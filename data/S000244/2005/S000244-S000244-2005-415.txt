Chairman, I submit the following jurisdictional letters of exchange for inclusion in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 4128, the ``Private Property Rights Protection Act.''                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2005.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: I understand that you will      shortly bring H.R. 4128, as amended, the Private Property      Rights Protection Act of 2005, to the House floor. This      legislation contains provisions that fall within the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.       I recognize your desire to bring this legislation before      the House in an expeditious manner. Accordingly, I will not      exercise my Committee's right to a referral. By agreeing to      waive its consideration of the bill, however, the Energy and      Commerce Committee does not waive its jurisdiction over H.R.      4128. In addition, the Energy and Commerce Committee reserves      its right to seek conferees on any provisions of the bill      that are within its jurisdiction during any House-Senate      conference that may be convened on this or similar      legislation. I ask for your commitment to support any request      by the Energy and Commerce Committee for conferees on H.R.      4128 or similar legislation.       I request that you include this letter in the Congressional      Record during consideration of H.R. 4128. Thank you for your      attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2005.     Hon. Joe Barton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Barton: Thank you for your recent letter      concerning the Committee on Energy and Commerce's      jurisdictional interest in H.R. 4128, the ``Private Property      Rights Protection Act.'' This legislation was introduced on      October 25, 2005, and referred solely to the Committee on the      Judiciary. The Committee on the Judiciary conducted a mark up      and ordered the bill reported on October 27, 2005. I      appreciate your willingness to waive further consideration of      H.R. 4128 to expedite consideration of the legislation, and      acknowledge the Committee on Energy and Commerce's      jurisdictional interest in the legislation.       I agree that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 4128, the      Committee on Energy and Commerce does not waive any      jurisdiction it may have had over subject matter contained in      this legislation. In addition, I agree to support      representation from the Committee on Energy and Commerce for      provisions of H.R. 4128 determined to be within its      jurisdiction in the event of a House-Senate conference on the      legislation.       Finally, as requested, I will include a copy of your letter      and this response in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration of this legislation.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 2005.     Hon. James Sensenbrenner,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Congratulations on your successful      markup of H.R. 4128, the Private Property Rights Protection      Act of 2005. As you are aware, I have been a vocal advocate      for the protection of private property since coming to      Congress 13 years ago. You should be commended for your      leadership in marshaling this important private property      rights legislation through your committee.       I have reviewed the legislation and discovered provisions      that are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on      Resources. Because of the importance of moving this      legislation to the floor quickly, I will not seek a      sequential referral of H.R. 4128 based on their inclusion in      the bill. Of course, this waiver does not prejudice any      future jurisdictional claims over these provisions or similar      language. I also reserve the right to seek to have conferees      named from the Committee on Resources on these provisions,      should a conference on H.R. 4128 or a similar measure become      necessary.       Once again, it has been a pleasure to work with you and      your staff. I look forward to seeing H.R. 4128 enacted soon.           Sincerely,                                                 Richard W. Pombo,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2005.     Hon. Richard W. Pombo,     Chairman, Committee on Resources, Longworth House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Pombo: Thank you for your recent letter      concerning the Committee on Resource's jurisdictional      interest in H.R. 4128, the ``Private Property Rights      Protection Act.'' This legislation was introduced on October      25, 2005, and referred solely to the Committee on the      Judiciary. The Committee on the Judiciary conducted a mark up      and ordered the bill reported on October 27, 2005. I      appreciate your willingness to waive further consideration of      H.R. 4128 to expedite consideration of the legislation, and      acknowledge the Committee on Resources' jurisdictional      interest in the legislation.       I agree that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 4128, the      Committee on Resources does not waive any jurisdiction it may      have had over subject matter contained in this or similar      legislation. In addition, I agree to support representation      from the Committee on Resources for provisions of H.R. 4128      determined to be within its jurisdiction in the event of a      House-Senate conference on the legislation.       Finally, as requested, I will include a copy of your letter      and this response in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration of this legislation.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                  ____         U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on            Transportation and Infrastructure,                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2005.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the      jurisdictional interest of the Transportation and      Infrastructure Committee in matters being considered in H.R.      4128, the Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2005.       Our Committee recognizes the importance of H.R. 4128 and      the need for the legislation to move expeditiously.      Therefore, while we have a valid claim to jurisdiction over      certain provisions of the bill, I will agree not to request a      sequential referral. This, of course, is conditional on our      mutual understanding that nothing in this legislation or my      decision to forego a sequential referral waives, reduces or      otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the Transportation and      Infrastructure Committee, and that a copy of this letter and      of your response acknowledging our valid jurisdictional      interest will be included in the Congressional Record when      the bill is considered on the House Floor.       The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure also      asks that you support our request to be conferees on the      provisions over which we have jurisdiction during any House      Senate conference.       Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.                                       ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2005.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: Thank you for your recent letter      concerning the Committee on Transportation's jurisdictional      interest in H.R. 4128, the ``Private Property Rights      Protection Act.'' This legislation was introduced on October      25, 2005, and referred solely to the Committee on the      Judiciary. The Committee on the Judiciary conducted a mark up      and ordered the bill reported on October 27, 2005. I      appreciate your willingness to waive further consideration of      H.R. 4128 to expedite consideration of the legislation, and      acknowledge the Committee on Transportation's jurisdictional      interest in the legislation.       I agree that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 4128, the      Committee on Transportation does not waive any jurisdiction      it may have had over subject matter contained in this      legislation. In addition, I agree to support representation      from the Committee on Transportation for provisions of H.R.      4128 determined to be within its jurisdiction in the event of      a House-Senate conference on the legislation.       Finally, as requested, I will include a copy of your letter      and this response in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration of this legislation.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                              Committee on Financial Services,                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 2005.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: On October 27, 2005, the      Committee on the Judiciary ordered reported H.R. 4128, the      Private Property Rights Protection Act. This bill protects      private property rights by prohibiting eminent domain abuse      by States or the Federal Government through limiting the use      of ``Federal economic development funds.'' This term is      broadly defined in the bill to mean any Federal funds      designed ``to improve or increase the size of the economies      of States or political subdivisions of States.'' This bill      will be considered by the House shortly, and I want to      confirm our mutual understanding with respect to      consideration of this bill.       Under rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives,      the Committee on Financial Services has jurisdiction over      legislation involving financial aid to commerce and industry      as well as urban development. This jurisdiction has been      exercised in a number of ways. The term Federal economic      development funds as defined in this bill would apply to a      number of programs developed by this Committee. For example,      these programs would include Community Development Block      Grants, Brownfields Economic Development Initiative, Economic      Development Initiative, Renewal Communities, Empowerment      Zones and Enterprise' Communities and the Section 3 Program      of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. The term      would also apply to the Economic Development Administration,      Delta Regional Authority and the Appalachian Regional      Commission. Had time permitted, this Committee would have      asked for, and likely would have received, a sequential      referral of the bill. However, given the desire to expedite      consideration of the bill, I will forego making that request.      I do so with the understanding that this will not prejudice      the Committee on Financial Services with respect to its      prerogatives on this or similar legislation. I further      request that you support appropriate representation from this      Committee in the event of a House-Senate conference.       I will conclude by requesting that you place a copy of this      letter and your response in the Congressional Record during      consideration of the bill. Thank you for your assistance.           Yours truly,                                                 Michael G. Oxley,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2005.     Hon. Michael G. Oxley,     Chairman, Committee on Financial Resources, Rayburn House          Office Building, Washington, DC.
