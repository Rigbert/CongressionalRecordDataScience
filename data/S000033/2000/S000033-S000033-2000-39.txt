 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would just put this on the scorecard of two wrongs do not make a right. EU absolutely does subsidize its wool and mohair producers. But when we look at New Zealand and Australia, we do not see that being the case. I think we should look more at the New Zealand and the Australian model than the EU example.  Secondly, we are talking about a small industry here, but nobody goes out to help and subsidize the local pizzeria when they go out of business, the local video store, or the local hardware store. And I think we should be moving toward free markets. Because if we really want to reinvigorate this society of ours, I think it rests on free markets and the competitive forces that should take place.
