I have 20 kids and grandkids. My daughter Molly and her husband have four children. One of those is adopted from Africa, a little girl. She was brought over here when she was a little baby. She is now 12 years old, reading at a college level. She is an outstanding little girl. I sponsor the African dinner every February, and she, for the last 3 years, has been kind of a keynote speaker, and everybody loves her.  They were up here 2 years ago, and they couldn't leave because all the airports were closed because of the ice storm. What do you do with a family of six when they are stuck someplace? They built an igloo. That was fun--a real igloo that will sleep four people. This became quite an issue, and we had articles from France and Great Britain and all criticizing my family. In fact, my cute little family was declared by Keith Olbermann of MSNBC to be the worst family in America because of this.  The point they were trying to make is, no one ever asserted that because it was the coldest winter in several decades up here that somehow that refuted global warming. I said: No, that isn't true. Now those same people are saying that it is.  So you can fool the American people part of the time and you can talk about all the hysteria and all the things that are taking place, but the people of America have caught on.  In March 2010, in a Gallup poll, Americans ranked global warming dead last, No. 8 out of eight environmental issues. They had a vote, and this was dead last.  A March Rasmussen poll: 72 percent of American voters don't believe global warming is a serious problem.  An alarmist, Robert Socolow, laments:       We are losing the argument with the general public big time      . . . I think the climate change activists--myself included--     have lost the American middle.  So as much money as they have spent and the efforts they have made, and moveon.org and George Soros and Michael Moore and the United Nations and the Gore people and the elitists out in California in Hollywood, they have lost this battle. Now they are trying to resurrect it. They would love nothing more than to pass this $300 billion tax increase. It is not going to happen.  But I am glad that we are talking about it again, and I applaud my friend. Senator Sanders from Vermont is a real sincere activist on the other side. We agree on hardly anything--except infrastructure, I would have tosay--and yet we respect each other. That is what this body is all about. We should have people who are on both sides of all these controversial issues talking about it. There has been a silence for 3 years. Now we are talking about it again.  So welcome back to the discussion of global warming. I look forward to future discussions about this.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                  Unanimous Consent Agreement S. 3326
