Mr. Speaker, due to a family emergency, I am forced to return home to Alaska. During my absence the House will again take up the important issue of term limits. On two occasions, Alaskan voters voiced and voted their support for term limits. In the November 1996 election, a majority of Alaskan voters passed a ballot initiative requiring Congress and the State legislature to support a very specific term limit measure.  In response to previous calls for term limits by Alaskans, I supported a term limits amendment to the Constitution when it came to the House floor in the 104th Congress. House Joint Resolution 73, offered by Congressman McCollum would have limited congressional term limits. I followed the wishes of my fellow Alaskans by supporting House Joint Resolution 73. I had planned to again follow the wishes of my constituents by supporting a term limits proposal this week. However, due to this family emergency, I will be at home in Alaska when this vote takes place.
