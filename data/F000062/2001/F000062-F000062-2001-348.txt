 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to reform the longstanding inequity in the Medicare Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) formula that has unfairly compensated many teaching hospitals across the country in the past 15 years.  The Medicare DGME payment compensates teaching hospitals for many of the costs related to the graduate training of physicians.  This legislation is timely as many of our nation's 400 teaching hospitals are in the midst of a serious financial crisis.  Over 72 percent of all teaching hospitals are currently operating with negative margins, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Approximately 42 percent of the 100 major teaching hospitals could be operating at a loss by 2002.  Teaching hospitals are losing millions of dollars annually.  The University of Pennsylvania reported a $200 million deficit in 1999.  In Massachusetts, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the New England Medical Center posted operating losses for the six month period of October 1998 to March 1999 totaling more than $63 million.  The University of Minnesota sold its hospital to a private company in 1997 because ``it was bleeding red ink,'' according to the university's senior Vice-President for health sciences.  Wayne State University in Michigan lost nearly $200 million in 1998 and 1999.  Georgetown University lost $83 million in 1999, $62 million in 1998, and $57 million in 1997.  In my State, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) has seen its net income plunge $50 million and bottom out close to zero.  The University of California San Francisco faces a $25 million loss over the next year.  Excluding the University of California San Francisco, all University of California teaching hospitals collectively lost $90 million in net income since 1997.  Many factors are to blame for the financial crisis of our nation's teaching hospitals.  Balanced Budget Act of 1997:  The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 took a major blow at teaching hospitals, significantly cutting federal Medicare payments.  The cuts included in BBA 1997, for example, has meant a loss of $25 million over three years to UCLA.  Penetration of Managed Care:  Managed care payments to many teaching hospitals barely cover costs. Twenty-eight percent of all privately insured Americans are enrolled in an HMO. In California, this number is 88 percent.  For example, California's capitation rate is one of the lowest in the nation. The average capitation rate in the State reached its peak in 1993 at $45 per month. Last year, the rate sunk to $29, while the cost of living jumped 25.2 percent.  Increasing Number of Uninsured:  The number of uninsured has exploded. Today, 44 million Americans are without health insurance, California alone has 7 million uninsured residents.  The high rate of uninsured impacts teaching hospitals because they are a major safety net provider--teaching hospitals provide approximately 44 percent of all care to the indigent. This means that when our nation's uninsured require medical care for complicated and complex pathologies, they find their way to teaching hospitals.  Academic medical centers affiliated with the University of California, for example, are the second largest safety net for a State that has the fourth highest uninsured rate in the country.  These are three examples of the forces behind the financial crisis of our nation's teaching hospitals. Low DGME payments further erode and destabilize the health care system.  Academic medical centers have three major responsibilities and missions--teaching, research, and patient care--which cause them to incur costs unique to such facilities. ``If just one leg of that three-legged stool is weak, it [academic medical centers] becomes destabilized,'' said Dr. Gerald Levey, UCLA's provost for health sciences. Low DGME payments are weakening teaching hospitals' ability to train future physicians.  Teaching hospitals account for only 6 percent of the nation's 5,000 hospitals. Despite the small number of teaching hospitals, they are a major provider of care. Teaching hospitals house: Forty percent of all neonatal intensive care units; fifty-three percent of pediatric intensive care units; and seventy percent of all burn units.  Teaching hospitals also handle: Twenty percent of all inpatient admissions; twenty-two percent of outpatient visits; nineteen percent of surgical operations, including 82 percent of all open heart surgeries; sixteen percent of emergency visits; and nineteen percent of all births.  The bottom line is that the financial crisis faced by teaching hospitals is impacting patient access to and quality of care.  California has been particularly impacted by this financial crisis.  Let me tell you how an outpatient eye clinic at the University of California, San Francisco has been impacted by the financial crisis facing teaching hospitals.  The clinic has a patient mix that is approximately 70 percent Medicare and 30 percent Medi-Cal. Due in part to historically low DGME payments, the clinic has had to decrease the number of staff, increase patient load, and cut faculty salaries by 15 percent. The number of patients seen on an average day, for example, has increased from 12 per half day to 18. Less time with each patient compromises quality of care.  According to a 1965 Medicare rule, Medicare paid for its share of DGME costs based on each hospital's ``Medicare allowable costs.'' This allowed for open-ended reimbursement.  Congress changed the methodology used to determine payments in 1986, and retroactively established Fiscal Year 1985 as the base year for all future calculations for DGME payments. The problem, which created this disparity in payments, is that some teaching hospitals narrowly interpreted the law and did not claim such expenses as faculty costs and benefits in 1985.  Submitted claims for 1985 were then used to determine a ``base formula'' for each teaching hospital. The base formula determined for each teaching hospital in 1985 has been used to determine all DGME payments since 1985 and disadvantages many teaching hospitals.  To give you an idea of the large variation in payments, 10 percent of teaching hospitals had per-resident payments of more than $98,800 in 1995, whereas the average payment for another 10 percent was below $37,400. The national mean in 1995 was $62,700.  A study conducted last year based on data from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) further highlights the variations among teaching hospitals. The study shows that: Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan received an average Medicare payment of $57,010 a year for each resident it trains. In comparison, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan received an average of $24,444 per resident.  Even when cost-of-living and training expenses are presumably similar (both hospitals are in Manhattan), there is great variation in the payment received by hospitals for training residents.  Additional examples of variations in payments include: Montefiore MedicareCenter in the Bronx received an average of $55,073 per resident; Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston received an average of $29,843 per resident; Cleveland Clinic Hospital received an average of $16,118 per resident, and the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center received an average of $11,908 per resident.  In an attempt to level the playing field, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BRA) contained provision that created a 70 percent floor and a 140 percentage ceiling for Medicare DGME payments. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Improvement Act of 2000 also contained provision to increase the floor to 85 percent in 2002.  While Congress has begun to address the tissue of variations in DGME payments by implementing a floor and a ceiling for payments in 1999 and 2000, more must be done.  I believe all teaching hospitals should receive reimbursement from Medicare that equal the national average. Bringing all teaching hospitals up to the national average, without undermining the financial stability of those teaching hospitals currently receiving payments above the national average, could help stabilize our nation's health care system.  The legislation that I am introducing today takes good steps to reduce variations in DGME and restore stability to the system.  As established in current law, the floor for Medicare reimbursements for teaching hospitals would equal 85 percent by Fiscal Year 2002. Over a period of four years (from FY 2003-2006), this legislation would bring teaching hospitals that are currently reimbursed by Medicare below the national average up to the national average.  The phase in is as follows:  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2003 and 2004, the floor would be increased to 90 percent.  In Fiscal Year 2005 the floor would be increased to 95 percent.  By Fiscal Year 2006, all teaching hospitals would be receiving per resident payments that equal at least 100 percent of the national average. Those teaching hospitals receiving payments above the national average would be held harmless.  Approximately thirty-eight States benefit under the proposed legislation. Teaching hospitals in several states will benefit over the next several years due in combination to the proposed legislation and the changes made in both 1999 and 2000 to increase the floor for DGME payments.  California to Benefit:  California will gain approximately $61.5 million over the next 6 years as a result of this legislation and the changes made to the DGME floor in 1999 and 2000.  For example, the University of California Medical Centers will gain $16.3 million over six years. The medical center at the University of Davis will gain $3.2 million; the medical center at the University of Irvine will gain $1.6 million; UCLA's medical center will gain $5.8 million; the medical center at the University of San Diego will gain $1.8 million; and the medical center at the University of San Francisco will gain approximately $3.9 million.  This is merely an example of State impact under the proposed legislation. These numbers are significant. Many of our nation's teaching hospitals would greatly benefit under the proposed legislation.  The proposed legislation would use new money to move teaching hospitals below the national average up to the average. Less than $500 million over 4 years would be borrowed from the Medicare Part A Trust fund to pay for the increase in Medicare payments to direct graduate medical education. So as to keep the Medicare Part A Trust Fund solvent beyond 2025, this legislation authorizes the Senate to appropriate to the Trust Fund annually an amount equal to what is taken out to reimburse teaching hospitals at this higher rate.  Teaching hospitals rely heavily on DGME payments to train and support their medical students and faculty.  For example, medical education funding in California helps support 108 hospitals that train more than 6,700 residents over three-to-five year periods. California received $75.1 million in DGME payments in 1997.  Many of the nation's teaching hospitals will be forced to close down beds and lower the quality of care they provide. UCLA has had to lay off 300 employees in the past few years due to budget constraints.  In a statement issued April 2000 by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AMC), the association said that:       To enhance the credibility of the payment system and to      eliminate inequities in payment levels, the AMC believes that      payments to any hospital whose per resident DGME amount is      below the national average per resident DGME payment levels      (adjusted for local variability in cost of living wages)      should be raised closer to the national average; additional      funding resources should be used to accomplish this      adjustment.  This legislation does just that--over a period of four years, teaching hospitals receiving payments below the national average will be brought up to the national average using new money. It is that simple.  ``Teaching hospitals are a national resource,'' says Albert Carnesale, Chancellor of UCLA. I agree with Chancellor Carnesale. I believe that the vitality of our nation's teaching hospitals should be of highest concern to Congress.  As our nation's uninsured rate continues to grow and the population continues to explode, we must work to ensure that we have an adequate supply of physicians to provide medical care. Training physicians and providing teaching hospitals with the funds necessary to offer this training should be of highest priority.  I believe that a teaching hospital's ability to serve their communities and train physicians will be further compromised if we do not enact this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 135       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
