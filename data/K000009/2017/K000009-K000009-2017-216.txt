 Mr. Mnuchin was the chief executive officer of OneWest Bank, which engaged in so-called robo-signing of mortgage documents. That means you really don't--you treat people like objects; you really don't go into the details of every case.  The Columbus Dispatch said its analysis of dozens of foreclosure cases in Ohio, and subsequent action, prove otherwise.  The dastardly practice of robo-signing, prevalent throughout the mortgage industry in the aftermath of that terrible financial crisis, had certain leaders, of which Mr. Mnuchin was at the top of the heap; and their employees signed foreclosure documents en masse without properly reviewing them and forcing unjust foreclosures.  The Columbus Dispatch found more than 1,900 such cases in Ohio alone. Individual cases revealed OneWest Bank declared properties vacant, even though someone was living in them. OneWest Bank, time and again, refused to abide by agreed-upon loan modifications.  Is that the kind of person that we really want in charge of the U.S. Treasury Department?  Nominee Mnuchin comes with a Goldman Sachs pedigree. Well, wouldn't we know that? He was nicknamed the ``foreclosure king'' after buying up IndyMac, a subprime lender that evicted about 36,000 people during the financial crisis.  Sadly, Mr. Speaker, while President-elect Trump promised to drain the swamp, his nominee for Treasury Secretary proves he is not doing that at all. He is enlarging the swamp.  The Columbus Dispatch found more than 1,900, I repeat, OneWest Bank foreclosures in our State's six largest counties from 2009 to 2015.  In addition, Mr. Mnuchin profited personally off of kicking people out of their homes. Does such a person actually deserve confirmation as Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America?  Wake up, America. Wake up. Pay attention to what is happening here in Washington, D.C. This city belongs to you. This Capitol belongs to you.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to place in the Record a release I sent out over the weekend relating to President Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees. Kaptur Statement on President Trump's Executive Order on Immigration                               and Refugees  Condemns misguided mandate, invites Trump to meet with refugees who                              call Ohio home       Washington, DC.--Today Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09)      released the following statement in light of confusion and      hurt emanating from President Donald Trump's Executive Order      on immigration and refugees.       ``In New York harbor, not far from President Donald Trump's      office tower stands the awesome Statue of Liberty with Emma      Lazarus' immortal words, `Give me your tired, your poor, your      huddled masses yearning to breathe free.' Surely, President      Trump has read these words.       ``Ancesters of the Trump and Kaptur families both passed      through that unforgettable portal as they made their way to      America as immigrants. How can we deny to others the gift of      freedom bequeathed to us?       ``I support robust efforts to make America safe and secure.      But a workable solution should ensure America's safety      without destroying our heritage as an immigrant nation,      dedicated to liberty and justice for all.       ``President Trump's mandate will make America less safe. It      penalizes worthy individuals and actually gives terrorist      cells ammunition to use against America. This mandate puts      people at risk who have helped America in our battle against      terrorism, at home and abroad. It punishes innocent      individuals caught in the crossfire fleeing terror and tribal      conflict.       ``Dangerously this misconceived Executive Order will spur      anti-American sentiment globally and on the Internet,      spurring more terrorism, including against our troops, and it      potentially aggravating religious conflict half way around      the world. Reckless rhetoric puts our nation at greater risk      at home and puts Americans traveling abroad in danger.       ``I cordially invite the President to northern Ohio to meet      personally with some of the crossfire fleeing the terror of      war and tribal conflict. A well-crafted policy should      enshrine liberty for all law-abiding persons while avoiding      unintended consequences that can be used by our enemies to      enflame terrorism.''
