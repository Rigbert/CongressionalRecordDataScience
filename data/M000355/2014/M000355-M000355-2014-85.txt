 Mortimer hails from Magoffin County, KY, and served his country honorably over the course of his career with the Kentucky National Guard.  After graduating from Castle Heights Military Academy in Tennessee, Mortimer enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves. Only 22 at the time, it would be 30 years before he retired from the military.  In 1960, 2 years after enlisting, he was transferred to the Kentucky National Guard. His experiences in the Guard ran the gamut from clearing out swamps in southern Georgia to riot control on the University of Kentucky campus during the Vietnam war to responding to natural disasters. It is this diverse range of service to our country that epitomizes the National Guard motto--``Always Ready, Always There.''  Mortimer retired from the Guard in 1988 with the rank of command sergeant major. In addition to his military service, he also took the time to substitute teach in Lexington high schools and obtain his masters from Georgetown College.  His service to this country is worthy of our praise here in the Senate--so, I ask that my colleagues join me in paying tribute to Mr. Jim Mortimer.  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing Mortimer's military career. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]                    Mortimer Retires From the Guard                           (By Heather Oney)       Geared up early for a career in the military, Magoffin      native Jim Mortimer left Magoffin when he was 14 years old      and attended Castle Heights Military Academy, in Lebanon,      Tennessee. When he was 22 years old and with the draft      imminent, Mortimer joined the U.S. Army Reserves in      Sistersville, West Virginia, in 1958.       In 1960 he was transferred to the Kentucky National Guard      and was called to active duty during the Berlin Crisis in      1962.       Mortimer's unit replaced another unit that had been      deployed to Germany, taking their place at Fort Stewart,      Georgia, in charge of repairing vehicles and armament, as      well as various National Guard functions, he said, such as      riots and natural disasters.       While he was never sent overseas, he said the year he spent      in southern Georgia preparing to be deployed was his      strongest memory of his service.       For a year Mortimer said they lived in Quonset huts and      were tasked with clearing out swamps with saws and rakes,      cutting trees and brush along the way.       Also while he was at Fort Stewart, Mortimer said they had a      tornado and all the men got in their vehicles armored much      like tanks, while he and two other sergeants laid in the      ditch.       ``It was maybe a mile away,'' Mortimer laughed. ``Just lots      of wind.''       With an extremely flat terrain, he said lightning was a      problem there, with two of their soldiers hit. He remembers      one was near a radio and the lightning hit the antenna,      knocking him out of his boots.       During Desert Storm, Mortimer was sent to Frankfort,      working as a liaison aiding the dependents of the men at war.       During his 30 years of service, he worked at Fort Knox,      Kentucky; Fort Campbell, Kentucky-Tennessee border; Fort      Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Hood, Texas; and Fort Sill,      Oklahoma. Mortimer was involved in rifle marksmanship on the      Kentucky State Rifle Team, winning several awards. He had a      scout troop sponsored by the National Guard, as well.       In North Little Rock, Arkansas, he attended National Guard      matches, where Guards from all over sent teams to compete.       During active duty, Mortimer taught second lieutenants in      Officer Candidate School (OCS), as well as many other      courses, such as marksmanship and all weapons.       In 1965 he was called to deal with Vietnam War riots on the      University of Kentucky's campus, where students had burned      down the ROTC building.       Mortimer obtained the rank of command sergeant major in      1980, retiring from his employment with the Kentucky National      Guard and as a part-time soldier in 1988.       While in the Guard, Mortimer went to school, receiving a      degree in 1980. He began substitute teaching in Lexington      high schools while still in the service.       In 1973 he returned to Magoffin and started substitute      teaching in 1977 at the middle school and high school, where      he eventually retired from in 2000. In the meantime, he      received his masters from Georgetown College in 1982.       Mortimer is presently a member of the Salyersville Kiwanis      and works part-time with the Magoffin County Sheriff's      Office. He has a daughter and two sons, as well as six      grandchildren. His wife of 53 years, June, passed away in      2011. In 2013, he married Gail King Mortimer and the two sons      still live in Magoffin.                          ____________________
