Certainly I understand the desire of the distinguished Senator from Nevada to move expeditiously. I think both of us will try to do that.  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I say to Senator Reid we are going to have to, because of a previous unanimous consent agreement, get unanimous consent to allow a second-degree amendment to be considered. That would have to be the first order for us, to be able to get that.
