Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2372, the Private Property Rights Implementation Act. I must say I just listened to the previous speaker and I have read this bill and I cannot find where it says what he says it does in that bill. It is the most amazing thing I have ever heard.                              {time}  1430  Mr. Chairman, I am not a lawyer, thank God for that, but I do not read it that way. What I am hearing, as a Committee on Resources chairman, frankly, is to help protect the fifthamendment of the United States Constitution.  The taking of private property, unfortunately, all too often the various governmental bureaucrats involved in land use decisions use their regulatory authority to take private property, and then blame other levels of government for their actions. I think maybe this is what the gentleman was speaking about. The Federal bureaucrats, through their efforts, will take private property and then blame someone else.  As a result, I support H.R. 2372, because it will ensure that landowners, landowners, little landowners, yes, big landowners, but mostly little landowners, the largest percentage of takings by this government is from little landowners, will get a fair chance to have their cases heard in Federal court, no matter which government bureaucracy is involved.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2372 will also ensure that land dispute cases are heard expeditiously in order to resolve these disputes very promptly. As a result of the expeditious court proceedings, taxpayers', as well as the private property owners', legal costs will be reduced. These prompt court proceedings will give even the poorest of our citizens the ability to defend their land.  Finally, H.R. 2372 will level the playing field between private property owners and the government. Landowners who wish to protect their legal and civil rights will now be able to afford court proceedings, and the government will no longer be able to pressure landholders into taking their land.  I want to stress this, that right now the bureaucrats take their time, slow it down, use undue pressure, and finally get the land away from the private property owners. Let us ensure that the smallest and the poorest landowners can have the same rights as the biggest corporations and the environmental groups.  I urge support of H.R. 2372 and oppose any amendments to this legislation, because this is the Constitution. The basis of our society is private land, not government land. When we have private land, we have something to do with our government. When it is owned by the government, we have nothing to do with the government.  I urge Members to pass this legislation.
