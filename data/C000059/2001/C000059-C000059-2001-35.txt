Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a couple whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of California's Inland Empire is unparalleled. On December 11, 2001, Francis and Jean Domenigoni will be honored as Distinguished Citizens for the Good Scout of the Year Award.  The Domenigoni family is one of the oldest pioneering families in the region. They share a history that is as rich as the soil in which they have farmed for over five generations. Angelo Domenigoni, along with his brother Peter and a friend named Gaudenzio Garbani, immigrated to this great nation in 1874. The patriarch of the family, Angelo, arrived in ``Pleasant Valley'', now known as Winchester in 1879, and set the Domenigoni family on the road to achieving the American Dream. Through hard work and dedication he and his wife, Maria Antonia established a life that was blessed with seven children: Antonio, Natal, Peter, Jack, Rita, Serafina and Dominica. Antonio married Dominica Fiscalini and they had five beautiful children of their own; Angelo, Francis, Julia, Fred, and Elsa. All five children were born and raised on the ranch. Fred and Francis Domenigoni carried on the family farming operation all of their lives.  Francis Domenigoni married Jean Connell, a member of the Garbani Family. Continuing in the tradition of his parents, Francis and Jean raised five children; Richard, Larry, Donald, Andy, and Steve. Together with his son, Andy, Francis managed the family's farming and ranching business for twenty years. In 1997, Francis passed away, leaving his wife Jean, his sons, and grandchildren to carry on the family legacy.  For the past fifty years, the Domenigoni Family has been a major sponsor and contributor to the Junior Livestock Auction and Farmers Fair. Active members in the Riverside County Farm Bureau, they support the Winchester Harvesters and Pleasant Valley 4H Programs. The Domenigoni's have also opened their ranch for the past decade for a riding event to support the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and American Disabilities Association. The family also recently dedicated a building shell for the Winchester Community Center and Recreation Facility.  The Domenigonis continue to endorse higher education by sponsoring the UC Riverside Foundation, the Mt. San Jacinto College Foundation, and providing annual scholarships to agricultural students at Hemet and West Valley High Schools. They are also active participants in the Winchester Homeowner's Association; the Chambers of Commerce in Winchester, Murrieta, and Temecula; the Riverside County Property Owners' Association; the Murrieta Temecula Group, and the Hemet-San Jacinto Action Group.  It is a well deserved honor and I am proud to pay homage today to a family who has done much for the people in my district.                          ____________________
