President, I first want to commend the Senator for his eloquent statement. I think it is always important to remind Americans, no matter where they live, of the productivity of American agriculture and the importance, particularly, of our family farmers. There is no one who is a greater advocate for America's farmers than the Senator from Iowa. So I am very pleased to have had the privilege of hearing his comments today.  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of the legislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')                          ____________________
