 President, I don't know whose budget Senator Cornyn is presenting, but it is certainly not the President's budget. The President's budget recommends raising the minimum wage, and that is not in Senator Cornyn's proposal.  The President's budget includes 2 years of free community college. That is what the American people want, and it is not in Senator Cornyn's proposal.  The President's budget talks about a fair tax proposal, not more tax breaks for billionaires, and that is not in Senator Cornyn's proposal.  I will vote no because I am not quite sure what is in Senator Cornyn's proposal, but it is certainly not what President Obama presented to the American people.
