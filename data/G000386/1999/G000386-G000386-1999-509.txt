 President, on behalf of Senator Breaux and myself, I am introducing legislation today to require the use of universal product numbers (UPNs) for all durable medical equipment (DME) Medicare purchases. A similar bipartisan bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Amo Houghton and Louise Slaughter. The purpose of this legislation is to improve the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) ability to track and to appropriately assess the value of the durable medical equipment it pays for under the Medicare program. Very simply, our bill will ensure Medicare gets what it pays for.  According to a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Office of Inspector General's review of billing practices for specific medical supplies, the Medicare program is often paying greater than the market price for durable medical equipment and Medicare beneficiaries are not receiving the quality of care they should. HCFA currently does not require DME suppliers to identify specific products on their Medicare claims. Therefore it does not know for which products it is paying. HCFA's billing codes often cover a broad range of products of various types, qualities and market prices. For example, the GAO found that one Medicare billing code is used by the industry for more than 200 different urological catheters, with many of these products varying significantly in price, use, and quality.  Medicare's inability to accurately track and price medical equipment and supplies it purchases could be remedied with the use of product specific codes known as ``bar codes'' or ``universal product numbers'' (UPNs). These codes are similar to the codes you see on products you purchase at the grocery store. Use of such bar codes is already being required by the Department of Defense and several large private sector purchasing groups. The industry strongly supports such an initiative as well. I am submitting several letters of endorsement for the record on behalf of the National Association for Medical Equipment Services, the Health Industry Distributors Association, Premier Inc., and a joint letter from industry groups such as the Health Industry Business Communications Council, Healthcare EDI Coalition, Health Industry Purchasing Association, and Invacare Corporation.  This bill represents a common sense approach. It will improve the way Medicare monitors and reimburses suppliers for medical equipment and supplies. Patients will receive better care. And the Federal Government will save money. I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support this legislation which I am introducing today with my friend and colleague, Senator Breaux.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and the letters of endorsement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 256       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. John Breaux,     Ranking Minority Member, Special Committee on Aging, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley and Breaux: We applaud you for      introducing the Medicare Universal Product Number Act, which      will require the inclusion of universal product numbers      (UPNs) on Medicare Part B billings for medical equipment and      supplies that are not customized. UPNs are codes that      uniquely identify an individual medical product; they are      often associated with the bar codes that allow scanners to      process them. These codes are a major enabling factor in our      efforts to minimize fraudulent billings and to automate the      distribution process.       The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Veterans      Administration have already taken a leadership position in      promoting the implementation of the industry standard of      UPNs. As a part of the decision to use commercial medical      product distributors, the DoD has mandated the use of UPNs      for all medical/surgical products delivered to DoD      facilities. The VA is prepared to implement a similar      requirement this year. Most private sector group purchasing      organizations also require the use of UPNs.       We believe that the Medicare Program would also benefit      greatly from the use of UPNs. By cross-referencing each UPN      with the current HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)      and requiring the inclusion of the UPN on each Medicare Part      B claim for medical equipment and supplies, Medicare's      ability to track utilization and combat fraud and abuse would      be greatly enhanced. As UPNs provide a unique, unambiguous      means of identifying medical products, Medicare would have an      exact record of the specific product used by the beneficiary.      For the first time, the Medicare Program could identify      precisely what items are being billed. Unusual trends in      product utilization and claims for ``suspicious'' items would      be easily identifiable. HCPCS alone cannot provide this      information, as many products of varying quality and cost are      included in a single code.       In addition, problems with ``upcoding'' and miscoding could      be greatly reduced through the implementation of UPNs.      Upcoding occurs when Medicare is intentionally billed under a      code that provides a higher reimbursement than the code      corresponding to the item that was furnished to the      beneficiary. Currently, upcoding is difficult to detect      because HCPCS are so inexact. UPNs would correctly identify      the specific medical product, thereby making it harder to      misrepresent the cost and quality of the product. In      addition, by cross-referencing each UPN to the appropriate      HCPCS, legitimate confusion about HCFA's current coding      system would be alleviated. As the General Accounting Office      has reported (GAO/HEHS-98-102), the HCPCS system is      needlessly ambiguous.       We believe that the Medicare Program and medical products      industry would benefit greatly from the use of UPNs. This      standard would not only increase Medicare's understanding of      what it pays for, but also assist in the effective      administration of the Program.       Again, thank you for introducing the Medicare Universal      Product Number Act.           Sincerely,       Health Industry Business Communications Council.       Healthcare EDI Coalition.       Health Industry Distributors Association.       Health Industry Group Purchasing Association.       National Association for Medical Equipment Services.       Invacare Corp.       Premier Inc.                                  ____                                          National Association for                                   Medical Equipment Services,                                 Alexandria, VA, January 12, 1999.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Hon. John Breaux,     U.S. Senate,     Special Committee on Aging.       Dear Senators Grassley and Breaux: As you know, the      National Association for Medical Equipment Services (NAMES)      was pleased to endorse your bill, The Medicare Universal      Product Number Act of 1997, S. 1362 in the 105th Congress. We      understand you will re-introduce this bill in substantially      the same form in the 106th Congress, and so, in concept,      support that legislation.       Requiring universal product numbers on home medical      equipment for product labeling and billing purposes would      accomplish two key objectives. First, it would improve home      medical equipment inventory control by creating a unique      numbering system that easily permits computerized optical      scanning of product information. Second, it would provide      third-party payers with more information on equipment      characteristics than does the current HCPCS coding system,      thus allowing reimbursement rates to be set more      appropriately.       While equipment manufacturers and retailers would need time      to comply with the bill, we note that S. 1362 provided more      than two years for compliance to be attained. We look forward      to working with you as this bill proceeds through the      legislative process.           Sincerely,                                     William D. Coughlan, CAE,                                                     President and     Chief Executive Officer.                                  ____                                                   Health Industry                                     Distributors Association,                                 Alexandria, VA, January 11, 1999.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. John Breaux,     Ranking Minority Member, Special Committee on Aging, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley and Breaux: On behalf of the Health      Industry Distributors Association (HIDA), I applaud you for      introducing the Medicare Universal Product Number Act. HIDA      is the national trade association of home care companies and      medical products distribution firms. Created in 1902, HIDA      represents over 700 companies with approximately 2500      locations nationwide. HIDA Members provide value-added      distribution services to virtually every hospital,      physician's office, nursing facility, clinic, and other      health care sites across the country, as well as to a growing      number of home care patients.       HIDA has long supported the use of UPNs for medical      equipment and supplies. By providing a standard, unique      identifier for each product, UPNs supply the information      needed to minimize fraudulent billings and streamline the      health care product distribution process. The Department of      Defense (DoD) has already recognized the many benefits      resulting from the implementation of the industry standard of      UPNs. As a part of their decisions to use commercial medical      product distributors, DoD has mandated the use of UPNs for      all medical/surgical products delivered to DoD facilities.       The Medicare Program could also benefit greatly from the      use of UPNs. By using UPNs, the Medicare system would be able      to correctly identify the specific items they are paying for,      a crucial piece of information that the agency is now      missing. As UPNs provide a unique, unambiguous means of      identifying each product on the market, Medicare would have      an exact record of the specific product used by each      beneficiary. Unusual trends in product utilization and claims      for ``suspicious'' items would be easily identifiable. The      HCFA Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) can not provide      this information, because many products of varying quality      and cost are included in a single code.       In addition, problems with ``upcoding'' and miscoding could      be greatly reduced through the implementation of UPNs.      Upcoding occurs when Medicare is intentionally billed under a      code that provides a higher reimbursement than the code      corresponding to the item that was actually furnished to the      beneficiary. Currently, upcoding is difficult to detect      because HCPCS are so inexact. UPNs would correctly identify      the specific medical product, thereby making it harder to      misrepresent the cost and quality of the product. In      addition, by cross-referencing each UPN to the appropriate      HCPCS, legitimate confusion about HCFA's current coding      system would be alleviated. As the General Accounting Office      has reported (GAO/HEHS-98-102), the HCPCS system is      needlessly ambiguous.       HIDA firmly believes that the Medicare Program and the      medical equipment industry would benefit greatly from the use      of UPNs. This standard would not only increase Medicare's      understanding of what it pays for, but also assist in the      effective administration of the Program.       Again, thank you for introducing the Medical Universal      Product Number Act.           Sincerely,     S. Wayne Kay.                                  ____                                                      Premier,                                 Washington, DC, January 20, 1999.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Hon. John Breaux,     U.S. Senate, Special Committee on Aging,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley and Breaux: On behalf of Premier,      Inc., the nation's largest healthcare alliance, I am pleased      to support the ``Medicare Universal Product Number Act.'' The      bill requires the use of universal product numbers (UPNs) for      all durable medical equipment Medicare purchases by 2002.       Premier represents more than 200 owner hospitals and      hospital systems that own or operate 800 healthcare      institutions and have purchasing affiliations with another      1,100. Premier owners operate hospitals, HMOs and PPOs,      skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation facilities, home      health agencies, and physician practices. Through      participation in Premier, healthcare leaders can access cost      reduction avenues, delivery system development and      enhancement strategies, technology management, decision      support tools, and a variety of opportunities for networking      and knowledge transfer.       Premier welcomes federal government leadership in requiring      manufacturers to label their products at each unit of      inventory with a universal product number by the year 2002.      The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) recommended in a May      1998 report to Congress that HCFA require suppliers include      UPNs on their Medicare claims. This     requirement will not only aid the Medicare program, but also      will help the private sector reduce healthcare costs. A      recent study conducted by Efficient Healthcare Consumer      Response on improving the efficiency of the healthcare supply      chain concluded that $11.6 billion could be saved through      automation and integration of the product information stream      from point of manufacture to point of use across the      industry. UPN is a major component within that potential      remarkable savings stream. Therefore, we believe that UPN      will become as important to the medical industry as other bar      code standards have become to grocery and other retail      industries for many years.       This bill represents a common sense approach to reducing      healhcare costs in the United States. Thank you Senators      Grassley and Breaux for your leadership on this issue and we      look forward to assisting you with your efforts to enact this      legislation into law.           Sincerely,                                                   James L. Scott,     President.                                  ____
