Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and maketheir communities a better place to live and work. Bud Gordon is one of these individuals. On January 16, 2014, Bud will receive a prestigious honor when the Corona Chamber of Commerce gives him the Lifetime Achievement Award at the organization's annual awards and installation gala at the Eagle Glen Golf Club.  One of Bud's greatest achievements has been bringing immense growth in the region. He is the visionary behind the Gordon Automotive Group which includes several automotive dealerships throughout Riverside County and greater Southern California. Bud's commitment is seen especially at the Gordon Automotives Group's Headquarters, Quality Toyota of Corona, which carries the guiding principle of delivering service that is caring, defect-free, and timely. He has helped add numerous jobs in the area which has strengthened and bettered the economy in a profound way.  Bud is not only an innovative businessman, but also an active community member and has spent his life giving back in any way he can. Bud founded and formed the At Risk Children Angel Foundation in conjunction with members of the Corona Police Department to help supply local at risk children with sports equipment, registration fees, and even basic necessities. He has also been an active supporter of the Happy Hairston Youth Foundation, where he both raised and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to help disadvantaged youth achieve their goals and pursue their dreams.  Inspired by his daughter, Bud also created a variety of educational programs to motivate and inform students in the community. He recreated the Oval Office at his Corona headquarters, forming the Quality Toyota West Wing, which has served over 195,000 students who have participated in the 2\1/2\-hour educational learning experience offered there. Bud also recognized a need for a hands-on trade school training facility, and thus, Uncle Bud's Automotive Museum was born. The Museum offers ``A Journey Through Automotive History,'' where students can both see and feel the history of the automobile and hear from docents regarding the variety of careers offered in the automotive industry.  Bud's passion and leadership are contagious and when it comes to commitment, he makes sure to match his words with his actions. He is a tireless supporter of the Settlement House, which provides food to the needy, the Trauma Intervention Program, the Alternatives to Domestic Violence Program, and various organizations supporting local schools.  In light of all he has done for the community of Corona, the Corona Chamber of Commerce has given him their Lifetime Achievement Award. Bud's tireless passion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. He has been the heart and soul of many organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
