President, we were engaged in lengthy debate for months--maybe years--about health care in the United States, and I believe we passed a historic bill that addresses some of the most fundamental issues about health care: first, to address affordability because if you can't afford it, it doesn't matter how good medical care is; second, to make sure it was successful for people rich and poor alike; third, to make sure the basic health insurance policies being offered in America covered the most important things in a person's life. That was part of the debate, and an important part of it.  A fundamental principle of health care reform is to ensure Americans have access to a comprehensive package of health services--we call them essential benefits under the law--which includes maternity care, vaccinations, and preventive care.  Many years ago when I was a new lawyer working in the Illinois State Senate, someone approached me and said: Are you aware of the fact that you can buy a health insurance plan that covers a family and literally covers a newborn but exempts coverage for the first 30 days of their life in Illinois?  I said: No, that is impossible.  He said: No, that kind of health care is for sale, and it is a little cheaper because we all know that if a baby is born with a serious problem, the first 30 days can be extremely expensive.
