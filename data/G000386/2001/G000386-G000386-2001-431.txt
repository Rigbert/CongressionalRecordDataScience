 President, I rise today to commend Farmland Industries for their leadership in educating farmers on the importance of international trade, through the program ``Support Trade, for Farmers, For Farmland, For You.'' I also congratulate them for receiving the 2001 National Agri-Marketing Association's award for Best of Show.  I ask that the letter of congratulations I sent to Farmland Industries be printed in the Record.  The letter follows.                                             United States Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2001.     Mr. Robert Honse,     President & CEO, Farmland Industries, Inc., Kansas City, MO.       I recently read that Farmland's trade education program,      ``Support Trade, For Farmers, For Farmland, For You'' was      selected to receive the 2001 National Agri-Marketing      Association's award for Best of Show. Congratulations on this      impressive achievement!       Farmland Industries clearly understands the important role      of international trade to the agriculture industry. As the      only working family farmer in the United States Senate and      Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, I also      appreciate the importance of international trade to America's      farmers. International trade has a significant impact on my      home state of Iowa, with agriculture exports contributing      more than $5 billion a year to Iowa's economy. Nationwide,      approximately $6 million in agriculture products, such as      grains, oilseed, cotton, meats, and vegetables are processed      for export every day. These exports generate more than $100      billion in total business activity, and sustain nearly a      million American jobs.       Trade is vital to the United States economy generally, and      to our farmers in particular, as agriculture makes an      enormous and valuable contribution as our third largest      export. Increased market opportunities in agricultural trade      are of tremendous importance to American farmers and to our      economy. That is why I applaud your efforts to inform and      mobilize the farming community in support of open markets.       The ``Support Trade'' program sponsored by Farmland      Industries, and the communications team led by Sherlyn Manson      and David Eaheart, addressed a vitally important issue      through a program that has informed and enlightened farmers      at the grassroots level on the importance of international      trade.       You are to be highly commended for your leadership. Too few      companies appreciate the importance of trade education at the      grassroots level. Farmland Industries is truly a leader whose      example I hope others will emulate.       I look forward to working with you during this session of      Congress as we address such important international trade      issues as renewing Trade Promotion Authority for President      Bush, continuing normal trade relations for the People's      Republic of China, passing normal trade relations for      Vietnam, and preparing for the launch of a new round of World      Trade Organization negotiations this November.       Again, congratulations for your selection as the recipient      of the 2001 National Agri-Marketing Association's Best of      Show.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley.                          ____________________
