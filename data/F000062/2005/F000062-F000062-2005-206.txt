  Remember, last year, in this strong statement I have just told you about--in the deletion of funding of the $27.5 million for the earth penetrator and the $9 million for advanced concepts that at the time included a study for the development of the low-yield nuclear weapons--Republicans and Democrats, authorizers and appropriators alike, joined together to send a clear signal to the administration that the House and Senate would not support moving forward with the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons. If you consider this, along with the facts I have just revealed, based on a polling of the American people, you have to wonder why the administration comes back with a new request this year.  In April of this year, a group of experts of the National Academies of Sciences confirmed what we have long argued--that according to the laws of physics, it is simply not possible for a missile casing on a nuclear warhead to survive a thrust into the earth deep enough to take out a hard and deeply buried military target without spewing millions of tons of radiation into the atmosphere.  That is where we are--funding a study that the law of physics says will not work. It is folly to me. And the repercussions are enormous.
