President, I come to the floor this afternoon because I am troubled by what appears to be a request by the Bush administration in the Iraq supplemental that would have our citizens use their hard-earned tax dollars to subsidize the cost of gasoline in Iraq so Iraqi citizens would only have to pay 10 cents a gallon.  The questions I am going to raise this afternoon with respect to this proposal can all be found essentially on page 29 of the report with respect to the request for the supplemental funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq.  For those who are following this discussion, this is under the question of the purchase of oil products at page 29 of the request for the supplemental.  I want to begin asking some questions about the fairness of this Bush proposal and about how this subsidy program that is in this report would work if it was actually to be funded by the Senate.  Today I also intend to send a letter to the President trying to get answers to some of these questions. But I would tell the Senate that here is what we know at present.  The Bush administration has included in its Iraq supplemental funding request an estimated cost of $900 million to cover the difference between ``Iraqi demand and refinery production to establish and maintain a 30-day reserve in all major petroleum products to ensure no interruption in basic services due to terrorist activity.''  The administration's funding request specifies:       $600 million will be needed in the first quarter of 2004 to      compensate for the large difference between demand and      production and to build this 30-day reserve.  The first question is, How much is going to be spent on creating this reserve, and how much is going to be spent on purchasing gasoline for Iraqis? Using demand data from the Energy Information Agency's latest report on Iraq and current market conditions, it is estimated the establishment of a 30-day fuel product reserve would cost approximately $200 million. If that amount is correct, that would mean roughly $400 million would be spent to purchase gasoline and other petroleum products for Iraqis in the first 90 days of next year. Iraq is importing about 750,000 gallons of gasoline a day, according to recent statements by senior oil ministry officials.  Based on those statements, Iraq would need about 67.5 million gallons during the first quarter of 2004. If that estimate is correct, U.S. taxpayers would be paying almost $6 per gallon for the gasoline that is provided to Iraqis by the United States in the first quarter of 2004.  The question I ask today and in the days ahead will be: Why does it cost $6 per gallon to provide gasoline to Iraqis when the cost in neighboring countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait is less than $1 per gallon and below the $2 per gallon cost almost everywhere in our country?  According to an article in the Houston Chronicle on September 28, the United States has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars to provide gasoline to Iraq under the contract previously issued with Halliburton. My question here would be: What is the cost of gasoline that has been sent to Iraq by the United States? What was the wholesale price involved here that Halliburton paid for the gas sent to Iraq at taxpayer expense?  Of course, I think our citizens would want to know what profit was made on these deliveries.  The Houston Chronicle also reported that in Iraq the low-octane government-subsidized gasoline sells for less than a dime a gallon.  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Houston Chronicle entitled ``U.S. Taxpayer Footing Bill for Cheap Iraqi Gasoline'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       [From the Houston Chronicle; Sept. 28, 2003]          U.S. Taxpayers Footing Bill for Cheap Iraqi Gasoline                           By Michael Hedges       Baghdad, Iraq.--Mahmoud Ali, a gap-toothed 15-year-old,      worked steadily under a penetrating sun at his rather      monotonous job outside the large Mansur filling station here.       Taking turns with his two uncles, Ali waited in line in the      family's 1982 Chevrolet to get a tank of cheap gasoline,      which the locals call benzene, at the station subsidized by      the Iraqi Oil Ministry.       After filling up the faded white Chevy, the men pulled the      vehicle to a curb. There, they siphoned the fuel into 20-     liter plastic jugs to sell at triple the posted price to      other drivers too frustrated to wait in the lengthy lines.       Then, one of the men drove the Chevy back to the line to      sweat it out until another full tank of fuel could be      secured.       Selling fuel at three time its state-set price about 100      yards from a line of 14 working pumps would be a hard dollar      to earn in another economy.       But it works here in Iraq, because the low-octane,      government-subsidized fuel sells for less than a dime a      gallon. Even working-class Iraqis earning a few dollars a day      are willing to pay outrageous mark-ups to avoid the line.       ``Benzene is cheaper than water here,'' local journalist      Qais Al-Bashir said Friday.       What it is costing American taxpayers is another story.       Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime last April,      Iraq's resuscitated oil industry has been unable to produce      enough gasoline, cooking oil and other petroleum products to      meet the country's needs.       So far, U.S. taxpayers have spent some $562 million under      the Halliburton contract to bring in gasoline and other fuels      and make needed repairs to Iraq's gas distribution network,      according to the Army Corps of Engineers. In fact, that      effort has accounted for nearly half the $1.22 billion worth      of work that Halliburton has performed in Iraq since the war.       ``The benzene we sell here comes from Turkey, Kuwait and      Saudi Arabia,'' said Majed Mohammed, 44, who manages the      Mansur station for the Iraqi Oil Ministry.       ``Before the war,'' he said, `` it was 100 percent from      Iraq. But now we have problems with sabotage of the      pipelines. The refineries are working at far less than      capacity.''       Mohammed, who has worked for the Oil Ministry for 21 years,      said artificially low fuel prices are nothing new to his      country.       ``The cost is subsidized by the ministry,'' he said. ``It      was like that before the war when Saddam was here, and it is      the same now. We are obliged to do it because of the needs of      the people. If we didn't, there would be major problems and      even more anger at the Americans.''       Iraq is importing about 750,000 gallons of gasoline a day,      according to recent statements by senior Oil Ministry      officials. Expectations by the Bush administration that     oil could fund the massive rebuilding of the country--or at      least the needs of its people in the immediate future--have      not been met.       Iraq's oil output is less than half the pre-war level of      2.3 million barrels per day and only about one-third the 3.2      million barrels produced by the nation before the 1991      Persian Gulf War and the subsequent United Nations embargo.       Experts differ on when Iraq's fuel production capacity will      reach 1990 levels. The Coalition Provisional Authority, which      oversees the U.S.-led occupation, has said that production      could reach 3 million barrels per day by later summer of      2004. Private analysts have said it could take at least a      couple of years to reach that level.       For the foreseeable future, the occupation authority will      have to spend massive amounts to underwrite the fuel used by      Iraqis. And conservation seems unlikely in a country where      decades of cheap gasoline have created a culture in which      driving around in aging, fume-spewing cars is seen as a form      of recreation.       ``Iraqis always loved to drive, and there are more cars      than ever now--cars from Kuwait and Jordan that have come in      since the war,'' said Mohammed, the Mansur filling station      manager.       Even on Friday, the Muslim holy day, lines formed at the      city's fuel stations.       ``We used to be open 24 hours a day before the war, so      there were no lines,'' Mohammed said. ``Now we have a curfew,      and people don't feel safe to wait in line after dark because      of the explosions.''       The 10-person staff at the Mansur station provides its own      security, and a stack of AK-47s is kept handy in the main      office.       Not all the city's fuel stations are owned and operated by      the Oil Ministry, though none is a truly private business.       Meqdam Abdullah, 30, runs a station near the Sheraton      Ishtar Hotel in central Baghdad that his family leases from      the Oil Ministry. In exchange, officials sell fuel to the      station at a slightly reduced price. By averaging sales of      more than 100,000 liters a day, the station ekes out a small      profit, Abdullah said.       But it is a tough business. During the war, the station got      caught in a firefight between U.S. soldiers and armed      looters, as evidenced by patched bullet holes.       Since the war ended, thieves have struck more than once,      taking, among other things, the station's generator that is      needed to produce electricity. Abdullah's family had to pay      the looters to get the generator back. It was a necessary      expense, because officials provide electricity to Baghdad in      sequences of three hours on, three hours off.       Like many other Iraqis, Abdullah said the failure of U.S.      authorities to provide security is his biggest complaint in      the post-Saddam era. The lack of consistent electricity is      the second.       He attributed the sporadic power to some inscrutable form      of manipulation similar to the times, he said, that Saddam      cut off fuel to disfavored minorities.       ``America,'' Abdullah said, ``is the world's great      superpower, and it can't get the electricity back? I can't      believe that.''       The generator briefly failed at the service station on      Friday. Ironically, dirty fuel provided by the government      because of poor refining was believed to be the cause,      Abdullah said.       For a while, the station was quiet. But as the generator      sputtered back to life, cars immediately veered into the      lanes besides the pumps.       The only types of gasoline transaction not largely      controlled by the Oil Ministry here are the bootleg      operations like those of Ali and his uncles.       ``It is illegal, but no one bothers with them,'' shrugged      Mohammed, the Mansur station manager.       On Friday, business was slow as Ali and his uncles offered      large plastic jugs of fuel for sale.       ``It is always slow like this on Fridays, because it is the      holy day,'' Ali said. ``But we'll be back tomorrow. We always      do well on Saturdays.''
