Speaker, I take to the floor today to recognize the outstanding career of Lois Krieger, who retired after 25 years as Western Municipal Water District's representative on the Metropolitan Water District Board of Directors on January 1. Throughout the towns and cities across our nation, there are individuals who are willing to step forward to dedicate their talents and energies to make life better for their friends and neighbors. The citizens of Riverside, CA, are fortunate to have had such an individual in Lois.  Lois began her career in 1976, when she was appointed to succeed her father, Howard Boylan. At that time Lois Krieger already possessed a deep understanding and dedication to the region's complex water affairs from her years traveling with her father to public utility hearings and water affairs meetings. It was precisely Lois' commitment to these issues that spurred her election as the first woman, in the district's 60-year history, to chair the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) Board, serving from 1989 to 1993.  MWD imports water from the Colorado River and northern California, to supplement the local supplies within southern California, and provides it safely and reliably to the public. Western Municipal Water District is one of the 27 member agencies to make up MWD and provides water, waste water disposal and water resources management to the communities within a 510 square mile area of western Riverside County.  In addition to her work on the MWD's Board of Directors, Lois also served as the first woman president of the Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA), a California statewide association of 435 public water agencies responsible for the delivery of most of the water in the state. In that capacity, Krieger considers Water for All Californians, the governing policy of ACWA, as her chief accomplishment while President. Additionally, Lois has served as: a member on boards of directors of the Water Education Foundation, the California Water Resources Association, the Colorado River Resources Coalition; a western delegate to the municipal caucus of the National Water Resources Association; and a member of the University of California at Riverside Chancellor's agricultural advisory council and Women's Hall of Fame.  Lois Krieger's leadership has led to numerous awards and recognitions. The highlights include: the Los Angeles YWCA's Silver Achievement Award for public service in 1990; the Riverside YMCA's Women in Achievement Award for public and community service in 1990; and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Citizen Award for her commitment to the needs of the water community in 1993.  Mr. Speaker, Lois' work to preserve and strengthen southern California's water resources has been critical to the future viability of our communities, region and state. I know that all of the Inland Empire is grateful for her contributions to the betterment of the community and salute Lois as she retires from the Municipal Water District's Board of Directors. I look forward to continuing to work with her for the good of the Inland Empire and southern California in the future.                          ____________________
