President, I rise today to introduce the Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Fitzgerald. This legislation develops a coordinated approach for understanding and treating the devastating mental health disorder of postpartum depression.  This act is named for Chicago native Melanie Stokes, a successful pharmaceutical sales manager and loving wife of Dr. Sam Stokes, who gave birth on February 23, 2001 to her daughter, Sommer Skyy. Unfortunately, with the birth of her daughter, Melanie entered into a battle for her life with a devastating mood disorder known as postpartum psychosis. Mrs. Stokes was in and out of hospitals three times, each for a week to 10 days. She stopped eating and drinking and refused to swallow pills. Her weight dropped rapidly. Despite medical assistance and the support of her family and friends, Mrs. Stokes lost her battle with postpartum psychosis. Melanie jumped to her death from a 12-story window ledge on June 11, 2001. In addition to Melanie Stokes, in my own home State of Illinois, three other women suffering from postpartum depression or psychosis have committed suicide since June 11.  These women were not alone. Studies indicate that 50 to 75 percent of all new mothers undergo the ``baby blues,'' a feeling of let-down after the emotional experience of childbirth. Serious postpartum depression affects 10 to 20 percent of women who manifest symptoms including excessive worry or exhaustion, sadness, feelings of guilt, apathy, phobias, sleep problems, physical complaints and marked fear of criticism of mothering skills. These symptoms may last from 3 to 14 months. The most severe form of postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis, is characterized by hallucinations, hearing voices, paranoia, severe insomnia, extreme anxiety and depression, and deluded thinking in addition to many of the other symptoms of postpartum depression. Postpartum psychosis often requires hospitalization. While this severe form occurs fairly infrequently, affecting an estimated one in 1,000 new mothers, it may have the most grievous consequences including attempts at self-harm, suicide, or harm to others. Clearly postpartum depression is a significant problem with major societal costs.  While postpartum depression is a widespread problem, there are currently few research studies looking into its causes and there is currently no standard treatment for women suffering from this disorder. Given the lack of coordination amongst those interested in understanding and treating such a widespread problem, science and medicine have made few inroads into helping the many women and their families carrying the burden of postpartum depression. This legislation seeks to rectify this situation.  This bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to organize a series of national meetings, with the goal of developing a research and treatment plan for postpartum depression and psychosis. Further, this legislation encourages the Secretary to implement the research and treatment plan in a timely fashion. The bill also creates a new grants program, administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, to providewomen and their families with treatment and services.  In Illinois alone there are at least 175,000 births a year. Even using the conservative estimate that 10 percent of mothers will suffer from postpartum depression, this suggests that over 17,000 women, in the State of Illinois alone, and 400,000 women nationwide will experience the devastating symptoms of this disorder each year. Developing new treatments for this disorder should be a top priority.  I am pleased that Senator Fitzgerald has joined me in cosponsoring this bill. In the House of Representatives, Representative Rush has already introduced this legislation and it enjoys wide bipartisan support with 90 cosponsors at this time.  In remembrance of Melanie Stokes and all the women who have suffered from postpartum depression and psychosis, as well as their families and friend who have stood by their side, I am introducing the Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act.                                 ______                                       By
