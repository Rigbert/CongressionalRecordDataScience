Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, under the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia, we are going to reduce the penalty for pedophiles if they do not murder one of their victims. That shows that this amendment really is not a good idea and in effect reverses the entire thrust of the bill.  I do not think that the concern of the gentleman from Virginia is justified because what he is saying is that we ought to take the bill's penalties away from section 2243(a) of the criminal code which provides that whoever knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who is 12 to 15 years old and is at least 4 years older than the victim shall be fined or imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both.  If you have the hypothetical of an 18-year-old adult knowingly engaging in a sexual act with a 13-year-old child, that person would be indicted, would be prosecuted, would be convicted and would be incarcerated for several years as a result of that crime. My guess is that he would not be out of prison until he was in his mid- to late twenties. Now, if he turns around and commits another sexual act on someone who is 12 to 15 years old in his mid-twenties, then I think the book ought to be thrown at him, because this is not an immediate post-adolescent whose hormones have run amok and commits a sexual act. This is somebody who is now preying on somebody who is probably 10 to 15 years younger as a victim. I think that that is the type of person who ought to be sentenced to life imprisonment.  I think that really what we ought to do is look at how the clock runs, where you have the first strike that does not involve life imprisonment and then you have the second strike which would involve life imprisonment where the victim is probably at least 10 years and maybe even more than that younger than the assailant.  For that reason, I would hope that this amendment would be rejected.
