Mr. Speaker, I do thank the chairman and I do thank the ranking member for their kind comments.  Much has been said about this fine piece of legislation. As was mentioned, it has passed the House twice. The Senate finally passed out a bill, and now we are dealing with a Senate bill.  As was mentioned, this gives an opportunity for the YKHC, a Native hospital, to expand on Federal lands. By ownership of the land now, there will be no cloud on that title.  I do appreciate the comments. I do appreciate the work that has been put into this. This is a bill that should have been signed into law a lot sooner. It will be done now, and we will be able to expand this hospital for my Alaska Natives.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this legislation.
