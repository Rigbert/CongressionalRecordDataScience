Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, during the consideration of bill, H.R. 701, pursuant to House Resolution 497, the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) be allowed to control 20 minutes of my time for the general debate in the Committee of the Whole, with the understanding that I get the remaining part of my time.
