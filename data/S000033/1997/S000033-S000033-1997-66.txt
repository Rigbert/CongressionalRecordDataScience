 Chairman, the amendment that I am bringing forth is a very simple amendment. It is a chance for Members in the House to support their National Guard to increase funding for an educational program that represents just the kind of policy initiatives we need for young people in this country.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment, which is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States, will increase funding by $2 million for the National Guard star based program, bringing the program up to the President's request of $4 million. The star based public outreach program is administered by the National Guard and targets youth in grades 4 through 6, it is the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, to learn, hands on, with Guard pilots and technicians about math, science, and technology and to stay off of drugs.  Mr. Chairman, the star based program, my amendment brings funding for the National Guard star based program up to the $4 million requested by the President. This is, I think, exactly what we want to do in our communities. We talk a whole lot about asking kids to stay off of drugs. What this program does is have people from the National Guard interact with young people, explain to them the planes in the air work for certain reasons and get young kids excited in math and science, and the studies that have been done on the results of this program are excellent. More and more kids have an interest in math, they have an interest in science. It is a wonderful program for the National Guard, and it has been very successful.
