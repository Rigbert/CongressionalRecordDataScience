President, last night the President of the United States addressed one of the toughest issues any President has ever had to face. This is an environmental disaster of historic magnitude. It is one that could not have been anticipated. We have never had anything quite like it--at least near the United States. It is certainly one the President and our government did everything they could do to respond, but this frustrating situation continues.  What the President reminded us of last night is that we need to coordinate every effort, but understand that, in the end, there is no U.S. department of deep sea drilling. What it comes down to is that we need to turn to the private sector, which has the resources, the expertise, and the capability of not only dealing with the continuing oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico but the aftermath as well.  It has been clear from the outset that this President has been very firm and resolute that British Petroleum, this oil company, is going to be held responsible for the damage that has been done. It will be at their expense, and not at the expense of American taxpayers, that we will help the businesses affected and do anything within our power to restore the devastation which has occurred to the environment.  It was interesting yesterday that in testimony before the House of Representatives, many of the leaders of the major oil companies that compete with BP were as forthright publicly as they have been privately in other conversations.
