President, from Pickerel Pond to Lake Auburn, from Sebago Lake to Bryant Pond, lakes and ponds in Maine are under attack. Aquatic invasive species threaten Maine's drinking water systems, recreation, wildlife habitat, lakefront real estate, and fisheries. Plants, such as Variable Leaf Milfoil, are crowding out native species. Invasive Asian shore crabs are taking over Southern New England's tidal pools and have advanced well into Maine--to the potential detriment of Maine's lobster and clam industries.  I rise today to join Senator Levin in introducing legislation to address this problem. The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 would create the most comprehensive nationwide approach to date for combating alien species that invade our shores.  The stakes are high when invasive species are unintentionally introduced into our Nation's waters. They endanger ecosystems, reduce biodiversity, and threaten native species. They disrupt people's lives and livelihoods by lowering property values, impairing commercial fishing and aquaculture, degrading recreational experiences, and damaging public water supplies.  In the 1950s, European Green Crabs swarmed the Maine coast and literally ate the bottom out of Maine's soft-shell clam industry by the 1980s. Many clam diggers were forced to go after other fisheries or find new vocations. In just one decade, this invader reduced the number of clam diggers in Maine from nearly 5,000 in the 1940s to fewer than 1500 in the 1950s. European green crabs currently cost an estimated $44 million a year in damage and control efforts in the United States.  Past invasions forewarn of the long-term consequences to our environment and communities unless we take steps to prevent new invasions. It is too lateto stop European green crabs from taking hold on the East Coast, but we still have the opportunity to prevent many other species from taking hold in Maine and the United States.  Senator Levin and I introduced an earlier version of this legislation in March of 2003. Just a few months earlier, one of North America's most aggressive invasive species hydrilla--was found in Maine for the first time. This stubborn and fast-growing aquatic plant had taken hold in Pickerel Pond in the Town of Limerick, ME, and threatened recreational use for swimmers and boaters. At the time, we warned that unless Congress acted, more and more invasive species would establish a foothold in Maine and across the country.  Unfortunately, Congress failed to act on our legislation and new invasions have continued. In December, for the first time, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection detected Eurasian Milfoil in the State. Maine was the last of the lower 48 States to be free of this stubborn and fast-growing invasive plant that degrades water quality by displacing native plants, fish and other aquatic species. The plant forms stems reaching up to 20 feet high that cause fouling problems for swimmers and boaters. In total, there are 24 documented cases of aquatic invasive species infesting Maine's lakes and ponds.  When considering the impact of these invasive species, it is important to note the tremendous value of our lakes and ponds. While their contribution to our quality of life is priceless, their value to our economy is more measurable. Maine's Great Ponds generate nearly 13 million recreational user days each year, lead to more than $1.2 billion in annual income for Maine residents, and support more than 50,000 jobs.  With so much at stake, Mainers are taking action to stop the spread of invasive species into our State's waters. The State of Maine has made it illegal to sell, posses, cultivate, import or introduce eleven invasive aquatic plants. Boaters participating in the Maine Lake and River Protection Sticker program are providing needed funding to aid efforts to prevent, detect and manage aquatic invasive plants. Volunteers are participating in the Courtesy Boat Inspection program to keep aquatic invasive plants out of Maine lakes. Before launch or after removal, inspectors ask boaters for permission to inspect the boat, trailer or other equipment for plants. More than 300 trained inspectors conducted upwards of 30,000 courtesy boat inspections at 65 lakes in the 2004 boating season.  While I am proud of the actions that Maine and many other States are taking to protect against invasive species, all too often their efforts have not been enough. As with national security, protecting the integrity of our lakes, streams, and coastlines from invading species cannot be accomplished by individual States alone. We need a uniform, nationwide approach to deal effectively with invasive species. The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 will help my State and States throughout the Nation detect, prevent and respond to aquatic invasive species.  The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 would be the most comprehensive effort ever undertaken to address the threat of invasive species. By authorizing $836 million over 6 years, this legislation would open numerous new fronts in our war against invasive species. The bill directs the Coast Guard to develop regulations that will end the easy cruise of invasive species into U.S. waters through the ballast water of international ships, and would provide the Coast Guard with $6 million per year to develop and implement these regulations.  The bill also would provide $30 million per year for a grant program to assist State efforts to prevent the spread of invasive species. It would provide $12 million per year for the Army Corps of Engineers and Fish and Wildlife Service to contain and control invasive species. Finally, the Levin-Collins bill would authorize $30 million annually for research, education, and outreach.  Mr. President, the most effective means of stopping invading species is to attack them before they attack us. We need an early alert, rapid response system to combat invading species before they have a chance to take hold. For the first time, this bill would establish a national monitoring network to detect newly introduced species, while providing $25 million to the Secretary of the Interior to create a rapid response fund to help States and regions respond quickly once invasive species have been detected. This bill is our best effort at preventing the next wave of invasive species from taking hold and decimating industries and destroying waterways in Maine and throughout the country.  One of the leading pathways for the introduction of aquatic organisms to U.S. waters from abroad is through transoceanic vessels. Commercial vessels fill and release ballast tanks with seawater as a means of stabilization. The ballast water contains live organisms from plankton to adult fish that are transported and released through this pathway. Last week, a Federal judge ruled that the Government can no longer allow ships to dump, without a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, any ballast water containing nonnative species that could harm local ecosystems. The court case and subsequent decision indicates that there are problems with our existing systems to control ballast water discharge and signals a need to address invasive hitchhikers that travel to our shores aboard ships. Our legislation would establish a framework to prevent the introduction of aquatic invasive species by ships.  The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 offers a strong framework to combat aquatic invasive species. I call on my colleagues to help us enact this legislation in order to protect our waters, ecosystems, and industries from destructive invasive species--before it's too late.                                 ______                                       By
