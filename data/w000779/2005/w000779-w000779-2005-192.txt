President, tomorrow the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence gets back on the national security high wire as the committee continues to work on legislation reauthorizing the USA PATRIOT Act. I described this process as a high-wire act because success means striking a balance, an equilibrium, between fiercely protecting our country from terrorism while still preserving the privacy and civil liberties that make our democracy so precious.  Chairman Pat Roberts, to his credit, has held several open hearings on this issue. I gladly participated because I believed the open hearings would help to address some of the skepticism about why the PATRIOT Act has almost totally been debated in secret.  Unfortunately, the most important part of the debate, the part where the committee must actually discuss how to walk that high wire, is still going to be done behind closed doors. In my view, this secrecy in going forward will undermine any public confidence that open hearings helped to create.  I have repeatedly and vigorously opposed making these decisions out of public view. Holding the decisionmaking process in secret is a mistake because it makes it harder for citizens to hold elected officials accountable. Holding the decisionmaking process in secret is unnecessary because it is not difficult for the committee to go behind closed doors, certainly, briefly, when necessary, to discuss any PATRIOT Act-related issue that requires secrecy. Holding the decisionmaking process in secret gratuitously feeds the cynicism that citizens have about the Government's true intentions with respect to this law. Keeping these proceedings secret fuels concerns that the committee is making choices that will not stand up to public scrutiny--deciding, for example, that you can only have security if you sacrifice privacy. In my view, that is a false choice. I simply do not believe that protecting our country from terrorism and securing the privacy rights of our citizens are mutually exclusive objectives.  So here is my bottom line: Give law enforcement and intelligence officials the tools they need to protect our country, but stay away from the fishing expeditions. I do not think anybody will argue with me when I say that Congress passed the PATRIOT Act shortly after September 11, 2001, because it was necessary to move in a hurry. It was clear no one could have conceived of the way in which our country was exposed to attack. It was clear that the Federal Government needed to make major changes in how it fought terrorism, and those were needed immediately.  The best parts of the law tore down the unnecessary walls that had grown up between law enforcement and the intelligence agencies. Today, if you go out to the National Counterterrorism Center, the people on the ground there will tell you that those walls have been torn down, and they have stayed down. So the men and women on the front lines in the fight against terror are, in my view, more effective than they were.  However, other provisions of the law have sparked serious concerns. Giving Federal authorities broad powers of investigation has raised the specter that the rights of law-abiding citizens might be severely compromised, accidentally or even intentionally. In moving forward, I want to make sure that the right of our citizens to privacy is certainly not compromised intentionally.  I am not suggesting our national intelligence or law enforcement agencies are currently being misused the way they have been during our history--such as in the Watergate scandal. But it is important for us to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent unintentional abuses and prevent future even darker episodes in our country's history.  In my view, a proposed addition to the PATRIOT Act, one that certainly warrants open debate, is the administrative subpoena which, in my view, raises the risk of real abuse. I want to make it clear on this subject today, I believe reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act should simply not include new administrative subpoena authority for the FBI.  I am opposed to giving the FBI this authority to write their own administrative subpoenas for foreign intelligence investigations for a number of reasons. Doing so would give the FBI the authority to demand just about anything from just about anybody, with no independent check, simply by claiming that it is relevant to a national security investigation. The FBI already has access to the waterfront of personal information through the FISA warrant process. All they have to do is go before a judge and explain why it is relevant in the most general terms. By giving the FBI the authority to write their own administrative subpoenas, the Congress would be removing this even last modest safeguard.  Administrative subpoenas are currently used by many Federal agencies in many contexts. But, except in a very few limited cases, they are not used for national security investigations. National security investigations are simply different than criminal investigations. They, of course, are conducted in secret and do not require evidence of a crime. This is why there are different rules for the two types of investigations. It is not enough, in my view, to say what is good for the goose is good for the gander. The question here is, What is good for the American people? The answer is not administrative subpoenas.  As proposed, these subpoenas would be extraordinarily broad in their scope. They could be used to gain access to your credit records, your video rentals, your medical records, your gun purchases. They could be used to obtain just about anything. These subpoenas would only be seen by a judge if the recipient of the subpoena decided to challenge it. Even if the recipient was properly notified of his or her right to challenge, they might not be in the position to have the time or the resources to even make that challenge.  For example, there are 56 FBI field offices, one in just about every major American city. The head of the local field office could issue an administrative subpoena to a hospital director and ask for all the hospital's medical records simply by claiming they were relevant to an investigation. If the hospital director was busy or did not have the resources to make a challenge, then no judge--no judge would ever see this administrative subpoena. The patients would not even know that their records had been seized. They would be totally in the dark.  Even the FBI acknowledges that the agency can get all the information they could possibly need with the investigative powers they currently have. The only reason they have suggested for supporting this judge-free administrative subpoena is speed. They say that the FISA warrant process is simply too slow for time-sensitive, emergency situations.  This afternoon I would like to propose on the floor of the Senate an alternative. In this year's reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, Congress can balance protection for the public with the right of privacy by creating an emergency use provision to the FISA business records authority. This way, under the proposal I make today, if the FBI needs information right away, the FBI could notify a judge that theywere going to get it--send an e-mail, leave a voice message--and then go get it without waiting for a response. Then they would have 72 hours to apply for the warrant so they could do it after the emergency had been addressed. If the judge felt the FBI had acted inappropriately and decided not to grant the warrant, then the Agency would not be able to use whatever information they had gathered. The idea of adding an emergency use provision along the lines I have described would address the FBI's concern for speed without creating a broad new authority that would remove all the independent checks, even in situations where there were not emergencies.  Although time was not taken in 2001 to thoroughly discuss the privacy issues related to the PATRIOT Act, most of the law's more controversial provisions were made subject to sunset. This was done in hopes of a more thoughtful, informed debate during the reauthorization. The sunsets, in my view, have had an unanticipated benefit. They have made the agency very careful about how it uses the powers that have been granted.  In addition to the proposal that I am making today to give the FBI more authority to deal with emergencies, I believe the Senate should also focus its attention on sharper scrutiny for the sunset provisions in the act. Some of the sunset provisions that have existed have not attracted any controversy. Others have not only attracted controversy, serious questions have been raised about their use and possible misuse. I want to consider some of these provisions in detail today and, in addition to the proposal I have made with respect to giving the FBI emergency authority, I urge firm action to safeguard the American people as the sunset provisions are considered in the PATRIOT Act's renewal.  The provision that has attracted the most attention is probably section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. It is commonly referred to as the library records provision, but in fact it ought to be called the business records provision. Suffice it to say, it is a sweeping one. This provision gives law enforcement access to all types of information from video rentals and gun purchases to tax and medical records. In a nutshell, here is how it works.  Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA--which I have referred to several times already--it is possible for FBI agents to go to a judge and request a secret warrant to obtain business records. The person to whom the records pertain is not informed. This means that if the FBI serves a FISA warrant on a bank or hospital, the bank president or hospital director would know about it, but the customers or patients whose records had been seized would know nothing at all.  Before the PATRIOT Act, if the FBI wanted to get one of these warrants, they had to show a judge specific and articulable facts that the records pertained to a terrorist or a spy. The PATRIOT Act lowered the standard, so now the FBI simply has to assert that the records are, in their view, relevant to a terrorism inquiry. To protect innocent Americans, the business records provision needs to be modified in several ways.  First, the Congress should require that the application for a FISA warrant include a statement of facts explaining why the records are relevant to an investigation. Congress should also raise the standard for the most sensitive type of records. The ``relevance'' standard may be appropriate for a hotel or car rental record, but it may be necessary to require the FBI to show hard evidence before giving access to more sensitive records such as medical records.  Finally, there must be an increase in the reporting that is done in this area. Congress's duty to look out for abuses of the PATRIOT Act is often a challenging one. Little reporting is required on the use of some provisions. Details regarding the use of the PATRIOT Act are reported, even when reporting is not required. When there is a report, the information is often classified. National security investigations often need to be conducted in secret, but revealing how often particular techniques are used does not make them less effective. Congress needs this information to perform its constitutional responsibilities, and the fact is too often Congress has been doing oversight over the intelligence community in the dark.  The Intelligence reform bill that passed a few months ago tried to fill several of the reporting gaps, but there are others that need to be closed as the PATRIOT Act is reauthorized. These reports should also be made public, to the maximum extent possible so that the American people can know all that is safely to be known about FBI activity under the law.  One of the major reporting gaps I am concerned about involves what the FBI calls discreet inquiries that the agency uses to obtain library records. The FBI Director, Mr. Mueller, has testified before several Senate committees that, while FISA warrants could be used to obtain people's library records, this has never been done. But the FBI director went on to say that the Agency does obtain library records through what he called discreet inquiries. So I think that the American people deserve to know what a discreet inquiry is. The American people deserve to know how often they are used. And I have asked the FBI to get me this information.  Over a month later, despite multiple requests by the staff of the Intelligence Committee, the FBI has still not provided an answer to the question. Suffice it to say, the longer the Agency waits, in terms of answering the question of how they obtain library records, the more Americans believe that the Agency is stepping over the line and into the lives of law-abiding citizens. Those most directly affected by the library records provision have been expressing strong concerns. The American Library Association recently wrote me:       ``[D]iscreet inquiries'' by the FBI put our librarians at      risk of breaking state laws if agents approach them for      information without subpoenas or other properly executed      legal documents and intimidate them into complying with the      request.  I ask unanimous consent the letter from the American Library Association be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 American Library Association,                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2005.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: On behalf of the over 65,000 members of      the American Library Association (ALA) I am writing to      express our appreciation for your efforts to seek further      information about the nature and scope of FBI investigations      into library records. We thank you for your hard work      examining law enforcement activity in libraries under Section      215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, national security letters, and      ``discreet inquiries'' without, apparently, warrants or      subpoenas.       Librarians across the country, in all kinds of libraries,      take their jobs as public servants very seriously. We are as      concerned about our Nation's security as any other sector of      the American public. At the same time, the issue of privacy      and the confidentiality of library records is a long-held and      deep principle of our profession. The American public values      this principle as well: forty-eight States have laws      protecting the confidentiality of library records, and the      other two States have attorney general opinions doing so.       As you know, both the FBI and the Department of Justice      have reported that there has been ``zero'' use of Section 215      in libraries. However, our office is aware, at least      anecdotally, of FBI inquiries made using other methods in      what do not appear to be normal criminal or civil      investigations. To determine the extent of these inquiries      ALA has begun its own research regarding the scope of law      enforcement investigations of library patrons and their      reading records.       Leaders of ALA have met with Attorney General Gonzales and      FBI Director Mueller to discuss our concerns about these      library-related investigations as well as to discuss our      ongoing research. We are seeking aggregated data to      understand better the breadth of FBI investigations and the      impact the investigations have on library users.       We very much appreciate your questions seeking further      information from Director Mueller about these inquiries.      Specifically, we would like to know:       What exactly is a ``discreet inquiry?''       Do these inquiries require a subpoena and are they subject      to any judicial oversight?       How many ``discreet inquiries'' have been made in the last      four years? 1 year? In general, what kind of evidence was      uncovered?       Have these inquiries been related only to foreign      intelligence investigations or have they been used in non-     intelligence investigations?       What are the procedures and authorization for such      inquiries?       Are there pertinent FBI guidelines and related oversight      procedures for assessing ``discreet inquiries'' and if so,      are there aggregated public reports on this type of inquiry?       The American Library Association holds that privacy is      essential to the exercise of free speech, free thought, and      free association and that, in a library, the subject of      users' interests should not be examined or scrutinized by      others. Whether there has been one F.B.I. inquiry at      libraries on the reading habits of patrons or thousands, the      threat to the confidentiality of library records chills      library use by the public and threatens confidentiality in      other venues where privacy is the essence of the service/     relationship.       Thank you again for all your work on issues surrounding law      enforcement investigations in libraries and on the other      important provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and related      regulations that affect the privacy and civil liberties of      the public. We support your efforts to address both the need      for effective law enforcement and the civil liberties of the      American public in an appropriate and proportional manner.           Sincerely,                                                 Lynne E. Bradley,                          Director of OGR, ALA--Washington Office.
