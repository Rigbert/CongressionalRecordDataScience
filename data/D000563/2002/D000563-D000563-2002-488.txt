NICKLES. That is correct. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3529 effectively reformed AMT prospectively. That is correct. It has had no benefit for Enron, no cash benefits for IBM. So I want to make that clear.  Also, just for the record, I just had a chance to read the amendment offered by my friend, Senator Baucus. It has $2.3 billion in emergency agricultural assistance, $1.8 billion for the Commodity Credit Corporation, and an additional $500 million for the Commodity Credit Corporation that is designated as livestock. And $12 million is for the American Indian Livestock Program, which I did not even know we had. Anyway, there is a $500 million program for that. I think my colleague from Wyoming wants to speak on it.  I want to have printed in the Record the emergency spending for agriculture that we have done in the last 10, 11 years.  It has exploded, absolutely exploded. For the years 1990 through 1995, the average was less than $1 billion a year. For the last 2 years, agricultural emergency spending was right at $15 billion and over $11 billion. I think it has been done kind of haphazardly, and maybe done right before the end of the year, where agriculture has been in a tough situation, and we just threw out a lot of money. I am afraid that is what we would be doing if we added another $2.3 billion.  What about reforming the crop insurance program? We did that a couple years ago. I remember being in this Chamber and everybody saying: Wait a minute, let's fix the crop insurance program so we do not have to come up--every time there is a drought or a flood--with a new Federal emergencyprogram and write big checks. We are going to fix the insurance program. And we spent some money to fix it. And we have subsidized that program enormously.  What are we doing now? This is adding more money to agricultural emergency assistance. I know we have farmers hurting in my State, just as there are in Montana, and I am sure in many other parts of the country. We are having a drought that is very significant in my State, as I am sure in many of the plains States as well.  But I am looking at the total cost of this program. I will read through these last several years. In 1995, the total agricultural emergency assistance was $600 million; the next year it was $140 million; the next year it was $400 million; the next year, 1998, it was $160 million; and then in 1999 it jumps all the way up to $6.62 billion--not $6.62 million--$6.62 billion. Then the next year it doubles again to $14.99 billion; and last year, 2001, to over $11 billion.  Yet people are saying: Let's add some more billions on top of that.  Then we are going to be dealing with an agriculture bill in the next couple weeks, and people are going to say: Let's spend an extra $75 billion on top of that. Some of us will have an amendment saying: Let's look at who is getting what. There is a front-page article in the Washington Post today that talks about one farmer getting $38 million in the last 5 years. Then it basically says there are thousands of farmers who are making enormous amounts--hundreds of thousands of dollars--not $50,000, not $80,000, not $100,000. There are thousands of farmers who are getting hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I think for the top thousand or more in Arkansas, the average payment was almost $500,000. I have some of those in my State. I think that is outlandish. And they can get it from all kinds of ways, including emergency assistance, including supplemental farm bills. We used to have limitations. We need limitations.  When we get to the farm bill, again, I hope we will put limitations on the payments. In the Harkin-Daschle bill, if I remember, farmers would be able to receive almost $500,000. And I read in the paper today people are able to get millions through multiple entities. We need to tighten that up. I know Senator Grassley has an amendment. Others on the Democratic side hopefully will support it. I have one that will limit payments to $150,000. I am sure some people will say the sky is going to fall because we limit farmers and entities to $150,000. Regardless, I think we should do it.  I think we should be debating the farm bill and agricultural assistance on the farm bill, not on the stimulus package.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the chart from which I was reading.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Emergency Spending for Agriculture: A Brief History of Congressional                           Action, FY 1989-2001                                summary       From FY1989 through FY2001, twenty-one appropriations,      authorization, or farm disaster acts have added $43.8 billion      in emergency funding for U.S. Department of Agriculture      (USDA) programs. Nearly $32.8 billion, or about 75 percent of      the total amount, was for FY1999-FY2001 alone.       Since FY1989, the vast majority of the total emergency      funding has been paid directly to farmers, primarily through      two mechanisms: ``market loss payments'' ($21.4 billion, all      since FY1999) to compensate for low farm commodity prices,      and disaster payments ($15.8 billion) paid to any producer      who experienced a major crop loss caused by a natural      disaster. The remaining $6.6 billion has funded a wide array      of other USDA programs, including other forms of farm      disaster assistance, speciality crop assistance, farm loans,      overseas food aid, food and nutrition programs, and rural      development assistance.       Total annual funding additions in the 21 acts providing      emergency assistance to USDA programs since FY1989 are as      follows:       FY1989: $3.39 billion;       FY1990: $1.48 billion;       FY1991: $0;       FY1992: $1.0 billion;       FY1993: $1.3 billion;       FY1994: $2.57 billion;       FY1995: $0.6 billion;       FY1996: $0.14 billion;       FY1997: $0.4 billion;       FY1998: $0.16 billion;       FY1999: $6.62 billion;       FY2000: $14.99 billion;       FY2001: $11.17 billion.       Grand Total (FY1989-2001): $43.82 billion.
