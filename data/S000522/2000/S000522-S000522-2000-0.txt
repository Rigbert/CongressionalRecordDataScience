Mr. Speaker, today a great man of God, a brilliant writer of homilies and incisive commentary, an extraordinary humanitarian, a courageous defender of human life, Bishop James T. McHugh, was buried.  After a long battle with cancer, Bishop McHugh passed away on December 10. Consistent with how he lived his life, Bishop McHugh faced death like he faced life, with courage, dignity, and an unwavering faith that inspires us all.  Prior to his assignment at Rockville Center, New York, Bishop McHugh served with dedication and effectiveness as Bishop of the Diocese of Camden, New Jersey, an area just south of my district.  Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of knowing this holy man of God and calling him friend for over 25 years. By his words and extraordinary example, Bishop McHugh lived the gospel of Christ with unpretentious passion and humility. Bishop McHugh radiated Christ. He recognized evil and deceit in the world for what it was, yet he never ceased to proclaim reconciliation and renewal through Christ, the sacraments, and the church.  Clearly among the best and brightest and clearly among the most wise, Bishop McHugh nevertheless was humble and soft-spoken. His courage to press on against any and all odds was without peer. He was a spiritual giant, and we will miss him dearly.  A graduate of Seton Hall University and the Immaculate Conception Seminary in Darlington, New Jersey, Bishop McHugh began his service to the church early in his life. Ordained in 1957, Bishop McHugh's impact has been felt in countless ways. His constant and unyielding defense of the unborn will serve as a pillar of strength to all of us who carry on the fight for life.  At the time of his death, Bishop McHugh was a member of the U.S. Bishops Committee on Pro-Life Activities, as well as a consultor to the Pontifical Council on the Family. His dedication to the family and the pro-life movement knew no bounds, and his representation of the Vatican at international meetings at the United Nations on population control and pro-life matters served not only as an inspiration for myself and many others, but he upheld the convictions and beliefs of the church and believers worldwide, and did it with great distinction.  Bishop McHugh's courage and convictions could not have been more evident, again, as he entered his final days in life. He spoke up on behalf of all of those who are disenfranchised and dispossessed. Again, he preached reconciliation and love. I ask that we all remember him.

Bishop McHugh's courage and courage and convictions could not have been more evident than just recently, when he ordered that no public officials or candidates who supported abortion be permitted to appear at Catholic perishes. Although Bishop McHugh was critized by the media, he was upheld in high esteem among those of us who hold that all human life is precious. Bishop McHugh held strong to clear Christian teaching on the sanctity of human life and the duty of all men and women of goodwill, especially politicians, to protect the vulnerable from the violence of abortion.  Early in his career, Bishop McHugh worked on staff of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and was named director of the Division for Family Life in 1967 and director of the bishops' Secretariat for Pro-Life activities in 1972. Bishop McHugh did advanced theological studies at the Angelicum in Rome and earned his doctorate in sacred theology in 1981.  Bishop McHugh must be commended for this outstanding work as Vatican delegate to numerous international conferences, including the 1974 International Conference on Population in Bucharest, Romania, the 1980 UN World Conference on Women in Copehagen, Denmark; the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City; the 1990 World Summit for Children in New York; the 1992 International Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, and the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cario, Egypt.                          ____________________
