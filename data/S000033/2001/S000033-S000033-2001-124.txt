 Speaker, while we are on the issue of trade, I want to touch on an issue, talk about amazing issues, we talked about the WTO and OPEC. This one, in many respects, is even more amazing, and that is the Permanent Normalized Trade Relations with China. Let us talk a little bit about that and talk about it in two respects. Number one, what is going on?  Well, for a start, it seems to me that overall, our trade policy is almost by definition a disaster. Today, the United States has over a $400 billion trade deficit, which means that products that used to be manufactured in the United States by workers here who are making a living wage are now being manufactured in China, Mexico, many other countries around the world where people are being paid 20 cents or 30 cents an hour. Now, I find it very hard to talk about ``free trade'' and fairness in trade when American workers are being asked to compete against desperate people in China who make 20 cents an hour, who cannot form a union, who, if they stood up and asked for the most basic, elemental, democratic rights, they would be thrown in jail, and that is our competition.  Now, what is also very interesting about what is going on in terms of our relationships to China is how little we are hearing from the media on this issue.  If we look at our relations to China, and I am not anti-China, anti-Chinese, I do not want a Cold War with China, I want to see China integrated into the world economy, China has a fantastic history, and so forth and so on. I am not anti-Chinese. But why would we want to continue a trade policy with a country in which we have an $84 billion trade deficit, record-breaking trade deficit with China? If one is in Vermont, if one is in any State of the country, walk into the local department store and look at the labels of the products that we are buying, and we are not talking about cheap 50 cent products?  We are talking about a wide variety of products, some of them very, very good quality. One of the most important economic realities that has taken place in this country in the last decade is that the major multinational corporations have, to a significant degree, stopped investing in New England, stopped investing in the Midwest and many other sections of our country, but instead are investing billions and billions of dollars building state-of-the-art factories in China. And the reason for their doing that is, I guess, China is a great place to do business. Workers are forced to work for starvation wages, they cannot form unions, they cannot stand up for their rights; environmental regulations are weak or nonexistent.  What a fantastic place to do business. You can bribe government officials all over the place. It is a fantastic place. Why would one want to invest in the United States, pay workers here a living wage, have to obey environmental regulations and so forth and so on?  So what we are seeing is a huge amount of investment in China. And the support of this trade agreement, which has been a disaster for American workers by corporate America and their representatives in the United States Congress.  Now, what I found very interesting is that after we opened up our market to China, and we said to the American companies and so forth that are doing business in China, come on in, you could be Nike, you can pay your workers 20 cents an hour, you can sell your sneakers in this country for $100, great idea, no problem. Well, in the midst of all of this, a funny thing happened. A couple of months ago, as everybody knows, an American plane was collided with by a Chinese pilot. As a result of the heroic efforts of the American pilot, 24 service people were able to stay alive as their plane crash landed in China.  Now, one would think, one might think that given the fact that we have granted permanent normalized trade relations with China, that we have allowed them to sell products into our market which results in the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs, lowering of the wages of American workers, one might think that in the midst of all of that, what the Chinese government might say is, we are sorry for the accident.  Obviously, we are going to release the 24 American servicemen who crash landed, and you are going to get your plane back as soon as you possibly can. That would seem to me to be the logical response of a government whichnow has complete access to the American market, which has been granted Permanent Most Favored Nation status. Instead, this country held prisoner 24 American service people for 11 days and still has our airplane. Where is the outrage? Where is the outrage?  Well, in fact, as my colleague from Oregon knows, in a couple of months, within a couple of months, there will be another vote on Most Favored Nation status with China. The big money people are pouring huge amounts of money into the political process, and despite the recent outrage, my expectation is that MFN with China will, once again, be passed, and that we will not revoke PNTR, as I think we should.  So let me conclude my remarks in that regard by saying, I am not anti-Chinese. I do not want a Cold War with China. I want trade with China. But it has got to be trade based on principles that are fair for the American worker, not just corporate America, and a policy which results in a positive political relationship between China and the United States, which clearly the recent incident with the airplane indicates is not the case.  I yield to my friend for any thoughts he has on that issue.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, Mr. Speaker, certainly, big news in the Pacific Northwest recently was that the Boeing Company, after about a half a century, has moved its headquarters out of Seattle, and the rumor, and I have to unfortunately think it is true, is that the Boeing executives wanted to get out of town before they shipped the jobs to China. They have already outsourced some manufacturing to China. We know they would like to outsource more of their manufacturing of their planes to China. The CEO of the company has said he cannot wait until the day that he does not have to say it is an American corporation, that it is something else, a stateless company, and we know that they can get labor much cheaper in China. They are producing significant components of their planes there.  So the pressure on this administration, as the last administration, from the biggest corporations in this country, Boeing, Nike, IBM, Westinghouse, we can go down the list, is no matter what the Chinese do, so what if they sold nuclear weapons to terrorists, so what if they held our men and women hostage, so what if they are the most unfair trading nation on earth and they are stealing our jobs.  A few companies are making a little bit of money over there, and that is what drives U.S. policy and, unfortunately, and pathetically, this administration is going to be no different than the last, the Clinton administration no different than Bush I and Reagan on this issue; that is, whatever the dictators, the bloody dictators in Beijing want, they will get, no matter how high the price.  Last year the price was an $83.8 billion deficit with China, the most unfair trading nation on earth.  Pick up the report of the U.S. Trade Representative. It is about this thick, and read page after page after page after page of the ways that the Chinese have discriminated against U.S. manufactured goods. They are not buying our goods, except when they want to make copies of them. That is the only time they buy them. They are very studiously developing a market in the U.S. and avoiding U.S. goods coming into their country.  Last year, the wheat farmers from eastern Oregon came in to see me and they were just hysterical about the idea that they could get into China if we just only gave them permanent, Most Favored Nation status, and I said, I disagree. I gave them transcripts of radio talks by the Chinese agriculture minister saying there is no way we are going to allow our country to become dependent upon imports of food.  In fact, we intend to be exporting wheat and other goods. We only want access to their markets. And in trade we have to say nice things, but that is not what we mean and we are really going to do something totally different. I gave them the transcripts. They said, no, that is not true.  In fact, just before we voted here in this House of Representatives, a majority of our colleagues voted to give the Chinese everything they could ever dream of and, despite all of their misbehavior, they took in a boatload of wheat. Guess what? It is the last one they ever took. In fact, the same farmers came in to see me this year, they sat down quietly, and we were just sitting there on opposite sides of the office and they said, well, are you going to say it? I said, say what? They said, are you going to say you were right? I said yes, I was right, but what are we going to do about it?  Mr. Speaker, group after group of Americans has been snookered on this free trade rhetoric. They believe, and they are good Americans and they are hard-working Americans and they care about their family farms and their small businesses or their industrial small manufacturing plants. Group after group after group has come to me over the years on these trade issues and said, no, Congressman, they tell us it is going to benefit us, and group after group after group has come back 1 or 2 or 3 years later and said, we have been devastated. They are doing exactly the opposite of what they told us, and exactly the opposite has happened to our wheat folks. Not a grain of Oregon wheat has gone into China since that agreement was penciled.  Now, maybe they will take another boatload this spring because they need to get another vote here in this Congress, or maybe it will be apples from Washington or maybe it will be who-knows-what. It is a pretty cheap price to them when they are running an $83.8 billion unfair trade surplus with the U.S.  By the Commerce Department's own numbers, that is $1,660,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs that are gone to China. They always want to talk about oh, hey, every billion dollars of trade is 20,000 jobs. The only thing is they never talk about the net. We sent like $16 billion worth of stuff to China and we imported over $100 billion of stuff from China. That is the net number.                              {time}  2045  That is our job loss. Why will they not talk about that?
