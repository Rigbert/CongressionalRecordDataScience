But I think reality has caught up with the administration. Generally, Americans give the President high marks as a President. And the numbers have come down, but only slightly. His general overall rating is positive. I think a lot of that reflects on his leadership since 911 and perhaps in the Middle East. But when asked specifically about the state of the economy, that is when the chickens come home to roost.  I think that is the point where the President and the White House is failing. They have failed because their economic policy--giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America, generating the biggest deficits in our history--really has us headed down the road which we all understand would be a road of economic ruin.
