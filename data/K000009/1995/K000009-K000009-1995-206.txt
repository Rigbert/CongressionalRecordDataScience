I wish to draw my colleagues' attention to it.  Mr. Speaker, today the American people are going to win the first vote being allowed in this Congress on the misguided taxpayer-backed bailout of the Government of Mexico.  As a result of a procedure we employed to force the leadership of this House to let us vote on the first step in getting to the bottom of this, the House this afternoon will vote on House Resolution 80, a bipartisan resolution of inquiry which requires the administration to answer key questions regarding its $52 billion bailout of Mexico.  I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question and ``yes'' on House Resolution 80. Get answers to questions for your constituents such as who are the private creditors who will benefit from this rescue package? How solid is Mexico's pledge of oil collateral? Demand answers for your constituents.  This will be the first vote in many to follow, I hope, so we can get to the bottom of who our taxpayers are being asked to bail out.                          ____________________
