I thought about saying this, but I think the example Senator Coburn wrote about in the Wall Street Journal about Sheila made me decide to speak of it.  I had a very close friend, a member of the British Parliament, who thought he had broken his wrist. He had a lot of pain. It took quite a while to get in to see a doctor for a broken wrist. He finally did, and it was put in a cast.
