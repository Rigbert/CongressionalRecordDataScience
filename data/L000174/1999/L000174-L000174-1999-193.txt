President, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, stated the case very well this evening about the unprecedented sequence of three votes on judicial nominations. As I look at the Senate floor now, I have served in this body longer than anybody presently on the floor. In 25 years, I have not seen an instance where we have had such a series of votes.  We certainly have had times when Republicans have been in control of the Senate and times when Democrats have been in control of the Senate where nominees were sometimes voted down and sometimes were voted up, which is the way it should be. When the President is of a different party from the party controlling the Senate, that does not mean that the President's nominee, the man or woman he nominates for whatever position, automatically has to be voted against because one party controls the Senate and a different party is in the White House.  I look at two of my very distinguished, dear friends on the floor--the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan--both of whom have voted many times for nominees of the President of the other party in a whole lot of areas, certainly within their expertise on armed services but also for ambassadors and judicial nominations.  I am sure that if the distinguished Senators sitting here were to go back and search their memories, they could think of a number of people for whom they voted who were confirmed and who were not the persons they would have nominated had they been President. They might have picked somebody else. They might have picked somebody with a different politicalbent or ideology. But I think they have given the President of the United States the benefit of the doubt, and if the person is otherwise qualified, he or she gets the vote.  We have come to a difficult situation with judges. There continue to be a large number of vacancies, and there are a lot of nominees who are not being voted on. There are some that have waited for several years to be voted on. We talked about Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon who have been waiting for years to be voted on. We should either vote for or against them.  The distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee deserves great credit for having gotten these nominees through our committee, notwithstanding opposition from some members of his own party, and for having gotten them onto the floor and on the calendar. I compliment the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, for what he has done.  I have worked closely with him to help him get matters out of that committee. There were some matters with which I disagreed and that I voted against. But he was chairman, and I thought he should have as much leeway as possible in setting the agenda. I made it possible through various procedural actions for him to get his legislation out of committee.  Tonight we had a situation born out of the frustration, possibly mistakes, and, unfortunately, some unnecessary partisanship--although not partisanship between the distinguished chairman of the committee and myself. I intend to vote for his recommended nominee for district judge from Utah, Mr. Stewart. I intend to vote for him as I did in the committee.  I also intend to vote for Marsha Berzon. I intend to vote for Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie White, and, for that matter, for all of the other judicial nominees who are on the Executive Calendar. I intend to vote for every one of them.  I hope we will have a chance to vote on them, not just in committee where I have voted for each one of them, but on the floor of the Senate. That is what the Constitution speaks of in our advise and consent capacity. That is what these good and decent people have a right to expect. That is what our oath of office should compel Members to do--to vote for or against. I do not question the judgment or conscience of any man or woman in this Senate if they vote differently than I do, but vote.  We have just a very few people, a small handful of people stopping these nominees from coming to a vote. Basically, the Senate is saying we vote ``maybe"--not yes or no--we vote maybe. That is beneath Members as Senators.  We are privileged to serve in this body. There are a quarter of a billion people in this great country. There are only 100 men and women who get a chance to serve at any time to represent that quarter of a billion people in this Senate. It is the United States Senate. No one owns the seat. No one will be here forever. All will leave at some time. When we leave, we can only look back and say: What kind of service did we give? Did we put the country's interests first? Or did we put partisan interest first? Did we put integrity first, or did we play behind the scenes and do things that were wrong?  I hope my children will be able to look at their father's representation in this body as one of honor and integrity, as many of my friends on both sides of this aisle have done.  I hope what happened tonight was something we will not see repeated. I understand the distinguished majority leader in going forward with his motion. I understand and support the motion of the distinguished Democratic leader.  Now that this has happened, can it be like the little escape valve on a pressure cooker? The distinguished Presiding Officer and I are from a generation that remembers the old pressure cookers prior to the age of microwaves. Certainly, my wife and I as youngsters saw a pressure cooker now and then in the kitchen. Let us hope that maybe tonight's votes will act as a little valve and let the pressure off.  I do not want to infringe on the kindness of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, two of the very best friends I have ever had in the Senate and two Senators whom I respect and like the most here.  Let me close with this: Maybe the pressure cooker has allowed its pressure to be released now. I suggest that the distinguished majority leader, the distinguished Democratic leader, the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I now sit down and perhaps quietly, without the glare of publicity and the cameras, try to work out where we go from here. It may be necessary for the four of us to meet with the President. But let us find a way to tell these nominees they will get a vote one way or the other.  I am not asking anybody how they should or should not vote but allow nominees to have a vote. All the people being nominated are extremely highly qualified lawyers and judges. They have to put their lives on hold and the lives of their family on hold while they wait. They are neither fish nor fowl as a nominee. In private practice, all your partners come in and throw a big party and say it is wonderful, we are so proud of you, could you move out of the corner office because we want to take it now. And you cannot do anything while you wait and wait and wait.  Vote them up, vote them down.  Now that we have done this, let the cooler heads of the Senate prevail so the Senate can reassure the United States we are meeting our responsibility. Again, each Member is privileged to be here. There are only 100 Members, with all our failings and all our faults, to represent a quarter of a billion people. Let us represent that quarter of a billion people better on this issue.  The distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I have a close personal relationship. We will continue to have that. We will continue to work together, but the Senate has to work with us.                          ____________________
