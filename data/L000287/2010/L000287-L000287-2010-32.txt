Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5611, the Airport and Airway Extension Act, Part II.  As you know, the Trust Fund taxes and spending authority are scheduled to expire on July 3. This bill simply extends the authority one more month while we work together on a long-term solution.  Air travel plays a crucial and critical role in our economy and our lives. The world's busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is located in my congressional district. This airport alone has a direct impact of more than $32.5 billion on the State of Georgia's economy. At a time when we are considering the importance of jobs and job creation, I would like to note that the airport is the second-largest employer in Georgia with 58,000 workers.  If Congress does not pass the bill, the Trust Fund will lose the revenue that we need for airport construction and the Nation's air traffic control system.  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to come together and support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
