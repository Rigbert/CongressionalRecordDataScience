SALAZAR. May I keep going for a couple of minutes and I will be happy to yield for a question from my friend from Illinois.  I say to my friends who are listening tonight, I do have some personal history on this issue because my family came here in 1598, long before Jamestown, some 12 generations ago. We have been around a long time.  My own history is one where I know I am the first Mexican American to serve in this Senate in 30 years--the first Mexican American in 30 years and the only one, ever, elected to the Senate outside of the State of New Mexico.  When I look at this issue of the border, I approach it from the point of view that we as a nation have a sovereign responsibility to protect our borders. We have a responsibility to make sure we have a systematic law in place that deals with the immigration issues of our country. But I also believe, just as Ronald Reagan asked Mr. Gorbachev to take the wall down between East Germany and West Germany in order to end the cold war, there will come a time when, hopefully, this Senate is part of taking down this wall between Mexico and the United States.  Before I conclude, I yield to my friend from Illinois for a question.
