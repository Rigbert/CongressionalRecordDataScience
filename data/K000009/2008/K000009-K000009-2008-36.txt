But John took that background and he grew from it and he became something beyond his own heritage in a way, and he wanted to make America a better place.  Having seen some of what happened in industry run amuck, he believed in industry, but he knew it could be done in a better way and he set a different path for America. And his family has every right to feel blessed and gratified, as we do, for having known him. And Ohioans and every American really has a right to consider themselves very, very fortunate for having had a man like John Seiberling in our lives, if only for a time.  And I know that his family will miss him deeply. We certainly have missed him from the day that he left here, and we hope that the strength that he gave to all of us and to his family in life will comfort them now.  And we know that John Seiberling made his mark, and we feel very fortunate to have counted him among our most beloved colleagues.
