 President, so everyone knows what is happening, Senator Tester is going to be here in a minute to speak for several minutes. Senator Alexander has a few minutes remaining. At the end of that time, we will be moving to a vote on the underlying amendment, so I hope all Senators are close by the floor.  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Montana is in the Chamber and I ask him how much time he is going to use.  I believe the Senator from Montana will be using 5 minutes. Senator Alexander will be using a few. So a vote will be imminent.
