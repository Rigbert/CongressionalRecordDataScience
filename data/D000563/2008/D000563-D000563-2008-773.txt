President, I acknowledge that the Senator is correct that this modification of a mortgage on a primary residence would be a change in bankruptcy law. I ask the Senator from Texas, is he aware that in the 1980s we created chapter 12 bankruptcy for farms and created the opportunity for the bankruptcy court to modify mortgages on family homes and farms, and at the time the banking industry said the same thing about that change as they have about my amendment--that it would raise interest rates? Is the Senator aware of the fact that there was no significant increase in interest rates on farms as a result of the creation of chapter 12 bankruptcies?
