Chairman, I served actively on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years. I am still a member on leave. Never, in the 36 years that I have been here, have I seen an omnibus appropriation bill or a minibus appropriation bill brought to the floor before the August break.  Regular order is to bring each bill to the floor, debate each bill on its merit, have the opportunity to offer amendments, and debate the merits of the amendments and of that particular bill. However, the majority party has not done its job, and I do not hold accountable the members of the Appropriations Committee. I want to make that clear.  But, for whatever reasons, regular order has not been followed, and so each Member of the Congress of the United States is confronted with either voting for all of the bill with component parts, the Legislative bill, Energy and Water, MILCON-VA, Defense bill, that they may not like, but if they vote ``no,'' they will be accused of being against the security of the United States. That, my friends, is baloney.  In their pledge to America, Republicans said: ``We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.''  This belies that representation. The sponsors of this minibus package, Mr. Chair, claim it will make America more secure. I reject that argument.  Senior military leaders have said that the greatest long-term threat to our national security is the growing national debt and the impact of interest payments on the debt as they crowd out our ability to invest in defense and domestic priorities.                              {time}  1615  It is incumbent upon us, Mr. Chairman, to work together to pass a fiscally responsible budget agreement that lifts the sequester caps in a way consistent with the principle of parity between defense and nondefense spending.  Mr. Chairman, we were supposed to pass a budget on or before April 15. It is now July 26. We have passed no budget. There is no plan for overall spending. This, therefore, is a pig in a poke, and nobody on this House floor or in this country knows the ramifications of the passage of this bill on the eight domestic spending bills that remain unattended.  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
