Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 151) expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States should manage its public domain national forests to maximize the reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere among many other objectives and that the United States should serve as an example and as a world leader in actively managing its public domain national forests in a manner that substantially reduces the amount of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 151       Whereas carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, can be      removed from the atmosphere by trees through photosynthesis      and stored in wood;       Whereas releases of carbon dioxide can be prevented by the      use of wood products as substitutes for products whose      manufacture consumes fossil fuels and releases substantial      amounts of carbon dioxide; and       Whereas managing our forests by planting and growing our      forest resources will remove carbon dioxide from the      atmosphere: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the      United States--       (1) should manage its forests to maximize the reduction of      carbon dioxide in the atmosphere among many other objectives;      and       (2) should serve as an example and as a world leader in      managing its forest in a manner that substantially reduces      the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
