President, I want to call to your attention an editorial which was in yesterday morning's Washington Post by Charles Krauthammer.  I think he best characterizes where we are today in terms of our Nation's defense--in this editorial--more than anything I have read recently. He talks about the problems that we have in our defense system.  I think several of us have been disturbed that this administration has stripped our defenses down to the bone. We are operating now on a budget that is about what it was in 1980 when we could not afford spare parts. There are several of us who believe that we could not fight two regional wars right now. We could not fight the Persian Gulf war as we did.  This Nation has to rebuild its defense system. Charles Krauthammer states three incontrovertible facts.  The first is, America is coming home. He points out that we are bringing from overseas our bases back to the mainland of the United States. In 1960, we had 90 bases around the world. Today we have 17.  His second incontrovertible fact is that America cannot endure casualties. If you look at what is happening on CNN with the coverage on all of these humanitarian missions that are going on right now all over the world, we have more troops in more parts of the world right now on missions that have nothing to do with our Nation's security. We saw Captain O'Grady and how the entire Nation was watching him and hoping and praying for him. This is a concern that the entire Nation has; that we have a very low tolerance of casualties. Yet we look at Somalia. We had 18 Rangers that were killed there. And I have a great fear for what can happen in Bosnia.  The third fact is that America's next war will be a surprise. I think we all understand this. Certainly, Pearl Harbor was a surprise. The invasion of South Korea was a surprise. The Falklands war was a surprise. The next war will be a surprise, too.  To meet this criterion, what weapon, according to Charles Krauthammer, is the best one to do that? He says clearly it is to expand the B-2 bomber program--the B-2 bomber program--because, No. 1, it has the range; No. 2, it is invisible; and, No. 3, it is immediate. If you look at the Persian Gulf war, the F-117's, they had the invisible characteristics of a stealth fighter. Over 2 percent, I think, of the missions were flown by the F-117, and they got 40 percent of their targets.   So, Mr. President, I will conclude by saying that seven of the currently living former Secretaries of Defense agree with Charles Krauthammer that we need to expand the B-2 program, and I believe it, too.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this editorial by Charles Krauthammer be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, July 13, 1995]                    The B-2 and the ``Cheap Hawks''                        (By Charles Krauthammer)       We hear endless blather about how new and complicated the      post-Cold War world is. Hence the endless confusion about      what weapons to build, forces to deploy, contingency to      anticipate. But there are three simple, glaringly obvious      facts about this new era:       (1) America is coming home. The day of the overseas base is      over. In 1960, the United States had 90 major Air Force bases      overseas. Today, we have 17. Decolonization is one reason.      Newly emerging countries like the Philippines do not want the      kind of Big Brother domination that comes with facilities      like Clark Air Base and Subic Bay. The other reason has to do      with us: With the Soviets gone, we do not want the huge      expenses of maintaining a far-flung, global military      establishment.       (2) America cannot endure casualties. It is inconceivable      that the United States, or any other Western country, could      ever fight a war of attrition like Korea or Vietnam. One      reason is the CNN effect. TV brings home the reality of      battle with a graphic immediacy unprecedented in human      history. The other reason, as strategist Edward Luttwak has      pointed out, is demographic: Advanced industrial countries      have very small families, and small families are less willing      than the large families of the past to risk their only      children in combat.       (3) America's next war will be a surprise. Nothing new      here. Our last one was too. Who expected Saddam to invade      Kuwait? And even after he did, who really expected the United      States to send a half-million man expeditionary force to roll      him back? Then again who predicted Pearl Harbor, the invasion      of South Korea, the Falklands War?       What kind of weapon, then, is needed by a country that is      losing its foreign bases, is allergic to casualties and will      have little time to mobilize for tomorrow's unexpected      provocation?       Answer: A weapon that can be deployed at very long      distances from secure American bases, is invulnerable to      enemy counterattack and is deployable instantly. You would      want, in other words, the B-2 stealth bomber.       We have it. Yet, amazingly, Congress may be on the verge of      killing it. After more than $20 billion in development      costs--costs irrecoverable whether we build another B-2 or      not--the B-2 is facing a series of crucial votes in Congress      that could dismantle its assembly lines once and for all.       The B-2 is not a partisan project. Its development was      begun under Jimmy Carter. And, as an urgent letter to      President Clinton makes clear, it is today supported by seven      secretaries of defense representing every administration      going back to 1969.       They support it because it is the perfect weapon for the      post-Cold War world. It has a range of about 7,000 miles. It      can be launched instantly--no need to beg foreign dictators      for base rights; no need for weeks of advance warning,      mobilization and forward deployment of troops. And because it      is invisible to enemy detection, its two pilots are virtually      invulnerable.       This is especially important in view of the B-2's very high      cost, perhaps three-quarters to a billion dollars a copy. The      cost is, of course, what has turned swing Republican votes--     the so-called ``cheap hawks''--against the B-2.       But the dollar cost of a weapon is too narrow a calculation      of its utility. The more important calculation is cost in      American lives. The reasons are not sentimental but      practical. Weapons cheap in dollars but costly in lives are,      in the current and coming environment, literally useless: We      will not use them. A country that so values the life of every      Capt. O'Grady is a country that cannot keep blindly relying      on non-stealthy aircraft over enemy territory.       Stealth planes are not just invulnerable themselves.      Because they do not need escort, they spare the lives of the      pilots of the fighters and radar suppression planes that      ordinarily accompany bombers. Moreover, if the B-2 is killed,      we are stuck with our fleet of B-52's of 1950s origin.      According to the undersecretary of defense for acquisition,      the Clinton administration assumes the United States will      rely on B-52s until the year 2030--when they will be 65 years      old!       In the Persian Gulf War, the stealthy F-117 fighter flew      only 2 percent of the missions but hit 40 percent of the      targets. It was, in effect, about 30 times as productive as      non-stealthy planes. The F-117, however, has a short range      and thus must be deployed from forward bases. The B-2 can      take off from home. Moreover, the B-2 carries about eight      times the payload of the F-117. Which means that one B-2 can      strike, without escort and with impunity, as many targets as      vast fleets of conventional aircraft. Factor in these costs,      and the B-2 becomes cost-effective even in dollar terms.       The final truth of the post-Cold War world is that someday      someone is going to attack some safe haven we feel compelled      to defend, or invade a country whose security is important to      us, or build an underground nuclear bomb factory that      threatens to kill millions of Americans. We are going to want      a way to attack instantly, massively and invisibly. We have      the weapon to do it, a weapon that no one else has and that      no one can stop. Except a ``cheap hawk,'' shortsighted      Republican Congress.
