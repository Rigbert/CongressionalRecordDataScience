 Speaker, I am happy to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce), the ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services.  (Mr. LaFALCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. LaFALCE. Mr. Speaker, I find myself in agreement with much of what has been said by my friend the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter) and my friend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), so I rise in strong support of this 30-day extension of the Ex-Im Bank.  I think it is imperative that we continue the existence of Ex-Im Bank until no other country has the means of subsidizing their exports. Otherwise, we would be engaging in unilateral disarmament. We cannot do that. I do not foresee the day in the near future when we are going to have a multilateral agreement that ends all subsidies of exports.  So, this is really a necessity for survival. If we did not extend Ex-Im Bank, basically you would have to shut down its operations. That is just untenable.  Having said that, let me also say I share some of the concerns of my good friend, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), both with respect to procedure and with respect to substance. About 30 days ago when we had another 30-day extension, I said that it would be difficult for me to support another extension unless we had come to the floor or would be coming to the floor with the authorization bill.  I wish we had done it in the past 30 days, but we are doing it tomorrow. So that is good enough, we are doing it tomorrow. But also my assumption is, and I am supporting the 30-day extension on the assumption that the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) and others who have differences of opinion, who want to perfect the bill, will be given the opportunity to offer their amendments on the floor of the House so they can be voted up or down.  On the basis of that assumption, I can and do support the bill.
