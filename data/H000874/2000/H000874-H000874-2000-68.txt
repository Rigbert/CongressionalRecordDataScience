Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much. I appreciate the gentlewoman's remarks, and I believe her remarks were very cogent. I think it is a very significant fact that the six highest choices made by students in the District of Columbia who could go anywhere are historically black colleges, which speaks not only to the fulfillment of their mission, but to the quality of their work. So I thank her for her comments.  I yield to my very distinguished friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), a graduate of one of the most distinguished educational institutions in America that is also a historically black college, Morehouse College.
