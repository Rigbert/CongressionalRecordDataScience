Speaker, I am introducing legislation today, along with Congressman John Ensign, to create a demonstration program to waive, for selected diagnoses, the Medicare rule requiring a 3-day hospital stay before Medicare will cover services in a skilled nursing facility. There is growing evidence that, for selected diagnosis-related groups or [DRG's], a waiver could save money by allowing care in a less expensive setting.  The legislation would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to cover services in skilled nursing facilities for at least five DRG's that involve medical conditions that do not need inpatient care and that are not likely or are least likely to result in any net increase in Medicare expenditures. Over the course of time, the Secretary would be able to add to the list of DRG's for which the 3-day stay rule is waived.  The Secretary would monitor this demonstration program to determine the impact of the program on overall Medicare expenditures. If this experiment is successful, it will increase access to Medicare-covered services without an increase in costs.  I expect that, if the DRG's are carefully selected based on evidence of which medical conditions could be treated less expensively in skilled nursing facilities, there will be no increase in total Medicare expenditures and there might even be budget savings. However, in case that expectation is not met, the legislation includes explicit language to ensure budget neutrality.  If this demonstration program, as a whole, causes an increase in overall Medicare spending, payments to skilled nursing facilities will be reduced by a corresponding amount in the following year to make up for the losses. This provides a fail-safe mechanism, supported by the skilled nursing facility industry itself, to ensure that the measure does not cause new Federal outlays. Moreover, the Secretary would be authorized to remove DRG's from the waived list that result in an increase in overall Medicare spending.  If, as I hope, this demonstration program is successful and overall Medicare costs do not rise as a result of the 3-day stay waivers, the legislation directs the Secretary to actively consider adding other DRG's to the waiver list that could be added without increasing total Medicare costs.  While I do not expect Congress to move forward on this measure in the waning days of this legislative year, I believe this idea deserves careful consideration. I am introducing it now in the hope that we can lay the groundwork for this type of budget-neutral reform in the next Congress.                               H.R. 4244       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF 3-DAY PRIOR HOSPITALIZATION REQUIREMENT                    FOR COVERAGE OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITY                    SERVICES FOR CERTAIN DRGS.       (a) In General.--By not later than October 1, 1997, the      Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide for      coverage, under section 1812(f) of the Social Security Act,      of extended care services for individuals with a condition      that is classifiable within a diagnosis-related group      selected under subsection (b).       (b) Selection of Diagnosis-Related Groups.--For purposes of      subsection (a) and subject to subsections (c) and (d), the      Secretary--       (1) beginning with fiscal year 1998, shall select at least      5 diagnosis-related groups (as established for purposes of      section 1886(d)(4)(A) of the Social Security Act that--       (A) relate to conditions that do not require treatment      through receipt of inpatient hospital services, and       (B) are not likely (or are least likely) to result in any      net increased expenditures under title XVIII of such Act; and       (2) for subsequent fiscal years may select additional      diagnosis-related groups that meet the requirements of      subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1).       (c) Recovery of Excess Expenditures.--If the Secretary      determines that the application of this section in a fiscal      year has resulted in any increase in aggregate expenditures      under such title for the fiscal year above the amount of such      expenditures that would have occurred in the fiscal year if      this section did not apply (taking into account any      reductions in expenditures resulting from the elimination of      or a reduction in the length of hospitalization), the      Secretary--       (1) shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law,      provide for a reduction in the amounts otherwise payable      under part A of such title for post-hospital extended care      services in the following fiscal year by such proportion as      will reduce aggregate Federal expenditures in such fiscal      year under such part by the aggregate amount of such a      increase in the previous fiscal year, and       (2) may rescind the selection of any diagnosis-related      group if the application of this section with respect to such      group has resulted in such an increase in expenditures under      such title.       (d) Consideration of Additional Selections.--The Secretary      shall actively consider the selection of additional groups      under subsection (b)(2) if the Secretary determines that the      application of this section has resulted in a net reduction      in expenditures under such title.                          ____________________
