Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that today our amended version of S. 2292, the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004, is on the floor of the House for consideration. Senator Voinovich is to be commended for introducing and securing successful passage of S. 2292, as he is a tireless ally in our efforts to eradicate anti-Semitism. In support of his efforts, I introduced the House version, H.R. 4214, in April.  Realizing now is the time to act, Senator Voinovich, Congressman Lantos and myself have since discussed ways to further strengthen the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act. Working in concert, we amended the text to add mechanisms to improve and strengthen the ability of our government to combat the evil of anti-Semitism.  The amended version, Mr. Speaker, maintains the State Department report on global anti-Semitism envisioned by Senator Voinovich. This report will set a benchmark as to the individual records of countries around the globe. The report, due for release no later than November 15, 2004, will examine the number of acts of physical violence against Jews or vandalism of Jewish community institutions and government responses to such actions. In addition, the report will detail steps taken by governments to protect the religious freedoms of Jewish people and describe governmental efforts to promote anti-bias and tolerance education.  Recognizing the role of media in encouraging anti-Semitic acts, the amended version also adds coverage of propaganda in government and nongovernment media that attempt to incite acts of violence against Jews. The importance of this issue was hammered home by James Tisch, Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, at a Helsinki Commission hearing on governmental responses to anti-Semitism in the OSCE region. He said: ``[T]he Arab man in the street . . . doesn't stand a chance of being anything but [fiercely anti-Semitic], considering the barrage of hatred and venom about Jews to which he is constantly exposed. This river of lies flows from his leaders, his newspapers and his television set. The Arab media and the governments that sponsor and tolerate this flood of poison are to blame. This isn't about politics; it's about an ocean of hatred.''  Mr. Speaker, we must push all governments to ensure their media are not adding fuel to the fire of anti-Semitism. By including coverage of domestic media, we make the one time global report on anti-Semitism more complete by exposing the source of an enormous amount of anti-Semitic vitriol.  The amended version of S. 2292 is stronger in other ways, foremost by mandating the creation of the Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism in the State Department and creating the position of Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism. A point person specifically tasked with focusing on anti-Semitism will increase our ability to respond quickly and effectively when incidents arise. In addition, the Special Envoy can be double-hatted with another position, thereby giving the Department flexibility in its appointment. The office will also be involved in the drafting of the appropriate sections of the human rights and religious freedom reports. Considering anti-Semitism plagues all regions of the world, this special office will ensure that the United States resolutely denounces acts of anti-Semitism whenever and wherever they occur.  Concerning State Department reports, our amended version of S. 2292 will establish standards for the reporting on anti-Semitism when appropriate in the human rights and religious freedom reports. While our embassy staff labor tirelessly to ensure the human rights and religious freedom reports accurately cover the issue of anti-Semitism, I was concerned with the unevenness of reporting. The amendment will standardize coverage in the two reports, requiring the examination of: physical violence against Jews or vandalism of Jewish community institutions; propaganda in government and nongovernment media that attempt to incite acts of violence against Jews; governmental responses to violence or propaganda; governmental actions to enact and enforce laws relating to the protection of religious freedom of Jews; and governmental efforts to promote anti-bias and tolerance education.  By setting forth criteria for the Department, it will aid our embassies in more thoroughly covering the issue of anti-Semitism and ensure it receives the attention it deserves.  Again, I want to thank our leadership for making passage of this bill a priority. Their steadfast support, as well as the unwavering support from the Bush Administration, has greatly aided our efforts to fight anti-Semitism across the globe.  The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
