 President, let me take advantage of that time. I will take advantage of the opportunity to say, first of all, that all of these notices are already printed and ready to go. Do you want to throw that money away?  No. 2, it is only part of the story that there is a message going out to tell people they are going to get a check and to expect it. There is also a notice going out to 32 million people that they are not going to get a check, and that is a very important notice to go out, so that the IRS is not bothered by phone calls wondering whether or not they are going to get a check. I think it is very important that we do this right.  I ask for the defeat of the Schumer amendment and I yield the remainder of my time.
