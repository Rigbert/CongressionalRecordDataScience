Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume to remind those listening, though, that there is no law the gentleman just spoke about having to require the cooperation that says they may, that there is no law, because there is no law on the books. That is what I am trying to do, put a law on the books that gives the constitutional duty to the Congress, as it is the Congress's responsibility.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn].
