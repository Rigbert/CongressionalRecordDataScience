Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman, just land acquisition?  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I believe that is the text of the language. But it does not obviate the gentleman's point of the gentleman.  If in the State of Alaska, wherever this project is occurring, the local political subdivision most immediately under the State is other than who is trying to construct it, then the answer would be yes.  I would venture a guess, if their construct is anything like most other States, then the City of, say, Anchorage, they would be the political jurisdiction and would have the authority.
