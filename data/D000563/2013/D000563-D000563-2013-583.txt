President, today along with my colleague Senator Mark Kirk, I introduced a bill to name the United States Postal Service facility at 302 East Green Street in Champaign, Illinois, as the James R. Burgess Jr. Post Office Building.  I am proud to introduce this measure to honor Mr. Burgess, an accomplished Illinois war veteran and public servant. Mr. Burgess served his country honorably in World War II and after. At age 29, he led one of six companies in the 761st Tank Battalion, the first African-American armored unit to enter battle in World War II. The 761st served under General George Patton. After the war, he remained in the military, serving in Army intelligence. As part of his training, Mr. Burgess attended both Germanand Russian language school. He retired from the Army in 1962 with a ``top secret'' clearance.  After his military career, Mr. Burgess moved his wife and two sons to Champaign where he earned a law degree from the University of Illinois. After moving to Chicago for a time, the family eventually returned to Champaign where Mr. Burgess worked for the Champaign County State's Attorney. In 1972, he was elected to the post himself. He became the first and, to this day, the only African American elected to county-wide office in Champaign County.  In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Mr. Burgess to be United States Attorney for what was then the Eastern District of Illinois. He held that position until 1982. Mr. Burgess passed away in 1997.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to complete the effort long-undertaken by his loving son, Steve, and family to honor this worthy Illinoisan and patriotic American.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 796       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
