President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the town of Moscow, ME. Lying at the foothills of Maine's Western Mountains and on the banks of the mighty Kennebec River, Moscow was built with a spirit of determination and resilience that still guides the community today. This bicentennial is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  Moscow is a small town with a big history. In the fall of 1775, Colonel Benedict Arnold--before he became a traitor--led the newly formed Continental Army through the region on the ill-fated but valiant attempt to capture Quebec. While the first major military initiative of the Revolutionary War failed, it demonstrated the American resolve that would eventually bring independence. One of the oldest graves in Moscow's Union Cemetery is that of Joseph Kirk, one of the regiment's men, and Baker Cemetery is the final resting place of David Decker, a member of the Boston Tea Party.  After independence was won, settlement began when two great patriots--the financier William Bingham and General Henry Knox--joined together in the famous Bingham Purchase, the acquisition of 2 million acres of Maine wilderness. Shortly afterward, the first sawmill was built, the timber industry thrived, and the population boomed.  When the town was officially incorporated on January 30, 1816, the citizens chose the name of their new community with care, finally selecting Moscow to honor the people of the Russian city who repelled Napoleon's invasion in 1812 with great courage and sacrifice.  The first settlers were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy mills. The wealth produced by the land and, by hard work and determination, was invested in schools and churches to create a true community.  The industriousness of Moscow is demonstrated by two remarkable feats of engineering. In 1904, construction began on the Gulf Stream Trestle across Austin Stream to extend the Somerset Railroad in order to grow the logging and outdoor recreation industries. Seven hundred feet long and 125 feet high, the trestle was one of the largest structures to span a river in New England.  Although the trestle has been removed, the Wyman Dam remains one of the town's most outstanding features, supplying power to a large part of central Maine. Replacing a natural course of rapids 140 feet high on the Kennebec River, the construction of the dam began in 1928, and the dam was in operation just 2 years later. This massive project required a labor force of 2,400 workers, whose families had to be housed, so a settlement of nearly 300 homes was built, along with a school for the children. In addition to electricity, the project created beautiful Wyman Lake, one of Maine's largest lakes and a favorite recreation destination.  Moscow has always been a town of involved citizens, working hard and working together. The planning and volunteerism that have gone into this yearlong bicentennial celebration confirm that this spirit grows only stronger. Thanks to those who came before, Moscow has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
