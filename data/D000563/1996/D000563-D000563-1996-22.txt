Chairman, I would like a clarification on that, because under the existing language of the bill, the courts are only restricted in granting these applications for rearming felons for three specific categories. With my amendment we would eliminate all convicted felons in their right to be rearmed; their right to have another firearm.  I would say to the gentleman, from the Chair's ruling, that that gives to the courts a much clearer mandate to eliminate the Al Capone's and John Gotti's and those who did not commit those three specific crimes.
