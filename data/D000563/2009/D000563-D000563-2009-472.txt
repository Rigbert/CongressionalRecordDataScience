They have now resisted us for 21 days to extend unemployment benefits to these people across America. I am sure in each of our States, as I found in Illinois, many of these unemployed people have also lost their health insurance as a result of losing their jobs.  I would like to ask either or both of the Senators to comment on what this health care reform proposal that we are talking about would do for a person who has either lost a job or is in a low-income category; someone who is scraping by with a low-wage job, hoping for something better, or maybe that is the best they can come up with.  Would either of the Senators like to respond as to what this legislation, our health care reform bill, is proposing?
