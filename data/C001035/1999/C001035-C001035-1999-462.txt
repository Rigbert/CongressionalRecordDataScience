President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination on the Executive Calendar, No. 36.  I finally ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements relating to the nomination be printed at the appropriate place in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then return to legislative session.
