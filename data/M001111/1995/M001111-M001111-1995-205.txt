 President, I was necessarily absent last evening, attending the high school graduation of my son, Randy.  I would have voted against the Smith amendment lifting penalties against States for not having helmet or seat belt laws.  This issue for me, comes down to the simple question of safety. An issue that is bipartisan and noncontroversial. In fact, a recent comprehensive consume survey shows that 82 percent of Americans support a strong Federal role in safety.  How can we then support a step backward against the giant gains we have made in highway accident and injury prevention. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, from 1983 to 1993, safety belts saved more than 40,000 lives and prevented $88 billion in economic losses by reducing health care costs and productivity losses. In 1993 alone, motorcycle helmet laws in 25 States saved 515 lives, prevented 2,035 moderate to serious injuries, and saved $513 million in economic losses.  As a former State senator, I understand State's rights, but let us legislate on the side of safety and human life.
