Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I support the McNulty resolution to disapprove the extension of trade waiver authority with Vietnam.  Mr. Speaker, last year I supported the exact opposite position, in hopes that there would be signs in Vietnam that, in fact, that government would move toward a more open society. There are no signs of that, and political repression continues. Talk to people who live here in the United States who have relatives in Vietnam; many live in the Washington area.  What was even more troubling to me and the reason for this change in my own position, and I am not going to use the person's name, but one of the two most important Americans in charge of shaping U.S. policy toward Vietnam was speaking with me the other day; and I said, what are you going to do about the treatment of workers in Vietnam under this trade authority to give them dignity, whether they are working for a U.S.-based company or some other multinational working over there? And this American said to me, oh, that is not a trade issue, that is probably more cultural. That offended me so much.  Mr. Speaker, I think our government is on the wrong song sheet here. We ought to be for developing a civil society in Vietnam, beginning with humanitarian linkages, as our community is trying to do by helping build schools and clinics. We ought to be having educational exchanges to teach people something about democracy-building. We ought to have family reunification. We ought to have arts and cultural exchanges; but by golly, when top-ranking people from our own government fail to see that the basis of Jackson-Vanik is that political repression is wrong and this Nation ought to stand up for liberty at every cost, we ought to bring back those who are missing in action and call the government of Vietnam to task on that.  But we need to support the McNulty resolution and deny the additional extension, because it is in freedom's interests here and abroad.
