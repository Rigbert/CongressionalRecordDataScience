President, I was going to speak first, but I understand the senior Senator from New York, as happens with so many of us, is supposed to be in two places at once. While he is capable of many good things, that is one thing he has not figured out how to do yet.  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York. Once he has finished, I will then speak and answer some of the things that have been said on the other side.
