President, last night the Senate confirmed two more Federal judicial nominees of President Bush: Judge Louis Guirola to the Southern District of Mississippi and Neil Wake to the District of Arizona. With these confirmations, the Senate has now confirmed 173 judicial nominees of this President. That is more than during the entire four years of the first term of President Reagan, from 1981 through 1984, and just two fewer than were confirmed in all 4 years of President Clinton's second term in office from 1997 through 2000. We have reduced the number of vacancies in the Federal courts to 43, the lowest number in more than 13 years.  These two confirmations bring to four the number of judicial nominees confirmed in the first few weeks in session this year. The American people should remember that the Republican Senate leadership in 1996 allowed only 17 judicial nominees of President Clinton to be confirmed all year. I remain confident that with the cooperation of the administration, the Senate this year will be able to match the total from that Presidential election year, the last year of President Clinton's first term. We are well ahead of the pace Republicans achieved in 1996. The four judges confirmed so far this year is four more than were confirmed on this date in 1996.  The two nominees confirmed last night had their hearings this year but two others, J. Leon Holmes and Judge Dora Irizarry, had hearings last year, were reported by the Judiciary Committee last year, and still have not been scheduled for a vote by the Republican leadership. Democrats have been ready to debate and vote on these nominees for many months. They have generated some controversy and will need to be debated before the vote, but there is no Democratic ``hold'' on either nomination of which I am aware and no Democratic objection to a full and fair debate on each as far as I know.                          ____________________
