Mr. Speaker, first let me say, and I think it is unfortunate and unhelpful when my good friend, the gentlewoman from California refers to prolifers as the far right--in this case me.  Let me just say that I am conservative and very proud of it, but I take a back seat to no one on human rights. Ihave been in this body for 18 years. I have been all over the world, very often with my good friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and other committed leaders in human rights.  I have chaired more hearings in my subcommittee--international operations and human rights that have ever been held ever on human rights. I have been to Asia, Africa, Eastern and Central Europe, the Middle East, Central and South America--all on behalf of human rights. Gulag labor abuse and exploitation of child workers. We have worked on religious freedom. When it comes to child survival, going back to the early 1980s, I led the effort and offered amendment after amendment on this floor and in committee to beef up the child survival account.  As a matter of fact when Reagan's Administration wanted to zero out the $25 million child survival account, I put $50 million and reauthorized that account to continue immunization, oral rehydration, breast feeding, and growth monitoring. I take a back seat to no one on humanitarianism and on human rights. If that is ``far right,'' I accept the label, but I think the gentlelady's use of the term is to engender ridicule and disgust. Moreover, name calling undermines the caliber of debate and does grave injury to the comity of the House when people make such reference.
