Now, it is not certain that the current H5N1 bird flu is going to become a human-to-human type pandemic, but all the experts say we are overdue for a pandemic in the United States so it is prudent that we look at our preparedness or lack thereof.  Recently, in the Homeland Security Committee on which I serve, as does the gentleman in the chair, we held a hearing called ``Are We Ready: Implementing The National Strategy For Pandemic Influenza.'' There were a number of disturbing things that came out during that hearing, and one in particular has been highlighted a number of times by GAO reports and recently by press reports. I asked some questions regarding that during the hearing, and that is the lack of ventilators in the United States.  Basically, experts say that medical professionals will be triaging ventilators because we have such a severe shortage of ventilators in this country. It is the one way to help take someone through an acute phase of the H5N1 virus. The very few survivors that are known have been on ventilators and received intensive antiviral drugs and others. So were this to be a pandemic, as opposed to a few isolated cases, we are woefully short.  In fact, the estimates are that we would be 637,500 ventilators short. That is, people would be dying unnecessarily because they wouldn't be able to get near a ventilator, and that number assumes that none of the existing ventilators are being used for any other purpose in the United States.  Now, when I raised this issue with Dr. John Agwunobi, who is the Assistant Secretary For Health, he is a recent Bush appointee, his expertise was being Health and Human Services Director for President Bush's brother in Florida, so he brings tremendous expertise to this job and great professionalism, as do many of the political appointees we have seen with this administration, but when I asked Dr. Agwunobi about the ventilator shortage, he said, well, that is not our job.  I said, well, what about the national stockpile? He said, oh, yeah, we'll get some for the national stockpile. How many? Oh, well, 4,000 or 5,000 ventilators. Remember, we need another 640,000 or so in the case of a pandemic.  So I said, well, whose duty do you think it is to enhance the stockpile? How are we going to enhance the stockpile? He says, oh, no, that is the job of the States and the hospitals. He said, in fact, you know, hospitals or some county somewhere might not build a swimming pool; instead, they should be investigating in preparedness for pandemics.  Well, he doesn't live in the world that most of us live in. My counties are pretty short of money for essentials. They are not out building swimming pools. We don't have public hospitals in my State. The other hospitals that are there can't get reimbursed. You can't work it into a Medicare reimbursement schedule to buy a bunch of ventilators to stockpile for a pandemic. They have to justify the current clientele needing the ventilators, otherwise they are not allowed to put that into their rate base.  So I raised these issues with Dr. Agwunobi, and he just basically blew it off. He is really not too concerned. Now, this is the Assistant Secretary For Health, political appointee of George Bush. He started to kind of remind me of another famous appointee, Michael Brown. But this time it is before the fact. We need action to prepare for a pandemic.  I am writing to the Appropriations Committee recommending that they deal with this in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriation bill; that we mandate some purchases for the national stockpile, minimally of ventilators. We should also be doing a much better job of stockpiling the antivirals; and we should also be, with more urgency, instead of waiting for the private sector or the pharmaceutical companies, who aren't much interested in vaccines or other things they can't make a bunch of money on, to give us some new installed capacity in this country, modern capacity, to develop vaccines. I mean, this pandemic will come in waves. And between the waves, if it goes on for 6 months or a year, you could develop and deploy vaccines once the specifics are known. Unfortunately, there are no modern facilities in the United States of America capable of manufacturing vaccines.  But, again, Dr. Agwunobi and the Bush appointees don't look at this as a particular problem. We need to better prepare to protect the American people for the possibility of a flu pandemic.                          ____________________[Pages H3708-H3709]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS
