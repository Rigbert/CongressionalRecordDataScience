GRAHAM. As I understand it, the problem with Judge Southwick is that it appears there has been some effort to try to get the Mississippi Senators to nominate someone else. And there has been the suggestion he could be a district judge but we want someone else to be the court of appeals nominee. I do not think that is a process we should engage in. So there are a lot of politics behind this nomination. We should not allow that to happen. We should not basically hold hostage the ability of the Senators from Mississippi and the President to put someone forward. If we think they are not qualified, vote them down. But playing politics, trying to change the nominating process, I do not think is kosher. And I think that is what is going on.
