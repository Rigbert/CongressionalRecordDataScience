Congress first established a National Day of Prayer in 1952, and in 1988 set the first Thursday in May as the day for Presidents to issue proclamations asking Americans to pray. From its founding, America has had a rich heritage of affirming religious expression in the lives of its citizens. In fact, many of our nation's leaders make decisions based on a set of moral values, often rooted in their religions or spiritual beliefs. Commander-in-Chief George Washington regularly issued orders for military troops to attend and participate in religious gatherings.  In the midst of the recent health care debate in Congress, I attended Sunday Service at the Capitol. I was particularly moved by the quote that was shared during the service, which was originally given by Chaplain Peter Marshall on the floor of the Senate 63 years ago: ``Save us from accepting a little of what we know to be wrong in order to get a little of what we imagine to be right. Help us to stand up for the inalienable rights of mankind and the principles of democratic government consistently and with courage, knowing that Thy power and Thy blessing will be upon us only when we are in the right. May we so speak, and vote, and live, as to merit Thy blessing. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.''  I found this particularly poignant as I prepared to cast my vote on the health care reform bill. One of many issues within this bill was the role of the federal government in supporting abortion services. I believe federal support for elective abortions is morally wrong, and I know many of my colleagues share similar opinions. Chaplain Marshall's words of caution from so many years ago offered me guidance as I cast my vote against the legislation.  Madam Speaker, the National Day of Prayer continues to stand as a wonderful representation of the religious and spiritual heritage of this great nation. Today I urge Americans to reflect on the significance of prayer in their lives and it is my hope that Americans will always observe the National Day of Prayer with reverence and reflection.                          ____________________
