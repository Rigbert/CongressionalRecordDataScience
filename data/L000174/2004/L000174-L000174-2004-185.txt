President, I want to address a recent court decision that has exposed America's e-mails to snooping and invasive practices. The 2-to-1 decision by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in a case called United States v. Councilman has dealt a serious blow to online privacy. The majority--both, Republican-appointed judges--effectively concluded that it was permissible for an Internet Service Provider to comb through its customers' emails for corporate gain. If allowed to stand, this decision threatens to eviscerate Congress's careful efforts to ensure that privacy is protected in the modern information age.  The indictment in Councilman charged the defendant ISP with violating the Federal Wiretap Act by systematically intercepting, copying, and then reading its customers' incoming emails to learn about its competitors and gain a commercial advantage. This is precisely the type of behavior that Congress wanted to prohibit when it updated the Wiretap Act in 1986, as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), to prohibit unauthorized interceptions of electronic communications. Congress's goal was to ensure that Americans enjoyed the same amount of privacy in their online communications as they did in the offline world. Just as eavesdroppers were not allowed to tap phones or plant ``bugs'' in order to listen in on our private conversations, we wanted to ensure that unauthorized eyes were not peering indiscriminately into our electronic communications.  ECPA was a careful, bipartisan and long-planned effort to protect electronic communications in two forms--from real-time monitoring or interception as they were being delivered, and from searches when they were stored in record systems. We recognized these as different functions and set rules for each based on the relevant privacy expectations and threats to privacy implicated by the different forms of surveillance.  The Councilman decision turned this distinction on its head. Functionally, the ISP in this case was intercepting emails as they were being delivered, yet the majority ruled that the relevant rules were those pertaining to stored communications, which do not apply to ISPs. The majority rejected the Government's argument that anintercept occurs--and the Wiretap Act applies--when an email is acquired contemporaneously with its transmission, regardless of whether the transmission may have been in electronic storage for milliseconds at the time of the acquisition. As the dissenting judge found, the Government's interpretation of the Wiretap Act is consistent with Congressional intent and with the realities of electronic communication systems. I agree, and urge the Justice Department to continue to press this position in the courts. The Department has been a powerful proponent of privacy rights in this case, and I commend its efforts.  I also will be taking a close look at possible changes to the law to ensure that there is no room to skirt the wiretap provisions and engage in the type of privacy violation at issue in the Councilman case. We have an obligation to ensure that our laws keep up with technology, and it may be that advances in communications warrant change. It is imperative that we continue to safeguard privacy adequately in our modern information age.  In a world where Americans are already inundated with targeted mass marketing and mailings, the Councilman decision opens the door to even more invasive activity. With this kind of precedent, ISPs need not offer free services in exchange for reduced online privacy. They could simply snoop in secret, and their unsuspecting customers would never know.  The Councilman decision also opens the door to Government over-reaching. For practical reasons, surveillance devices are often installed at the point of millisecond-long temporary storage prior to an e-mail's arrival at its final destination. To date, law enforcement agencies have treated this as what it is--an interception--and have sought appropriate wiretap approval. But this decision allows law enforcement agents to potentially skip the rigors of the wiretap laws, and perhaps could unleash unrestrained use of search programs like Carnivore. This outcome belies the realities of electronic communications in today's society, undercuts Congress' intent, and is inconsistent with the current approach to such communications in law enforcement practice.  The Councilman decision creates an instant and enormous gap in privacy protection for email communications, and we need to address it swiftly and responsibly. I urge my colleagues to make this a top priority as we finish up the session. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record four recent editorials and articles on this issue.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, July 2, 2004]                         Derail E-Mail Snooping       Imagine that your friendly local mail carrier, before      delivering a letter for you, decides to steam it open and      read its contents. An outrageous and illegal infringement on      your privacy, obviously. But a Federal appeals court in      Boston has just permitted an Internet service provider to      engage in exactly this kind of snooping when the message is      sent in cyberspace rather than by snail mail. This ruling is      an unnecessarily cramped parsing of a law that Congress meant      to guard, not eviscerate, the privacy of communications. The      Justice Department, whose prosecution of the ISP executive      was thrown out by the appeals court, should seek a review of      the ruling. If that doesn't work--if the Federal wiretapping      law has been outpaced by the technology it was supposed to      regulate--Congress should quickly step in to fix the glitch.       The wiretapping law makes it a crime to intentionally      intercept ``any wire, oral, or electronic communication.''      This language dates to 1986, when e-mail was at an embryonic      stage but Congress, in an effort to account for and      anticipate that and other technological changes, enacted the      Electronic Communications Privacy Act.       The appeals court, however, ruled that opening and reading      e-mails isn't covered by the wiretapping law because the      messages weren't actually intercepted, as the law defines      that term, but were, rather, in ``electronic storage'' and      therefore covered by another, looser law. That finding stems      from the peculiar nature of e-mail transmission, in which      messages are briefly stored as they're transmitted from      computer to computer. As the court itself acknowledged, that      would leave little privacy for e-mail: ``It may well be that      the protections of the Wiretap Act have been eviscerated as      technology advances.''       In practcal terms, the implications of the ruling are      perhaps more troubling for the restraints it lifts on law      enforcement than for the theoretical leeway it gives service      providers to copy and read e-mails. The facts of the case      were unusual: A small online company that sold out-of-print      books and also provided free e-mail service wanted to peek at      Amazon.com's sales strategy and copied all of Amazon's      messages to the smaller company's customers. Mainstream ISPs      have policies that eschew such spying, and the customer      backlash that would ensure if they engaged in similar      practices would probably deter them from doing so. But the      ruling highlights the need for stringent privacy policies in      which customers give clear--and informed--consent.       Of more concern, the case could make it far easier for law      enforcement agents to engage in real-time monitoring of e-     mail and similar traffic, like instant messaging, without      complying with the strict rules applied to wiretaps. Under      this reading of the law, agents would still need to show      probable cause to obtain search warrants from a judge. But      they wouldn't have to hew to the more exacting requirements      of the wiretap law.       E-mail has become too ubiquitous, too central a facet of      modern life, for this ruling to stand.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, July 2, 2004]                          Intercepting E-Mail       When you click on ``send'' to deliver that e-mail note to      your lover, mother or boss, you realize that you are not      communicating directly with that person. As you well know,      you have stored the e-mail on the computer of your Internet      service provider, which, as you also know, may read, copy and      use the note for its own purposes before sending it on.       What, you didn't know all this? Sounds ludicrous? We would      have thought so, too, but a Federal appeals court recently      ruled that companies providing e-mail services could read      clients' e-mail notes and use them as they wish. Part of its      rationale was that none of this would shock you because you      have never expected much online privacy.       Count us among the shocked. The decision, on a 2-to-1 vote      by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the      First Circuit in Massachusetts, sets up a frightening      precedent, one that must be reversed by the courts, if not      the Congress. It's true that people are aware of some limits      on online privacy, particularly in the workplace. But the      notion that a company like America Online, essentially a      common carrier, has the right to read private e-mail is      ludicrous.       All major I.S.P.s, including AOL, say they have no interest      in doing that and have privacy policies against it. The case      before the First Circuit involved a small online bookseller,      no longer in business, that also provided e-mail service. To      learn about the competition, the company copied and reviewed      all e-mail sent from Amazon.com to its e-mail users. One of      its executives was indicted on an illegal-wiretapping charge.       Both the trial and appeals courts ruled that the Federal      wiretap law, which makes it a crime to intercept any ``wire,      oral or electronic communication,'' did not apply because      there had been no actual interception. Technically speaking,      the judges held, the bookseller had simply copied e-mail      notes stored on its servers, and different laws apply to the      protection of stored communications.       These laws were drafted before e-mail emerged as a form of      mass communication, so there is some ambiguity in how to      apply them. But as the dissenting judge on the appellate      panel noted, his two colleagues interpreted the wiretap      statute far too narrowly. What's more, their analysis was      predicated on the bizarre notion that our e-mail notes are      not in transit once we send them, but in storage with an      intermediary. The same logic would suggest that the postal      service can read your letters while they are in ``storage.''       Americans' right to privacy will be seriously eroded if e-     mail is not protected by wiretap laws. The implications of      this erosion extend beyond the commercial realm. The      government will also find it easier to read your e-mail if it      does not have to get a wiretap order to do so. Congress ought      to update the law to make it clear that e-mail is entitled to      the same protection as a phone call.                                  ____                     Court Creates Snoopers' Heaven                             (By Kim Zetter)        It was a little court case, but its impact on e-mail users      could be huge.        Last week a Federal appeals court in Massachusetts ruled      that an e-mail provider did not break the law when he copied      and read e-mail messages sent to customers through his      server.        Upholding a lower-court decision that the provider did not      violate the Wiretap Act, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of      Appeals set a precedent for e-mail service providers to      legally read e-mail that passes through a network.        The court ruled (PDF) that because the provider copied and      read the mail after it was in the company's computer system,      the provider did not intercept the mail in transit and,      therefore, did not violate the Wiretap Act.        It's a decision that could have far-reaching effects on      the privacy of digital communications, including stored      voicemail messages.        In 1998, Bradford C. Councilman was the vice president of      Interloc, a company selling rare and out-of-print books that      offered book-dealer customers e-mail accounts     through its Web site. Unknown to those customers, Councilman      had engineers write and install code on the company network      that would copy any e-mail sent to customers from Amazon.com,      a competitor in the rare-books field.        Although Councilman did not prevent customers from      receiving their e-mail, he read thousands of copied messages      to discover what books customers were seeking and gain a      commercial advantage over Amazon. Interloc was later bought      by Alibris, which was unaware that Councilman had installed      the code on the system.        Councilman wasn't caught because customers complained      about his actions; a tip about another, unrelated issue led      authorities to discover what he had done.        But just what had Councilman done that was so bad?        Everyone knows that e-mail is an insecure form of      communication. Like a postcard, unencrypted correspondence      sent over the Internet is open to snooping by anyone.       Additionally, companies have the right to read their      employees' e-mail, since the companies own the computer      systems through which the correspondence passes, and      employees send the mail on company time. And ISPs scan e-mail      for viruses and spam all the time, before delivering the mail      to the provider's customers.       But there is an expectation that service providers will      access communications only with permission from customers, or      when they need to do so to maintain their network. In fact,      the Wiretap Act states that a provider shall not ``intercept,      disclose, or use'' communication passing through its network      ``except for mechanical or service quality control checks.''       In April, Google launched an e-mail program called Gmail      that gives customers 1 GB of e-mail storage in exchange for      letting Google's computers scan the content of incoming e-     mails to seed them with related text ads. Gmail customers      agree to let a computer read their e-mail.       In contrast, Councilman personally read customers' messages      to undermine his competitors' business. He did no without      customers' permission and with the knowledge that if his      customers found out, his company would likely lose their      business.       And yet the court found him innocent of violating the      specific law under which authorities charged him.       The court ruled that because the mail was already on      Councilman's computer network when he accessed it, he didn't      intercept it in transit and therefore was not guilty under      the Wiretap Act. The court said the mail was in storage at      that point and, therefore, was governed under the Stored      Communications Act.       In a similar case in 1991, the U.S. Secret Service seized      three computers belonging to a company called Steve Jackson      Games. The company, in addition to producing fantasy books      and games, hosted an online bulletin board for gamers to      communicate with one another. An employee of the company was      under suspicion for activities conducted outside work, but      the Secret Service confiscated his employer's computers as      well. The Secret Service accessed, read and deleted 162 e-     mail messages that were stored on the computers used for the      bulletin board.       In a suit filed by the game company against the Secret      Service, a federal district court found that while the Secret      Service agents did not intercept the e-mail, and thus violate      the Wiretap Act, they did violate the Stored Communications      Act.       Pete Kennedy, the lawyer from the Texas-based firm that      litigated the case, called the decision ``a solid first step      toward recognizing that computer communications should be as      well-protected as telephone communications.''       The Stored Communications Act, along with the Wiretap Act,      is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which      protects electronic, oral and wire communications.       But because Councilman was charged under the Wiretap Act      and not the Stored Communications Act, the court had to rule      in his favor. But even if prosecutors had wanted to charge      him under the Stored Communications Act, they could not have      done so, since service providers are exempted under the Act.       What this means is that before the Councilman case, ISPs      that read their customers' mail without permission could only      have been prosecuted under the Wiretap Act. But now the      Councilman case eliminates that possibility as well.       The problem with interpreting e-mail on an ISP's server as      stored communication is that it opens the possibility for e-     mail even outside the ISP to be viewed as stored e-mail.       At many points during its path from sender to recipient, e-     mail passes through a number of computer systems and routers      that temporarily store it in RAM while the system determines      the next point to send it on the delivery route. Under the      court's definition, an ISP could access, copy and read the      mail at any of these points. Anyone who is not exempt under      the Stored Communications Act, however, could still be      charged under that law, though penalties for violating this      law are less severe than penalties for violating the Wiretap      Act.       Last week's ruling means that e-mail has fewer protections      than phone conversations and postal mail. Granting e-mail      providers the ability to read e-mail is equivalent to      granting postal workers the right to open and read any mail      while it's at a post office for sorting, but not while it's      in transit between post offices or being hand-delivered to a      recipient's home or business.       The ruling also has repercussions for voicemail messages,      as long as certain provisions in the Patriot Act remain law.       Before the Patriot Act, the legal definition of wire      communication included voicemail messages. This meant that      authorities had to obtain a wiretap order to access voicemail      messages or face charges of illegal interception under the      Wiretap Act. Under the Patriot Act, however, the definition      of wire communication changed. Voicemail messages are now      considered stored communication, like e-mail. As a result,      law enforcement authorities need only a search warrant to      access voicemail messages, a much easier process than      obtaining a wiretap order.       The provision in the Patriot Act that changed this is set      to sunset in December 2005, but if the current administration      has its way, the law will be renewed.       The changes in the Patriot Act, combined with the decision      in the Councilman case, also mean that a phone company could      now access voicemail messages without customers' permission      and not be charged with intercepting the messages under the      Wiretap Act. They also would not be charged under the Stored      Communications Act, since they are exempt from this statute.       If all of this is hard to follow, it's just as confusing to      the people who make their living interpreting the law.       ``This is one of the most complex and convoluted areas of      the law that you will run across,'' said Lee Tien, senior      staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ``The      statutes themselves are not models of clarity. Even for the      judges it's complicated, and then, on top of the statutes,      you add the changing technology.''       In the end, in the absence of laws to preserve privacy, the      best solution for e-mail users to protect their privacy is to      use encryption. But until encryption for voicemail messages      becomes common, you'll have to settle for talking in tongues.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, July 6, 2004]          You've Got Mail (and Court Says Others Can Read It)                           (By Saul Hansell)       When everything is working right, an e-mail message appears      to zip instantenously from the sender to the recipient's      inbox. But in reality, most messages make several momentary      stops as they are processed by various computers en route to      their destination.       Those short stops may make no difference to the users, but      they make an enormous difference to the privacy that e-mail      is accorded under federal law.       Last week a Federal appeals court in Boston ruled that      federal wiretap laws do not apply to e-mail messages if they      are stored, even for a millisecond, on the computers of the      Internet providers that process them--meaning that it can be      legal for the government or others to read such messages      without a court order.       The ruling was a surprise to many people, because in 1986      Congress specifically amended the wiretap laws to incorporate      new technologies like e-mail. Some argue that the ruling's      implications could affect emerging applications like      Internet-based phone calls and Gmail Google's new e-mail      service, which shows advertising based on the content of a      subscriber's e-mail messages.       ``The court has eviscerated the protections that Congress      established back in the 1980's,'' said Marc Rotenberg, the      executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information      Center, a civil liberties group.       But other experts argue that the Boston case will have      little practical effect. The outcry, said Stuart Baker, a      privacy lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, is      ``much ado about nothing.''       Mr. Baker pointed out that even under the broadest      interpretation of the law, Congress made it easier for      prosecutors and lawyers in civil cases to read other people's      e-mail messages than to listen to their phone calls. The      wiretap law--which requires prosecutors to prove their need      for a wiretap and forbids civil litigants from ever using      them--applies to e-mail messages only when they are in      transit.       But in a 1986 law, Congress created a second category,      called stored communication, for messages that had been      delivered to recipients' inboxes but not yet read. That law,      the Stored Communications Act, grants significant protection      to e-mail messages, but does not go as far as the wiretap      law: it lets prosecutors have access to stored messages with      a search warrant, while imposing stricter requirements on      parties in civil suits.       Interestingly, messages that have been read but remain on      the Internet provider's computer system have very little      protection. Prosecutors can typically gain access to an      opened e-mail message with a simple subpoena rather than a      search warrant. Similarly, lawyers in civil cases, including      divorces, can subpoena opened e-mail messages.       The case in Boston involved an online bookseller, now      called Alibris. In 1998, the company offered e-mail accounts      to book dealers and, hoping to gain market advantage,      secretly copied messages they received from Amazon.com. In      1999, Alibris and one employee pleaded guilty to criminal      wiretapping charges.        But a supervisor, Bradford C. Councilman, fought the      charges, saying he did not know     about the scheme. He also moved to have the case dismissed on      the ground that the wiretapping law did not apply. He argued      that because the messages had been on the hard drive of      Alibris's computer while they were being processed for      delivery, they counted as stored communication. The wiretap      law bans a company from monitoring the communications of its      customers, except in a few cases. But it does not ban a      company from reading customers' stored communications.        ``Congress recognized that any time you store      communication, there is an inherent loss of privacy,'' said      Mr. Councilman's lawyer, Andrew Good of Good & Cormier in      Boston.        In 2003, a Federal district court in Boston agreed with      Mr. Councilman's interpretation of the wiretap law and      dismissed the case. Last week, the First Circuit Court of      Appeals, in a 2-to-1 decision, affirmed that decision.        Because most major Internet providers have explicit      policies against reading their customers' e-mail messages,      the ruling would seem to have little effect on most people.        But this year Google is testing a service called Gmail,      which electronically scans the content of the e-mail messages      its customers receive and then displays related ads. Privacy      groups have argued that the service is intrusive, and some      have claimed it violates wiretap laws. The Councilman      decision, if it stands, could undercut that argument.        Federal prosecutors, who often argue that wiretap      restrictions do not apply in government investigations, were      in the somewhat surprising position of arguing that those      same laws should apply to Mr. Councilman's conduct. A      spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Boston      said the department had not decided whether to appeal.        Mr. Baker said that another Federal appeals court ruling,      in San Francisco, is already making it hard for prosecutors      to retrieve e-mail that has been read and remains on an      Internet provider's system.        In that case, Theofel v. Farey-Jones, a small Internet      provider responded to a subpoena by giving a lawyer copies of      339 e-mail messages received by two of its customers.        The customers claimed the subpoena was so broad it      violated the wiretap and stored communication laws. A      district court agreed the subpoenas were too broad, but ruled      they were within the law. The plaintiffs appealed, and the      Justice Department filed a friend of the court brief arguing      that the Stored Communications Act should not apply.        In February, the appeals court ruled that e-mail stored on      the computer server of an Internet provider is indeed covered      by the Stored Communications Act, even after it has been      read. The court noted that the act refers both to messages      before they are delivered and to backup copies kept by the      Internet provider. ``An obvious purpose for storing a message      on an I.S.P.'s server after delivery,'' the court wrote, ``is      to provide a second copy of the message in the event that the      user needs to download it again--if, for example, the message      is accidentally erased from the user's own computer.''        Calling e-mail ``stored communication'' does not      necessarily reduce privacy protections for most e-mail users.      While the Councilman ruling would limit the applicability of      wiretap laws to e-mail, it appears to apply to a very small      number of potential cases. The Theofel decision, by contrast,      by defining more e-mail as ``stored communications,'' is      restricting access to e-mail in a wide range of cases in the      Ninth Circuit, and could have a far greater effect on privacy      of courts in the rest of the country follow that ruling.                          ____________________
