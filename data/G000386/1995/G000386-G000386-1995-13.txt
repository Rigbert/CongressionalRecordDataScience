  Mr. President, I would like some assurances from the chairman and ranking minority member that they will work with us in developing an acceptable approach to our request.  Our purpose is simple.  We want an independent review of the CIA's unspent balances.  Are they being maintained and controlled according to law?  But how do we do that?  We need the committee's advice and assistance.  We have been told, in news reports, that CIA Director John Deutch is launching his own investigation to review the NRO's ``deliberately obscure fiscal practices.''  That is fine and dandy.  But that's not an independent review.  I hope the committee will work with us to find a way to conduct an independent review of the CIA's unspent balances.  The taxpayers of this country have a right to know that their money is being spent according to law.  Mr. President, I would also like to ask the committee's leadership these three questions:  First, could the committee conduct an examination of the CIA's appropriations accounts to determine whether they are maintained and controlled as required by law?  Second, could the committee do the job if assisted by knowledgeable personnel from the DOD IG's office and the GAO?  Third, could the DOD IG do the job?  I just hope my two colleagues help us get to the bottom of sense things. I know you have the same concerns I do. But I would like to move forward with this, to make sure we are not--my point is, we are not relying just upon internal CIA investigations to make sure this does not happen. We ought to have some sort of independent, outside group, make sure that the job is being done and done correctly.  I yield the floor.
