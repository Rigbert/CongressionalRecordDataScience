Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) my friend, my brother, and my colleague, for being the co-leader of this delegation traveling from Washington to Birmingham where we had an opportunity to visit the Civil Rights Museum, the Sixteenth Street Church that was bombed on September 15th, 1963, where the four little girls were killed, and to visit the park where they used the dogs and the fire hoses against little children.  We then traveled, as the gentleman suggested, on to Montgomery and then to Selma. During that entire trip in the State of Alabama, we were in the district of the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Hilliard) and we should take the moment to thank him for his hospitality and thank all of our colleagues.  This trip was sponsored by Faith and Politics, a group that comes together here in Washington where we have been meeting for some time discussing the whole question of race, having a dialogue on race. We have been doing it here, in our districts, in our offices, in our homes. We did it on this trip and we are going to continue to do it.  So I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) for bringing us together tonight. Maybe the gentleman from Alabama would have something to say, since we were in his district in Alabama.
