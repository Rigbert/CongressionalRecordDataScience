 President, I would first like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee for joining Senator Boxer and myself in this colloquy regarding our amendment to make technical corrections to title I, section 119 of the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. This section, as amended, will allow the Department of Justice and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to transfer surplus real property to State and local governments for law enforcement, fire fighting, and rescue purposes.
