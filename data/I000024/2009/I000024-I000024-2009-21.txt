President, I understand my colleagues are getting very close. I want a couple more minutes and that is to mention something that is happening today in the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Feingold has an amendment with which I wholeheartedly agree. It is actually not an amendment. It is a bill having to do with the LRA. Let me explain quickly what that is.  The LRA, the Lord's Resistance Army, has for about 25 years, led by a guy named Joseph Kony in the northern part of Uganda, been mutilating kids. We have heard of the Child's Army. They go into the villages and kidnap these kids, take them out, teach them how to be warriors, and once they join up, they send them back to the village to murder their own parents, their own family.  This has been going on for a long period of time. This bill is something about which I am very excited. Finally, we have the attention of the people in the United States, and that is to join in and go after this animal named Joseph Kony.  In the last 18 years, the LRA has captured over 20,000 kids. I have been to northern Uganda. I have been up Guru. I have watched these kids after they have been dismembered, after they cut their lips off, cut their ears off, and all of this.  When this bill first came out, I was opposed to it because Senator Feingold had to pay for this bill with a reduction in some of the funds that would otherwise go to the U.S. Air Force. That has been taken out. So I join him now in saying this is something that has to take place. This is the first time we have actually had the opportunity to bring up this issue, to let it surface.  I personally talked with President Museveni in Uganda, President Kagame of Rwanda, and President of the eastern part of Congo. I have been to Goma where Joseph Kony has kidnaped these kids, murdered these kids, mutilated these kids. I can tell from personal experience this is something we need to get involved in, and we are doing it by virtue of this bill.  I have gone 1 minute past. I apologize to the managers of the bill. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
