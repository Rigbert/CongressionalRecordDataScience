 Reserving the right to object, there is no need for an extension. This current law expires Saturday. We know 68 Members of the Senate have already voted for a Protect America Act that would extend the law for 6 years. We know a majority of the House of Representatives, on a bipartisan basis, thinks that law ought to be taken up and passed. That is what we ought to be doing.  I am sure the Democrats in the House are grateful to their good friend, the majority leader, for trying to protect them from their actions. But the fact is, there is only one reason we have a crisis. It is because the House Democratic leadership refuses to act on a bill that enjoys bipartisan majority support in the House of Representatives that we have already passed overwhelmingly. Therefore, I object.
