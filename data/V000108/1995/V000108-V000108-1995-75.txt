Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to call your attention to the School City of Hammond Adult Education Program in Hammond, IN. This outstanding program has successfully taken on the immense job of tackling adult illiteracy. I would like to highlight for you and my other colleagues this impressive program and its many achievements.  Under the direction of Dr. Gary Jones, assistant superintendent of curriculum for the School City of Hammond, and Dr. Steve Watson, director of adult education and extended services, the Hammond Adult Education Program has developed into one that should be used as a model for adult education programs throughout the country.  The Hammond Adult Education Program uses several innovative approaches to fight adult illiteracy. Hammond adult basic programs and services include literacy training and life skills education, as well as GED preparation and English as a second language. Joblink 2000 Workforce Development and Instructional Programs, which are joint training programs developed by Hammond adult education, the Inland Steel Co., and the United Steelworkers of America Local 1010, provide academic instruction to steelworkers so that they can learn new skills and compete in a global market. Another initiative the Hammond adult education is most proud of is the continuing education program specifically designed for the Navy recruiting district of Chicago. This program, which is the first in the Nation to qualify GED graduates for acceptance into the U.S. Navy, was initiated 2 years ago and has proven to be very successful.  The Hammond Adult Education Program has entered into cooperative agreements with 22 local agencies, institutions, and organizations to coordinate the planning and delivery of services to adults. Moreover, Hammond adult education exceeds both Federal and State averages relative to student attendance and retention. Again, this year, Hammond adult education joined with the city of Hammond and other educational institutions to sponsor a job fair. This year's fair, which attracted more than 600 participants, was held at the Hammond Area Career Center and featured educational provider booths, an assessment of learner skills follows up by guidance counseling, and displays by local employers.  The Hammond Adult Education Program is already a nationally recognized leader in the field of adult education having received the U.S. Secretary of Education's Outstanding Adult Education Program in 1990. In addition, this distinguished program has received the following awards: 1994 Tri City Community Mental Health Center Community Service Award; 1990 Region V Outstanding Adult Education Program Award; 1990 Indiana Department of Education's nomination for Outstanding Adult Education Program Award; 1984 Governor's Indiana Adult Literacy Coalition's Exemplary Instruction Award; 1984 Citation in Effective Literacy Programs; and, in 1984, the Indiana Division of Adult Education Program Quality Award.  The Hammond Adult Education Program functions as a true melting pot for all racial, ethnic, cultural, socio-economic, and religious groups in northwest Indiana. In May, I spoke to 231 graduates who received their GED diplomas from the Hammond Adult Education Program at the GED graduation and recognition ceremony. These fine graduates, along with the 2,000 other students enrolled in this program are to be commended for their dedication to improve themselves through continuing education. I enthusiastically applaud the Hammond Adult Education Program for successfully improving the quality of life for residents in northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
