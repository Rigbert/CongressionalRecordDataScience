Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, just because the other body has not taken up a bill that has overwhelmingly passed this body is no reason why we should turn our back on trying to get it through in another method. I believe that all of the provisions of this bill are very meritorious. I intend to ask for a rollcall, and I think that most of the Members of this body will agree.
