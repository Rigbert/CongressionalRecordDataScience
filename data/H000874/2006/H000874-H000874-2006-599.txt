Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the University of Maryland Men's Soccer Team, the 2005 National Collegiate Athletic Association Champions. The Maryland Terrapins claimed the 2005 NCAA Championship, 1-0, over the University of New Mexico Lobos at SAS Complex in Cary, North Carolina, on December 11, 2005.  The University of Maryland Men's Soccer Team has had a very successful season of which we can all be proud. In addition to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Championship, the Terrapins won the 2005 Atlantic Coast Conference Regular Season Championship and had an overall record of 19-4-2. They also set a school record of 66 goals. Additionally, the Maryland Terrapins are the first team since 1992 to win the tournament as the number one seed.  The Terrapins' Men's Soccer Program has a history of successes. In just the past four seasons, the Terps have amassed 76 wins, the most in the NCAA during the 4-year span. In addition, the Terrapins won their first national soccer title in 1968, when it shared the title with Michigan State.  The coaches who have led the Terrapins to victory are Head Coach Sasho Cirovsky, Assistant Coach Russell Payne, and Assistant Coach Rob Vartughian. Also assisting the team were Associate Athletics Director Shawn Flynn, Trainer Terry Gee, and Adam Zundell with Sports Information. University of Maryland Athletics Director Debbie Yow was also essential to their success.  The gifted athletes include the following University of Maryland students: Spencer Allen, Matt Beckman, Kenney Bertz, Marc Burch, Robbie C'deBaca, Kwame Darko, A.J. Delagarza, Michael DelIo-Russo, Maurice Edu, Jason Garey, David Glaudemans, A.J. Godbolt, Aki Kadotani, Stephen King, Chris Lancos, Michael Marchiano, Kevin Reiman, Doug Rodkey, Robbie Rogers, Craig Salvati, Chris Seitz, Kevin Tangney, Michael Vallie, Pat Wilson, and Graham Zusi.  Mr. Speaker, in addition to promoting discipline and health, collegiate athletics provide a wonderful training ground for future leaders and I expect that we will see great things come from these young men in the future. I applaud the University of Maryland's 2005 Men's Soccer Team on its success.                          ____________________
