President, Maine and New Hampshire share a border, a history, and an invigorating climate. When Kelly Ayotte came to the Senate 6 years ago, I immediately saw in her those traits shared by the people of our two States: a strong work ethic, a respect for tradition balanced by a spirit of innovation, and fiscal prudence always tempered by compassion.  During those years, I came to know Senator Ayotte as a diligent, energetic, and committed public servant.  She brought with her to the Senate a remarkable record of public service. As her State's attorney general, she fought hard to protect the people of New Hampshire and the environment that is so crucial to their way of life.  It has been rewarding to work with her on such bipartisan efforts as the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and addressing the opioid addiction crisis confronting our States. From her support for land conservation to advancing biomass energy, she has been a strong leader in the wise use of natural resources and their role in growing the economy.  Coming from a military family, she has demonstrated her respect for our men and women in uniform as a member of the Armed Services Committee and is recognized as a leading voice on national security issues and the well-being of our veterans. We have joined together on many occasions to advocate for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard that is so important to our Nation's defense and to the dedicated men and women of our two States who work there.  It has been an honor to serve with Kelly Ayotte in the United States Senate, and the American people are better off for her service. I wish Kelly and her wonderful family all the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
