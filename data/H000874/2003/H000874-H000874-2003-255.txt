 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows and has stated, we do have a tradition of having open rules for consideration of appropriations measures. I do not know what discussions the gentleman is referring to. This side has had no discussions that I am aware of about what the rules would look like on appropriations. I would hope that we would continue the tradition of open rules on appropriations; but obviously, we do have to look at all of these bills on a case-by-case basis.
