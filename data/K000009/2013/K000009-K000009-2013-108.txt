 Congressman Lynch, I think, has really thought through this proposal very well. His is a modest amendment. Actually, the bill that we are considering is $29,425,000 above the budget request of the administration, so he is merely conforming his amendment to the initial request.  For the record, we anticipate that the Department will with this change spend approximately $420 million this year for fossil energy research and development.  I agree with my esteemed colleague from New Jersey about the importance of natural gas, as Ohio is a State that has benefited deeply from that. A lot of that technology is going very well, and the companies are making significant profits. They can invest some of that in their own advanced development now. Then with the additional drilling for oil on public lands and so forth, we are producing more than we have in modern history over the last several years.  So I think it's worthy to transfer some of these dollars to the Corps. We have over $60 billion worth of Corps projects that are backed up, and in terms of job creation, that just rings home across this country because those Corps dollars will be put to work in projects that have been backed up from coast to coast.  I now yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).
