Speaker, as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Croatian Caucus and in light of the forthcoming National Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit in Riga, I would like to bring your attention to the significant progress Croatia has made to date under Euro-Atlantic integrations. I would also like to emphasize the contributions Croatia could make as a new NATO member in furthering its principles and enhancing security in the area. Finally, I would like to commend both the Croatian Embassy to the United States and the National Federation of Croatian Americans for their steadfast commitment to furthering the U.S.-Croatian relationship.  In pursuing extensive political, economic, and defense reforms since it's independence, Croatia has proven to be a reliable partner in the international community's efforts to build long-term support and stability, and has been an active supporter of the global coalition against terrorism. Croatia fully recognizes the fundamental importance of sharing its vision of Euro-Atlantic integration with other countries in the region, demonstrating this through various regional initiatives such as the U.S. Adriatic Charter for Partnership with Albania and Macedonia.  Croatia is one of the countries first in line for the next round of NATO enlargement, and has benefited greatly from the substantial investment made by the United States in the region. This investment represents the United States' belief in Croatia as a partner in promoting democratic ideals and peace-keeping efforts world-wide. Croatia has been an active contributor to non-Article V. NATO operations in the areas of crisis management and crisis response, notably under NATO-led ISAF operations in Afghanistan, Further, Croatia has consistently demonstrated its support for international efforts to bring peace, stability, and democracy in Iraq.  The Congress' continuing support for further NATO enlargement was expressed last year, when the United States House of Representatives unanimously adopted House Resolution 529, recommending Croatia's integration into NATO. This was quickly followed by a similar resolution in the United States Senate. These resolutions not only represented recognition by the U.S. Legislature of the significant progress made by the Croatian government towards participating actively in a free and democratic world, they also provided valuable support for further efforts in Southeast Europe towards stability and security in the Southeastern European region.  At the Riga Summit, NATO should go beyond its ``open door'' policy and issue an unequivocal message to invite one or more aspirant MAP countries to begin accession talks with NATO at the next Summit in 2008, provided that they continue with necessary reforms and fulfill the conditions for membership, Croatia has demonstrated it is willing and able to assume responsibilities of NATO membership, and will prove to be an effective contributor to the collective defense and overall Alliance mission.  Mr. Speaker, as a Co-Chair of the Croatian Caucus, I am fully convinced that Croatia's earliest integration into NATO will allow it to be a more valuable ally to the United States. I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me today in recognizing Croatia's progress and in encouraging the Departments of State and Defense to push for full integration of Croatia into NATO at the earliest opportunity, preferably with an invitation no later than 2008.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1921-E1922]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          NATO SUMMIT IN RIGA                                 ______                                                         HON.
