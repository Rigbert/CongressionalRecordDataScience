President, today the Senate passed the conference report on the emergency supplemental and rescission bill. Some of the cuts in the report were well deserved. The emergency relief for California and Oklahoma is certainly much needed. But you do not buy a horse because it has two good legs, and I will not vote for a rescission bill whose cuts have such a lopsided affect on low- and middle-income Americans. There is a better way to cut spending.  Last month I supported the Senate in overwhelmingly passing a rescission bill that, while far from perfect, put the emphasis of cuts where it should be, on pork not the poor. The Senate bill included cuts to earmarked courthouse construction, American subsidized broadcasting to Europe--a hard program to support when public broadcasting at home is being cut, and unused funding for transportation projects.  The House cuts had a much difference focus, a focus that unfortunately the conference report has adopted. The conference package cuts $319 million from low-income fuel assistance programs, $113 million--five times the Senate level of cuts--to low-income education programs, and $1.5 billion more than the Senate proposed in cuts to assisted housing programs. Affordable housing took the biggest cut, with the conference report rescinding $7 billion from Department of Housing and Urban Development--30 percent of this year's budget.  These cuts are not equitable, they are not fair to working American families, they are not the cuts the Senate voted for on April 6. I hope that there will be an opportunity to return the focus of this rescission bill to the programs that the Senate bill targeted. The disaster victims need the assistance the supplemental will provide. Let us get it to them without making victims of middle-class American families.
