We have a forest health crisis in the Western United States caused by mismanagement, and that would include some salvage, but we are being asked to accept a pig in a poke. We are being told that the Democrat administration has entered into a secret agreement not available in writing with the Republican majority which we are going to be asked to vote on within 15 minutes here in the House of Representatives. I am being asked to accept on good faith that this is something that will both protect the environment and do what we need for forest health and salvage in the Western United States, but it is not available in writing.  This is an outrage, this is an extraordinary outrage. I do not know how many times I heard from the minority on that side last year, ``You can't make us vote on something we haven't read.'' We have not read this. This is not available to us. It is not available to us either through the Democratic administration, nor the Republican majority. That is absurd. No one in America thinks we should vote on something we have not read.
