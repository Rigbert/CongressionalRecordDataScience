 President, it is with tremendous pride that I rise today to salute the Rotary Club of Wilmington, DE, for its leadership in the worldwide initiative of Rotary International to establish eight Centers for International Studies in Peace and Conflict Resolution.  Recently, the Chairman of the International Rotary Foundation, Luis Giay, visited Delaware and presented an award to the Wilmington Rotary Club for being among the very first Rotary Clubs in the world to raise, sua sponte, $50,000 for the International Studies in Peace and Conflict Resolution project. The funds will be used to pay the two-year tuition costs for a graduate student to attend one of the newly-formed Rotary Peace Centers.  In this time of war and strife, my colleagues might find it interesting to learn more about these new Centers. The goals of the Rotary Peace Centers are: Mediation, Conflict Resolution, and Peace where there is war; understanding where there is disharmony; food security where there is hunger; health Care where there is disease; education where there is illiteracy; conservation where there is environmental degradation; sustainable Economic Development where there is poverty.  As Rotary's major educational priority in the 21st Century, the Rotary Centers for International Studies will provide opportunities for our next generation of leaders and scholars to focus on dealing effectively with obstacles to international cooperation and peace.  Educating such promising future leaders will help Rotary fulfill its long-standing mission to promote global peace and understanding.  The Rotary Centers have partnered with some of the leading universities in the world. The eight Rotary Peace Centers are located at: Duke University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in North Carolina; the University of California-Berkeley in California; Sciences Po in Paris, France; the University of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England; the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; the International Christian University in Tokyo, Japan; and, Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Like most big ideas, the fundraising initiative grew from a seed, in this case a seed planted by a small group of Wilmington Rotarians. Past Presidents Joe Melloy and Bruce Beardwood knew that with the Wilmington Rotary Club's 86-year history of service that its members would want to be pioneers in the Rotary Peace Center project. Wilmington Rotarians then set out to meet the $50,000 goal. They held a very successful silent auction to raise nearly half of the money. Generous, individual contributions put them over the top.  Even more impressive, the Wilmington Rotary Club then challenged the other 43 Clubs and 2,000 Rotarians in the Rotary District that encompasses Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland to raise money for the Rotary Centers for International Studies. I am proud to say, challenge issued, challenge met.  I think it is appropriate and important to publicly recognize the efforts of the Rotary Club of Wilmington to do its part to help make our world a better, safer place to live. Not only is the Wilmington Rotary Delaware's oldest and largest Rotary Club with about 250 members, it continues to be among the leading Rotary Clubs in the United States. Its leadership as a pioneer Club for the Rotary Centers for Peace and International Studies is a great example of the Rotary tradition of service and of the part each one of us can play in advancing the goal of world peace.  To the members of the Rotary Club of Wilmington, congratulations and thank you.                          ____________________
