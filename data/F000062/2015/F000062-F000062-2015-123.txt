 President.  I thank the distinguished chairman for this time. I do not think I will take 15 minutes. We have worked it down.  I join Senator McCain and Ranking Member Reed--as well as Senator Collins and the other cosponsors, Senators Leahy, Paul, King, Flake, Heinrich, Whitehouse, Mikulski, Wyden, Murphy, Hirono, Warner, Baldwin, Brown and Markey--in offering an amendment that will help ensure the United States never again carries out coercive and abusive interrogation techniques or indefinite secret detentions.  I am very pleased that the Senate will consider this amendment, and I urge an aye vote.  The amendment we are offering today is really very simple. It applies the authorizations and restrictions for interrogations in the Army Field Manual to the entire U.S. Government.  It extends what Congress did in 2005, by a vote of 90 to 9, with the Detainee Treatment Act--which I believe Senator McCain authored--which banned the Department of Defense from using techniques not authorized by the Army Field Manual and also banned the government from using cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.  The amendment also requires prompt access by the International Committee of the Red Cross to any detainee held by the U.S. Government.  Both of these provisions are consistent with United States policy for the past several years, but this amendment would codify these requirements into law.  President Obama banned the use of coercive and abusive interrogation techniques by Executive order in his first few days in office, actually on January 22, 2009.  That Executive order formally prohibits--as a matter of policy--the use of interrogation techniques not specifically authorized by the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations.  This amendment places that restriction in law. It is long overdue.  The amendment also codifies another section of President Obama's January 2009 Executive order, requiring access by the International Committee of the Red Cross to all U.S. detainees in U.S. Government custody--access which has been historically granted by the United States and other law-abiding nations and is needed to fulfill our obligations under international law, such as the Geneva Conventions.  It is also important to understand that the policies in the 2009 Executive order are only guaranteed for as long as a future President agrees to leave them in place. This amendment would codify these two provisions into law.  Current law already bans torture, as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.  However, this amendment is still necessary because interrogation techniques were able to be used, which were based on a deeply flawed legal theory, and those techniques, it was said, did not constitute ``torture'' or ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.''  These legal opinions could be written again.  In 2009, President Obama's Executive Order settled the issue as formal policy, and this amendment will codify a prohibition on a program that was already defunct at the end of the Bush administration.  CIA Director John Brennan has clearly stated that he agrees with the ban on interrogation techniques that are not in the Army Field Manual. Director Brennan wrote the following to the Intelligence Committee in 2013 about the President's 2009 Executive order:       I want to reaffirm what I said during my confirmation      hearing: I agree with the president's decision, and, while I      am the Director of the CIA, this program will not under any      circumstances be reinitiated. I personally remain firm in my      belief that enhanced interrogation techniques are not an      appropriate method to obtain intelligence and that their use      impairs our ability to continue to play a leadership role in      the world.  Furthermore, it is important to point out that the Senate and the House bothrequired the use of the Army Field Manual across the government in the fiscal year 2008 Intelligence authorization bill. Unfortunately, President Bush vetoed that legislation.  Whatever one may think about the CIA's former detention and interrogation program, we should all agree that there can be no turning back to the era of torture.  Interrogation techniques that would together constitute torture do not work. They corrode our moral standing, and ultimately they undermine any counterterrorism policies they are intended to support.  So before I close, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of letters and statements in support of this amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     June 9, 2015.       Dear Senator: As retired generals and admirals who believe      that American ideals are a national security asset, we urge      you to support the amendment to the 2016 National Defense      Authorization Act that solidifies the ban against torture and      cruel treatment of detainees in U.S. custody.       While international and domestic law, including the 2005      Detainee Treatment Act, prohibit such cruelty, high-level      officials in the Executive Branch still managed to evade      congressional intent by using loophole lawyering to authorize      torture and cruel treatment. We need to make sure this never      happens again. The United States should have one standard for      interrogating detainees that is effective, lawful, and      humane.       The McCain-Feinstein amendment would ensure lawful,      effective, and humane interrogations of individuals taken      into custody by requiring all agencies and departments to      comply with the time-tested requirements of the Army Field      Manual (``Human Intelligence Collector Operations''). It      would also codify existing Department of Defense (DOD)      practice of guaranteeing timely notification and access to      the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for      detainees taken into custody--an important bulwark against      abuse.       We strongly urge you to support this legislation to help      move our country towards decisively rejecting the use of      torture or cruel treatment against detainees held in our      custody.       Thank you for your commitment to upholding our national      security and American values.

The use of enhanced      interrogation techniques, or torture by another name, was      wrongly justified by some as means to prevent another      terrorist attack. Torture is never justified. September 11th      Families for Peaceful Tomorrows applauds the legislation      being offered by Senators McCain and Feinstein to reinforce      the ban on torture. Any assertion of torture as effective      must be repudiated. Any loophole suggesting torture as a      justifiable means to security must be closed. Any ethical      principle that finds torture morally permissible must be      challenged.       American legislators must clearly and forcefully codify      policy that rejects and criminalizes torture in all its      forms. Only then will trust in the rule of law be restored,      and the people of this nation truly safe.                                  ____                                                     June 9, 2015.       Dear Senator: As intelligence and interrogation      professionals who have offered our collective voice opposing      torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading      treatment, we strongly encourage you to support the amendment      to the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act that      solidifies the ban against torture and cruel treatment of      detainees in U.S. custody.       While international and domestic law, including the 2005      Detainee Treatment Act, prohibit such cruelty, sadly high-     level officials in the Executive Branch exploited loopholes      and still authorized torture and cruel treatment. The      interrogation methods that have kept America safe for      generations are sophisticated, humane, lawful, and produce      reliable, actionable intelligence in any interrogation      scenario. To promote a return to that respected level of      professionalism, there must be a single well-defined standard      of conduct--consistent with our values as a nation--across      all U.S. agencies to govern the detention and interrogation      of people anywhere in U.S. custody.       The amendment would ensure lawful, effective, and humane      interrogations of individuals taken into custody by requiring      all agencies and departments to comply with the time-tested      requirements of the Army Field Manual (``Human Intelligence      Collector Operations''). It would also require a review of      the Army Field Manual to ensure that best practices and the      most recent evidenced-based research on humane interrogation      are incorporated. It would also codify existing Department of      Defense (DOD) practice of guaranteeing timely notification      and access to the International Committee of the Red Cross      (ICRC) for detainees taken into custody--an important bulwark      against abuse.       We strongly urge you to support this legislation to help      move our country forward and reaffirm that there is no      conflict between adhering to one of our nation's essential      and founding values--respect for inherent human dignity--and      our ability to obtain the intelligence we need to protect the      nation.

U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator, As deliberations over the FY 2016 National      Defense Authorization Act continue, I write to express      support for an amendment offered by Senators John McCain and      Dianne Feinstein that would prohibit all U.S. government      agencies and their agents from using torture as an      interrogation technique.       The amendment would:       Require all U.S. government agencies (including the CIA) to      limit interrogation techniques to those set out in the Army      Field Manual;       Require the Army Field Manual be updated regularly and      remain available to the public to reflect best interrogation      techniques designed to elicit statements without the use or      threat of force; and       Require the International Committee of the Red Cross be      given access to all detainees.       These provisions are ones that the Committee on      International Justice and Peace of the United States      Conference of Catholic Bishops have long supported in trying      to ban the practice of torture by the U.S. government.       The Army Field Manual 2-22.3 prescribes uniform standards      for interrogating persons detained by the Department of      Defense. A guiding principle of the Field Manual echoes the      Golden Rule: ``In attempting to determine if a contemplated      approach or technique should be considered prohibited, and      therefore should not be included in an interrogation plan,      consider . . . if the proposed approach technique were used      by the enemy against one of your fellow soldiers, would you      believe the soldier had been abused?'' (5-76)       The McCain-Feinstein amendment seeks to ensure that Army      Field Manual's standard is also the same standard used by      other governmental agencies, including the CIA. Adhering to      these standards and ensuring access by the International      Committee of the Red Cross to visit detainees in      international armed conflicts would make a substantial      contribution to our nation's efforts to uphold our      international obligations under the Geneva Conventions and      the Convention Against Torture. The amendment would help      restore the moral credibility of the United States.       In Catholic teaching, torture is an intrinsic evil that      cannot be justified under any     circumstances as it violates the dignity of the human person,      both victim and perpetrator, and degrades any society that      tolerates it. We urge all Senators to support the McCain-     Feinstein amendment that would help to ensure that laws are      enacted so that our government does not engage in torture      ever again.           Sincerely yours,                                        Most Reverend Oscar Cantu,          Bishop of Las Cruces, Chair, Committee on International      Justice and Peace.                                  ____           Protecting U.S. Security Upholding American Values       The United States detainee interrogation policy can live up      to American values and, at the same time, protect our      national security. This policy, supported by overwhelmingly      bipartisan legislation in 2005, states: ``No individual in      the custody or under the physical control of the U.S.      Government, regardless of nationality or physical location,      shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or      punishment.'' Such principles can be attained by following      the U.S. Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector      Operations. We believe these lawful, humane, and effective      techniques will produce actionable intelligence while      adhering to our founding principles.       To ensure the integrity of this critical process, Congress      should conduct effective, real-time oversight on America's      intelligence communities. Failure to live up to these      internal safeguards adversely affects the nation's security      and damages America's reputation in the world.

Dear Senator: As you authorize FY16 appropriations for the      Department of Defense, please approve language in an      amendment to be offered by Senators McCain and Feinstein that      would strengthen the prohibition of torture in U.S. law and      apply the Army Field Manual interrogation policies and      standards to all personnel and facilities operated or      controlled by our government.       The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) opposes the      use of torture as a violation of basic human dignity that is      incompatible with our beliefs in the sanctity of human life.      The use of torture is also inconsistent with American values,      undermines our moral standing in the world and may contribute      to an environment in which captured U.S. personnel are      subjected to torture.       The NAE's position is set forth in ``An Evangelical      Declaration Against Torture,'' available at http://nae.net/an-evangelical-dec     laration-against-torture/, and reaffirmed in a recent NAE      statement (http://nae.net/nae-affirms-u-s-army-prohibition-of-torture/).       While the use of torture is currently prohibited across all      government agencies by executive order, this fundamental      principle must be enshrined in law, to ensure that no future      President may authorize the use of torture.       We are grateful for your leadership and pray that God will      guide you as you consider how best to defend our nation.           Sincerely,                                                   Leith Anderson,     President.                                  ____                                 National Council of Churches,                                                    June 11, 2015.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: As you consider amendments to the National      Defense Authorization Act, please support the McCain-     Feinstein amendment on torture. The amendment would prohibit      torture by requiring the CIA and other agencies to follow the      guidelines in the Army Field Manual when conducting      interrogations, and by ensuring that the International      Committee of the Red Cross is given access to all detainees.      The amendment also provides a means to update the Field      Manual to reflect the best legal, humane, and effective      interrogation techniques.       As Christians we believe that all people are created in the      image of God, endowed by our Creator with an inalienable      dignity and worth. Torture is a deeply degrading violation of      that image and to us it is never morally acceptable. As the      most powerful country on earth, we should set an example for      humane treatment of prisoners; we should never allow our      nation's practices to be used to justify torture.       Passing the McCain-Feinstein amendment would strengthen the      legal prohibition against torture and thereby prevent the CIA      from ever resuming its torture program. Please support      McCain-Feinstein and help begin to put the CIA's brutal and      degrading use of torture behind us.           Sincerely,                                                      Jim Winkler,     President and General Secretary.                                  ____           American Civil Liberties Union; Human Rights; National            Religious Campaign Against Torture; The Constitution            Project; Physicans for Human Rights; Open Society            Policy Center; The Center for Victims of Torture                 (For Immediate Release: June 9, 2015)Human Rights Groups Applaud Legislation Reaffirming U.S. Prohibition on                                 Torture       On Tuesday, June 9, 2015, Senators McCain, Feinstein, Reed,      and Collins introduced legislation to make the U.S. Army      Field Manual on Interrogations the standard for all U.S.      government interrogations to make sure that the United States      never uses torture again. Seven human rights and civil      liberties organizations, including the ACLU, the Center for      Victims of Torture, The Constitution Project, Human Rights      First, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, the      Open Society Policy Center, and Physicians for Human Rights,      announced their strong support for the legislation via the      joint statement below.       Washington, DC.--We applaud Senators McCain, Feinstein,      Reed and Collins for offering bipartisan legislation to      ensure that the United States never uses torture again.      Senator McCain's prior legislation (the Detainee Treatment      Act) was approved by the Senate in 2005 with strong      bipartisan support and was a positive game-changer by      mandating among other things that interrogations conducted by      all Department of Defense personnel had to follow the U.S.      Army Field Manual on Interrogation (the Interrogation      Manual). The McCain-Feinstein amendment extends and improves      the Detainee Treatment Act by making the Interrogation Manual      the standard for all U.S. government interrogations, and by      mandating that the Manual be reviewed and updated regularly      to insure that it reflects the very best evidence-based      interrogation practices and complies with all U.S. legal      obligations. The McCain-Feinstein amendment also requires      that the International Committee of the Red Cross have access      to every prisoner in U.S. custody no matter where or by whom      they are held.       We believe that the CIA's ``enhanced interrogation''      techniques and ``black sites'' were clearly illegal under the      law that existed on 9/11, under the 2005 Detainee Treatment      Act and also under the relevant provisions of the 2006      Military Commissions Act. But the overwhelming evidence that      has emerged of shocking brutality employed by the CIA      notwithstanding these laws--including waterboarding, nudity,      stress positions, sleep deprivation, forced rectal feeding,      beatings and other abuses--demonstrates that additional      protections are still essential. Had the McCain-Feinstein      amendment been in place following the 9/11 attacks we believe      it would have significantly bolstered other prohibitions on      torture and made it far more difficult, if not impossible,      for the CIA to establish and operate their torture program.      Among other things, the Interrogation Manual explicitly      prohibits waterboarding, forced nudity and other forms of      torture employed by the CIA and it specifies that only      interrogation methods that are expressly described in the      Interrogation Manual are permitted. In addition, under the      McCain-Feinstein legislation no prisoner could have been      hidden away at CIA ``black sites'' without access to the Red      Cross.       More can and should be done to pursue accountability for      past brutal and illegal interrogations and to improve the      Interrogation Manual. But the McCain-Feinstein Amendment is a      vital and welcome step toward ensuring that the United States      never again uses torture.
