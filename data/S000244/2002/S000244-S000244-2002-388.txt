Chairman, I yield myself 7 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, it is beyond time to restructure one of the worst-run agencies in the Federal Government, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS has long been considered the undesirable and unwanted stepchild of the Justice Department. It carries out neither of its crucial missions well, enforcing our immigration laws andproviding services to immigrants playing by the rules.  Today, we must stop being enablers, stop giving more and more money to an agency as a reward for squandering the money we gave it the year before. We must practice tough love and abolish the INS.  In its place, we need to create two separate immigration bureaus in the Justice Department, a Bureau of Immigration Enforcement and a Bureau of Citizen and Immigration Services. This is what the Barbara Jordan Immigration Reform and Accountability Act of 2002 is all about.  I am proud of the work of the Committee on the Judiciary in crafting this legislation on a cooperative and bipartisan basis.  Barbara Jordan, our distinguished former colleague, chaired the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform. The Commission came to the conclusion that the INS suffers from institutional schizophrenia, or mission overload. It explained that the INS must give equal weight to more priorities than any one agency can handle. Such a system is set up for failure, and with such failure, a loss of public confidence.  That is exactly what has happened. The public no longer has faith in the INS. The public is right, and this bill abolishes this agency.  Some say INS stands for ``ignoring national security.'' It is hard to argue with that. There are at least 8 million illegal aliens living in the United States, according to the Census Bureau. Over 300,000 criminal and deportable aliens who have been ordered deported, and removed by immigration judges, have absconded and the INS does not have the slightest idea where they are.  Mohammed Atta became a household name after September 11 to everyone but those in the INS, which approved Atta's visa to attend flight school long after he had completed it, and 6 months after he hijacked a plane, flew it into the World Trade Center, and killed thousands of people of various nationalities.  This bill creates a new Bureau of Immigration Enforcement, headed by a law enforcement professional and focused singly on crafting and carrying out policies to enforce our immigration laws and keep Americans safe from terrorists, criminals, and other aliens who wish to do us harm. National security will be given the attention it deserves.  Others say INS stands for ``incompetent and negligent service.'' It would be hard to argue with them, either. The agency had a backlog of almost 5 million applications and petitions at the end of fiscal year 2001. It takes the INS years to adjudicate a green card application. It takes years for a naturalization applicant to become a U.S. citizen, and during this time, lawful immigrants trying to play by the rules must live in a state of purgatory.  Let me give one example. Green card applicants must have their fingerprints taken on a card like this. Now, for legitimate law enforcement reasons, fingerprints are only valid for 15 months. However, when the INS takes years to process a petition, a prospective immigrant must take off work multiple times and often go out of the way to a fingerprinting center, two more cards.  Even apart from the INS' slow-paced processing, very often they lose the fingerprints. And guess what? The alien has to have his fingerprints retaken. Here is strike four.  This bill creates a new Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, headed by a professional in adjudicating government benefits. It will have the sole mission of adjudicating and providing benefits to aliens. The Bureau will bring the attention, the independence, and the budget to the immigration service issues that have been neglected far too long.  The bill also creates an Office of the Ombudsman, independent of the service bureau. Currently, when aliens and their attorneys reach their wit's end with the INS, they approach their Representatives and Senators for help. My district caseworkers spend more time dealing with the INS than with any other Federal agency, including the IRS. Thankfully, my staff and those of all of the Members can often help immigrant constituents, but immigrants need an effective advocate within the bureaucracy so they do not come to their Representatives' offices in the first place. The Office of the Ombudsman will be that advocate. It will have the duty of recommending better operating methods for the Bureau and monitoring its performance.  The Office of the Ombudsman will help infuse accountability into the immigration bureaucracy.  The two bureaus created by this bill will have their own set of offices to focus on and carry out their respective missions, including policy and budget shops. The bill also creates within the Justice Department an Associate Attorney General for Immigration Affairs to oversee and to supervise the bureaus and to coordinate the administration of national immigration policy. This will elevate immigration issues to the level they deserve.  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan, commonsense bill. It will result in true immigration reform, better service, better security, and it is long overdue.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1200
