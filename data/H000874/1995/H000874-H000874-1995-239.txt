Chairman, this title of the bill is education. Americans believe strongly in education, and everybody on this floor wants to balance the budget. As a matter of fact, unlike the gentleman who just spoke, I voted to reduce the deficit by $500 billion in 1993. The gentleman did not.  Whether conservative or liberal, all Americans believe in the American opportunity society. My parents wanted me to have a better life than they had. That is what I want for my three daughters, and, yes, for my granddaughter. The United States is a great Nation because we give people that opportunity, the opportunity to make a better life for themselves and their children. Education is the doorway through which American access that opportunity.  But this appropriation bill is an all-out assault on the American opportunity society. The words opportunity society are meaningless if you do not have the education you need to compete in today's global marketplace. The word opportunity is meaningless if you cannot make a living wage and your kids cannot get a good education in school.  Why are the Republicans waging this attack? The reason is not so they can bring that deficit down, I tell my friend, but so that we can take that money and shift it over to a tax cut for the wealthiest folks in America.                              {time}  1245  That is what we are doing. We are not taking that money that they gentleman just talked about to bring down that $670 figure, what we are doing is taking that money and shifting it over here for a tax cut: a $245 billion tax cut.  Nobody likes paying taxes, but I do not talk to any constituents who believe that it is not important to see that our kids are educated, and that is what that title is about.  Mr. Chairman, what does this attack mean for local schools? Let me talk about a school in my district, Carrollton Elementary School in Prince George's County.  At Carrollton, parents attend workshops to learn what their children are learning in the classroom to help their kids at home. We know if parents are not doing the job, nothing we do is going to suffice. The budget cuts in this bill would end those parent workshops.  Carrollton needs reading and writing materials to reach the new higher educational standards the State of Maryland has set, appropriately, so we can compete in the world markets. The school board has approved them and the contract has been signed, but these budget cuts will cancel that program.  Mr. Chairman, at Carrollton more than 100 third- and fourth-grade students are struggling to learn to read. Some kids have a tough time. These cuts mean the teacher who works to help those kids catch up with their classmates will lose their job.  This is real. This is not some chart so that we can shift money to the wealthiest in America, not bring down the deficit, I tell the gentleman from Florida. It is to give that $245 billion cut, that seems so important, at the expense of these kids.  The American people know that cutting support for kids at Carrollton and across the country is bad educational and economic policy. That is why the polls show, I tell my colleagues, over 90 percent of the voters in America believe we must invest more, not less, in improving education.  Mr. Chairman, this bill is shortsighted. I am going to mention this again, but I want to mention it now, do not take my word for it. Let me quote from a statement made by Secretary Terrel Bell, who served as the Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan. It was not a Democratic administration, you understand; Ronald Reagan. Let me read to my colleagues what he says on July 13, 1995:  ``The drastic and unwarranted education cuts made in congress by the House Appropriations Subcommittee,'' the bill we are considering, ``must be restored or we will undercut community efforts to better educate our children.''  He closes with this: ``The American people support educational excellence, not political extremism.''  That is what he refers to this bill as. That, Mr. Chairman, was Secretary Terrel Bell, the Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan.  Mr. Chairman, let us reject this political extremism that is masked as deficit reduction, when it shifts from our kids to the wealthiest Americans our resources to improve this country.
