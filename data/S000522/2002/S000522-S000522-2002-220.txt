Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, for yielding me this time, and I strongly support H.R. 2146, the Two Strikes and You're Out Child Protection Act, introduced by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Green).  This bill will amend the Federal Criminal Code to provide for mandatory life imprisonment of a person convicted of a Federal sex offense in which a minor is the victim, when the person has previously been convicted of a State or Federal child sex offense. This is important legislation that will protect our children from sexual predators.  Studies have shown that sex offenders and child molesters are four times more likely than other violent criminals to recommit their crimes. Even more disturbing is the number of victims the average pedophile abuses in a lifetime. While any criminal's subsequent offense is of public concern, preventing child sexual predators from repeating crimes is particularly important, given the irrefutable harm that these offenses cause victims and the fear they generate in the community. Sexual assault is a terrifying crime that can leave its victims with physical, emotional, and psychological scars.  Mr. Chairman, this legislation will provide law enforcement officials with the ability to permanently remove those individuals from our society, who have demonstrated that they will continue to prey upon our children if not incarcerated.  Based upon the testimony before the Subcommittee on Crime, this bill enjoys broad support from victims' rights organizations, correction officials, as well as those who suffer from sex offenders' actions. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
