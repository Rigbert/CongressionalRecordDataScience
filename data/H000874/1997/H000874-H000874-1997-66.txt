Speaker, I rise more in disappointment than in anger. I am the Democratic member of the task force on the contested election in the 46th District, the district of the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Sanchez]. I have not taken to the well of the House or to the podium upstairs in the press gallery to talk about the disturbing pattern that has developed in this investigation.  Several days ago, the House Oversight Committee adopted a resolution providing for the issuance of interrogatories. The resolution clearly stated that there would be consultation with the ranking minority member. There was none. There was no discussion regarding the process or the substance of these interrogatories, directly contrary to the resolution of the committee.  What happened last week, unfortunately, is consistent with the pattern that has been established in this case. It has not been, I repeat, it has not been, a fair one. It has not been a process which has reflected a desire to proceed in a cooperative way to effect the ends of a fair investigation.                          ____________________
