 The current U.S. courthouse in Fresno is at its full capacity and would require extensive modifications to meet seismic, fire and security standards.  The current courthouse, the B.F. Sisk Building, opened in 1968 as an office building with only two courtrooms and a small amount of support space designated for the courts. Now, the court and related support agencies occupy 92 percent of the building with additional space being leased on the outside. There are currently four district, two magistrate and two bankruptcy courtrooms in the building, which is used by two district judges, two senior district judges, one visiting judge from Sacramento, two bankruptcy judges, two magistrate judges and visiting magistrate judge. Within the next year, there will be an additional senior judge. Five of the current courtrooms have been built out in previous office space. There is no room for future expansion.  A recent seismic evaluation on the current building found that the cost of seismic retrofitting would be more than the cost of the building. Also, serious concerns have been raised about the safety and security standards in the building relating to its use as a court facility.  Given the current situation and projected future growth, the city has been working with the courts, the General Services Administration [GSA] and the subcommittee to obtain funding for a new structure for the past few years. However, I understand that due to budget constraints, there is no funding provided for new start courthouse projects, including the Fresno project, in the conference report for the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.
