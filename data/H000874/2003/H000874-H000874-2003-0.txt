Speaker, I thank the minority leader for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, there are many of my colleagues who are new to this House and who do not know its history and do not know perhaps the words of your side of the aisle. So I want to give you a little history. I want to take you back to October 28, 1987. The House was considering a controversial Democratic budget reconciliation bill, which I tell the gentlewoman from Connecticut that we thought was very important. The vote stood at 206 to 205. Twenty-four Members had not voted.  The Speaker of the House, in attempting to pass what he believed to be a very important bill, kept the clock going for less than 30 minutes, a little more than 25; and a vote changed, and we prevailed. Your side was outraged. Let me remind you of some of the quotes.  I am the minority leader. Excuse me, I am the minority whip. I understand that. The minority whip at that time is now the Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney. He was angry. The vote was 206 to 205. This bill, for over 2 hours, had an absolute majority of the House of Representatives supporting it, with 218 Members opposing the bill, the proposition that we fought for.  Thirty minutes. And here is what Mr. Cheney said about keeping the ballot open: ``The Democrats' tactics are the most grievous insult inflicted on the Republicans in my time in the House.'' October 1987. He was quoted as saying something else. ``It was,'' he said, ``the most arrogant, heavy-handed abuse of power I have ever seen in the 10 years I have been here.''  Less than 30 minutes, 206 to 205. The Vice President of the United States. The most arrogant abuse of power he had seen. And then the Republican minority whip referred to the Speaker as follows, and listen, my colleagues, particularly those who are new. Referring to the Speaker of the House, he said, ``He's a heavy-handed,'' and he used an epithet that we know as SOB, except he fully articulated it, ``and he doesn't know any other way to operate. And he will do anything he can to win at any price. There is no sense of comity left,'' said Dick Cheney.  I tell the gentlewoman from Connecticut, this was an important bill, but so was the bill that Speaker Wright was following and trying to pass. Dick Cheney, with less than 30 minutes, ``There is no comity left. The most heavy-handed arrogant abuse of power.''  That is what this is about, treating one another with respect and treating the American public with respect. My colleagues had an opportunity to offer their bill. It was offered, we voted on it; and 218 people voted no, and they stuck no for over 2 hours. But my colleagues refused to accept the judgment of democracy. You refused to accept the judgment of this House.  Bob Walker said, ``We found out the majority is perfectly willing to change its rules to crush the minority.'' I know this is not a rule, I say to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier); but I also know that at the beginning of this session, the Speaker, whom I respect and would never demean by addressing him in the terms that Dick Cheney addressed our Speaker, this House's Speaker, said this at the beginning of this session: ``The Speaker's policy announced on January 4, 1995, will continue through the 108th Congress.'' That was Newt Gingrich.  On that occasion, referring to October 30, 1991, the House was considering a bill in the Committee of the Whole under a special rule that placed an overall time limit on the amendment process. We did it in 15 minutes. The Speaker concluded at the beginning of this session, ``Each occupant of the Chair will have the full support of the Speaker in striving to close each electronic vote at the earliest opportunity.'' In this instance it was almost 3 hours. Not 15 minutes, not 17 minutes, not 27 minutes, but 3 hours.  ``I just want to serve notice,'' this gentleman said, ``if the majority, which clearly has the rights under sheer voting power, insists on stripping the right away from the minority, then we have an absolute obligation to take the necessary steps to communicate our dissatisfaction with that kind of legislative process and do everything possible to stop it.'' Newt Gingrich, August 5, 1991.                              {time}  1600  Those of you who are new to this House who believe in democracy, who believe that this is the people's House, ought to accord to every one of us, Democrats and Republicans, the respect due a person chosen to represent 650,000-plus Americans in this House, to put up our votes on that board, to have the majority prevail, but to have them prevail in a time frame that does not, as Mr. Cheney referred to it, reflect ``the most arrogant, most heavy-handed abuse of power I have ever seen in my 10 years.''  My Republican friends, let me ask something: If keeping the ballot open for 25 minutes is the most arrogant abuse of power that Mr. Cheney had ever seen, what is keeping it open 3 hours? Ask yourself that question, and then understand why this resolution is on this floor.
