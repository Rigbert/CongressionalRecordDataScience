 President, I now ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged and the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 27, the House companion bill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1021, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and S. 1021 be returned to the calendar.
