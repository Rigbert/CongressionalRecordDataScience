President, today I am introducing the Layoff Prevention Act, legislation to strengthen and expand work sharing programs to keep Americans on the job and provide employers with a practical alternative to layoffs that is good for business.  While the U.S. has experienced 15 consecutive months of private-sector job creation, too many Americans, nearly 14 million, remain out of work. Like everyone in my State, I am fully focused on finding ways to create jobs. As we work to stabilize employment, our efforts should also be aimed at preventing the loss of jobs in the first place.  This is where work sharing programs make a real difference. If you are a business owner faced with the prospect of having to let go some percentage of your highly-skilled workforce because of a rough patch, work sharing allows you to keep your workers on the job with reduced hours until you can bring them back on full time when business rebounds. In this way, a business does not lose out on the considerable expense and time it has put in to hire and train these workers. This initiative helps workers by lessening the impact of those reduced hours on workers and their families because workers receive a proportionate share of unemployment benefits.  Work sharing has proven to be effective not only in my State of Rhode Island, but in the more than 20 States and the District of Columbia that have adopted it across the Nation. At the height of the recession in 2009, there was a significant jump in employer participation, demonstrating the program's value to small, medium, and large businesses. Indeed, according to the Department of Labor, work sharing programs saved approximately 165,000 jobs in 2009, nearly triple the number the year prior. As the overall economy improved in 2010, the system continued to be a valuable tool, saving 100,000 jobs. But these numbers could be much larger if more States adopted work sharing.  Although work sharing has played an increased role in preventing layoffs, it remains underutilized. Some States are not actively promoting its use; while in many other States it is simply not available.  Despite these limitations, the current economic circumstances have shined a bright light on the value of job sharing and these initiatives have been front and center as States are increasingly turning to them to prevent job losses. A growing number of States with Republican and Democratic Governors have taken action. In just the past few weeks, Maine and Pennsylvania have enacted laws to create work sharing systems, following Colorado, Oklahoma, and New Hampshire last year. The President has also recognized the potential of work sharing to stave off further job losses by including in his fiscal year 2012 budget proposal that expanded on legislation I introduced last Congress.  The bill I am introducing today along with Senators Harkin, Murray, Schumer, Sherrod Brown, Whitehouse, Leahy, Casey, and Blumenthal builds on this momentum and encourages States with existing lay off prevention systems to utilize them more frequently and incentivizes States without work sharing to create them. It strengthens the legislation that I authored last Congress by including changes suggested by the business community, States, economists, and other stakeholders. As in past versions, it provides States that have approved programs with temporary Federal financing for 100 percent of work sharing benefits paid to workers, limited to 26 weeks worth of benefits spread out over the course of a year. This financing is available for three years.  While the bill is designed to incentivize States to enact permanent laws to create work sharing, the bill also includes provisions to allow States to get work sharing up and running more quickly. Specifically, a State can reach an agreement with the Department of Labor to create a temporary program under which they would receive 50 percent Federal financing. This financing incentive would be available for 2 years, and such States would be eligible for a third year of 100 percent federal funding if they pass a permanent law.  In addition, the bill provides flexible grants to State labor agencies at a time when they are doing more with less. States that enact work sharing programs are eligible for grants to improve implementation and administration, and there are also grants for promotion and enrollment. These resources will play a critical role in ensuring that States are efficiently able to inform employers of its benefits, and encourage greater use of work sharing to stave off layoffs. Moreover, as work sharing programs take hold, States will see their unemployment insurance systems less burdened as fewer individuals will need to avail themselves of full unemployment benefits.  Simply put, this legislation will help more workers, businesses, and communities stay afloat, while the country works its way through these tough economic times. Moreover, the bill lays a needed foundation to protect businesses and workers from any future recession. It is a win-win for all.  First, work sharing helps speed economic recovery. Economist Mark Zandi estimates that temporary financing of work share offers a very high ``bang for the buck'' of $1.69. That is, every $1 devoted to finance State work share programs results in $1.69 in real GDP.  Second, work sharing allows businesses to retain skilled workers, temporarily cut costs, and maintain employee morale.  Third, it keeps people working while receiving a share of unemployment benefits to make up for lost wages and retaining health insurance and retirement benefits. This means workers can continue to pay their mortgages and bills, provide for their families, and support businesses in their local communities.  Keeping workers attached to the workforce is a key element of ensuring economic growth.  This legislation does not reinvent the wheel, it is not a mandate on employers or States, and it is not telling anyone what they must do.  Instead, it takes a proven jobs-saving initiative, that is increasingly being used by States, and strengthens and expands it. It gives more employers in more States the opportunity to take advantage of its benefits.  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important legislation. It is my hope that we can proceed in a bipartisan manner as has been accomplished in the more than 20 States where work sharing has been adopted and take swift action to pass this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1333       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
