Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that observation.  With respect to the Labor-HHS-Education bill, which is the largest appropriation bill, as the gentleman knows, that still is outstanding, do you expect that we will have a freestanding conference report on that bill, or do you expect it to be rolled into an omnibus?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, I hope, and I know, I hope that the Labor-HHS appropriations bill for 2004 would be considered freestanding and on its own. A lot of work has been put into that bill. The conference committee is working as hard as it can to get it out before November 21. And as this House has been working so hard to have all these bills freestanding conference reports so that Members can consider them individually, I would hope that it would be freestanding and the House could vote on it. However, if things fall apart, it could be a candidate for the larger package.
