Speaker, one of the biggest cliches in sports is that you do not want your team to be number two.  However, the same does not hold true in other areas. That is why today I want to congratulate the entire St. Mary's College of Maryland community, including the students, alumni and parents and President Margaret O'Brien and the extraordinary faculty, for being ranked the number two public liberal arts college in the Nation.  Mr. Speaker, it will surprise no one that St. Mary's College is in my district. Furthermore, for full disclosure, I am on the board of trustees of St. Mary's College. It is an extraordinary institution of higher learning.  In fact, according to the latest college rankings by the magazine U.S. News and World Report, St. Mary's College is again one of the top 100 liberal arts colleges in the Nation, rising to 84 from 87 the year before. So not only is it number two of small colleges; it is number 84 in the entire Nation of all colleges.  When it comes to public liberal arts colleges, St. Mary's finished only behind the Virginia Military Institute in the U.S. News rankings.  Those rankings are based upon several criteria of academic excellence, including graduation and retention rates, faculty resources and peer assessment.  And this year, St. Mary's peer assessment rose to 2.9 out of a possible 5.0, and the freshmen retention rate rose to 88 percent.  Mr. Speaker, with roots going back to 1840, St. Mary's College is the State of Maryland's only public honors college, offering the academic excellence of a top private college with the openness and affordability of public education.  Today, about 1,950 men and women from 35 States and 23 countries attend St. Mary's, and the average SAT score for the entering freshmen is 1,252. The faculty also has distinguished itself, and more than 94 percent hold doctorate degrees.  By combining the virtues of public and private education, St. Mary's provides a unique alternative for students and their families. This special identity underpins the college's success and its reputation for excellence, in a waterfront setting in the heart of the Chesapeake Bay region just 70 miles southeast of Washington. It is an extraordinarily beautiful setting for an extraordinarily excellent college.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the college's board of trustees since 1995, I have seen this wonderful institution flourish over the last decade, and I am particularly pleased to see St. Mary's is winning national recognition among it peers. This is not the first time that has been the case, but it is a continuing affirmation of the excellence at St. Mary's.  Our 34th President, John F. Kennedy, once said: ``Education is the mainspring of our economic and social progress. It is the highest expression of achievement in our society, ennobling and enriching human life.''  Mr. Speaker, St. Mary's College of Maryland truly enriches southern Maryland and our entire State. I want to congratulate the entire St. Mary's College community on receiving this latest national recognition. Well done, well deserved.                          ____________________[Page H8628]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]             CONGRATULATING ST.
