 I will briefly, in the remaining time, talk about the refugee situation. The toll we have heard about in terms of deaths over there has been somewhere between 2,000 and 3,500. NATO is now saying 3,500; some are saying 2,000. Let's say 3,000. That means that 1 out of 600 of the Kosovar Albanians has lost his life, 1 out of 600. If you compare that--I have a ministry in West Africa. Three weeks ago, I came back from there. In the two countries of Angola and Sierra Leone, for every 1 person who has lost his life in Kosovo, 80 have lost their lives in just those two countries alone.  We knew this was coming. I am reading now from the Washington Post of March 31:       For weeks before the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia,      CIA Director George Tenet had been forecasting that Serb-led      Yugoslavian forces might respond by accelerating ethnic      cleansing.  Then when we asked Secretary Cohen about this, he said:       With respect to George Tenet's testifying that the bombing      could, in fact, accelerate Milosevic's plans, we also knew      that.  So they knew it. The President knew it, and the administration knew it. I have to say this--and this has not been observed by anyone so far--I interviewed these refugees just 2 days ago. When I interviewed the refugees, I found some very interesting things. They all said the same thing. They said that, in fact, they didn't have any problems until the bombing started. I was interviewed by a Tirana TV station, I think it was Tirana. It was Albanian, anyway. And they said, What is the United States going to do about all these refugees? I said, What do you mean, what are we going to do? He said, You are the reason we are here. You are the ones that bombed, and that is what has caused the ethnic cleansing and the forced exodus.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.
