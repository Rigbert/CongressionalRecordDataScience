 President, I submit to the record these essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Third Annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' Essay contest conducted by my office. These 13 finalists were selected from over 300 entries.         Riley Forbes, Mt. Abraham Union High School (Finalist)       The most important issue for the government to solve today      is human rights.       Everybody deserves equal opportunities in life. The State      and Federal Government should help to make sure that everyone      is free from torture, has the right to adequate food,      clothing and housing, and has the right to health care. The      most significant issue for the government to solve today is      human rights.       Human rights are the basic rights that everyone who is      human has. Human rights are important for everyone in the      world to have. An important right is the right to have basic      items, adequate clothing, food and housing. The United      Nations has a right that gives everyone the basic items that      they need, (clothing, food and housing). Whereas the United      States does not have a right giving everyone basic supplies      that is needed to live. ``A man in India without access to      clean water dies of a treatable disease'' (Pinheiro).      Everyone deserves adequate clothing, food, water and housing,      but the problem is that these things are limited. There are      homeless shelters and water, but there may not be enough for      everyone. The Government should try to help provide people      with the basic needs that are needed to survive.       The government should act to protect all people from      torture. The United Nations and the United States believe      that people should have the right to be safe from torture. A      guard watches as a man is assaulted by an inmate in a jail      Texas (Pinheiro). This man gets assaulted and the guard does      nothing. The guard is watching; he should help to protect the      people and not let them suffer even though they are in jail.      The Government should pay attention and try to help people      feel free and safe from torture.       In order for everyone to get a long life, people need to      have their basic needs. The United Nations and the United      States do not have any kind of right that says that everyone      should have healthcare or be able to have health care.      Obamacare will allow more people health insurance that they      can afford (Marston). People who couldn't afford health care      before now have a health care that is more affordable. The      Government is helping to provide people the access to an      affordable health insurance.       The Government should help to support the people and their      rights.

November 2012          Damon Fulcher, South Royalton High School (Finalist)       The state of the Union is the most difficult to decipher in      years. We, as a nation, are stuck in a time where the war in      Afghanistan is dwindling, and we're trying to climb out of an      abysmal fiscal pit. In a nation that has made its name for      moving forward, controversies over human rights like the      right to marry and the right to have an abortion are still as      prevalent as ever. However, all is not lost, and this great      nation will continue to forge on, despite these setbacks.       The land of the free still does not grant rights to every      group of people. Gay marriage is one of the most hotly      debated subjects in our country right now. Even though our      Constitution states that all men are created equal, we as a      nation do not always abide by this principle. Half of the      American population is brushing a group of people under the      rug, just because they have a different sexual orientation      than themselves. The most recent example of this is North      Carolina amending its state constitution to say that same-sex      couples do not have the right to marry. This act takes the      issue to a whole new level past legality. However, not all is      bad. Several more states have begun adding to the pool where      same-sex couples have the right to marry. The United States'      highest court is taking on a case concerning a California      proposition to ban gay marriage. This case will decide the      fate of the issue in the years to come. Unfortunately, the      most serious issue our country faces is not even marriage      equality.       The most pressing issue currently is the economy. The great      debate is whose taxes should be cut and whose taxes should be      raised. The nation is greatly divided along partisan lines in      this respect. These opinions are exemplified by our current      President Barack Obama and our Speaker of the House John      Boehner. One believes that taxes should be raised on the      wealthy and cut on the middle class and the other, vice      versa. This is the nation's problem. We simply need to get      over which party we are a part of and work toward a common      goal. There is guaranteed success if all of Congress works      together to move forward.       The current state of the Union is complex, containing many      positives and negatives. With the idea in mind that working      together is necessary for the betterment of this nation, the      President and Congress will move forward and fix the dilemmas      that this country faces.            Benjamin Gilbert, Milton High School (Finalist)       This country faces one of the most important stages of      change and development it has ever seen. The decisions we      make as a nation in the next few years will shape not only      the future of our own lives, but the lives of every citizen      of this world. We won't be able to do this unless we come      together. We are humans. It is in our nature to disagree. We      are a democracy. It is a democracy's nature to disagree.      Disagreement is a sign of a thriving democracy. It is also in      our nature to solve problems, to be civil, to be fair, and to      provide for a better tomorrow.       In the coming years, we need more doctors and researchers,      to finally find a cure for cancer. We need more books to      inspire. We     need more businesspeople to meet to the new age markets. We      need teachers, and lawyers. We need successful young people      to inherit this country. However, this will not be possible      with the rising costs of higher education. The cost of      sending a child to college is the highest it has ever been.      If we as a country decide not to act, we cannot hope to make      a better tomorrow for ourselves or for our children. In a      state of economic turmoil, cuts have to be made. The military      has been allowed to spend almost without limit. The funds      that will keep Americans safe and soldiers well equipped      should not be touched, but the endless spending must stop.      Anything that is not absolutely vital and necessary for the      safety, protection, and justice of the American people ought      to be reevaluated.       Since its foundation, America has been the birthplace for      equality. From George Washington fighting against the      oppression of a monarchy, to Martin Luther King working      towards a more civil existence, to Alice Paul screaming for      the right to vote. Each step has helped open the door to      equality. Each day we are tested, and each day we must answer      history's call to change. Gay men and women have been quieted      for centuries. But their time is here. No federal ban on love      will stop the dawn of equality that is breaking upon this      nation. This is not about Republicans or Democrats,      religions, or politics, but about American people who love      and cherish one another.       We have a broken system. Today, it is far too difficult to      receive mental healthcare. It is easier to get your hands on      an assault weapon than visit a doctor. We have seen in the      past decade that this inequality leads to a tragic and      horrific reality. Assault weapons are made for the military,      and should be reserved exclusively for that purpose. Most      importantly, those in need of mental healthcare should have      access to it. We must forget about the politics and money,      and focus on the lives of Americans who are in danger every      day.       I have high hopes for the future of this country. We are      all different. We are often very divided. However, we are      strongest when we stand together.              Liam Hayes, Vergennes Union High (Finalist)       Today our country is facing many problems that require the      attention of not only the leaders in Washington, but the      American people as well. As a teenager I believe the two most      important issues are unemployment and our education system. I      know that these issues are affecting our country, mainly in      its overall growth.       First, I feel that our unemployment rate is quite      unacceptable. However, in the past year it has been lowering      slowly by the month. Although it may seem like a substantial      amount, the area of the nation I live in continues to      struggle to find jobs for students graduating college and for      people retraining to new careers. I believe to continue this      progress over the coming years America needs to look at the      national picture of what jobs are there, what new jobs could      serve a need for products and industry and what skills these      new industries will require Americans to have.       Lastly, I think that when it comes to education in this      great nation, the statistics and rankings don't lie. In math,      science, and writing, the US is in the lower half when      compared to other nations. If you look at statistics,      compared to others, we are a more developed country. I am      sure there are many things that we can do as a country to      climb higher in the tables. I truly think that if there      wasn't a long summer break, and there were one or two week      breaks frequently throughout the course of the year to take      place of the large summer break. I think this would help      because the long summer break leaves ridiculous amounts of      time to forget everything you have learned in the school      year. I also think that Americans have requirements for a      second spoken language and to promote challenging classes      throughout our schooling experience. If education is truly      the key to our future, it needs to give us not only the      basics, but the skills to problem solve, create and be the      architects of America's new future.       Christie Kershaw, South Burlington High School (Finalist)       I believe our nation has shown much improvement over the      past year. Job growth rates have been increasing and      businesses have been getting back on their feet after an      economic low point. Even with these developments, there are      many more aspects that need to be addressed and improved. I      believe that as a country, the biggest issues we should be      focusing on are improving the state of our environment and      making college more affordable for students.       In my opinion, our government isn't taking the issue of      global climate change as seriously as it should be. We are no      longer able to turn our backs on this difficult issue because      we are already starting to see signs of its negative impacts      on us. With major droughts this summer in the Midwest and      powerful storms like Super storm Sandy, it's clear to see      that our climate is becoming more unpredictable and deadly,      and the root cause of this is from climate change. There      haven't been enough major moves put into effect by our      government to combat this issue and I believe that both      political parties should work closer together to come to an      agreement on how do this. There should be tighter regulations      on the amount of greenhouse gases factories can emit, higher      miles per gallon standards for new cars, and more money put      into the development of renewable energy sources.       In order to make advancements in the field of green energy      to slow down climate change, there must be scientists who are      able to do the work. But we may soon be seeing a decrease in      the number of these people because increasing costs for post-     secondary education make it difficult for those who want to      pursue a career in the sciences, or any other field, to do      so. In order to ensure that our country will have enough      highly educated citizens to help bring our nation closer to      solving our energy crisis, we need to make college more      affordable for everyone. Universities must lower their      tuition costs and have more scholarships and grants for a      wide range of students. If our government made loans easier      to get with lower interest rates, this would also help remedy      this problem. This particular issue is especially important      to me because, as I start my college career in less than a      year, I will be spending a lot of time worrying about how I      will be able to pay for my education. Many other students      feel the same way as me and some may have to postpone their      plans for higher education. A decrease in college-educated      citizens is not what our country needs right now.       These two issues of climate change and post-secondary      education affordability are to me the most important on the      list of many our country is facing. If both political parties      work together, they will be able to resolve these issues in      the near future.       Sonia Lowen, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)       The United States of America is the most powerful nation in      the entire world but it's currently facing severe issues. The      financial crash of 2008 resulted in the most disastrous      economy since the 1930's Great Recession. Climate change is      creating extreme weather disasters and destroying nature. Not      to mention that there is more income inequality in present      day than ever before. These are only a select few because the      list of issues goes on. The good news is that solutions are      accessible but the bad news is that as long as corporate      lobbyists continue to corrupt legislators, they will never be      reached. The United States Congress needs to stop allowing      corporate corruption.       The American economy is beginning to show signs of recovery      but it still has a long way to go. Millions are out of a job      and the government has a $16 trillion debt hovering over      their heads. The end of this recession is not going to come      fast, but there are provisions that will begin to facilitate      it, such as raising taxes not only on the rich but on the      corporations as well. This will cause more of their money to      go towards helping the government rather than manipulating      it.       America is not the only place being affected by climate      change but that does not, in any way, constitute sitting back      and hoping someone else will fix it. The United States makes      up 2% of the world's population yet they use 25% of the      world's resources. The environment's safety is dependent on      Congress to create new laws that will further regulate      manufacturers to reduce harmful emissions. America's economy      and climate would prosper greatly if they invested time and      money into green energy. Unfortunately, automobile and other      corporate lobbyists refuse to let that happen because they      can make more money manufacturing oil-powered products.       Corporate lobbying has corrupted what the Constitution      deems as the most powerful branch of government. Much of the      legislation that is passed is beneficial to industries,      whereas much of the legislation that would be beneficial to      the general population is rejected. The corporations have      gained this unhealthy amount of power by guaranteeing members      of Congress a future job in the private sector in exchange      for legislation that will favor whichever industry and/or      corporation they represent. It is a gross injustice of      congressional power.       The United States of America is at a fork in the road: they      can either choose to take a step in the right direction and      work for the interests of the people, or they can take a leap      in the wrong direction and work in the interests of      corporations. The country's future prosperity will be a      result of that decision. It is crucial that the government      abolishes corporate lobbying and strives to serve the people      this nation was built for. This will not be easy, but it is      critical in the process of rebuilding America.      Alexandra McFarland, Woodstock Union High School (Finalist)       As we have seen throughout our country over the past few      years, climate change is greatly affecting weather patterns.      In 2011 Vermont was hit by Hurricane Irene which devastated      much of the state and resulted in destroyed roads and      homeless families. In 2012 Hurricane Sandy came ashore in New      Jersey and New York changing even more of our fellow      Americans' lives with massive destruction. Last year snowfall      here in the Green Mountains was nearly half of the annual      average. This year we have already seen two major snowstorms      and snow levels are already approaching and surpassing the      total snowfall of last year. We have to be concerned with      these extreme weather changes. Weird weather may now be      normal weather and scientists predict such patterns only      worsening in the future unless we take action.       Climate change is a great problem that the United States,      although on the surface has     attempted to tackle, needs to face head on. We need to once      again be world leaders. Our first step is to launch a      nationwide campaign, as there remains a huge portion of the      population who still believe climate change is simply a myth,      to help folks understand the complex science. Second, our      nation needs to support scientific research and publicize new      discoveries that could help to better our understanding of      the climate change crisis as well as create and implement new      green technologies to combat it. We need to establish a      national plan to reduce our energy use.       The 350 Initiative, started by environmental activist Bill      McKibben, is a great goal for our nation to strive toward.      Through awareness and education programs that will lead us to      conserve as well as the development of new and innovative      green technologies, we will reduce atmospheric carbon levels      to a more sustainable level of 350 parts per million by the      year 2050. Scientists have shown that 350 is a safe upper      limit for the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. The 350      plan puts a solid number that we can strive to achieve on a      concept that so often feels much too great to tackle.       As one of the largest economies and one of the largest      consumers of fossil fuels, we should be a leader in changing      the way people around the globe think about our climate. It's      not simply here for us to use at will. It's here for us to      take care of and preserve for generations to come. These are      feats that our country has the resources, the will power and      the ingenuity to tackle.       We will not sit back and watch as extreme weather washes      over our great nation. As we have in the past, we will face      our worst problems and we will overcome them.       Rachel Moore, South Royalton Middle/High School (Finalist)       My family is like most families in Vermont: middle-class      citizens. Both my parents work to pay taxes and to put meals      on the table for my two brothers and me. Sometimes barely      getting by is all we can do. Life is not what it used to be.      When it is time for taxes to be paid for, it is always the      hardest, but we skim by. Taxes are killers to lower and      middle class citizens. I think the government should address      this problem in full detail. It is time to be fair and to put      the money back into the economy. In my opinion, when the      President gives his State of the Union speech, he should      promise to raise taxes for the rich and lower them for the      poor.       Lower-class citizens pay taxes like everyone else. The      difference between them and higher classes is their income.      Lower-class citizens do not receive a lot of income.      Therefore they have a harder time supporting their families.      There is a reason why so many people are losing their homes.      And most of those people are lower-class citizens. When the      President makes his State of the Union address, he, in my      opinion, should promise to raise taxes on the rich and lower      them for the poor. It is not fair that lower-class people      work twice as hard to keep their home, and to pay for food,      when higher-class citizens do not have to work as hard and      they do not need to worry. Lower-class citizens are not the      only ones who suffer from taxes.       Middle-class citizens also suffer from taxes. They have to      work harder to support their families than the higher-class.      Being a part of the middle-class group, I have experienced      the effects taxes have on our lives. Sometimes skimming by is      all my family is capable of doing. I have sat at the table      watching my mom write out and pay all her bills. I frequently      wish that I were rich, so I could support all my family      members and to get them to a better state. But wishing has      not done much for me, so I gave up. But now I have turned my      head to the President and his colleagues. Maybe my plea can      be heard by them, to lower taxes on the poor and raise it on      the rich. I want to live an American dream, not just dream      it. The more you raise taxes on the lower-class, which is the      majority of Americans, the less money will go back into the      economy. Tax the people who can spare an extra dollar, not      the people who depend on that dollar for a meal.       In my opinion, taxes should be raised on the rich and      lowered for the poor. Lower and middle classes have a hard      time supporting their families because of taxes. What about      that American dream people talk so much about? How will      future generations be able to live that dream if they cannot      even buy a house? It is time to do something, so, in my      opinion, when the President makes his State of the Union      address he should promise to lower taxes on the poor and      raise them to the rich.             Derryk O'Grady, Milton High School (Finalist)       My fellow Americans, we need to remember the tragic events      that occurred in Newtown, Connecticut, change in gun control      laws must happen. Unfortunate events like this can separate      weak countries and divide them, but we are different. A      tragic incident like this makes us more aware and stronger.      As we move forward, we will use this as a learning experience      to make this country safer by decreasing the ability to own a      gun.       In addition to gun control, the following are other major      topics of concern. First, we are in major national debt.      Second, unemployment rates are reaching an unbearable high.      Third we need to use more green energy and save more of the      world's oil. Lastly, the cost of the education is incredibly      high and still increasing. We must find solutions to these      issues and I believe I can do it.       We need to better our international relationships. We need      to stop involving ourselves in wars. Wars are a heavy burden,      and over the past twelve years, we spent $3.7 trillion and by      the end, possibly $4.4 trillion. This money does not need to      be spent. We need to take care of our own business, impose      higher taxes on the wealthy, and save money from wars.       More jobs need to be created for our country. The national      unemployment rate is around 7.7%, and in 2010, we reached      9.8%. A steady decline has to continue to happen. The more      people in this country working, the more revenue we can      bring. This will help chip away at the debt because the more      people working making money, the more money they can spend.      This series of working, making money, and putting it back      into the economy is what we need to create a surplus.       America's oil dependency is on a slight decrease since      president Obama took office. We have limited the use of other      countries oil by depending more on ourselves and this saves      money. We need to find more ways of using renewable energy      such as wind power, solar power, and hydro power: fossil fuel      is not everlasting, while renewable energy is.       We tell high school students that they need to go to      college to reach success, but then we throw them in debt. The      prices for college are astronomically high and continue to      increase. The average price for an in-state student is      $22,000 a year. How many students can afford to spend      $88,000? The answer is easy: not many. We need to find a      standard price range for colleges to work with.       As we grow as a nation, I promise we will find answers. Our      nation can overcome any challenge. Nothing brings this      country down. We will keep fighting these battles until we      have reached our goals. Thank you, and may God bless you all.             Saleban Olow, Winooski High School (Finalist)       Dear President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Fellow      Americans, From the birth of America, to America today, the      driving force and the heart of America has always been the      American success story. The United States of America is a      country of opportunity and accomplishment. We believe in our      country and our government. We believe that we will      eventually succeed, overcoming any obstacles that we face.      Our government and the entrepreneurs creating jobs made our      country the best among the world, but new issues have      appeared from the unemployment rate to the cost of college      tuition to gun control. These are what we need to address.       Perhaps the biggest problem we face as a nation is the      current rate of unemployment. According to the ``Department      of Numbers,'' during the November of 2012, the unemployment      rate is down to 7.7 percent of people in the United States.      This means that over 12 million Americans are jobless,      including my mom. Many American families are losing their      jobs because companies obtain their jobs. Companies and      wealthy people are getting richer and those from the middle      class and poverty levels are falling toward and below the      poverty line. This is particularly true given the fact that      the dollar is not worth what it was in the past. As a result,      inflation is boosting up the price of all goods and services.      As unemployment has been rising, the cost of education is      increasing. Today, American colleges have imposed an      extraordinary increase in tuition. Additionally, there are      also issues such as gay rights, Social Security, illegal      immigration and the War on Terror.       In spite of these factors, many students in the United      States look for higher education after high school. They want      to go to college and have a good career. If the government's      influence results in increasing college costs, then students      like ``ME'' will not be able to afford college. The average      family cannot fully support their child's tuition costs. Our      parents' incomes are spent paying for college debt. While      many college graduates remain jobless, they still must face      debts of more than 90K dollars. For our newly hatching      generation, I believe that college tuition should be cheaper      for everyone no matter what economic level the family is.       Regarding another critical issue, each year thousands of      Americans lose their lives through gun related problems. Guns      are designed to kill people easily and many lives are lost      each year because the United States doesn't have strict gun      control laws. The deadly massacre shooting at a Connecticut      elementary school was heartbreaking. The outcome of this      tragedy resulted in the deaths of 20 children and 6 adults, a      painful scenario. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 4      and 9 years were slaughtered. It is my strong opinion that      the government should pass a gun law that would reduce gun      problems. President Obama and fellow lawmakers, I feel you      need to be creative and figure out a better way to ensure      young kids' safety. By choosing you, the United States is      going in the right direction for a better future.       In conclusion, the challenges that we face with      unemployment, college tuition and gun control are ones that      we must currently address. We must make significant changes      in order to progress. The success of our nation must be made      by building upon our society. As in the past, we can and      always will work hard and make America and the world a better      place.       God bless the United States of America.          Robert Pennypacker, St. Johnsbury Academy (Finalist)       This year's Tax Rate for the richest are the lowest this      Country has ever seen!       Today's tax rate means that person making $379,150 pays the      same tax as a person making seven million dollars. Thirty      years ago this was different. In 1981 there were 16 tax      brackets. Today there are six. The highest tax bracket for      today's federal income tax is 35% for a person making      $379,150 or more. That means you're taxing a small business      owner the same rate as a giant corporation president like      General Electric's Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt who has a      salary of 3.3 million dollars as of 2011.       If and when the tax rate increases for the rich like many      Americans want, it will not hurt the economy like the GOP is      stating. Last September, the Congressional Research Service      published a report countering Republican claims that lowering      top tax rates would lead, or had led, to higher economic      growth. ``Changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal      rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear      correlated with economic growth,'' the report concluded.      Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell responded by      having the report suppressed, but its findings were      incontrovertible. This shows that, with the rise in taxes for      the upper class, it will not affect the economy like many      Republicans are stating.       Also, we are at war with the Taliban and yet we still have      lower taxes than ever before. How are we paying to support      this war? Never before has the United States had lower taxes      during a war. In 1943, during WWII, the tax rate for a person      making $2,593,984 (adjusted for inflation) was 88%. In that      same year a person making $155,000 (adjusted for inflation)      was 38%. During the Vietnam War, in 1966, the tax rate for a      person making $629,530 (adjusted for inflation) was 70%.      Also, in that same year, a person making $83,104 (adjusted      for inflation) was 36%. Today's tax rate, as of 2011, for a      person making $379,150 is 35%. A person making 1.1 million      dollars tax rate pay the same 35%.       Should a person making $379,150 pay the same rate as multi-     millionaires? No they shouldn't. Why do we have the lowest      taxes ever in the United States and yet be in a war? The      United States should have taxes similar to years before. The      middle class should pay the same rate. The rates for the      middle class have stayed within the same percentage for the      last 70 years. Meanwhile the upper class has gone from a 90      percent tax rate in the 1940's and 50's to 70 percent from      1960's through 1981, and 50 percent in 1982 through 1986. Now      they have a 35 percent tax rate which is the same as a middle      class citizen. The United States should raise the taxes of      the rich.        Rebecca Potter, Brattleboro Union High School (Finalist)       Congress is dysfunctional because of priority      discrepancies. Some in our government seem to believe that      holds, filibusters, and less legal tactics of delay and      obstruction serve as necessary means to a greater GOP-     dominated end. Others argue that while disagreement is key in      a true democracy, so is compromise. Certain members of the      Senate, where unanimous consent remains relevant in the      scheduling and timing of legislation, stand by ``holding''      the Senate's progress on a bill or committee action. Others      point out that this is 2012, where a hold in Senate exists as      a euphemism for indefinite or permanent vetoes, often done in      secret. In both houses, many forget that the true party      holding the majority in Congress is the white, heterosexual,      wealthy men.       While Congress' dysfunction directly correlates with the      partisan gridlock we've been witnessing over the past four      years, this has more to do with flaws in the system itself      rather than the puppets within it. Sure, people are selfish      and want the connections voting a certain way or hiring a      specific set of hands will bring--but what ingenious economic      system provides the impetus for such action? Capitalism, at      the root of it all, enables members of Congress and the      wealthy holding the strings above them to exist as money-     motivated figures of power. The privatization of education,      healthcare, and human services creates the legislative      standstill we've got in Congress, which dedicates an absurd      amount of time to arguing over non-issues in a partisan lock.      This allows legislation that matters often gets nixed in      committee or shoved through without necessary debate.       Capitalist society has created a dysfunctional Congress,      and until we fix the system we will keep getting the same      results. The bandage for this infectious situation is      compromise in the Senate and House of Representatives--     impending compromise, I predict, what with a certain cliff      looming over our heads. Antibiotics for a more permanent      change would mean a re-evaluation of everything we've grown      up being told was ``American'': federalized elections,      spending limits on campaigns, socialized care for humans and      our unalienable rights (health, education, safety), and      public ownership of the land of the free.         Austin Price, Mt. Anthony Union High School (Finalist)       My fellow Americans, Our country is evolving and changing      in ways it has never before. We can either adjust or get left      in the past. America was once the greatest power in the world      and I believe we can get back to that, but we must take hold      and lead with force. Although we are on the path back, we      still need to focus on our military, economy, and civil      rights.       Our military is the backbone of our success as a nation.      With over nine hundred military bases internationally, we      need our military to be strong as ever to protect our trading      partners as well as us. The necessary changes that must be      made are to increase our presence in the countries that are      filled with enemies of the state and looking to do harm to      the United States and its citizens. We must increase the      spending budget for the military so that we will maintain our      internationally renowned army. We as a country have the      responsibility to not only protect our rights, but to protect      the civil rights of others who don't have the ability      themselves.       Further, we are in one of the greatest recessions since the      Great Depression; we face unprecedented challenges as a      nation to get back on top. If any country can come out of a      depression and be even stronger than before, it is America,      the home of the brave. Were the spending in any sector to      increase, then there would be a huge influx of jobs that were      created by all that new money. A higher tax rate for the      wealthiest of Americans will help this nation get out of the      greatest debt it has ever been in. It is time for everyone to      pay their fair share. Although the taxes do need to be      increased, increasing the taxes on small business owners will      only hurt our economy because they will hire fewer workers.       There is also a great civil rights issue that must be      addressed in our country. This is the marriage of      homosexuals. I am proud to say that the state I reside in has      done what few other states are brave enough to do by creating      civil unions. There are a shocking forty-one states that ban      same-sex marriage compared to only nine that allow it. I am      asking for an immediate legalization of same-sex marriage in      all states, similar to that of the desegregation laws of the      sixties and seventies.       If we as a nation are to be prosperous, we must grow and      adapt to the world around us. In order to reach our goals      their will have to be sacrifices made by every American. We      must make changes to the economy, military, and civil rights      in order to reach our lofty goals and reap the benefits of      our hard work.                          ____________________
