 It is an amendment related to interchange fees. Interchange fees are the fees charged to commercial establishments which accept credit cards. So if I owned a restaurant and accepted Visa or MasterCard, when my customer, who has a bill, presents the credit card to pay for it, then I have to pay a percentage of that bill to the credit card company. That is called the interchange fee.  That is separate and apart from the customer's relationship with the credit card company. This is the relationship of the merchant, the retail establishment, the small business, with the credit card company. Unfortunately, over the years, small businesses across America have had little or no bargaining power with the major credit card companies.
