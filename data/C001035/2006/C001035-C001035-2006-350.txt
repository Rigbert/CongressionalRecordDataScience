President, I rise today to express my support for a provision in S. 2611 that will level the playing field for minor league sports teams that depend on getting the best athletic talent. Under current law, minor league players who have to use the H-2B visa category face severe visa shortages, while Major League players qualify automatically for plentiful P-1 visas. This unfair discrepancy in the law needs to be remedied, and my amendment, which was accepted by the Judiciary Committee and is now in the underlying bill, provides a commonsense solution.  By way of background, H-2B visas are intended for use by industries facing seasonal demands for labor, such as the hospitality and agricultural industries. What many people do not know is that, in addition to loggers, hotel and restaurant employees, and many other types of seasonal workers, the H-2B visa category is also used by many talented, highly competitive foreign athletes who are recruited by U.S. teams.  A chronic H-2B visa shortage over the last few years has posed challenges for all industries using the H-2B visa category. In both fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the 66,000 visa cap was met early in the year. While we were successful last year in crafting a temporary 2-year fix for the H-2B shortage, this fix will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. I commend my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, for offering an amendment to this bill that would extend the current exemption of returning H-2B workers until 2009.  However, solving this problem goes beyond fixing the H-2B visa cap. Minor league players simply do not belong in the same visa category as seasonal workers. There is no reason why Major League players can qualify automatically for P-1 visas, which are granted to talented athletes, artists, and entertainers, while minor league players cannot. My amendment would remedy this unfair situation.  The problem of requiring minor league athletes to use the H-2B visa category has posed a particular challenge to those of us in Maine who enjoy cheering on our sports teams. The MAINEiacs, a Canadian junior hockey league team that plays its games in Lewiston, ME, has faced tremendous difficulties obtaining the H-2B visas necessary for the majority of its players to come to the United States to play in the team's first home games.  Last year, due to uncertainty surrounding the availability of H-2B visas at the end of the fiscal year, the team had to reschedule its season home opener and cancel several early season games. This forced the team to schedule make-up games for those normallyplayed in September. The problems created by the visa situation creates an unnecessary hardship for this team, in addition to threatening the revenue the team generates for the city of Lewiston and businesses in the surrounding area.  The Portland Sea Dogs, a Double-A baseball team affiliated with the Boston Red Sox, is another of the many teams that relies on H-2B visas to bring some of its most skilled players to the United States. Thousands of fans come each year to see this team, and others like it across the country, play one of America's favorite sports. Due to the shortage of H-2B visas, however, Major League Baseball reports that, in 2004 and early 2005, more than 350 talented young, foreign baseball players were prevented from coming to the U.S. to play for minor league teams. These teams have been a traditional proving ground for athletes hoping to make it to the major leagues and players often move from these teams to major league rosters.  The inclusion of these highly skilled athletes in the H-2B visa category seems particularly unusual when you consider that major league athletes are permitted to use an entirely different non-immigrant visa category--the P-1 visa. This visa is available to athletes who are deemed by the Citizenship and Immigration Services to perform at an ``internationally recognized level of performance.'' Arguably, any foreign athlete whose achievements have earned him a contract with an American team would meet this definition.  CIS, however, has interpreted this category to exclude minor and amateur league athletes. Instead, the P-1 visa is typically reserved for only those athletes who have already been promoted to major league sports. Unfortunately, this creates something of a catch-22 for minor league athletes--if an H-2B visa shortage means that promising athletes are unable to hone their skills, and to prove themselves, in the minor leagues, they are far less likely to ever earn the major league contract currently required to obtain a P-1 visa.  A simple, commonsense solution would be to expand the P-1 visa category to include minor league and certain amateur-level athletes who have demonstrated a significant likelihood of graduating to the major leagues. Major League Baseball strongly supports the expansion of the P-1 visa category to include professional minor league baseball players. In correspondence to me, the league has pointed out that, by making P-1 visas available to this group of athletes, teams would be able to make player development decisions based on the talent of its players, without being constrained by visa quotas. The P-1 category, the league believes, is appropriate for minor league players because these are the players that Major League clubs have selected as some of the best baseball prospects in the world.  There is no question that Americans are passionate about sports. We have high expectations for our teams, and demand only the best from our athletes. By expanding the P-1 visa category, we will make it possible for athletes to be selected based on talent and skill, rather than visa availability. In addition, we would reduce some pressure on the H-2B visa category making more of those visas available to the industries that need them.  I am pleased that this important provision is included in S. 2611, and I thank the Judiciary Committee for their willingness to incorporate it into the underlying bill.  I ask unanimous consent that letters endorsing my amendment from the Lewiston MAINEiacs Hockey Club and Major League Baseball be printed in the Record.  There: being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                Lewiston MAINEiacs                                             Hockey Club, LLC,                                      Lewiston, ME, April 7, 2006.     Re ``MAINEiacs'' amendment to enable American sports teams to          recruit talented players from abroad.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Collins: I wish to express the Lewiston      MAINEiacs Hockey Club's support for your efforts with regards      to ``MAINEiacs'' amendment to enable American sports teams to      recruit talented players from abroad.       The Lewiston MAINEiacs Hockey Club is the sole U.S. based      franchise in the 18-member Quebec Major Junior Hockey League      (QMJHL). The QMJHL together with the Ontario Hockey League      (OHL) and the Western Hockey League (WHL) make up the      Canadian Hockey League which comprises a total of 58 teams.      Of those 58 franchises, 9 are located in the United States      (OHL-3, WHL-5, QMJHL-1).       The CHL is the largest developer of talent for the National      Hockey League (NHL). More than 70% of all players, coaches      and general managers who have played in the NHL are graduates      of the Canadian Hockey League.       The majority of players in the Canadian Hockey League are      Canadian, although each team is permitted to have a maximum      of 2 Europeans on their rosters. There is also an increasing      number of elite U.S. born players now playing in the league.       In January of 2004, the City of Lewiston purchased the      Colisee in order to complete the first round of renovations      to the facility which was in excess of two million dollars.      The Colisee has undergone a second phase of renovations in      excess of 1.8 millions dollars that entails a three-story      addition to the front of the building providing for new      offices, box office, pro-shop, food and beverage concessions      and a new private VIP suite that can accommodate more than      130 fans per game. The City of Lewiston contracted the day-     to-day management of the Colisee to Global Spectrum, a      subsidiary of Comcast-Spectacor, one of the largest and most      successful facility management companies in North America.       The results of the current visa laws have forced all U.S.      based franchises in the CHL to delay the commencement of      their regular season until or after October 1 of each year      due to the restrictions of the of the H-2B temporary work      visa regulations. This has caused significant hardship on      teams, their facilities and the 3 leagues. U.S. based      franchises are forced to try and make-up games that would      normally be scheduled in the month of the September later in      the season, putting both the teams and their fans at      disadvantage before the season even commences.       Under your leadership, should congressional legislation      make available P-1 visas to Major Junior players of the CHL,      the success of all 9 U.S. based CHL franchises would be      greatly enhanced by ensuring that all 58 teams have an equal      chance at attracting and developing the best available      talent.       It is the hope of the Lewiston MAINEiacs that your      colleagues in the Senate follow your leadership and endorse      your recommendations for the amendment to the immigration      reform bill to ensure the viability and success of not only      our franchise--but the 8 other U.S. based clubs in the      Canadian Hockey League.           Sincerely,                                                    Matt McKnight,     Vice President & Governor.                                  ____                                       Office of the Commissioner,                                        Major League Baseball,                                     New York, NY, April 27, 2006.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Re legislation for nonimmigrant alien status for certain          athletes.       Dear Senator Collins: I write to express Major League      Baseball's support as you redouble your efforts to make Minor      League players eligible for P-l work visas.       Unlike other professional athletes, baseball players need      substantial experience in the Minor Leagues to develop their      talents and skills to Major League quality. To get that      necessary experience, young players are signed by Major      League Clubs and assigned to play for Minor League affiliates      throughout the United States, such as Maine's own Portland      Sea Dogs.       Approximately 40 percent of these young players come from      foreign countries, and MLB must obtain H2-B visas in order      for them to enter the U.S. Under current law, however, these      visas are capped, and the demand for them is so great across      a wide range of industries, many Minor Leaguers are not being      afforded the opportunity to play here and develop into Major      League baseball players.       The lack of available visas prevented more than 350 young      baseball players from performing in the United States in 2004      and 2005, and will prevent even more from doing so this year.      Additionally, over the past few years several Clubs have      shied away from drafting foreign (mostly Canadian) players      whom they otherwise might have selected in the annual First-     Year Player Draft, because of the risk of not being able to      obtain visas for those players. In fact, in 2004, signings of      Canadian players declined 80% over the previous year, and in      2005 only four of the twenty-five Canadian players who were      drafted were eventually signed by a Club. The resulting      impact on the quality of the product on the field is      significant, particularly for almost forty million Americans      who attend Minor League Baseball games each year.       Under your leadership, Congress can ensure that the best      baseball prospects from around the world will have the      opportunity to develop here in the United States, without the      constraint that the H-2B visa cap imposes. Minor League      Baseball shares our support of your efforts. The Major League      Baseball Players Association also supports allowing the best      young players to develop here in the United States.       Major Legue Baseball hopes that your Senate colleagues will      follow your leadership     and pursue a legislatiye remedy to a problem that is      threatening to weaken Baseball's Minor League system.           Sincerely,                                                  Robert A. DuPuy,                              President & Chief Operating Officer.
