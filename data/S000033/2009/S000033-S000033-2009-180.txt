 President, I wish to rise today to honor two Vermont businesses, Chroma Technology Corporation and Seventh Generation, which have been named to the 2009 List of Most Democratic Workplaces. This list, compiled by the labor rights organization WorldBlu, selects the gold standard in fair labor practices each year.  By creating incentives for workers to constructively participate in the governance of their company, Chroma Technology Corporation of Rockingham, VT, exemplifies the ideal of the Most Democratic Workplace. With a decentralized power structure, and with every worker eligible to become a member of the board of directors, employees genuinely play a major role in business decisions and company practices. Moreover, Chroma is 100 percent employee owned, and sets a limit on executive compensation, a limit determined by a ratio of the pay scale for the lowest-paid workers in the firm. Chroma has also developed an innovative profit-sharing system for all its employees.  The other Vermont business to receive this prestigious award, Seventh Generation, is a producer of cleaning and home care products in Burlington, VT. This impressive firm truly challenges its employees to not only participate in all aspects of the company's operations, but also to take the company's mission of positive change and apply it to the outside world. Employees can apply for committee-approved paid sabbaticals in order to participate in philanthropic endeavors. To foster companywide professional development, Seventh Generation combines teambuilding with cross-functional communication so employees gain perspective on the company's big picture operations and goals. Through these professional opportunities and many other policies, employees work outside of the box and come to share the mission of the company.  Perhaps not all companies can adopt every strategy of these two industry leaders, but we should recognize the value of their business models. Both Chroma and Seventh Generation go above and beyond the duty of an employer, and our entire economy benefits from the investment they make in training the best employees possible. I urge every American company--indeed every lawmaker in Congress--to consider the lessons we can take from these Most Democratic Workplaces. Improving job training and developing human resources is important, especially in our current challenging economy; at the same time, investment in workers creates a lasting benefit that lays the foundation for a strong future.  Treating workers with dignity and respect, enabling them to not only develop their capacities, but participate in decisionmaking, is essential to creating democratic and productive workplaces.  Mr. President, I commend Chroma Technology and Seventh Generation for a job very well done and to congratulate them on their selection as a 2009 Most Democratic Workplace.                          ____________________
