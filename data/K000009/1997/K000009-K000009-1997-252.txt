Speaker, I wish today to pay tribute to a man of rare commitment and resolute conviction. Calton ``Cal'' Krueger of Toledo, OH passed away on May 24, 1997. We shall miss him and his leadership as an unwavering voice for the powerless and exploited. He loved all of God's children and sought to protect them.  Cal was a minister in the United Church of Christ for 38 years before retiring in 1990 from First United Church of Christ, whose congregation he led for 25 years. A deeply moral, strong, and compassionate pastor, and a veteran, Cal was most known for his social activism. He was deeply involved in world affairs, particularly in Central America, and belonged to Pastors for Peace, Veterans for Peace, the Toledo Metropolitan Mission, the Interracial Religious Coalition, the Interfaith Justice and Peace Center of Northwest Ohio, and the Toledo Area Committee on Central America.  Promoting desegregation and racial harmony in our communities' neighborhoods, peace for all nations, refugee resettlement, nuclear disarmament, and many other social and global causes, Cal was part of an elite corps of clergy who truly lived out the words and deeds of Christ and His teachings. Cal was a man emulated by many but equaled by few. Our community extends its sincere sympathy and deepest admiration for the Krueger family. to his wife Gena, his children Geoffrey, Jill, Stephen, Jonathan, and Amy and his grandchildren, thank you for sharing this gifted man of faith with us. His depth of understanding about international politics and his own commitment to make a difference were precious and inspiring. We are honored he dwelt among us.                          ____________________
