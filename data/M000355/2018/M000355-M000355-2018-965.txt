 President, yesterday I had an opportunity to meet with Judge Brett Kavanaugh as we begin preparations for his confirmation process to the Supreme Court. It is really impossible not to come away impressed. Judge Kavanaugh is the real deal. He has the all-star legal resume and the top-light academic credentials. His extensive judicial record is defined by fairness, thoughtfulness, thoroughness, and analytical precision. I was already confident the President had made an outstanding choice. Now I am even more confident. My colleagues here and Americans around the country won't have to take my word for it; just look to one of Judge Kavanaugh's former professors at Yale Law School. Here is what Professor Akhil Amar wrote in the New York Times: ``It is hard to name anyone with judicial credentials as strong as those of Judge Kavanaugh.''  Current faculty at Yale Law described him as a ``true intellectual,'' ``a leading thinker,'' and ``a wonderful mentor and teacher to our students.''  Even at Harvard, his alma mater's archrival, a scholar agrees that Judge Kavanaugh is ``a generous, honorable, kind person.''  Ask the legal professionals who have clerked for him on the DC Circuit.
