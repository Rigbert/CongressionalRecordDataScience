 It is our expectation that the first week back, which will be the week of July 9, I believe, Tuesday, the 10th, at 6:30 p.m., we will not have appropriation bills that week. There will be legislation that week, and we will give notice of that next week so that one can anticipate it for the week that we come back from the July break. But we do not expect appropriation bills to start until the following week, the week of July 16.
