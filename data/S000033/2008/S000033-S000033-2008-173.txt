 I thank the Senator from Illinois.  Mr. President, I will conclude because the Senator from Illinois made the point better than I can make it. Every Member of the Senate knows this is a huge issue. In their heart, every Senator knows there is something immoral, that there is something outrageous about hard-working people paying 25, 30 percent, especially at a time when the Fed is lowering interest rates.  I say to my colleagues, it is no great secret. The financial services industry is very powerful. We all know that. They make huge campaign contributions. They have a lot of power here. But I hope that on this amendment, we have the courage to stand up to them.  In concluding, I remind my colleagues that in 1991, when Senator D'Amato offered a similar amendment, there was overwhelming bipartisan support. The American people want us to act on this issue. As the Senator from Illinois indicated, this is directly related to the housing crisis, and I think it is time we move forward and put a cap on interest rates.  I yield the floor.
