 We are trying to work through. Members have a lot of priority amendments. We are trying to make sure our lists match. Our staffs are working very hard to go back and forth so everybody has equal time on the amendments which are a priority to each side. I apologize for taking time to do it. We are trying to come to an agreement, and sometimes it takes a few minutes.  I yield the floor to the Senator from Alaska.
