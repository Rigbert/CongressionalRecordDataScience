I said wait a minute, do you think that Chrysler, which is building a new large Dodge Ram truck plant, a truck that sells for a minimum, I think, of $15,000, some of them sell for as much as $30,000, I said do you think Mexicans with their former average earnings of $1,700 a year, this week reduced to about $800 or $900, are going to be buying many of the Dodge Rams which they build? And they say, well, no.  I said, have you noticed that since Chrysler or other United States firms started building these trucks in Mexico, that the price has come down? Oh, no.  Have you noticed that the profits have gone up, but the price has not come down?  Well, now that you say that, yeah, I guess I did notice they had their most profitable quarter ever.  I say that is the point. Even if you can argue that we should produce goods overseas because we can exploit cheap labor and it will be beneficial to the American consumer, the bottom line is that does not happen. The prices do not go down. The profits go up.  Nike Corp., based in Portland, OR, they don't make anything in America anymore. They used to manufacture shoes here.
