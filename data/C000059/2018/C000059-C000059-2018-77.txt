Chair, I am happy to accept the gentleman's amendment and work with him and the rest of my colleagues to address the public safety and justice construction needs in Indian Country.  The ranking member and I have worked very closely together in Indian Country to recognize the shortcomings throughout Indian Country in Indian education, Indian healthcare, and certainly within the Indian public safety and justice problems that we are having throughout the United States.  Mr. Chair, I certainly support an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I just want to thank the chair and the ranking member for all their commitment to Indian Country and for their support of this amendment.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Chair, across Indian Country, access to safe and clean drinking water is a major issue that we are obligated to address.  In the northwest corner of my district, the Hopi Tribe has a water system with over three times the Federal maximum standard for safe drinking water for arsenic. Let me repeat that: three times the amount of arsenic than the maximum standard considered safe.  Members of the Tribe have no choice but to use this unsafe water. This is beyond unacceptable in any community in America, but it is a fact of life for Tribes across the Nation.  No matter where you are born, no child or family in America should have to risk their health because they can't access clean water.  This basic lack of water infrastructure has limited many Tribes' ability to unleash their economic potential in rural communities across the country.  The Hopi Tribe has limited financial resources. In fact, it has an 80 percent unemployment rate. Our country's unemployment rate is 4 percent. It also has a mine that is potentially going to close that supplies 80 percent of its general funds.  They have not sat idly waiting for the Federal Government to fix the problem it created. The Tribe has launched the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project to directly address this challenge.  Through the project, the Tribe has identified arsenic-free wells and mapped the pipeline route that will deliver arsenic-free water to villages and towns across the reservation. All the Tribe needs to complete the project is construction funding.  Unfortunately, funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs Construction account has not been adequate enough to fund projects across country like Hopi's. That is why I am offering a commonsense amendment to increase BIA's construction funding by $10 million.  Increasing this funding for construction of water infrastructure will enable the BIA to assist communities in building water systems that will deliver clean drinking water to schools and homes, some for the first time.  This amendment is not only a wise investment for Tribal communities as they seek to develop their economies and attract investment, but it is also a moral imperative.  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to increase access to clean water for tribal communities across the country.  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
