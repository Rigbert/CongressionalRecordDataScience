Michel.  Bob Michel's interest in veterans' affairs began when he served in the Army's 39th Infantry Regiment, fighting on Normandy Beach during World War II. Wounded by machine gun fire during the Battle of the Bulge, he was discharged from the military as a disabled veteran after earning The Purple Heart, two Bronze Stars, and four Battle Stars.  Michel began his life of public service in 1957, serving the citizens of the 18th District of Illinois in the House of Representatives. Because of his hard work and dedication to his constituents, he was elected minority whip and eventually House minority leader. He was also actively involved in the creation of several pieces of legislation that dealt with veterans' affairs, including a resolution that helped to remove obstacles to employment of partially disabled persons honorably discharged from the Armed Forces.  A veteran himself, Michel understood the need for quality health care for those who served in the military. He used his prominent position in the House of Representatives to lead the effort to establish a VA clinic in Peoria. The clinic he helped to create now serves up to 10,000 veterans a year, in as many as 12 counties in central Illinois. The clinic offers a variety of services for veterans, including medical and mental health services, ophthalmology, audiology and assistance for the homeless.  Representative Ray LaHood, who now holds the Congressional seat previously held by Bob Michel, has introduced companion legislation in the House. Representative LaHood's bill is supported by all House members of the Illinois delegation.  I hope that the Senate will act expeditiously in enacting this legislation. This bill will serve to honor Robert H. Michel who served our country through his service in the military and Congress.                          ____________________
