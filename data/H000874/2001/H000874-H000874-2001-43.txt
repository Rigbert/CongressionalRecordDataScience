Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, who is doing such an outstanding job as the ranking member, and I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Taylor), and I thank Ed and Liz for the outstanding job they are doing. We are glad to have Liz Dawson with us. She is doing an outstanding job, and now doing an outstanding job with the security of our Capitol. I appreciate our former Staff Director's assistance as well.  Mr. Speaker, I am not going to take a long time, but I want to talk about just a couple of things, actually three things that are in this bill with which I am very pleased.  First of all, we are moving ahead on enhancing security in this complex. That is absolutely essential. I have been talking about that for some years. I appreciate the fact that the committee has now provided the Capitol police with all of the officers that they can train within the next year to fully fund the security requirements and the Capitol police in terms of their safety as well as the safety of this complex, both from a physical standpoint and from an individual personal standpoint. I do not mean us personally, but the individuals in the Capitol.                              {time}  1215  It also restores pay parity of the Capitol Police with the Park Police and Secret Service. I think that is important, because we do not want to spend a lot of money training people simply to have them go off to other agencies. So I thank the committee for their efforts in that regard.  Let me mention two additional provisions, and then I will cease. Both of these provisions are related to legislative branch workers.  First, section 133 of the bill will finally end the practice of employing temporary workers for long periods without providing them access to the same valuable Federal benefits that permanent employees enjoy from the first days on the job. I think that is important as a personnel policy, and I think it is important, from a fairness point of view, to our personnel.  The Architect now employs more than 300 such workers, mostly on construction projects. Many have been employed almost continually for years, and in some cases over 15 years, and still have not had benefits: no retirement, no health care. That is obviously, when one is 25 years of age, thought to be not of much consequence; when one gets to be 50 years of age and one looks back, it is of great consequence. These workers will now have access to benefits, and no new hires can work more than 1 year without getting them.  Secondly, section 310 will ensure that the House telephone operators, who have played a key role in assuring continuity of operations during the instant crisis, will always receive the same annual wage adjustment ordered by House administration for all classified House employees.  We found a discrepancy existed. I will not go into the reasons that discrepancy existed, but it is now resolved.  There are a lot of other excellent provisions in this bill. I agree with the chairman and with the ranking member, this is not a controversial bill. It is a good bill.  Again, I thank both the chairman and the ranking member and our staffs for working so hard to make it so.  Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent bill that every member should support.  It fully funds a number of accounts, including the Government Printing Office, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congressional Research Service, key agencies that directly support the Congress.  It fully funds the American Folklife Center in the Library, including the veterans' oral history project. It funds the new sound-recording preservation program. It provides needed funds to improve services in the law library.  To enhance security in the complex, it funds all the extra Capitol Police officers that the department can hire and train during fiscal 2002. I've fought for over two years for enough police manpower to assure adequate security. A key measure of adequate security is deployment of a minimum of two officers on every door.  We're not there yet, but this bill moves us in that direction and I hope we will move still further next year.  The bill does restore pay parity for the Capitol Police with the Park Police and Secret Service Uniformed officers.  The bill extends GPO's early-out/buy-out authority for 3 years, and funds a 4.6 percent COLA.  The bill otherwise provides sufficient funds for the operation of member offices, committees, and the officers of the House.  Mr. Speaker, there are two provisions that I want to mention in particular, both related to legislative-branch workers.  It funds the same $65 transit benefit available in the executive branch for every legislative-branch agency. I especially want to compliment my friend from Virginia for making this a priority. I will work with Chairman Ney in House Administration to authorize the increased benefit promptly for House employees.  First, section 133 will finally end the Architect of the Capitol's practice of employing temporary workers for long periods without providing them access to the same valuable Federal benefits that permanent employees enjoy from their first days on the job.  The Architect now employs more than 300 such workers, mostly on construction projects. Many have been employed almost continuously for years, as ``temporary'' workers. Under my provision, these workers will have access to benefits, and no new hires can work more than 1 year without benefits.  Second, section 310 will ensure that the house telephone operators, who have played a key role in assuring continuity of operations during the instant crisis, will always receive the same annual wage adjustment ordered by House Administration for all classified House employees. That initially didn't happen this year.  Mr. Speaker, there are many other excellent provisions in this bill, far too many to list in the time allotted. Suffice it to say that it has been a joy to work this year with the gentlemen from North Carolina and Virginia, and with the able new subcommittee clerk, Elizabeth Dawson, all of whom I sincerely thank.  I also want to thank Mark Murray, the minority subcommittee clerk, Tim Aiken of Mr. Moran's staff, and Roger Szemraj [``Shem-rye''] and Julie Little of Ms. Kaptur's staff, for their fine work. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
