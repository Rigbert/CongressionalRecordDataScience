President, is I do not want to cut into anybody else's time. But since I do not see anybody else seeking recognition, I will continue, as I have throughout consideration of this bill, to point out some of the issues we face in our foreign aid bill. Maybe one issue is especially good to look at as we look at the world's attention focused on Afghanistan.  I was struck by what I heard over and over again from various military analysts and others; that is, there are millions of unexploded landmines scattered throughout that mountainous country. It is not hyperbole when I say millions of unexploded landmines; there are millions. Most of them are plastic Russian mines--those are probably the most difficult to detect--but some are Chinese mines, some are British mines, some are Italian mines, and some are American mines.  The reason I mention that is, any one of those mines could kill a soldier--ours or theirs--or kill a child. A lot of them are designed to injure a combatant, blow a leg off a soldier, the idea being, if the soldier is not dead, it might tie up three or four of his comrades to take care of him or carry him back to a safe place. But, of course, a shiny little mine that might blow a leg off a soldier--it looks like a shiny toy to a child--sometimes blows off the hands, arms, or head of a child. In fact, the vast majority of those who will be injured by them will be noncombatants.  Because landmines are also weapons of terror, they are routinely used to terrorize not combatants but civilian populations. Afghanistan is only one example. There are lots of countries--dozens--that are plagued by mines.  Landmines maim and kill innocent people every day in the Balkans, in Southeast Asia, Africa, Chechnya, even in Central America. What is as tragic is that the killing goes on long after the war that brought the mines is over.  We usually see the newspaper articles or television specials where the parties come together and they sign the armistice, they sign a peace agreement at the end of the war. They say: OK, it is all over. We are now friends again, or at least we are noncombatants. They leave. The armies march off, the tanks drive away, and so forth, but the mines stay. A child not even born at the time the peace agreement is signed is killed when first learning to walk.  We have mines and unexploded munitions from the United States in Vietnam and Laos. They were dropped when I first came to the Senate a quarter of a century ago. They are still blowing people up. They are still killing and wounding people in Vietnam and Laos.  In Bosnia, most American casualties were from landmines. The same was true in Somalia.  In Afghanistan, we gave mines to the anti-Russian forces, some of whom are now the Taliban. You know the phrase: What goes around comes around. We gave the Taliban landmines. We also gave them Stinger missiles. But landmines, think of that; we gave some of the Taliban landmines. When our troops go there--as they already have, according to the press accounts, and we assume will continue to go there--one of the biggest dangers they will face is some of the landmines we left there from the 1980s.  We and the rest of the international community are going to be paying for many years to clean up this deadly legacy. The right thing to do is to clean it up. In fact, this bill contains $40 million for demining programs and has another $12 million to assist victims of war, including mine victims.  But I think of the $12 million or so that gets spent every year in the Leahy War Victims Fund, and the tens of millions of dollars in demining, and I think, wouldn't it be wonderful if wedid not have to spend any of that money because the world stopped the indiscriminate use of landmines and we had a chance to clean up what was there.  A lot of nations already have stopped using them. Every member of NATO, with the exception of one, has agreed to stop using them. Ironically enough, even though we are spending a lot of money to clean up landmines, the one nation in NATO that has not agreed to stop using landmines is the United States.  Every nation in the Western Hemisphere has banned the use of landmines except two, the United States and Cuba. Interesting company. Cuba should ban them; the United States should ban them. Every other country in our Western Hemisphere has.  Two months ago, terrorism was a foreign concept to so many Americans. Anthrax was a foreign concept. But it is not any longer. We have experienced the tragedy and fear that people in many countries have lived with for years.  Fortunately, in our Nation, when it comes to landmines, we have not used landmines on American soil since the Civil War. I can't help but think if landmines were used in this country to terrorize Americans, as they are in other countries, then the United States, I am sure, would have joined the 142 other nations in banning their use.  Ask people who have served in combat. Most people who actually served in combat tell me that mines are more trouble than they are worth, and any enemy worth its salt can breach a minefield in a matter of minutes. A child cannot; the enemy can.  You scatter landmines and then your own troops--who often need to maneuver quickly because sometimes the battlefront moves very quickly--risk triggering their own mines. The battle might be over in a matter of hours, but even self-deactivating mines stay longer than that. The battle can ebb and flow very quickly.  Unfortunately, the Pentagon has been bogged down in a costly, poorly designed program to find alternatives to mines. Although it might have seemed like a good idea when it was proposed 6 years ago, it has been managed by people who have no sense of urgency and who never believed in the goal anyway. They spent the money, but there is little to show for it.  It makes me think of that PBS program, ``Yes, Minister''--a wonderful program. You had a British minister who, while elected, had the head of the public service for his ministry who did not agree with anything the minister wanted to do; but he was so nice.  Every time the minister said, we have to go forward with programs like this, that, or the other thing, the head of his civil service would say: Yes, Minister. Of course, Minister. Wonderful idea, Minister. We will do it in the fullness of time. And the minister finally realized ``the fullness of time'' was not his lifetime.  That is what has happened with those who have been tasked with the idea of coming up with this alternative to landmines. They do not believe in it, so they drag their feet. They know those of us in Congress who support it will someday leave; they hope the sooner the better. Administrations come and go. But the irony is, we do not need to even search for alternatives.  As many retired and active duty defense officials will say privately, we already have suitable alternative weapons technologies. We have smart weapons. We have sensor technologies that are a lot more cost-effective than mines. They are safer for our soldiers, and they don't impede their mobility. I hope that the Pentagon, with all the weapons in its arsenal, is not going to add to the millions of landmines already littering Afghanistan.  They threaten civilian and humanitarian aid workers. They terrorize and kill and maim refugees who are trying to flee. These indiscriminate weapons don't belong on today's battlefield no matter who is putting them there, no matter how right they think their cause.  The administration is conducting a review of its landmine policy. We can have a mine-free military if we want. Then probably it would not be long before Russia would do the same. Wouldn't it be nice if we could say that in the western hemisphere, where today every country except the United States and Cuba has banned mines, we banned mines as every other country except Cuba? Now it is your turn. Wouldn't it be nice when we sent our Ambassador to NATO not to have to look away when every single NATO ally tells us they have banned their landmines and we haven't?  The Clinton administration took some first steps, but they never fully grasped the issue. They didn't understand it. Some did not want to. I believe the President did want to but didn't follow through.  This administration has an opportunity to design a roadmap to finish the job. It would increase the effectiveness and mobility and the safety of our own troops. This is not something we do just to help other countries. It would actually help our own troops. It would take White House leadership, but it can be done. The White House lead would be strongly supported by the Congress, Republicans and Democrats, because so many across the political spectrum have already voted to ban landmines.  One person in this country has done more than any other to bring to the world's attention the need to ban landmines. That is Bobby Muller, the head of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation. Bobby Muller is known and admired by so many Senators, particularly those who served in combat. He is perhaps the most visionary, eloquent, dedicated, and inspiring person I have met.  He enlisted in the Marine Corps. He volunteered to serve in Vietnam. He was paralyzed from the waist down from a gunshot wound. Last weekend he was honored by Hofstra University, his alma mater, with its lifetime achievement award.  I ask unanimous consent that a Newsday article about this award be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsday, Oct. 17, 2001]                              A Man Reborn                          (By Marc Siegelaub)       United States Marine Corps 1st Lt. Robert Olivier Muller      will remember the day he died for the rest of his life.       On April 29, 1969, the 23-year-old infantry officer was      standing at the base of a hill in northernmost South Vietnam,      10,000 feet below the demilitarized zone and some 10,000      miles from his home in Great Neck.       Lt. Muller was serving in an advisory capacity to 600 South      Vietnamese soldiers. They were massing for attack against a      handful of dug-in Viet Cong, 15 or so suicidal fanatics      bleeding and dazed from the concussive air attacks and      ferocious shelling unleashed upon them.       With soldierly instincts honed from eight months on active      duty in a country ravaged by civil war, Muller sensed a big      mismatch: He knew his battalion lacked the stomach to take      the high ground from an entrenched enemy force bent on      defending its turf to the death. Incensed that 15 Viet Cong      could keep his 600-man unit at bay, Muller rallied the outfit      into formation behind three U.S. Marine tanks and led them up      the rise. Foot by foot, they ascended the hill without a      misstep until the bullets started to fly. Instantly, the      South Vietnamese scattered, turning Muller into a sitting      duck.       And that's when it happened. That's when a bullet ripped      through Muller's chest, puncturing both lungs and splintering      the fifth thoracic vertebrae of his spine before exiting his      broken back. That's when this stranger in a strange land      collapsed on the dank dirt and closed his eyes in the      midafternoon light.       Fast forward more than three decades to Hofstra University      on Long Island, where homecoming weekend kicks off Friday      with a special awards reception. The high point is the honor      to be bestowed on one of Hofstra's own for extraordinary      lifetime achievement--alumnus of the year.       The distinction in 2001 goes to a local boy who never made      the top half of his class in law school. ``I was the most      average student you could have imagined,'' the recipient says      matter-of-factly.       But consider that when Kerry Kennedy Cuomo compiled a short      list of ``human-rights defenders who are changing our world''      for inclusion in her book, ``Speak Truth to Power,'' this      ``most average student'' made it beside such stalwarts as the      Dalai Lama and Elie Wiesel. Or when Bruce Springsteen      composed ``Born in the U.S.A.,'' his hard-driving tribute to      Vietnam veterans, this ``most average student'' served as a      good part of his inspiration. Or when the 1997 Nobel Peace      Prize was conferred on the International Campaign to Ban      Landmines, this ``most average student'' was the co-founder      of the movement.       Considering all the testimonials heaped on this ``most      average student,'' perhaps his greatest act was the act of      survival. Hofstra's alumnus of the year, you see, is Robert      O. Muller, whose life ended on April     29, 1969, in Vietnam, only to be reborn a short time later,      crippled from the chest down and altered forever from the      neck up.       By all accounts, Bobby Muller, now 56, never should have      made it to the dawning of a new day, much less to home or to      homecoming.       ``I was conscious long enough after I got hit to feel the      life ebbing out of my body,'' Muller recalled. ``I was on my      back, looking at the sky and grabbing my gut. I couldn't feel      a thing. My last thought on this earth was I'm dying on      this--piece of ground.''       Muller lapsed into a coma. Suddenly, a medevac helicopter      hovering overhead swooped down, and medical personnel scooped      him up and whisked him off. In no time, he was in surgery on      a state-of-the-art hospital ship, the U.S.S. Repose. The      vessel just happened to be positioned farther north than it      had ever been, mere miles from the stricken Marine.       ``Despite the instant medevac and great care, it was      written on my chart that had I arrived one minute later I      would have died,'' said Muller. ``When I came to, there were      seven tubes sticking out of me, but I was ecstatic. I      couldn't believe my luck--I was alive!''       Alive but paralyzed, the doctors told him about his      condition. ``Don't worry about it, that's OK. I'll handle      it,'' Muller shot back without hesitation. ``The fact that I      was permanently disabled. the sorrow of being told that I'd      be a paraplegic--a word I never heard before--was so lost in      the overwhelming joy of realizing I was going to make it.''       The bullet that stuck Muller cut him off from his past in a      flash. One second he had the sinewy limbs of a long-distance      runner; the next second he was laid out flat, unable even to      wiggle his toes.       Something else got severed on Muller's tour of duty in      Vietnam--his close connection to the country he loved and      trusted.       He as born in Switzerland at the tail end of World War II,      and his family moved to New York City while he was still in      diapers. The family later settled in Great Neck. Always on      the go, Muller played soccer, ran track and wrestled in high      school and college.       In 1965, Muller entered Hofstra. The Vietnam War was      raging, as were his red-white-and-blue sensibilities. ``I      felt it was my duty as a citizen of the greatest country in      the world to join the service . . . I never questioned the      war or studied the history of Vietnam. I only knew that my      government wanted me there to repeal a massive northern      communist invasion threatening the freedom -loving people of      South Vietnam.''       On graduation day in January, 1968, Muller enlisted in the      Marines. He underwent 33 weeks of intense training in boot      camp and officer's school, after which he was wound as tight      as a racehorse at the starting gate. ``I demanded Vietnam,      and I demanded front-line infantry.''       Muller got his wish in September of 1968, but he never got      his bearings abroad. ``The South Vietnamese civilians didn't      tell us where the booby traps were or the land mines or the      trails and supply caches; they harbored the VC, gave them      information and plotted against us. And our military allies      were nicknamed `The Roadrunners' for hightailing it at the      first sign of danger. What the hell were we doing there?       ``I was bitter because I put my allegiance in my      government,'' Muller said. ``I did so with the best, most      honest intentions, believing I was doing the right thing. I      gave my country 100 percent, and they used me as a pawn in a      game.       ``But I don't feel sorry for myself--I'm here and a lot of      my buddies aren't. The real tragedy is that I was totally      naive . . . As a college graduate. I was supposed to be      educated. I was an idiot. I never asked `Why?' And that is my      greatest tragedy--one which was shared by all too many      Americans.''       I Vietnam was Muller's baptism under fire, where the seeds      of activism took root, then his rehabilitation in a Veterans      Administration hospital in the Bronx was the detonator that      launched him on the path of social resistance.       This was the same rodent-infested, broken-down facility      featured in a shocking 1970 Life magazine spread ``My closet      pal and eight of my friends with spinal-cord injuries      committed suicide in the Bronx VA,'' said Muller. ``I was the      quadriplegics, multiple amputees, men who could only move      their heads. We were entitled to care second to none. I had      to fight against that system for reasons of my own      survival.''       At the ripe young age of 25, Muller ventured into the den      of inequity and started his own private war. He showed up in      Times Square and blocked traffic on the same afternoon that      President Richard Nixon vetoed a veterans' benefits act on      the grounds that it was ``fiscally irresponsible and      inflationary.''       ``I said, `Wait a minute, I was a Marine infantry officer,      I called in hundreds of thousands of dollars a day to kill      people. I got shot and now I come back and you suddenly tell      me it's `fiscally irresponsible and inflationary' to provide      critical medical care? I don't think so.''       As an activist he was a natural. ``From the moment a TV      crew stuck a microphone under his nose, Muller discovered he      had a gift for articulating what was on his mind,'' wrote      Gerald Nicrosia in ``Home to War,'' a history of the Vietnam      veterans' movement.       Muller began popping up all over the place-in Hofstra's      School of Law, learning how the system works and how to work      the system; in Miami Beach, shouting down Nixon during his      1972 acceptance speech; in the Academy Award-winning      documentary ``Hearts and Minds,'' spitting invectives at how      everything went awry in Vietnam; in the vanguard of anti-war      protests, riding his photographable wheelchair; in Congress,      carrying the burdens of veterans on his broken back.       Once again, Muller found himself leading the charge up the      hill. He arrived in Washington, D.C., in January 1978, as      head of the New York-based Council of Vietnam Veterans. ``I      figured if somebody went to Washington and simply told the      American people what was going on with Vietnam veterans. . .      . a compassionate society would have to respond.''       That February, The Washington Post ran an op-ed piece      headlined ``Vietnam Veteran Advocate Arrives.'' It was just      the beginning of a yearlong editorial campaign undertaken by      the Post on behalf of Vietnam vets. ``The New York Times      picked it up, and when that happens, you wind up setting a      lot of amplification,'' Muller said.       Even so, ``not a single thing we were fighting for was      enacted into law. That was a lesson: To argue for something      simply in terms of justice, fairness, equity doesn't make it      in our political process.''       So Muller switched gears and went grass roots. ``We      traveled into the districts that the members of key      congressional committees were elected from, and got into      their editorial pages and did their radio talk shows and      brought pressure from the people in their districts. And      finally we started to get the programs we critically needed      and deserved.''       In the summer of 1979, Muller co-founded the Vietnam      Veterans of America, a national movement designed to give      veterans a voice and vehicle to air their grievances and      drive their concerns. The political advocacy group would      bring about the passage of landmark legislation to treat and      compensate victims of Agent Orange and post-traumatic stress      disorder, and to secure the right to judicial review of VA      decisions.       With a measure of progress achieved on the home front,      Muller began to cast a wary eye beyond his own borders. In      1980, he established the Vietnam Veterans of America      Foundation, a nonprofit group that was separate and      autonomous from the VVA. Located smack in the lap of      government in Washington, D.C.--where Muller still works and      resides--the philanthropic organization set out to raise      revenue and raise consciousness on mattes of human rights      affecting victims of war throughout the world.       Muller led the first group of American veterans back to      Vietnam in 1981. The historic visit was cathartic: They      reconciled with their former adversaries, introduced      humanitarian assistance programs and laid the groundwork for      future economic and diplomatic detente between the two      countries.       Several years later, the VVAF brigade visited Cambodia on a      fact-finding mission. ``Cambodia changed my life even more      than Vietnam did,'' Muller said. ``What took place on the      killing fields was genocide. The horror of seeing 10,000      skulls piled up in a ditch and legless kids walking on their      hands in the capital city of Phnom Penh was a whole different      order of suffering.       ``And I learned there were more land mines in Cambodia than      there were people, and it was considered proportionally the      most disabled society of any country on Earth.''       The VVAF launched a new campaign against the hidden scourge      of Southeast Asia--lethal underground bombs meant to wreak      havoc on innocent men, women and children.       ``If you've got a machine gun, a rifle, an artillery piece,      a tank, there's a target to fire at and a command-and-control      function with directing that fire,'' explained Muller. ``Not      so with a land mine. You simply set it, you bury it, you hide      it and whoever happens to step on that land mine becomes the      victim, long after the other weapons have been put back in      the armories.       What's more, land mines cause inhuman suffering. ``Step on      one, and all this crap--dirt, shrapnel, garbage, clothing--     gets blown up your limb. You go through a whole series of      operations when you're treated like a piece of salami and      keep getting resected and cut down. Guys on the hospital ship      would cry out for their mothers when the dressing was changed      on their raw wounds,'' said Muller.       Beyond the physical pain, psychological torture is      inflicted on the peasants who are denied use of the land.      ``This stupid $3 weapon winds up being the major      destabilizing factor in Third World countries, these      agrarian-based societies that are trying to recover,'' Muller      said. ``And not just in Cambodia, but in Afghanistan,      Kurdistan, Angola, Bosnia, Mozambique.''       And so the VVAF established a charitable beachhead on      foreign soil, setting up rehabilitation clinics in Cambodia.      ``By setting up the clinics to fit amputees with prosthetic      limbs and orthotic braces, by supplying wheelchairs free of      charge, by initiating programs to employ disabled people, we      went through a process of emotionally connecting with an      issue that we intellectually understood was devastating.''       Muller and the VVAF co-founded the International Campaign      to Ban Landmines in 1991, but they needed to recruit a potent      political presence to spearhead the effort in Congress. Enter      Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), who controlled the money as      chair of the Appropriations Committee on Foreign Operations,      and ``who had seen, with     his own eyes, what land mines were doing to civilians.''       In 1992, Leahy procured a one-year moratorium on the      trafficking of anti-personnel land mines. Before the ink was      dry, he was back on the Senate floor to draft a three-year      extension of the act, and his colleagues passed it      unanimously. ``I gotta tell you,'' Muller said admiringly,      ``the Senate doesn't vote a hundred to nothing that the moon      circles the Earth.''       Leahy, in turn, praised Muller for his pivotal role in the      campaign. ``Whenever I needed more votes, whenever I asked      him to talk to someone, he never failed me,'' Leahy said.       Meanwhile, a huge global network of anti-land- mine      organizations had begun to germinate, and influential support      had started to flourish in high places, most noticeably in      the Clinton White House and in the royal realm of Diana,      princess of Wales.       The bow was about to be tied on a comprehensive pact when      the coalition began to unravel. First the United States      balked at signing, with President Bill Clinton citing the      safety of American troops stationed in South Korea, where the      U.S. military had planted anti-personnel mines on the North      Korean border. Then the UN failed to reconvene the council on      conventional weapons. By September 1996, the landmark treaty      was in jeopardy of being shelved.       ``But we had a five-term senator go nuts on this issue and      drive it,'' Muller said. ``And the foreign minister of      Canada, Lloyd Axworthy, with great personal courage, said,      `We're going to do something totally different. We're going      to set a standard, and we're going to invite anybody who      wants to come and sign this treaty to do so in a year.' ''       For his part, Muller rounded up a posse of retired military      leaders who agreed to put their collective might behind a      full-page open letter in The New York Times, urging President      Clinton to scrap antipersonnel land mines because ``it was      militarily the responsible thing to do.''       The signatories included Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf and more      than a dozen other retired brass of the first rank.       ``Fact is, anti-personnel land mines were the leading cause      of our casualties in Vietnam,'' Muller said, ``and they are      the leading cause of casualties for our peacekeepers through      NATO and the UN,'' not to mention the peril they now pose to      our own foot soldiers in Afghanistan.       Off the record, officials from the Pentagon told Muller      that land mines were ``garbage.'' But if we let you reach      into our arsenal and take them out, went their reasoning,      then other categories of weapons would be at risk--the domino      theory as applied to armaments.       On Dec. 3, 1997, Axworthy delivered, as promised, an      international agreement involving 122 nations to scrap land      mines. But the achievement was muted by the refusal of the      U.S. government to put its John Hancock on the document.       Muller has no tolerance for hollow victories. Not when some      80 million land mines remain buried in the ground; not when      the job of providing assistance in all the countries that      need to be cleaned up and put back together lies ahead.       ``You cannot be looking to stigmatize land mines in the      public's thinking if the world's superpower, which has every      alternative to meet any possible military requirement, say      it's OK to continue to use them,'' Muller said.       ``If we allow genocide, if we allow innocent people to be      slaughtered on the scale that we're witnessing, it sows the      seeds of destruction. And one day that degree of madness is      gong to walk up the block and come into your neighborhood.''       It already has. Muller's view of the recent carnage in the      United States--the main hit taking place just 25 miles from      Hofstra--is colored by his frequent treks to ``ground      zeroes'' in Third World nations. He has eyeballed the      atrocities wrought by land mines. ``A terrorist is a      terrorist is a terrorist,'' said Muller.       With characteristic energy and purpose, Muller is      mobilizing his forces at the VVAF to confront the terrorist      threats to domestic safety and security in the wake of Sept.      11. The lessons he learned in the land mines campaign apply      readily to this grave new world, Muller said. ``Political      strength has got to be connected to the righteousness of the      argument; multilateral cooperation and agreements have got to      be in place; philanthropic funding has got to support global      efforts and concerns, and the American people have got to be      alert to and engaged in the issues that affect their      democratic way of life.''       Actually, the VVAF had already been hard at work on ``the      Justice Project''--an ambitious undertaking that includes      educational outreach programs and curriculum guides on      terrorism for schoolchildren.       This weekend, at homecoming, Muller will look upon the      youthful revelers and wonder who among them will go out and      absorb some hard knocks, ask tough questions, learn how and      why things happen, search for the plain truth, undergo vital      changes, and--as a result--get involved in trying to correct      the injustices they uncover.       The all-American boy who left the sanctuary of home and      Hofstra in 1968 and emerged at the other end of the Earth in      a brutal conflict got jolted to the core. ``I'm a better man      now than I was before I went to Vietnam,'' Muller said. ``I'm      certainly more aware of the sanctity of life.''
