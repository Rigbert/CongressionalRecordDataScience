 The Statement of Managers that accompanies this conference report does, in fact, contain tables which disclose the required information. In an effort, however, to go well beyond the letter of the rule and provide an additional level of transparency, I would like to include in the Record supplemental information that will serve as further clarification with respect to some of these items. Because of the way the information is presented at the request of the House of Representatives, the full amount of funding specified for a particular project could, to some, be difficult to discern in those instances where the item of congressionally directed spending is in addition to the amount contained in the President's budget request. The list of items that I will place in the Record will make it easier for Members to make the distinction between what was in the President's budget and what is subject to disclosure under the rules of the Senate.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:        Clarification of Congressionally Directed Spending Table       Bureau of Land Management--Land Acquisition: $1,000,000      over budget, California Desert Wilderness (CA), Senator      Feinstein.
