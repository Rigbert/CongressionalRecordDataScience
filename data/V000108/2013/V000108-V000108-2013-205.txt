Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to honor Mr. Joel Gorelick on his retirement from his position as president and chief administrative officer of Peoples Bank. Joel's many years of dedication and expertise in the banking industry have been a remarkable asset to the community of northwest Indiana. In honor of Joel's retirement, a reception will be held on Friday, January 25, 2013, at Briar Ridge Country Club in Schererville, Indiana.  Joel Gorelick was born and raised in northwest Indiana and graduated from Ball State University. He went on to receive a master's degree in business administration from Indiana University and also attended the Graduate School of Banking at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. In 1983, Mr. Gorelick joined Peoples Bank as the vice president for commercial lending. In this role, Joel was able to effectively develop the bank's commercial line of business and established Peoples Bank as a leader in small business lending. For his tremendous success, he was awarded the Small Business Advocate award from the Entrepreneurial Excellence program, hosted by the Northwest Indiana Small Business Development Center, and was named the 2000 Board Member of the Year by the National Association of Development Companies. In 2005, Joel was promoted to president and chief administrative officer of Peoples Bank. He played a major role in the development of the corporate office in Munster, Indiana and in the expansion of the bank throughout Lake and Porter Counties. Joel Gorelick is known for his energetic dedication to serving the people of the community and has been called a mentor and coach for the bank's personnel.  Ever a good man of business, Joel realized that his responsibility was not simply to ensure the success of Peoples Bank, but to leave the world better than he found it. Mr. Gorelick selflessly and passionately gives of his time through his involvement in various community organizations and civic activities, including the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Company, the Indiana Bankers Association, the Lake County Economic Development Corporation, and the Boys and Girls Club of Northwest Indiana, for which he is currently providing direction to the executive committee of the Tolleston Project, a campaign to build a new home for the Boys and Girls Club in Gary, Indiana.  Joel's excellence in his field and commitment to charitable endeavors throughout the community is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. Joel and his wonderful wife, Marcia, have two beloved sons and two grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Joel Gorelick for his lifetime of leadership and service to the community. His constant effort to improve the quality of life for the people of northwest Indiana is truly inspirational. Joel has been able to positively impact the lives of countless individuals and is worthy of the highest praise. I ask that you join me in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
