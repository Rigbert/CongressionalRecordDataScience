Chairman, the Green amendment is very similar to the bill that I introduced last Congress and, as we know, did pass the House with some bipartisan support.  This amendment establishes a straightforward and predictable procedure to permit cross-border pipelines and electric transmission facilities.  It is not Keystone. We are over that battle. It is time to move beyond that. But we want certainty in these things.  This is an important amendment. In order for the U.S. to fully benefit from our energy abundance, we have to encourage rather than obstruct trade with our good neighbors, particularly the Canadians, as well as the Mexicans--an energy policy that works.  Let's do this. The amendment is a good one.
