It is my understanding that the State of Indiana opposes the closing of the locks.  I would agree with the gentleman's assertion that we face a very serious problem as far as the carp, and I and others have certainly joined in that concern. As a member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for over a decade, we have been working acidulously on this particular problem, not only with the Army Corps of Engineers, but with an assortment of State and Federal regulatory bodies, because no one wants carp in the Great Lakes. But I would emphasize to this body that it is a work in progress. And at this point, the closure of the locks is uncalled for.  The second point--and the gentleman talks about the economy, there is an economic issue. Speaking for the State of Indiana, I would point out, if those locks were closed, the impact as far as the loss to economic activity in the State of Indiana is $1.9 billion, and 17,655 jobs in Indiana would be affected.                              {time}  1330  We're trying to create jobs in this economy, not strike them from beneath us.  And, finally, this issue is not without controversy. It has ended up in the courts. The gentleman's absolutely correct about that. Twice the United States Supreme Court has rejected arguments by the Michigan Attorney General that closing the locks is eminently needed at this point in time.  Last year the State of Michigan brought the question of lock closure before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On December 2, Judge Robert Dow ruled against the State of Michigan on their request for a preliminary injunction, explaining that the lock closure could inflict certain harm on the economy, and that the State of Michigan had failed to demonstrate that the Asian carp presented an ecological threat to the Great Lakes that was imminent.  So again, I would urge all of my colleagues to oppose the gentleman's amendment.
