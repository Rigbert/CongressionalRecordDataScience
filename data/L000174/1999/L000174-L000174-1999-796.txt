President, I regret to have to return to an unfinished aspect of the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton.  On February 2, I attended the deposition of Vernon Jordan as one of the Senators designated to serve as presiding officers. On February 4, the Senate approved the House Managers' motion to include a portion of that deposition in the trial record. Unfortunately, the House Managers moved to include only a portion of the videotaped deposition in the trial record and left the rest hidden from the public and subject to the confidentiality rules that governed those proceedings.  On Saturday, February 6, at the conclusion of his presentation, Mr. Kendall asked for permission to display the last segment of the videotaped deposition of Vernon Jordan, in which, as Mr. Kendall described it ``Mr. Jordan made a statement defending his own integrity.'' The House Managers objected to the playing of the approximately 2-minute segment of the deposition that represented Mr. Jordan's ``own statement about his integrity.''  I then rose to request unanimous consent from the Senate that the segment of the videotaped deposition be allowed to be shown on the Senate floor to the Senate and the American people. There was objection from the Republican side.  I noted my disappointment at the time and in my February 12 remarks about the depositions. After the conclusion of the voting on the Articles of Impeachment and before the adjournment of the court of impeachment, unanimous consent was finally granted to include the ``full written transcripts'' of the depositions in the public record of the trial. As far as I can tell, however, the statement of integrity by Mr. Jordan has yet to be published in the Congressional Record.  I regret that the Senate chose to prohibit the viewing of the videotape ofthis powerful personal statement during the trial. I regret that it continues to be restricted from public viewing.  In order to be sure that the transcript that is being made a part of the public trial record is readily available to the public, I ask unanimous consent that the following portion of the written transcript of the deposition of Vernon Jordan, that containing his statement of integrity heretofore suppressed, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       The Witness. Mr. Chairman, may I be just permitted a moment      of personal privilege? I don't know about the rules here, but      uh, I'd like to say something if you would permit.       Mr. Hutchinson. Mr. Chairman----       Senator Thompson. Well, Mr. Jordan, quite frankly, it      depends on what the subject matter is and what you'd like----       The Witness. Well, it won't be a declaration of war.      [Laughter.]       Senator Thompson. Counsel, did you have----       Mr. Hutchinson. I would reserve the objection. I think      that's permissible under the rules. So I would state my      objection, let him answer it, and if--we can debate that if      it becomes an issue in the Senate. I'd like to reserve the      objection.       Senator Thompson. All right.       The Witness. It's just something I want you, Mr.      Hutchinson, and the House Managers to understand about Vernon      Jordan. And that is, you know, it's a very long way from the      first public housing project in this country for black      people, where I grew up. It's a long way from there to a      corner office at Akin Gump. It's a long way from University      Homes to the corporate board rooms of America. It's a long      way from University Homes to the Oval Office. And I have made      that journey understanding one thing, and that is that the      only thing I have in this world that belongs to me is fee      simple absolute, completely and totally, is my integrity.       My corner office at Akin Gump is at best tenuous. My house,      my home, is at best tenuous. My bank account, my stocks and      my bonds, they are ultimately of no moment.       But what matters most to me, and what was taught to me by      my mother, is that the only thing that I own totally and      completely is my integrity. And my integrity has been on      trial here, and I want to tell you that nothing is more      important to me than that.       The Presdient is my friend. He was before this happened, he      is now, and he will be when this is over. But he is not a      friend in that I have no friends for whom I would sacrifice      my integrity. And I want you to understand that.       Senator Thompson. Thank you, Mr. Jordan.       If there is no further question, then this deposition is      completed, and we stand adjourned.       The  Witness. Thank you.                          ____________________
