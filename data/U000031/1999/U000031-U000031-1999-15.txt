Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2130) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to add gamma hydroxybutyric acid and ketamine to the schedules of controlled substances, to provide for a national awareness campaign, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 2130       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Hillory J. Farias Date-Rape      Prevention Drug Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds as follows:       (1) Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (also called G, Liquid X,      Liquid Ecstasy, Grievous Bodily Harm, Georgia Home Boy,      Scoop) has become a significant and growing problem in law      enforcement. At least 20 States have scheduled such drug in      their drug laws and law enforcement officials have been      experiencing an increased presence of the drug in driving      under the influence, sexual assault, and overdose cases,      especially at night clubs and parties.       (2) A behavioral depressant and a hypnotic, gamma      hydroxybutyric acid (``GHB'') is being used in conjunction      with alcohol and other drugs with detrimental effects in an      increasing number of cases. It is difficult to isolate the      impact of such drug's ingestion since it is so typically      taken with an ever-changing array of other drugs and      especially alcohol, which potentiates its impact.       (3) GHB takes the same path as alcohol, processes via      alcohol dehydrogenase, and its symptoms at high levels of      intake and as impact builds are comparable to alcohol      ingestion/intoxication. Thus, aggression and violence can be      expected in some individuals who use such drug.       (4) If taken for human consumption, common industrial      chemicals such as gamma butyrolactone and 1.4-butanediol are      swiftly converted by the body into GHB. Illicit use of these      and other GHB analogues and precursor chemicals is a      significant and growing law enforcement problem.       (5) A human pharmaceutical formulation of gamma      hydroxybutyric acid is being developed as a treatment for      cataplexy, a serious and debilitating disease. Cataplexy,      which causes sudden and total loss of muscle control, affects      about 65 percent of the estimated 180,000 Americans with      narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. People with cataplexy often are      unable to work, drive a car, hold their children or live a      normal life.     SEC. 3. ADDITION OF GAMMA HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID AND KETAMINE TO                    SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES; GAMMA                    BUTYROLACTONE AS ADDITIONAL LIST I CHEMICAL.

(e) Penalties Regarding Schedule I.--       (1) In general.--Section 401(b)(1)(C) of the Controlled      Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(C)) is amended in the      first sentence by     inserting after ``schedule I or II,'' the following: ``gamma      hydroxybutyric acid in schedule III,''.       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 401(b)(1)(D) of the      Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(D)) is amended      by inserting ``(other than gamma hydroxybutyric acid)'' after      ``schedule III''.       (f) Distribution With Intent To Commit Crime of Violence.--     Section 401(b)(7)(A) of the Controlled Substances Act (21      U.S.C. 841(b)(7)(A)) is amended by inserting ``or controlled      substance analogue'' after ``distributing a controlled      substance''.     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY FOR ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR                    GAMMA HYDROXYBUTYRIC PRODUCTS IN SCHEDULE III.
