Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today we are considering the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2004, bipartisan legislation which I introduced along with the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell). I want to thank those Members for their hard work and bipartisan cooperation.  In 1991, Congress passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which included landmark legislation that protected consumers from receiving unwanted and unsolicited commercial faxes. For over 10 years, the FCC had interpreted that law to provide businesses with an exception to the general ban when they faxed commercial or advertising material to an existing business customer.  Then, in 2003, the FCC made a major change in their interpretation of the law. Under the new FCC rules, every business, every single one, small, large, home-based, every association, every nonprofit organization, every charity, would be required to obtain prior written approval from each individual before it sent a commercial fax.                              {time}  1900  The logistical and financial costs of the new FCC rules, particularly to small business and nonprofit associations, would be enormous.  For instance, the survey of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce suggested that the cost to the average small business would be at least $5,000 in the first year and more than $3,000 each year thereafter. The survey further indicated that it would take, on average, more than 27 hours of staff time to obtain the initial written consent from their customers, and an additional 20 hours each year to keep those forms current. A recent survey by the National Association of Wholesalers-Distributors revealed that its member companies expected to pay an average of $22,500 just to obtain the consent forms. With our economy in the fragile stages of an economic recovery, I would much rather see those dollars going towards production and job creation.  Given the dramatic impact which the new rules would have, last August, just before the new rules were to go into effect, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), the then chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and I wrote the FCC and requested that the FCC delay the effective date of the new rules. Thankfully, the FCC did. In fact, they stayed the effective date until January of 2005.  Moreover, while the FCC currently has the new rules under reconsideration, I think it is the wisest course for Congress to step in and fix the law to resolve any lingering statutory interpretation problems which led to the FCC's new rules, and that is why we are here today.  Let me start by stating what the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2004 would not do. The bill does not overturn the ban on the faxing of unsolicited advertisements. That has been outlawed since the passage of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, and this bill does nothing to change that.  This bill does not protect the senders of those annoying, unsolicited faxed advertisements which so many of us get from companies with whom we have never done business, often sent to us randomly by blast fax, and do not properly identify themselves in the fax transmission.  Rather, the bill with clearly reinstate the established business relationship exemption to allow businesses, associations, and charities to send commercial faxes to their customers and members without first receiving written permission. Additionally and importantly, the bill would establish new opt-out safeguards to provide additional protections for fax recipients. Under the bill, senders of faxes must alert recipients clearly and conspicuously on the first page, of their right to opt-out of future faxes, and senders must abide by those requests. This is a level of protection that consumers never had under the FCC rules. Finally, the bill sets out the FCC reporting requirements so that Congress can monitor the FCC's enforcement activity.  The Junk Fax Prevention Act is commonsense, regulatory relief; and time is of the essence for Congress to pass it, since many businesses will very soon need to begin making arrangements to be in compliance with the new rules by January of 2005.  I want to thank my friends, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), for their sincere bipartisan cooperation on the bill. I also want to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle, Kelly Cole, Howard Waltzman, Pete Filon, Colin Crowell, Will Carty, and certainly Will Nordwind for all of their superb efforts.  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to ensure that we get this must-pass legislation to the President's desk as expeditiously as possible this year.
