Senator Lee and I both sought to bring up the USA FREEDOM Act well before the sunset date to avoid just this situation. Now that the roving wiretap, business records, and so-called ``lone wolf'' provisions have lapsed, it is important that we make clear our intent in passing the USA FREEDOM Act this week--albeit a few days after the sunset. Could the Senator comment on the intent of the Senate in passing the USA FREEDOM Act after June 1, 2015?
