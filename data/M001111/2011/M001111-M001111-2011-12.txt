 President, I am so pleased that we have completed work on the transportation, housing and urban development appropriations bill. This is an important bill that supports critical transportation investments--it is a jobs bill. It also supports housing and services for the Nation's most vulnerable.  This bill was difficult to put together, and there are cuts in here that I would rather not see. But on the whole it is a good bill. I thank all of my colleagues for all of the efforts and input on this bill, and I look forward to working with the House to get a final bill that we can send to the President.  I want to say a special thank-you to Senator Collins and her staff for all of their hard work. Senator Collins has been a great partner. And I thank my own staff as well for all their efforts.
