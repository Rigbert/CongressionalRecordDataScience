 This frightening disease has taken the lives of far too many women, and the long list of those who have died include many of my own friends.  As has been stated, breast cancer is a growing public health problem in this Nation and a great threat to women's health. Many women are very confused about the mixed messages being sent to us today about breast cancer. One year we are told to have annual mammograms beginning at the age of 40. The next year, after we faithfully comply with that, we are told something else. We remain worried and confused, and it is time for better research on the issue.  Clearly, research has to be done. More needs to be done in prevention and treatment of breast cancer, and the Race for the Cure is a way for all of us to express our desire to do better in this and to bring this to the public's attention.  I think it is an opportune time also for this Senate to recognize that it has been 6 months without a Surgeon General. Dr. Foster has the ability, if appointed, to bring this issue to the forefront of this Nation, and I hope that the majority leader brings Dr. Foster's nomination to the Senate expeditiously so that we can, again, have another way of making sure that women's health diseases are brought to the Nation's forefront.  I will be joining my husband and my children this weekend in the Race for the Cure. I urge all of my colleagues to not only walk the walk but talk the talk and get some good research done on this issue.  I thank my colleague from New Jersey.
