President, I rise today to pay tribute to Corporal David B. Champagne, USMC, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for service in Korea. In honor of the sacrifice made by this heroic young man, I am introducing a bill to name the new post office at 551 Kingstown Road in Wakefield, RI the ``David B. Champagne Post Office'' with my Rhode Island colleague Senator Chafee.  The son of Mr. and Mrs. Bernard L. Champagne, Corporal Champagne served in the National Guard before graduating from South Kingstown High School and enlisting in the Marines in March 1951. He was the only Rhode Island resident to receive this nation's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor, for service in Korea. The citation accompanying the Medal read:       For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of      his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a      fire team leader of Company A, First Battalion, Seventh      Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action      against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 28 May 1952.      Advancing with his platoon in the initial assault of the      company against a strongly fortified and heavily defended      hill position, Corporal Champagne skillfully led his fire      team through a veritable hail of intense enemy machine-gun,      small-arms and grenade fire, overrunning trenches and a      series of almost impregnable bunker positions before reaching      the crest of the hill and placing his men in defensive      positions. Suffering a painful leg wound while assisting in      repelling the ensuing hostile counterattack, which was      launched under cover of a murderous hail of mortar and      artillery fire, he steadfastly refused evacuation and      fearlessly continued to control his fire team. When the enemy      counterattack increased in intensity, and a hostile grenade      landed in the midst of the fire team, Corporal Champagne      unhesitating seized the deadly missile and hurled it in the      direction of the approaching enemy. As the grenade left his      hand, it exploded, blowing off his hand and throwing him out      of the trench. Mortally wounded by the enemy mortar fire      while in this exposed position, Corporal Champagne, by his      valiant leadership, fortitude and gallant spirit of self-     sacrifice in the face of almost certain death, undoubtedly      saved the lives of several of his fellow Marines. His heroic      actions served to inspire all who observed him and reflect      the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval      Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.  In addition to the Medal of Honor, Corporal Champagne received the Korean Medal of Honor, the Rhode Island Cross, the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Service Medal with 3 Battle Stars, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, and the United Nation's Service Medal.  Corporal Champagne is truly an American hero. In the best spirit of this country, he volunteered to go to a foreign land and fight for people he had never met, so that they would not be subjected to the rule of a totalitarian regime.  In my home state of Rhode Island a Korean War Memorial is under construction at the State Veterans' Cemetery. Carved on that memorial will be the same words that are inscribed on the Korean War Memorial dedicated in Washington, DC: ``Freedom Is Not Free.'' Corporal Champagne understood the meaning of those words. He unhesitatingly paid the ultimate price to preserve the freedom of South Korea and to save the lives of his men.  This legislation would pay proper tribute to this remarkable young man and commemorate his incredible valor for future generations. I ask my colleagues to join Senator Chafee and me in honoring Corporal David B. Champagne by supporting this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation to name the new Wakefield post office after Corporal Champagne be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 973       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
