 President, regarding the amendment we have worked out and that has been voted on, I agree with the senior Senator from Alabama. We can both count. We were counting votes and we were looking reality in the face.  Our State of Alabama is unique among the 50 States in that, as I have said before on the floor, we have had a wrongful death statute that assesses punitive damages only where someone is killed and there is a civil action because of the death. Most States in the Union--I guess all of them except Alabama--have compensatory damages.  If I had my ``druthers,'' I would leave this like it was or like it is today, but this will give the Alabama Legislature until September 12, 1996, to consider changing it, if this proposed legislation were to become law.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
