 President, for the benefit of all Senators, let me indicate where we are. Without reaching an agreement to go forward, which we have not reached at this point, the next vote will be at 1 a.m. If that changes, I will be the first to let everyone know. If it does, obviously we will try to expedite the process. But as of this moment, we will be voting at 1 a.m.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
