 I thank the Democratic leadership for their assistance today. Even though our work this afternoon took only a few moments, I also thank the staff and everyone around the Chamber for being here, this day before Thanksgiving.  With that said and if there is nothing further from my colleague, I wish everyone a happy and safe Thanksgiving.                          ____________________
