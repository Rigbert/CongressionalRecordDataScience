 President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We are hearing a great deal about politics in the debate regarding this amendment of the Senator from New York. We hear the notices in the mail to inform taxpayers of the rebate checks are somehow about ``politics.'' We hear the language used in a notice is about politics.  Let me assure that the only thing that is about politics is the amendment before the Senate. I make very clear the notices are being issued, being sent by Congress, because we gave that direction in the legislation we passed. I read from the conference report of the recently passed tax cut bill. Page 127 of the report says:       The conferees anticipate that the IRS will send notices to      most taxpayers, approximately one month after enactment. The      notices will inform taxpayers the computation of their checks      and the approximate date by which they can expect to receive      their check. This information should decrease the number of      telephone calls made by taxpayers to the IRS inquiring when      their check will be issued.  That is a quote from the conference report of the Congress of the United States, directing the Treasury Department to do what has been labeled as pure politics. This is a statement of the conference report. That is why these notices are being issued.  We are seeking to reduce confusion of taxpayers and minimize the burden on IRS employees. That is why the National Treasury Employees Union, the union that negotiates with the Treasury Department, representing those employees, supports the issuance of the letters being criticized.  I read from the last paragraph of the letter I have received from the National Taxpayers Union:       On behalf of the employees of the IRS who are charged with      implementing the decisions of Congress with regard to the tax      code, I urge you to oppose efforts to cut funding for the      mailing of a notification to taxpayers with regard to their      tax rebates.  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                             NTEU,                        The National Treasury Employees Union,                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2001.       I am writing with regard to funding included in the FY 2001      supplemental funding bill, H.R. 2216, that will allow the IRS      to mail notices to taxpayers informing them of the timing and      amount of tax rebate they will be getting. While NTEU has no      position on the wording of such notice, we strongly believe      that a notice will significantly reduce the amount of      telephone calls coming into the IRS with questions about the      tax rebate and ultimately reduce the costs associated with      administering the rebate.       The IRS already has great difficulty responding to all of      the telephone calls from taxpayers with questions. The volume      of calls will increase dramatically as anticipation of rebate      checks grows, thereby making it even more difficult for      taxpayers with other questions to get their calls answered.      Providing taxpayers with a notice in advance will hold down      the increase in calls and prevent a significant decrease in      the IRS' ability to provide customer service.       It is my understanding that the IRS has indicated that it      may go forward with a notice on the tax rebate even if funds      to mail it out are cut. Such a move would inevitably cause      erosion of customer service levels that are already suffering      from underfunding.       On behalf of the employees of the IRS who are charged with      implementing the decisions of Congress with regard to the tax      code, I urge you to oppose efforts to cut funding for the      mailing of a notification to taxpayers with regard to their      tax rebates.           Sincerely,                                                Colleen M. Kelley,                                               National President.
