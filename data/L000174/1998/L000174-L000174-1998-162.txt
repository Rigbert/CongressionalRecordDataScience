President, I see my colleague from Kentucky, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, on the floor, so I yield to him.  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my colleague from Vermont, we have--I hate to interrupt the debate on this amendment, but we have a unanimous consent agreement that has been cleared on both sides limiting the amendments. If it is all right with them, I would like to propound that at this particular time.                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the remainder of the Senate's consideration of S. 2334, the following amendments be the only remaining first-degree amendments, other than the pending amendment, in order and subject to relevant second degrees. I further ask that following the disposition of the listed amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and a vote occur on passage of S. 2334, all without intervening action or debate.  The amendments listed, Mr. President, are two by Senator Brownback, one on Iran, one on Georgia; two by Senator Coverdell, one relevant, one on Black Hawk helicopters; Senator Craig, four relevant; Senator Coats on North Korea; Senator DeWine on Haiti, drugs, and Africa, three of them; Senator Faircloth on world economic conference; Senator Hutchison on North Korea; the Senator Inhofe amendment, which is pending, on landmines; Senator Kyl, IMF; two amendments by the majority leader; two amendments on North Korea by the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain; two relevant amendments by myself; and one by Senator Shelby, and the pending Specter amendment.
