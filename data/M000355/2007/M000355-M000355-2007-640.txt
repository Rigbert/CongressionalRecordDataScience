 The Kyl amendment reflects this basic concern for the worker and the wage payer, and I encourage all of our colleagues to give it their full support.  This amendment will let American business men and women deduct the cost of tools and equipment the same year they buy it. This is clearly good news for employers and for workers. By giving business men and women the freedom to deduct costs right away, fewer will be forced to choose between new equipment and new hires. Republicans like Senator Jon Kyl are working hard to make sure we have a bipartisan accomplishment with this bill. I urge all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give this amendment their full support.
