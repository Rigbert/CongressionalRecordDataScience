Speaker, our Republican friends are desperate. House and Senate Republicans are so far apart on their tax proposals that GOP leaders are actually considering writing two reconciliation tax numbers into the budget resolution. That is an outrage. It is unprecedented, and it is a farce; and GOP leaders have no one to blame but themselves.  Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, is quoted as saying: ``It's a pipe dream to think you can get above 350 (billion dollars) without dramatic changes of position.'' In response, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), majority leader, warns that House Republicans may reject the budget resolution that fails to include the President's tax proposal, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) added: ``It probably would not be the worst thing in the world to not have a budget resolution.'' Imagine that. One year after hammering, hammering Senate Democrats for failing to pass a budget, congressional Republicans say that is not such a bad idea after all. Situational ethics. My, oh, my, how Republicans have changed their tune.                          ____________________
