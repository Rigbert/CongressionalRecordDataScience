  Further, special rules are provided to force proportionally liable defendants to pay more if a particular plaintiff suffers a high level of losses. A significant part of the debate revolves around our concern for poor and potentially vulnerable plaintiffs. Under this bill, if a plaintiff can claim damages exceeding 10 percent of their net worth, and their net worth is less than $200,000, then a defendant remains fully liable for that loss to the plaintiff and no proportional liability can be used to reduce that liability.  Additionally, many of us have concerns with the application if this law in instances involving insolvent defendants. If a defendant cannot pay due to bankruptcy, the defendants who would otherwise be only proportionally liable must pay up to 50 percent more to make up the plaintiff's shortfall due to the bankruptcy. What this means is that if the battle comes down to an innocent plaintiff who loses and a proportionally liable defendant who feels it would be unfair to force them to bear the full loss, the defendant loses and the proportionally liable defendants must pay more.  These are very important concepts to me, and I wanted to come to the floor to place my understanding with respect to legislative intent in the Record. I am very pleased that the senior Senator and author of this legislation is present and has corroborated these statements.  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.
