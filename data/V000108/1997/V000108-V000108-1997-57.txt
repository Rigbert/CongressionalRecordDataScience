Speaker, it is my great pleasure to commend the 1972 National Black Political Convention's 25th Anniversary celebration. This event will take place tomorrow, September 27, 1997, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, IN.  With great vision and dedication, the citizens of Gary, IN successfully hosted the First Black Political Convention 25 years ago. In 1972, 10,000 African-Americans trailblazed their way to Gary to bring together mainstream political leaders, labor officials, and ordinary people to forge a landmark and milestone in our country's struggle for economic justice and fair share of political power.  In 1972, there were 300 African-Americans elected to public office, nationwide; today, there are 7,000 in Federal, State, and local office. In 1972, there were 12 Members of Congress, and in 1997 there are 40 African-Americans in the U.S. Congress. The issues facing African-Americans today are different now than in 1972. The conference this weekend signals the shift from marches to the political arena, to using the political arena as the most effective avenue of opportunity.  In 1972, the convention agenda focused on political and economic empowerment, human development, international policy, communications, rural development, environmental protection, and self-determination. Twenty-five years later, some of the original organizers, including then Gary Mayor Richard Hatcher, are bringing together many of the same players for an anniversary celebration. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters of California, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, will speak at the Genesis Center tomorrow evening. Many social conditions continue to place African-Americans at a disadvantage in finding employment and adequate housing. As a result, the public is being asked to join in the celebration for a weekend of solidarity and discussion, which will focus on striving to eliminate the burdens plaguing African-Americans.  A host of the Nation's most respected academic and political activists, including Dick Gregory, Dr. Ron Walters, Ron Daniels, U.S. Representative Danny K. Davis, and Dr. Ron Karenga, have confirmed their attendance. I am proud to be a part of this celebration and would also like to commend the efforts of the members of the Gary Committee to Commemorate the 1972 National Black Political Convention: Richard Gordon Hatcher, James Holland, Dozier T. Allen, Morris Carter, Judy Cherry, Carolyn McCrady, and a host of other participants working to make this anniversary celebration a success. As the U.S. Representative of Indiana's First Congressional District, I am proud to represent the place of my birth, Gary, IN. I look forward to continuing to work with my African-American colleagues in making this country a better place for all people.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commemorating the 25 year anniversary of the 1972 Black Political Convention and to encourage public participation in carrying out their vision into the future.                          ____________________
