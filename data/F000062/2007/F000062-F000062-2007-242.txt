 President, I thank the manager of the bill. I want to say a few words on the bill in general and then move to an amendment, if I might.  I am a supporter of this bill. It is not a perfect bill. I think it is easy to tell the people on the far right of the political spectrum and the far left of the political spectrum are not happy with this bill. But what this bill accomplishes--like nothing I have ever seen in my 15 years in the Senate--is that it is a piece of work that is a product of people on both sides of the aisle sitting down and trying to work something out that can get 60 votes in this Chamber and move on, and not be a useless piece of legislation, but rather one that offers a kind of comprehensive reform that has definition.  People use the word ``comprehensive,'' and nobody really knows what they are talking about. But in the case of this bill, anyone who carefully looks at the bill will understand what the word ``comprehensive'' means because the word means addressing all sides of the immigration issue, taking borders that are broken and repairing them, stabilizing a border with additional border patrol, prosecutors, detention facilities, and also strengthening interior enforcement.  Three major sections--called titles--of this bill really deal with enforcement of our borders, enforcement of the interior. Then there is the question of how do you deal with the 12 million people who have been here for some time illegally, most of whom are engaged in legitimate, bona fide work. How do you deal with what has developed to be an entire subterranean economy in this country, with its own special shops, stores, and special points of congregation for work? How do you remove the element of fear that drives all of this further and further underground?  The more the ICE agents--formerly INS--pick up people in the workplace for deportation, the more you see the inequality and injustice--there was one family, about a week ago in San Diego, by the name of Munoz, who had been here for a long period of time. They both worked and raised three children who were born in this country. They owned their home and their furniture.  Well, in came the agents, who picked up the parents. The parents were out of the country and the children were left. The home was sold and the furniture was gone. And this is a family who had the piece of the rock of America. They were contributing to the economy of America. But they were destroyed.  Many of us in this body believe you cannot find and deport 12 million people. My State of California has the largest number of people living in undocumented status, which is estimated to be in the vicinity of 3 million people. They are a vital part of our workforce. They are 90 percent of California's agricultural workforce, which is the largest of the 50 States. They also work in service industries. You see them in hotels and in restaurants, and you see them in construction and housing. So they have become an indigenous part of the California workforce.  This bill puts together reforms in immigration with a process to bring those people out of the shadows. What has bothered me over these days, as I listen to the television and read in the newspapers, is I hear the drumbeat, and I even see small signs on automobiles that simply say ``amnesty.'' This bill is not amnesty.  What is amnesty? Amnesty is the categorical forgiveness of a crime, an event, or whatever the issue may be. This does not do that. This sets up a roadmap, which is complicated for someone who wants to remain in this country, to be legal, to be able to work legally, and perhaps even someday get a green card, and maybe someday further off, become a citizen.  Well, there is an 8-year road created in this bill. There are fines of $5,000 plus an additional $1,500 fee for processing. There is a touchback, which may be changed in a further amendment, but at this stage in the debate it is this: If during that 8-year period the individual who has now achieved this Z visa, which gives them the right to work in this country, decides they want to pursue a green card, they would go to their country of origin, to the nearest U.S. consulate, and with the Z visa they can come in and out of the country at will. They don't have to stay in their country of origin. What they would do is file their papers. They would submit their fingerprints, and they would turn around and come back into the United States. Then, electronically, the evaluation would be done after the present line for green cards expires. Everybody waiting in line legally for a green card gets it. They would have the opportunity to get a green card. This is estimated to be between 8 and 13 years. During that period of 8 years, they would have to re-up, come in and prove that they have done the things the bill requires them to do. This is not an amnesty.  Now, the other part is that there are changes made in what is called chain migration. Currently, one person on a green card can bring in any number of family members. This is changed to the nuclear family. The person holding the green card can bring in their spouse and their minor children. That future green card, after the 8 years--after the list is expunged, future green cards would be granted on the basis of the point system, which deals with merit in the sense of the availability of job, work, the educational attributes of the individual, the family, and other things. I think it is as close as we are going to get to solving this problem and creating the interior enforcement, the border stability, and the laws that are necessary to secure the rule of law when it deals with immigration.  Mr. President, many Senators from both sides of the aisle worked long hours over the past several months to address immigration reform. And through the process of negotiation and compromise a tough, fair, and workable bill has been crafted.  The bill before the Senate provides solutions to restore the rule of law, fix our broken borders, protect our national security, and bring the 12 million people now living illegally in the U.S. out of the shadows.  I believe this bipartisan bill is a strong first step toward addressing illegal immigration in a fair and balanced way.                        Immigration Enforcement  The bill is predicated on several fundamental principles. The first is that we must control our borders and protect our national security.  The bill ensures that before a single temporary visa is issued, or a single undocumented alien in the United States can earn their green card, several important ``triggers'' must be met--``triggers'' that show the Federal Government is taking a hard stance on enforcing the law and enforcing the border. The triggers include:  Installing at least 200 miles of vehicle barriers as well as 370 miles of fencing, 70 ground-based radar and camera towers, and deploying 4 unmanned aerial vehicles along the southern border; detaining all illegal aliens apprehended at the southern border, rather than continuing the ``catch and release'' policy; establishing and using the new Employment Verification system to confirm who can work in the United States legally and who cannot, and hiring 3,500 new border patrol agents to increase the total number of agents on the border from 14,500 to 18,000.  Then later, after the first 3,500 border patrol agents are hired, the bill requires that an additional 10,500 more border patrol agents are hired. So, the total number of border patrol agents will increase from its current level of 14,500, to 18,000 under the trigger, to eventually 28,500 by the end of five years.  The bill also requires hiring 1,000 new immigration agents, 200 new prosecutors, and new immigration judges and Board of Immigration Appeals members.  Next, the bill increases the penalties for people who illegally enter the U.S. or who overstay their visas.  Under current law, if an individual enters the U.S. illegally or overstays their visa they are barred from returning to the United States for three years, and could be barred for up to 10 years if they stayed in the U.S. illegally for over a year.  However, under the bill, if an individual is in the United States illegally the penalty is increased so that the person would be barred forever--and never be allowed to come to the United States.  The bill also includes provisions to fight passport and visa fraud based on the bill that Senator Sessions and I introduced this year.  These new provisions would punish people who traffic in 10 or more passports or visas, and increase the penalty for document fraud crimes to 20 years.  By including these tough new enforcement measures, this bill goes a long way to protecting our borders and takes a hard stand against individuals who violate the law.                         Employment Enforcement  The bill also takes a hard stand against employers who violate the law and hire illegal immigrants.  For too long, the administration has not enforced the laws on the books, and the negligible fines for hiring illegal aliens were just a part of doing business--this bill changes that.  Under current law, an employer can be fined $250 to $2,500 for hiring an unauthorized worker; the bill increases that fine to $5,000.  The bill also increases the penalties for employers who repeatedly violate the law and hire illegal aliens. Under current law, the highest penalty that can be assessed against an employer is $10,000 for a repeat violation; this bill imposes a new larger fine of $75,000 for repeat violations.  The bill creates a new employment verification system--mandating that within 3 years, all employers must verify with the Government that all of their employees, foreign and American, are who they say they are.  This new system will require employers to submit each employee's name and social security number or visa numbers to the Department of Homeland Security. DHS will then confirm whether the employee is in fact legally allowed to work.  If the DHS says the employee is not legally allowed to work or his legal status is in question, the employee then has 10 days to challenge the Government's conclusion, and while the employee is taking steps to contest his rejection, the Secretary must extendthe period of investigation and the employee cannot be fired.  This new verification system should ensure that individuals who are hired by American businesses are actually legally permitted to work in this country.                             Grand Bargain  Once the security and enforcement measures were established, the negotiators sought to devise a pragmatic solution to deal with the approximately 12 million illegal immigrants currently living in the United States.  This solution to this issue is what has been referred to as ``the grand bargain.''  In order to bring Democrats and Republicans together a compromise was adopted that creates a new ``Z'' visa that will establishes a strict path for those individuals who are already in the United States to be able to earn a legal status.  In exchange, the bill reforms the current immigration system and eliminates policies that allow for ``chain migration.''               Practical solution to 12 million now here  With respect to the first part of the grand bargain, I firmly believe we have to develop a practical solution to the deal with the 12 million illegal immigrants already in the country.  While some have complained that all 12 million undocumented aliens should be deported, such a solution is not practical nor is it reasonable--for many of those individuals and families who have become integrated into the fabric of their communities deportation would be a severe outcome.  For example, in my home State of California, the Munoz family from San Diego is facing exactly what a policy of absolute deportation would mean.  In 1989 Zulma and Abel Munoz came to the United States seeking medical care for their infant son who was sick--sadly, despite their efforts, 2 months later he died. At the time, Mrs. Munoz was pregnant with her second child, a girl, and a medical worker who had helped her son urged Mrs. Munoz to stay longer in the United States to make sure their infant daughter received proper care. They took that medical workers advice, and have remained in the United States since then. Both parents found work; they bought a home, and they repeatedly tried to legally adjust their status, but their attempts failed.  Then last month, at 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday night, Mrs. Munoz was arrested and led away from the house in her pajamas. Later when Mr. Munoz returned from Home Depot, he was handcuffed and taken away--leaving behind their three children, now 16, 13, and 9.  There are many families, like Mr. and Mrs. Munoz, who are not criminals, who have lived and worked in their communities for years, and who are productive members of society, but who are also in the U.S. illegally.  Families like these should be given the opportunity to come out of shadows, to earn a legal status, and to eventually apply for a green card--and that is what this bill provides through the Z visa program.  Let me be clear, this is not an amnesty. For those who say it is, I think it is important to define what amnesty means. Amnesty is automatically giving those who broke the law a clean slate no questions asked. This bill does not do that.  Instead, to qualify for a green card each individual must wait until the backlog has been cleared--approximately 8 years--and during that time these individuals and families would need to pass a national security check; apply for a Z-visa that allows them to stay in the U.S. legally; work or get an education; pay taxes; learn English; pay a fine of $5,000, plus processing fees of at least $3,000; not commit crimes; reapply and undergo additional background checks; return to their home country for a ``touch-back'' for at least a day, to submit their application, provide a fingerprint , biographical and biometric information; and earn enough points under the same merit system that all future applicants will use.  This is not amnesty. This is not simply giving a green card to anyone who is in the country illegally. Instead, through the Z visa program and the new merit system, each individual must meet these significant demands in order to earn a green card.                           Green card backlog  The second component of the ``grand bargain'' is to clear up the current backlog of individuals who have been waiting for green cards and to reform how green cards are awarded by creating a point system that is based on merit.  To achieve this, the bipartisan bill would provide about 200,000 new green cards annually that will go to those individuals who have followed the rules and applied for a green card prior to May 1, 2005.  For anyone who applied after May 1, 2005, they will now be required to re-apply through the new merit-based point system. This new point system is based on what has been done in other countries, including Canada and Australia. It sets up a framework to allow individuals to earn points that would qualify them to earn a green card.  Under this new system, individuals will get points for education, work history, ability to speak English, as well as whether they have U.S. citizen family members. This new point system is a balanced approach that considers multiple factors and allows individuals to earn their green cards.                        Temporary Worker Program  Finally, the third component in the ``grand bargain'' is to ensure that temporary means temporary--meaning workers who come to the United States on a ``temporary worker visa'' must return to their home countries when the visa expires.  Under the new ``Y-visa'' there are 2 temporary worker programs--one that brings in workers for 2 years, and then requires the worker to leave for a year; and a second, seasonal Y-visa where workers can come in for 10 months, and then are required to leave for 2 months.  Workers who come to the United States under the longer ``2 years in the country, 1 year out of the country'' program can renew their visa so that they can work up to 6 years total; but every 2 years they must leave the United States for a year.  However, if Y-visa holder wants to bring their family with them to the United States then they would be limited to only 1 renewal and they would have to demonstrate that they can support their family. They would do this by showing that the family has health insurance and that they will earn a wage above 150 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines.  Finally, the new Y-visa program is capped at 400,000 foreign workers a year for the 2-year/1-year program and 100,000 visas for the seasonal 10-month/2-month program. Both of these caps contain escalation clauses that allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue additional visas up to 600,000 per year for the longer program and up to 200,000 per year for the seasonal program.  The escalation clause in the longer program gives the Secretary the discretion to increase the number of Y-visas by as much as 10 percent or 15 percent each year. According to some estimates, this means that in 10 years well over 3.4 million foreign workers could come into the United States through the longer Y-visa program.  I am concerned about the impact on our economy and our country if such a substantial number of visas were to be issued. Senator Bingaman has an amendment that would eliminate the escalator and reduce the cap to permit only 200,000 Y-visas each year to be issued under the longer program. I am a cosponsor of the Bingaman amendment and I voted for it last Congress.  While I agree with the grand bargain principle that temporary means temporary, I am concerned that the high cap on the longer Y-visa program and the inclusion of the escalator means that the numbers of temporary workers coming in through this program are just too high.  But with the adoption of the Bingaman amendment I believe the temporary worker program adopts the right balance and still fulfills the principles of the ``grand bargain.''                      Need for Agricultural Labor  In addition to these important principles that were developed as part of the ``grand bargain'', the bipartisan bill contains two more important provisions: the DREAM Act and AgJOBS.  Last Congress, Senators Craig, Kennedy, and I repeatedly tried to pass AgJOBS. This bill reforms the current H-2A agricultural temporary worker program and creates a path to legalization for undocumented farm workers currently in the U.S.  There is no industry that is suffering more from a labor shortage than agriculture. Foreign workers make up as much as 90 percent of the work force and over half of the foreign workers are undocumented--as many as 1.5 million.  But for years now we have heard from farmers and growers that they can not get the labor force needed to harvest their crops.  California growers tell me that their labor forces are already down 30 percent this year. For example, Larry Stonebarger, a cherry packer in Stockton, CA, has said that his packing house only has 650 workers, instead of 1100 he needs.  California provides a vital part of our Nation's food source. Half of this country's fruits are grown in California and, in fact, California is the only U.S. producer of almonds, figs, kiwi fruit, olives, and raisins. The importance of having locally grown produce cannot be underestimated.  This Sunday, the Washington Post reported that the Food and Drug Administration detained 107 food imports from China at U.S. ports just last month. They found dried apples preserved with a cancer-causing chemical; mushrooms laced with illegal pesticides; juices and fruits rejected as ``filthy''; and prunes tinted with chemical dyes not approved for human consumption. This situation is unacceptable. But, amazingly, as we fight to keep out foreign produce that is not protected by safety and quality controls, our own immigration policies undermine the ability of U.S. growers to produce high quality fruits and vegetables right here in our own country.  The reality is, if there are not enough farm workers to harvest the crops in the United States, we will end up relying on foreign countries to provide our food. This is not good for our economy or for ensuring that Americans are receiving safe and healthy foods.  The best way to avoid this outcome is to ensure that American farmers and growers have the workers they need to harvest the crops, and the best way to ensure we have a stable agriculture labor force is to pass AgJOBS.  Our bill will stabilize the labor shortage on our farms by allowing undocumented farm workers who have worked in agriculture and agree to continue to work in agriculture for 3 to 5 years to earn a Z-A visa and eventually a green card. This will create a path to earn legal status for those ag workers already in the country.  Secondly, AgJOBS will streamline the H-2A program so that it is usable, so that growers and farmers can have access to a consistent supply of temporary workers in the future.  AgJOBS is a bipartisan bill that needs to be enacted to ensure that farmers, growers, and farm workers can continue to provide Americans home-grown, safe and healthy produce.  Immigration reform is certainly a difficult area to tackle, but this bill strikes the right balance and reflects the best thinking on how to accommodate all the various concerns and interests.  While it is easy to sit on the sidelines and criticize, it is harder to stand up, take on the tough issues, make the hard decisions and do what is right to fix our immigration system. I want to commend Senators Kennedy, Specter, Salazar, and Kyl for their hard work in undertaking this difficult issue and crafting this important legislation.  This is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill, and it is a bill that I hope the Senate will pass.                Amendment No. 1146 to Amendment No. 1150
