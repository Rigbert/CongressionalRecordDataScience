 President, today I am introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover screening tests for cancer. Congresswomen Carolyn Maloney and Sue Kelly are introducing a companion bill in the House today.  The bill requires plans to cover screening tests including mammography and clinical breast examinations for breast cancer, ``pap'' tests and pelvic examinations for gynecological cancers, colorectal screening for colon and rectum cancers, and prostate screening for prostate cancer.  To address future changes in scientific knowledge and medical practice, the bill allows the Secretary to change the requirements upon the Secretary's initiative or upon petition by a private individual or group. This provision is included because we do not yet have screening tests for many cancers, including brain tumors, leukemia Hodgkin's disease, and ovarian, liver and pancreatic cancers. These are often not detected until they produce symptoms, at which point the cancer may have advanced significantly.  The American Cancer Society has described ``screening'' as ``the search for disease in persons who do not have disease or who do not recognize that they have symptoms of disease,'' Screening, as defined by the American medical Association, is ``health care services or products provided to an individual without apparent signs or symptoms of an illness, injury, or disease for the purpose of identifying or excluding an undiagnosed illness, disease or condition.'' One of the most common screening procedures is the mammogram, which millions of women get annually to determine if there are suspicious lesions or lumps in their breasts.  A major way to reduce the number of cancer-related deaths and to increase survival is to increase cancer screening rates. The American Cancer Society, (ACS), predicts that 563,100 Americans will die of cancer this year. With appropriate screening, one-third of cancer deaths could be prevented, says ACS.  Screening is the greatest single tool for finding cancers early. Cancers found early are cancers that do not grow or metastasize and are cancers that can be treated more successfully than those that are found late. Early detection can extend life, reduce treatment, and improve the quality of life. For example, people can have colon cancer long before they know it. They may not have any symptoms, Patients diagnosed by a colon cancer screening have a 90 percent chance of survival while patients not diagnosed until symptoms are apparent only have a 8 percent change of survival.  Screening-accessible cancers, such as cancers of the breast, tongue, mouth, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis, and skin, account for approximately half of all new cancer cases. If all Americans had regular cancer screenings, the five-year survival rate for cancers of the breast, tongue, mouth, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis and skin could grow from 81 percent to 95 percent.  Screening costs less than treatment. For example, Medicare pays from $100 to $400 for a colorectal cancer screening test. The cost of treating colorectal cancer from diagnosis to death costs over $51,000, according to the Institute of Medicine.  To put cancer deaths in perspective, the number of Americans that die each year from cancer exceeds the total number of Americans lost to all wars that we have fought in this century. The American Cancer Society says that over 1.3 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year.  Despite our increasing understanding of cancer, unless we act with urgency, the cost to the United States is likely to become unmanageable in the next 10-20 years. The incidence rate of cancer in 2010 is estimated to increase by 29 percent for new cases, and cancer deaths are estimated to increase by 25 percent. Cancer will surpass heart disease as the leading fatal disease in the U.S. by 2010. With our aging U.S. population, unless we act now to change current cancer incidence and death rates, according to the September 1998 report from the Cancer March Research. Task Force, we can expect over 2.0 million new cancer cases and 1.0 million deaths per year by 2025. Listen to these startling statistics: One out of every four deaths in the U.S. is caused by cancer. That more than 1,500 Americans will die each day from cancer. The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 8.2 million Americans alive today have a history of cancer. One out of every two men, one out of every three women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime.  One of the tragedies of cancer is that we have tools available which can prevent much unnecessary suffering and death. But cancer must be prevented and it must be found early.  Deaths from colorectal cancer could be cut in half if most people over 50 had refuting screenings, for a disease that claims 56,700 a year.  Experts cite several barriers that prevent many Americans from getting cancer screenings. These include a lack of insurance coverage, inadequate insurance coverage, inability to pay for screenings, a fear of discomfort, and the fact that most of American health care is complaint drive, not preventive.  Insurance coverage is a major factor in whether people have preventive screenings. In other words, when screenings are covered by plans, people are more likely to get them. In California, screening rates for cervical and breast cancer are lower for uninsured women, who are less likely to have had a recent screening and more likely to have gone longer without being screened than women with coverage. In Medicare, for example, a study reported in Public Health Reports in October 1997, found that Medicare coverage increased the use of mammograms.  According to an University of California-Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research study from February 1998, in California women ages 18-64, 63 percent of uninsured women had not had a Pap test during 1997 versus 40 percent of insured women. Additionally, approximately 67 percent of uninsured Californian women ages 30-64 had not had a clinical breast examination during 1997, compared to 40 percent for insured women in the same age group.  The bill we are introducing, by requiring plans to cover screenings, can reduce death, reduce suffering and reduce costs.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  A summary of the bill follows:       Summary of the Comprehensive Cancer Screening Act of 2001       Requires private health insurance plans to cover cancer      screenings consistent with professionally-developed and      recognized medical guidelines, specifically: mammograms and      clinical breast examinations (for breast cancer); ``pap''      tests and pelvic examinations (for gynecological cancers);      colorectal screening (for colon and rectum cancers); prostate      cancer screening (for prostate cancers).       Authorizes the U.S. Secretary of Health an Human Services      by regulation to modify or update the coverage requirements      to reflect advances in medical practice or new scientific      knowledge, for all cancers as screenings are developed, based      on the Secretary's own initiative or upon the petition of an      individual or organization.       Prohibits health insurance plans from: denying eligibility      for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of the bill;      providing monetary payments to encourage individuals to      accept less than the minimum protections available;      penalizing or reducing reimbursement because a provider      provides care consistent with these requirements; providing      incentives to a provider to encourage the provider to provide      care inconsistent with the requirements.       Requires plans to provide subscribers full information on      the extent of coverage, including covered benefits, cost-     sharing requirements, and the extent of choice of providers.                                 ______                                       By
