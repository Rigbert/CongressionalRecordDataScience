Speaker, I rise today in adamant opposition to President Clinton's unilateral decision to bailout the Government of Mexico. In response to the President's actions, I am joining a number of my colleagues in introducing today a resolution calling for a full investigation of this matter by the U.S. Comptroller General.  I am extremely disappointed that the President decided to circumvent Congress and provide billions of dollars in United States-backed loan guarantees to rescue Mexico from a financial collapse without first receiving congressional approval. The taxpaying citizens of northwest Indiana are absolutely opposed to this United States-funded bailout of the Mexican Government.  While I recognize and appreciate the problems associated with a devalued peso and illegal immigration, I do not believe these arguments are compelling enough to justify a nearly $50 billion bailout of the Mexican Government. As someone who adamantly opposed NAFTA, I strongly believe that the United States aid package designed to prop up Mexico's unstable economy is the wrong course of action to take at this time. Mexico's problems are far more serious than a short-term currency shortage. This crisis clearly shows that NAFTA has failed to deliver on its promises of a strong and stable Mexico.  Mexico's problems are social, political, and economic in nature. The present crisis was precipitated by the Chiapas rebellion, as well as the assassination of key leaders. Mexican society is unstable, as evidenced by the recent elections, which contained extensive voter fraud. Mexico is also continuing its policy of repressing worker rights and labor standards in order to attract United States factories and foreign investors. New economic reforms proposed by the Mexican Government would reduce the average Mexican wage by at least 5 percent over the coming year, making cheap Mexican labor even cheaper.  Mexican's reforms have not gone far enough and they are now going the wrong direction. The Mexican Government is going to reduce wages of the ordinary worker, including the minimum wage, in order to help balance the Mexican budget and control the economy. Punishing the ordinary Mexican worker because of the irresponsibility of the Mexican elite is typical of a country with such a large gap between the rich and the poor.  Finally, we are setting a bad precedent by helping Mexico. It is entirely possible that Mexico will face a similar or worse crisis in the near future. United States taxpayers should not have to put up billions of dollars every time Mexico is unable to maintain fiscal stability. After all, 38,000 taxpaying citizens of northwest Indiana lost their jobs in the late 1970's and 1980's. The U.S. Government certainly did not step in to provide loan guarantees for those with home mortgages, credit card debt, or car loans.  I urge all Members to take a strong stand on this issue by supporting the resolution introduced by Representative Gene Taylor requiring that the U.S. Comptroller General provide a detailed explanation about the legality of the President's decision.                          ____________________
