 As we go forward with this legislation, I hope we will do more to look at the exchanges, which are the new marketplace for American health care. We haven't had that kind of approach since decades ago when we had a discussion about a system that, for all practical purposes, tethered people to one choice that was a judgment by an employer and insurance company. I wish to make sure, in the days ahead, that as many people as possible can keep exactly what they have today. That is something the President feels strongly about. That is something every Member of the Senate feels strongly about. I also want employers and employees to be able to say they are going to have a broader range of choices than they do now.  I think that can be done in a way that does not destabilize employer-based coverage. In fact, I believe it will strengthen employer-based coverage. I think that is one of the reasons the National Federation of Independent Business has endorsed our proposal.  We have a lot of work to do. I think there is a lot of good faith among Senators on both sides to get this done. I have always felt that on issues such as this, when you are talking about one-sixth of the American economy, you ought to try to find as much common ground as you possibly can. The three of us have come together behind a new set of amendments that does find some bipartisan common ground, around principles the President has embraced--choice and competition.  At this point, I yield whatever time she desires to our friend from Maine, who is a wonderful partner in this, along with Senator Bayh. Americans are looking for commonsense ideas above all else. That is what we have sought to do in this proposal.  I yield to my friend from Maine.
