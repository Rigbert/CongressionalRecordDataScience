 President, this Senate resolution S. Res. 227 is very similar to a Senate resolution passed by this body in 1996. That 1996 resolution--S. Res. 321--was passed to ensure that Senators who wanted to challenge the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act could do so using unlimited pro bono legal services, subject to regulations promulgated by the Ethics Committee.  It is clear that the campaign finance bill that passed today--H.R. 2356--will be challenged in court if the President signs it into law. The Senate resolution which passed today makes it clear that any Member of this body may receive pro bono legal services in connection with any action challenging the constitutionality of that law.  This body is in agreement on this issue. There is no need for debate or a vote. This new Senate resolution ensures that the Senate will continue its tradition of permitting Members to utilize unlimited pro bono legal services when challenging legislation that raises serious constitutional questions.
