Chairman, I have had Mr. Lyons in my office last year and this year telling me he was going to rationalize the program and take care of the accountability problems and the proliferation of passes. Nothing has happened. I would appreciate it if something would happen.  But I would further urge that if the committee is going to travel that they travel to my district and perhaps hold a hearing on the issue in my district and hear of some of the concerns and problems or meet in the district of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), from whom you will hear later. Because I think the committee will hear a little different story, perhaps because we have so many forests in our State and the proliferation is a problem.  Finally, if it is so popular, and I am not sure of those polling numbers, I suggest that perhaps I should offer my other amendment, which is to turn it into a voluntary system and turn do away with the enforcement. The Forest Service could save money on the enforcement, and perhaps the gentleman from Ohio would look favorably upon that amendment.
