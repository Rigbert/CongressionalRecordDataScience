 President, at this time I would like to recognize Brian Pomper, chief trade counsel for the Democratic staff on the Finance Committee. Today is Brian's last day with the committee. Brian has been a real asset to the Senate, and he will be greatly missed.  He has worked both with my staff and sometimes against my staff, but let me tell you this: He is the sort of person who, whether he is with you entirely or against you, is a wonderful person to work with. So at all times the lines of communication with him between our staffs always remained open, and it has always been a friendly relationship.  Brian is a very warm and decent person, and I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. It is my understanding that he is going to go into the private sector, the cold cruel world of the private sector. I hope he enjoys it, but I want to thank him for his cooperation with us.                          ____________________[Page S11641]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO BRIAN POMPER
