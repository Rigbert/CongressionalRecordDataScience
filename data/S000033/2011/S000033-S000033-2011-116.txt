 President, today I honor the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont. NOFA Vermont is a nonprofit association of farmers, gardeners, and consumers working to promote an economically viable and ecologically sound Vermont food system for the benefit of current and future generations. This year it celebrates its 40th anniversary of helping farms thrive, making locally grown and organic foods available to all, and increasing consumer access at farmers markets across our Green Mountain State.  NOFA Vermont was founded in Putney in 1971, making it one of the oldest organic farming associations in the United States. Today, they are proud to have more than 1,200 members throughout the State and to certify over 525 farms and processors to the USDA national organic program standards. They are passionate about increasing the acreage of certified organic land in Vermont, while also increasing access to local organic food by all Vermonters. The entirety of their programs strives to meet these goals, whether it involves working with schools to bring local foods into the cafeteria, or providing business planning services to farmers to ensure their businesses stay viable.  With a vision that consists of small farms and agriculturally based businesses that are improving the ecology of Vermont foodscapes, where organic farms and gardens supply food to all members of their communities and where everyone knows their farmers, I see NOFA-VT as an exemplary national leader for the USDA campaign ``Know your Farmer, Know your Food.''  Executive director, Enid Wonnacott, has led this exceptional organization for the past 30 years. She and her dedicated team offer technical assistance and revolving loan funds; and supply information on energy management, apprenticeships, and educational and electronic resources. They have built direct markets between farmers and consumers through the VT Farmers Market Association and have sponsored outstanding conferences yearly. This year they expect more than 1,500 farmers to attend their winter conference, which is extremely well-run, worthwhile, and fun. They provide knowledgeable speakers, workshops brimming with information and healthy attitudes for the 21st century of farming.  Finally, I have been very impressed with their commitment to Vermont's future and our children as NOFA-VT has been a significant partner in the advancement of the Vermont Food and Farm Education program, FEED. This critical program provides schools, farmers, food service directors, and community partners with technical assistance, training, and professional development to advance student achievement, improve childhood nutrition, and create community-based farm to school programs. It is through programs such as these that children are able to connect with the farm in their community, understand where their food comes from, and have the opportunity to eat local healthy food in their school meal programs.  I offer my sincerest congratulations to NOFA-VT on the occasion of their 40th anniversary of service to our great State of Vermont and wish them many more years of continued success.                          ____________________
