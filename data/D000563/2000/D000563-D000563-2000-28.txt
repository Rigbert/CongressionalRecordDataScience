President, I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his kind remarks in behalf of the birthday of our colleague from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond. Those were excellent remarks and tribute to a man with whom we have been proud to serve.  I would like to note, because the Senator is such a historian, that someone handed me a little piece of history which might be instructive to us in the days ahead.  The year was 1881, when a special session of the Senate convened on March 4, 1881. The session was called for the exclusive purpose of handling Cabinet and agency nominations for the new administration of President James Garfield. Republicans and Democrats were split evenly 37-37, with 2 independent Senators. Under normal circumstances, this short session should have lasted about 11 days. Due to intense partisanship, it resulted in deadlock. It ran for 11 weeks.  I hope that is a lesson to those of us who are trying to find a reasonable way to resolve our new challenge in the new Congress; that there are ways to do it so we can avoid that kind of deadlock and that kind of delay.  I see the Senator from Iowa present.
