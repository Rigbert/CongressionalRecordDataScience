Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th Anniversary Celebration of Georgian Court University (GCU). For the past 100 years, Georgian Court has been a leader in higher education, encouraging intellectual inquiry, ethical professionalism, and community involvement. Founded as a women's college in 1908 by the Sisters of Mercy, Georgian Court is dedicated to the success of women. The Women's College at GCU provides a liberal arts education tailored to women's learning styles and an environment conducive to achievement. Georgian Court's Women in Leadership Development program is one of the most powerful programs for young women today. By participating in university committees, making presentations, lobbying legislators, and networking with mentors, students develop the skills and tools needed by today's successful women leaders. In the 1970s, Georgian Court established a coeducational graduate program. Today, the University College caters to men and women adult students and offers flexible class schedules with online components at a number of locations throughout the state.  With 29 undergraduate and 8 graduate degree programs, Georgian Court University continues to develop new academic programs to meet the changing needs of the time. A new nursing program established in this Centennial Year will help stem the serious nursing shortage in our state. Accelerated and Executive M.B.A.s allow busy executives to gain the information they need to advance their careers. As 1 of only 50 NASA Educational Resource Centers, Georgian Court ensures that our children's teachers have the most up-to-date scientific information for their classrooms.  Georgian Court University has preserved the estate that comprises its campus and is on the National Register of Historic Places and the New Jersey Register. Over the decades, GCU has added buildings to meet the growing student population--starting with 7 students in 1908 up to more than 3,000 today. Within the past several years, a new wellness center, residence hall, chapel, and science wing have been added to the Georgian Court landscape.  Georgian Court University is an economic force in Lakewood and the surrounding areas, providing employment to thousands over its 100-year history and fueling the local economy. The university is also a cultural gathering place for the community, bringing notable artists, musicians, poets, writers, and political figures to campus for lectures and concerts that are open to the public.  Sending teams of students and staff to poverty-stricken areas of Honduras to install water systems, to New Orleans to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina, or right here in Lakewood to help provide the necessities of life for the homeless, Georgian Court University is a good neighbor and is committed to making the world a better place. Georgian Court is also an ecologically aware citizen, contributing to the sustainability of our environment. Its new wellness center complex has been built with energy efficiency in mind and is being considered for LEED--Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design--certification.  With an abiding commitment to its students, the community, and the greater good, I commend Georgian Court University on its 100 years of academic excellence and community service.                          ____________________
