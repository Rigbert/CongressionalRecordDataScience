Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his comments, and I believe that the House in the conference must oppose all detrimental riders, including those that were passed by the other body.  I would just like to add as well that we were really under the gun when we introduced this motion yesterday. Under the House Rules, it has to be introduced when we are in session. Because the legislative activity yesterday went a little bit faster than usual, and we were in fear that the conference would be finished even last night or today, we had to be very quick in drafting this.  I view this as a first step. I think we ought to go a lot further and take a lot of the junk out that the Senate put in. I would completely agree with the gentleman from New York with regard to the environmental riders and would hope that they would be stripped out. I know for me, as a Member, if they are not, I will be voting ``no'' when this bill comes back.
