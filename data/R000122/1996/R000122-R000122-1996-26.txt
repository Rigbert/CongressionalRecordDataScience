Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment, which is offered by myself and my colleagues, Mr. Frank of Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy of Massachusetts, and Mr. Kennedy of Rhode Island. It would prohibit all military education and training funds for Indonesia, IMET funds.  Currently, Indonesia receives expended IMET. Unfortunately, the Indonesian military has not made progress in improving its human rights record. The record is very clear. Indeed, the Department of State's ``Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1995'' states that the Indonesian Government continues to commit serious human rights violations in East Timor.  The report further states:       The armed forces continued to be responsible for the most      serious human rights abuses.       On East Timor, no progress was made in accounting for      missing persons following the 1991 Dili incident or the 10      other Timorese that disappeared in 1995.                              {time}  1430  And finally, ``The armed forces used excessive force in making arrests following anti-integration rioting in Dili in October.''  Mr. Chairman, our IMET resources are designed to provide training for other military forces around the world. It is not designed to encourage or in any way aid or abet in such human rights abuses. And, in fact, one would hope that these resources and the training that is involved with themwould be a strong barrier against such abuses of human rights.  We are not at this juncture criticizing the IMET program. The IMET program, as it is practiced around the world, is a valuable source of American foreign policy and military preparedness and national security strength for our country and our allies. But we cannot, I think, sit idly by, watching these abuses in East Timor against a people who were the victims of an invasion 20 years ago and continue to fund this type of military support for their regime, their military, those people who have been identified by our State Department as being the perpetrators of these types of human rights abuses.  In 1992, Congress, in a sense of shock and outrage, cut off IMET funds to East Timor. In 1991, on film, the British Broadcasting Corp. filmed the massacre of 250 East Timor residents by the forces of the Indonesian Armed Forces. That was such a shocking revolting incident that we acted properly and cut off those funds. We restored those moneys, but we restored those moneys with the idea that the Indonesian military had learned their lesson; that they would not continue these practices of human rights abuses.  Sadly, sadly, Mr. Chairman, that lesson has not been learned. It is incumbent upon us today to once again reiterate our strong opposition to these abuses and to do it in a palpable, tangible way, to do it by eliminating IMET funds for the Government of Indonesia and their armed forces. This is a position which, I think, has strong support in many different quarters.  Mr. Chairman, I will at the appropriate time introduce a letter in the extension of remarks from the Catholic Conference in support of this amendment, and included in that letter is the following language: ``Curtailing IMET funding to Indonesia constitutes a small but symbolically important expression by our government of the need for Indonesia to show greater will in resolving these problems.'' We cannot allow another 20 years of abuses to continue in East Timor.  I would also say for the record, which I think is important, Mr. Chairman, we have spent our the last several days debating this bill, in different guises, talking about Desert Storm and over valiant efforts to liberate Kuwait from the unprovoked aggression of Iraq in 1991.  Well, the similarities in this situation are ironic but associate, but in this situation it was the Government of Indonesia that struck a defenseless country, overran it without any justification under international law, and today not only do we not condemn that invasion vigorously but we continue to assist the Indonesian military. It would be as if we had stood by idly and passively in the gulf and now today continued to assist the Iraqi Armed Forces.  So, Mr. Chairman, I think justice and human rights and sound policy is on the side of this amendment and I hope it passes.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
