 Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), if I might. I had planned to offer an amendment to increase funding for the rural community advancement program by $10 million in order to fund a national pilot program to promote agritourism.  The purpose of this program is to provide another means of income for America's struggling family farmers. I think the plight of the family farmer in America is well documented, and I do not need to get into it right now. But as I said before, I am impressed with the work done in New Mexico with the rural economic development through tourism program.  I know the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) has been very active in that program. I think it would be very useful to expand this general concept into a national program. I think it is working well in New Mexico, and I think it could work well throughout rural America.  However, I understand that the funding authority for the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies has decreased significantlyfor fiscal year 1999, and I would, therefore, like to get a commitment from the gentleman from New Mexico to work with me in the future to fund a pilot national agritourism program for fiscal year 2000.
