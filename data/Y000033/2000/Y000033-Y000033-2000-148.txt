If the gentleman will continue to yield, Mr. Speaker, I would like to suggest that many people are very much unaware of the new demand on electrical power.  Twenty-five years ago we did not have that demand. The power being generated today, which we are now using mostly fossil fuels, natural gas, coal, no oil, but those two things, now the demand comes from that which we all take for granted, and that is the computer, the Internet.  The Internet alone, just the Internet, not the total, the Internet alone increased the consumption of electrical power 7 percent this year. Seven percent of our energy now is being used by the Internet.
