So it is a delay tactic to slow down the Senate, slow down deliberation.  Today, when the Democratic majority leader offered to the Republicans that we would call up Senator Webb's amendment to make sure our troops are rested and ready before they go into battle and allow Senator Graham, a Republican Senator, to have his similar amendment up at the same time with the same vote, it was rejected. The Republicans rejected it. Then one of the Senators came to the floor and said that is the way it has always been around here. It has always been this way, this is not unusual. It takes 60 votes to agree to these amendments. Now we know what it is going to take.  We did a little research, I might say to the majority leader. We looked at the last two Defense authorization bills which were called up and considered in this Senate. Not a single amendment required a cloture vote, required this delay tactic, required the 60-vote margin, even those amendments specifically relating to the war in Iraq. What the Republican leadership is doing now has not happened in the last 2 years on this same bill. They have come up with a new slowdown, a new delay tactic, a new obstacle they have tossed in our path.  I think it is very clear. The Senator from Nevada will recall that the last time the Defense authorization bill was up, there were two very important amendments on the war on Iraq, one by Senator Kerry of Massachusetts and another by Senators Levin and Reed. Both related to when the troops would come home. In each instance, cloture was not necessary, 60 votes were not required; the amendments were called on a simple majority vote. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On Page S8936, July 10, 2007 the following appears: another by Senators Levin and Reid.    The online version has been corrected to: another by Senators Levin and Reed. ========================= END NOTE =========================   So I say to the Senator from Nevada, it is very clear, the strategy the Republicans in the Senate are using. They are trying to avoid facing the tough issues America wants us to face. We were sent here to deal with cleaning up the mess in Washington, the culture of corruption. We were sent here to deal with the war in Iraq. Instead, day in and day out, week in and week out, every month for 43 different times now they have tossed an obstacle in front of us to stop the debate. The American people can see this, and today they can see it very graphically.
