 President, I rise today to recognize Shirley Smith-Pointer who is retiring from the Social Security Administration after 34 years of Federal service.  Ms. Smith-Pointer held the positions of claims development clerk, data review technician, and claims representative--the position she held upon retiring. Her duties as a claims representative involved assisting the public in filing claims for retirement, survivors, disability, and Medicare, and also determining entitlement and making final adjudication for those claims.  In addition to her good work as a Social Security employee, Ms. Smith-Pointer was very active in, and helpful to, her community. She served as secretary, usher, and Sunday school teacher for her church. She has also been a member of the National Council of Negro Women and served the Chestnut Street YMCA's Black Achievers' Program.  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in recognizing Shirley Smith-Pointer for 34 years of dedicated service to the Federal Government.                          ____________________
