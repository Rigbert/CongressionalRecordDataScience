 By our Senate oath of office we each commit to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' That is our paramount duty and a responsibility that I certainly cherish in this opportunity to represent the people of Vermont here today.  A constitutional amendment on the budget poses dangers to Vermont and threatens the constitutional principles that have sustained our democratic form of Federal Government over the past 200 years. Separation of powers, checks and balances, and majority rule are not constitutional guarantees to be altered without serious deliberation.  The real question this year is not whether to reduce the deficit, but by how much and what cuts to make in order to bring the budget into balance. That is the hard work that lies before us.  As President Clinton declared in his State of the Union Addresses: All we need to balance the budget is for Congress to pass a bill and for his signature. We do not need to change the Constitution of the United States.  The time and resources devoted to reconsidering a constitutional amendment on the budget merely serve as a distraction from the real task at hand. Let us not be distracted, again, from the true means to deficit reduction: Hard work, hard choices, and bipartisan cooperation with the President.  Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us reach the level of deficit reduction that has been achieved over the past 4 years. We cannot legislate political courage. We must summon that ingredient from ourselves.  In addition to being unnecessary, there are six key reasons why adoption of this proposed 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would, in the words of Treasury Secretary Rubin, ``be a terrible, terrible mistake.''                          risks to the economy  First, this amendment could be economically ruinous.  During recessions, deficits rise because tax receipts decline while various Government payments, like unemployment insurance, increase. By contrast, the amendment would require disastrous raises in taxes or cuts in countercyclical spending during a recession or depression.  As Treasury Secretary Rubin testified: ``a balanced budget amendment could turn slowdowns into recessions, and recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.''  Our economic policy--especially as we attempt to compete and adjust in an increasingly global economy--must be flexible enough to allow each generation of Americans and each Congress and President to deal with changing economic conditions as they see fit in serving the best interests of the Nation and our citizens. Yet, this proposal would impose an inflexible prescription on all future generations of Americans in perpetuity.       it increases the risks of government shutdown and default  Second, this constitutional amendment would vastly raise the stakes and risks to taxpayers and all citizens of a Government shutdown and default. We now have the experience of a year ago to gauge just how great these risks would be to our economy.  Under the supermajority requirements in the proposed amendment, a minority of Members, either from a particular region or sharing a political philosophy, could force the U.S. Government into default unless they got their way--just like a handful of House Members in 1995 tried to force President Clinton to accept their balanced budget plan by refusing to vote to raise the debt limit.  This proposed constitutional amendment would prevent the Treasury from taking the same measures it did during the 1995 budget crisis to avoid a default. Without that flexibility, the Government also would be unable to ensure on-time Social Security checks or Medicare and veterans benefits.                 an invitation to constitutional crisis  Third, this proposed constitutional amendment risks seriously undercutting the protection of our constitutional separation of powers.  No one has yet convincingly explained how the proposed amendment will work and what roles the President and the courts are to play in its implementation and enforcement. Constitutionalizing the budget and economic policy would inevitably throw the Nation's fiscal policy into the courts, the last place issues of taxing and spending should be decided under our system.  The effect could be to toss important issues of spending priorities and funding levels to the President or to thousands of lawyers, filing hundreds of lawsuits in dozens of Federal and State courts. If approved, the amendment would let Congress off the hook by kicking massive responsibility for how tax dollars are spent to the President or to unelected judges.          it erodes the fundamental principle of majority rule  Fourth, this proposed constitutional amendment undermines the fundamental principle of majority rule by imposing a three-fifths supermajority vote to adopt certain budgets and to raise the debt limit.  Our founders rejected such supermajority voting requirements on matters within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described supermajority requirements as a ``poison'' that serves ``to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.'' These supermajority requirements are a recipe for increased gridlock, not more efficient action.  The amendment's supermajority requirements would permit minority factions to extort pork barrel projects or extreme legislation as their price for avoiding a Government shutdown and default. Do we really want to allow 40 percent plus one of the Members in either the House or the Senate to hold the budget hostage to their demands?                         it is a pig in a poke  There is much truth to the axiom that the ``devil is in the details.'' This proposed constitutional amendment uses such general terms that even its sponsors and proponents concede that implementing legislation will be necessary to clarify how it will work.  What will this implementing legislation say? We will not find out until we see this implementing legislation. The questions raised that still lack satisfactory answers are many: What programs will be off-budget? What role will the courts and the President have in executing and enforcing the amendment? What will be considered compliance with the amendment? How much of a deficit may be financed and carried over to the next year? Many other questions still await answers going to core matters that are critical to our understanding of what this amendment means.  Congress should not be asked to amend the Constitution by signing what amounts to a blank check. Nor should any State be asked to ratify a pig in a poke.  In the interests of fair disclosure, Congress should first determine the substance of any implementing legislation, as it did in connection with the 18th amendment, the other attempt to draft a substantive behavioral policy in the Constitution.         it fails to protect basic commitments to our citizens  Sixth, this proposed constitutional amendment fails to live up to the commitments we have made to our citizens. It uses the annual surplus in the Social Security trust fund to mask thetrue size of the Federal budget deficit for years to come. This is wrong.  In addition to using the Social Security trust funds, this proposed constitutional amendment could short-change our seniors who depend on Medicare, our veterans who depend on service benefits, and our children who depend on nutrition programs. We have made commitments to our seniors, our veterans, and our children. But this amendment fails to honor our commitments. This is unacceptable.                               conclusion  We Vermonters pride ourselves on being able to apply Yankee common sense in sorting the sensible from the fanciful, and this proposed constitutional amendment lacks common sense, Yankee or otherwise.  One of the newspapers in my State observed: ``Amending the Constitution to require a balanced Federal budget would be like using a sledgehammer to nail a picket in a fence. The picket might stand, but at great risk to the fence.''  Even the short span of 2 years since the last debate on this amendment has brought forward changed fiscal and budget circumstances and new insights into the implications of amending the Constitution in this way.  Let us not proceed with a view to short-run popularity, but with a clear vision of our responsibilities to our constituents and the Nation in accordance with our venerable and venerated Constitution.  Madam President, for the last 4 weeks, I have been saying over and over again to Senators, think about what we are doing. This country, which has a Constitution the envy of all other democracies on Earth, has amended that Constitution only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. In that 17 times, one of those amendments was to repeal an earlier mistake, the amendment on prohibition.  Madam President, during that time, we have had civil wars, invasions of our Nation, the War of 1812, terrible world wars, Korean war, Vietnam war, depressions, recessions, earthquakes, natural calamities, expansion of our Nation. With all these changes, most of which were far, far greater than anything we see today, we resisted the temptation to amend the Constitution. We resisted the temptation to tinker with our Constitution, and we always came out a stronger nation.  We hear talk about Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson borrowed twice the budget of the United States for the Louisiana Purchase. Can you imagine what this country would be like had he not had the foresight to do that? Or can you imagine what this country would be like had he had the same constitutional amendment and not been able to borrow the money for the Louisiana Purchase? Where would this Nation be?  I hear one Senator come in the Chamber and talk about Senators who appear to change their position. I would point out that I heard no criticism from him of the three Senators who had opposed this constitutional amendment and now support it.  I hear a Senator come in the Chamber and say we need this to balance the budget, and yet that same Senator has done nothing to bring out of his own committee a budget, even though the law requires him to do so, within the next month.  Madam President, we do not need a bumper-sticker, sloganeering constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We can just have enough courage to face up to the special interest groups of the left and the right and balance the budget ourselves. That is what we need.  So many of those who are hollering for this sound like the lion in ``The Wizard of Oz.'' They are seeking courage. If we do not have the courage to do what is right, then we do not belong here. But I am afraid that some who want this are simply looking for something that will reflect the passing poll of the moment. The Constitution of the United States is not a passing poll of the moment. The Constitution of the United States is the bedrock of this Nation. It is why we have the strongest democracy in the world. It is why, incidentally, we have the strongest economy in the world.  Instead of running down our economy, instead of running down our Constitution, instead of adding something that looks good on a public opinion poll but does not look good on the test of time, we ought to do what is right: bring down the deficit by the hard votes, not by tinkering with our Constitution. Let us not slap this bumper sticker on the greatest Constitution ever written. It is beneath the Senate. It is beneath the House of Representatives. But, more importantly, it does great disservice to the finest Constitution democracy has ever had.  Madam President, am I correct that the time of the Democratic leader has expired?
