 President, I thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, for her excellent statement and for all of her support and her help on this very important piece of legislation.  I know that Senator Wellstone also wants to speak on behalf of our amendment today, and I believe he is on his way to the floor. While we are waiting for him, let me read a paragraph or two from a press release put out by the Children's Defense Fund today, who, as I spoke about before, know firsthand what happens to children in violent situations. I quote:       Mothers who have been threatened or battered need a safe      place for themselves and their children and they need support      to reenter the work force. Passage of the family violence      amendment makes it possible for States to offer that      protection and to help mothers with children.       There are studies by the Better Homes Fund and the      University of Massachusetts Medical Center and by the Taylor      Institute in Chicago that have documented the prevalence of      domestic violence in the lives of women and children      receiving public assistance. It is important that we pass      this amendment today so that we can make sure these women and      these children are taken care of in this country and live in      safe environments.  Mr. President, I am going to yield time now to Senator Wellstone, who has been instrumental in this battle. I thank him for all of his work on behalf of the many women and children across this country who will be able to feel much safer when we finally get this passed and put into the law.
