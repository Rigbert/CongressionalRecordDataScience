Rogers didn't quote this, he was talking about sequester--is ill-conceived and wrong. I therefore, Madam Speaker, urge my colleagues to vote against this short-term CR and to vote for the Senate bill that will be sent to us in just a short period of time, today, which passed the United States Senate with over a two-thirds vote. Democrats only have 46 Members, so almost a majority of the Republicans are voting for it as well.  Madam Speaker, that is the responsible thing to do. That is the right thing to do. That is the regular order to do. Let's do it. Let's put aside our partisan differences and our partisan strategies and vote as Americans to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the balance of the year.
