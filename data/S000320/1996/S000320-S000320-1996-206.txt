 President, this amendment before the Senate provides funding to the Postal Service for liabilities incurred by the former Post Office Department. The funds are paid to the Department of Labor for workmen's compensation claims.  Mr. President, this provision was inadvertently left out of the bill. It is a mandatory payment and does not have an impact on the discretionary funding in the bill.  This amendment, I understand, has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.
