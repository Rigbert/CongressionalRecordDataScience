 I want to tell the gentleman, although I announced only the American Jobs Bill Closing Tax Loopholes and Preventing Outsourcing Act, my expectation is we will also deal with the COMPETES Act next week as well. That bill, we believe, is a very important bill. We think it's very important for jobs. We think it's very important for investing in our future, and we intend to bring that bill to the floor as well next week.
