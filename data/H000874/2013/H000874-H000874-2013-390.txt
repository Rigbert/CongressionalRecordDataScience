Speaker, I rise to thank Mr. Gerald E. Bennett for over 43 years of outstanding service to the United States House of Representatives.  Jerry is retiring this week as Chief Logistics Officer of Logistics and Support, with more than four decades of House experience. He first started working for the House of Representatives in 1969 as part of a summer employment program under the Office of the Doorkeeper. From folding Member mailings to distributing paychecks, he provided a number of important services. Over the years, he moved up the ranks, holding positions as a Maintenance Supervisor, Assistant Deputy Director, Manager, and Director of Logistics. He then served as Assistant Chief Administrative Officer and Assets, Furnishings, and Logistics Deputy Chief Administrative Officer, before becoming the Chief Logistics Officer of Logistics and Support.  Throughout his career, Jerry's thoughtfulness and positive attitude has earned him the respect and confidence of countless employees. It is not unusual to see Jerry lending a listening ear or providing sound guidance to an employee. His caring and encouraging nature is valued by this institution and its employees.  Jerry has often said that he always felt a powerful sense of purpose and a role in something deeply important. His commitment topublic service extends into his community, where he serves as a deacon in his church, uses his vacation to chaperone youth trips, and donates his time to coaching soccer. His devotion to faith and family is recognizable to all who have had the privilege to know Jerry and work beside him. He attributes much of his success to his wife, Karen, his children, and his eight grandchildren, who have always been fully supportive of his career. Jerry once claimed: ``I don't come to work to work. I love what I do.''  On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I congratulate Jerry on his retirement and thank him for his dedication and outstanding contributions to the institution. I wish him the best in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________
