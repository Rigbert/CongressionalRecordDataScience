Chairman, this bill does not trim, it literally guts Occupational Safety and Health by one-third and will adversely impact millions of workers across this country. This very morning an individual was killed in my district in an oil refinery. He was using high pressure hydroblasting equipment to clean refinery equipment, was hit by water sprayed at a pressure of in excess of 10,000 pounds per square inch, and was killed. This accident could have been prevented.  Mr. Chairman, 55,000 workers die in our country and another 60,000 are permanently disabled each year in work-related deaths and injuries. Just in my region in the last 6 months there have been 11 work-related fatalities, a record number, two electrocutions, a fall from an elevated platform where no fall protection was used, an individual crushed by a forklift, a woman who was working on structural steel and was killed by a piece of that steel, a worker overcome by fumes while filling a rail car with CO2. Let us stand up for people who work. Let us value life. Vote ``no'' on this bill.
