President, I just want to comment very briefly on the comments of the Republican leader.  It was interesting when he said the courtesies that were extended to President Clinton and President Obama when it came to Supreme Court nominees; he left out 1 year--last year.  Last year, when there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Antonin Scalia passed away and President Obama sent the nomination of Merrick Garland to the floor of the Senate, it was refused by the Republican leader to even give him a hearing, let alone a vote. So there was an omission in his call for courtesy when it comes to Nominee Gorsuch, a very grievous omission from the point of American history.  For the first time in the history of the U.S. Senate--for the first time--Republican leaders in the Senate refused to give a hearing and a vote to a Supreme Court nominee sent by President Obama. Many of us came to this floor pleading that we follow tradition and the Constitution. I am going to stand by that. Even though I think Merrick Garland was treated poorly by the Republican majority, I believe that Neil Gorsuch is entitled to a hearing and a vote. I made that argument before; I will make it again.                       Republican Healthcare Bill  Mr. President, the second point I want to make, and very briefly, is that we now have seen the Affordable Care Act repeal that has been brought forward by the Republicans in the House. We still do not know its fiscal impact.
