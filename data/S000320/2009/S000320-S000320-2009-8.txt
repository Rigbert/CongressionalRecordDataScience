 President, I wish to honor the International Fertilizer Development Center, IFDC, as it celebrates the 35th anniversary of its founding today, October 8.  In the wake of the worldwide food and energy shortages of the 1970s, the IFDC was established in Muscle Shoals, AL, to be a national center of excellence with expertise in fertilizers to service the needs of developing countries. Since its inception, the IFDC has worked to address issues such as international food security, the alleviation of global hunger and poverty, environmental protection, and the promotion of economic development and self-sufficiency.  Today, with staff members working in 30 nations throughout Africa, the Near and Far East, and Latin America, the IFDC is critical to ensuring underdeveloped countries have more efficient fertilizer and, therefore, food for their people. The IFDC has helped increase sustainable food production in more than 130 nations and has also contributed to the development of institutional capacity-building through training.  I sincerely congratulate the IFDC on its anniversary and wish it continued success in Muscle Shoals and abroad.                          ____________________
