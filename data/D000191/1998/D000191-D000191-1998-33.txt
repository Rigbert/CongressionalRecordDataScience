Chairman, as we know, the Senate adopted an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill which is identical to the amendment the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Dunn) and I had planned to offer.  We intended to introduce that amendment as a stand-alone bill before we adjourn this week. However, in light of the recent outbreak of school shootings this year, I ask for the chairman's support as we work to make this bill law, and create new ways to prevent youth violence in our schools and give our communities the tools they need in that effort.
