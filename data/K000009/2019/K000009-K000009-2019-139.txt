Chair, I rise today in support of the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act.  Our federal public servants dedicate their lives to serving their fellow Americans.  Today, let's thank them for their dedicated service to our country by providing them and their families an overdue pay raise that they have earned.  The Trump shutdown exposed the all-too-real economic reality for many Americans. Millions live paycheck-to-paycheck, including many of our public servants. They did not choose a life of public service to make it rich, but rather to serve and improve the lives of their fellow citizens.  The shutdown also crystalized the daily impact federal workers have on all our lives. 85 percent of all federal workers live outside of Washington, and their paychecks drive the economies of communities across the U.S.  This increase of 2.6 percent will help federal workers, 1 in 8 of whom make less than $40,000 a year, make ends meet while stimulating local small businesses across the nation when federal employees spend their earnings.  Mr. Chair, it is unacceptable that their pay has not reflected the increased demands of cost of living for years. It's time we give our hardworking federal employees the pay raise they deserve and earn every day.  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. The amendment printed in part A of House Report 116-5 shall be considered as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.
