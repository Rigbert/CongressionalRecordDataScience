 President, I want to take this opportunity to recognize and express appreciation for the contributions to public service made by Ann Jorgensen, who is finishing her term as board member to the Farm Credit Administration.  A production agriculture and hog farmer from my home State of Iowa, Ms. Jorgensen moved to Washington in 1997 to serve on the Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed, three-member board of the Farm Credit Administration, FCA. FCA is an independent U.S. Government agency responsible for regulating and examining the entities of the Farm Credit System. The Farm Credit System is a nationwide financial cooperative that lends to agriculture and rural America.  Members of the FCA board also serve as Directors for the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, FCSIC, to which Ms. Jorgensen was elected as the first woman chair in January 2000. FCSIC is an independent U.S. Government corporation responsible for ensuring the timely payment of principal and interest on insured notes, bonds, debentures, and other obligations issued on behalf of Farm Credit System banks. Ms. Jorgensen's leadership was instrumental in keeping the insurance fund at or near the statutory 2 percent capitalization level.  During Ms. Jorgensen's 5-year tenure at the Farm Credit Administration, many changes took place in the Farm Credit System influenced by the FCA board. Through the board approval of restructuring applications, the number of Farm Credit System associations consolidated from 250 to 103, thus creating greater efficiencies, better customer service, and cost savings to associations. The board also amended participation regulations allowing for the purchase of a 100-percent interest in participations and eliminating the territorial consent requirement. With these and other changes, the Farm Credit System today is well capitalized and profitable with a high asset quality.  Prior to her appointment to the FCA board, she served on a number of governing boards for the State of Iowa, including 6 years as a member of the Board of Regents. The Board of Regents is responsible for the State's three universities, including the University of Iowa Hospital, a world-renowned teaching hospital, and its affiliated clinics. She also served on the board of the Iowa Department of Economic Development and chaired the Iowa Rural Development Council. Among many other boards and committees, she has also served on the Agriculture Product Advisory Board, the Interstate Agricultural Grain Marketing Commission, the National Pork Producers Council Environmental Committee, the European Trade Task Force Legislative Study Committee; the Iowa Public Broadcasting Network Board of Directors and Foundation Board.  She was named to the Farm Foundation's Bennett Agricultural Round Table in June 2000. This provides a forum for discussion and dialogue among agricultural, agribusiness, government, academic, and interest group leaders on issues of importance to agriculture and rural America. Alpha Zeta, the national honorary agricultural fraternity, named her to its Centennial Honor Roll in 1997. She has also been inducted into the Iowa Volunteer Hall of Fame, and along with her husband, has previously been recognized by Farm Futures magazine as owner of one of the Top 10 Best Managed Farms.  I thank her for her numerous contributions to our farmers as well as rural America, and I extend my very best wishes for her continued success.                          ____________________
