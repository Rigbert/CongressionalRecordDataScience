 President, I thank Senator Feinstein for her cosponsorship and working with me and the chairman on including this amendment that would provide 655,000 jobs.  I heard the Senator from Iowa earlier talking about providing or increasing Government jobs. I would let our colleagues know that this amendment before us is about private construction jobs.  In fact, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from AGC of America, Associated General Contractors, as well as a letter from FasterBetterSafer, Americans for Transportation Mobility, which represents the American Public Transportation Association, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, the Associated Equipment Distributors, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, the Associated General Contractors, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Laborers International Union ofNorth America, the National Asphalt Pavement Association, the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel Association, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in support of this amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            The Associated General                                       Contractors of America,                                  Arlington, VA, February 2, 2009.     Re: Support Murray/Feinstein Amendment.     Hon. Harry Reid,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid: The Associated General Contractors of      America urges you to support the Murray/Feinstein amendment      to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The      amendment will provide additional funding to critical surface      transportation and water infrastructure projects across the      country.       Construction employment has tumbled by 899,000, or 11.6      percent, since peaking in September, 2006. Unfortunately      because of dwindling public and private funding more than a      million more good workers could face layoffs in 2009 without      significant construction stimulus.       Providing a significant investment in funding for      construction projects would help address our nation's      infrastructure investment gap and create good jobs in      communities across America. AGC estimates that, an additional      $1 billion of investment in nonresidential construction      supports or creates 28,500 jobs. More than half of the gain      would impact non construction elements of our economy, as      workers and owners in the construction and supplier      industries spend their added income on a wide range of goods      and services.       We estimate that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act      would create or support more than 1.85 million new jobs      between now and the end of 2010, including over 620,000      construction jobs, 300,000 jobs in supplying industries and      930,000 jobs throughout the broader economy.       The construction industry stands ready to participate in      the economic recovery spawned by the American Recovery and      Reinvestment Act of 2009. Thousands of AGC members across the      country have expressed their personal commitment to putting      this funding to use quickly. Please support the Murray/     Feinstein amendment.           Sincerely,                                             Jeffrey D. Shoaf,                                        Senior Executive Director,     Government and Public Affairs.                                  ____                                               Washington, DC,                                                 February 2, 2009.       To the Members of the U.S. Senate: The Americans for      Transportation Mobility (ATM) Coalition strongly supports the      inclusion of funding for highways and public transportation      in S. 336, the ``American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of      2009,'' and urges the Senate to increase funding levels for      highways and public transportation to at least the levels      provided in H.R. 1, the House-passed version of this      legislation.       Preserving and creating jobs through highway and public      transportation infrastructure investment is a key element of      this economic recovery package. The investments in near-term      transportation projects supported by this legislation would      protect and create jobs to support broad recovery and address      particularly hard hit sectors like construction.      Transportation spending also results in long-term economic      benefits: transportation infrastructure plays a critical role      supporting the nation's economy by facilitating safe,      efficient, and reliable movement of people and goods.       The recovery package is an important step toward renewing      highway and transit infrastructure, but it is only a      beginning. The ATM Coalition looks forward to working with      the Senate in the coming months on reauthorization of the      Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity      Act--A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which must build on the      investment in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by      providing the policy and programmatic reforms as well as      long-term funding needed for highways and public      transportation.       ATM urges you to increase funding for highways and public      transportation investments in S. 336 to at least the House-     passed levels.           Sincerely,                            Americans for Transportation Mobility.       ATM Management Committee Members: American Public      Transportation Association, American Road and Transportation      Builders Association, Associated Equipment Distributors,      Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Associated General      Contractors, American Society of Civil Engineers,      International Union of Operating Engineers, Laborers      International Union of North America, National Asphalt      Pavement Association, National Stone, Sand, and Gravel      Association, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of      America, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
