 Let me posit a possibility here. Thursday at 3 o'clock we clearly, I don't believe, aren't going to finish the business that we need to finish before we leave. Therefore, my presumption is we will be back in the following week. Therefore, Friday would not be the last day and therefore we could do whatever we have to do on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and we should plan on a five-day week at least for the following week.  Is that correct?
