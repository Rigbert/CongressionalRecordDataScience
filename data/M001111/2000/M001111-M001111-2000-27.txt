Res. 345       Whereas every day in the United States, 12 children under      the age of 19 are killed with guns;       Whereas 31 percent of children aged 12 to 17 know someone      in that age bracket who carries a gun;       Whereas during the 1996-1997 school year, 5,724 students      were expelled for bringing guns or explosives to school;       Whereas the homicide rate for children under 15 years of      age is 16 times higher in the United States than in 25 other      industrialized nations;       Whereas over the past year, at least 50 people have been      killed or injured in school shootings in the United States;       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important      resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in      enabling children to grow in an environment free from fear      and violence;       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for      their own decisions and actions, and by positively      influencing the decisions and actions of others, help chart a      new and less violent direction for the entire Nation;       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation      will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide      observance involving millions of their fellow students, and      will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant      agents in a wave of positive social change; and       Whereas the observance of October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of      National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence'' will      allow students to make a positive and earnest decision about      their future in that such students will have the opportunity      to voluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun      Violence'', and promise that they will never take a gun to      school, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will      actively use their influence in a positive manner to prevent      friends from using guns to settle disputes: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of National      Concern About Young People and Gun Violence''; and       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation      calling on the school children of the United States to      observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
