 President, I want to say to my good friend from Utah--I think Members of the Senate already know this--no one, no one in the Senate, has more articulately and persuasively defended the right of American citizens to participate in the political process, which is a constitutional right in this country; no one has more articulately been involved and persuasively been involved in an effort to stop misguided efforts to put the Government in charge of the political speech of individuals and groups, candidates, and parties than has the Senator from Utah.  But what he has done today is provide for the Senate and for the public a clear summary of the illegal activities of the current administration. The Senator from Utah has reminded everyone that it is against the law now for foreigners to contribute to American elections, for money laundering to be engaged in, and for money to be raised on Federal property.  So the Senator from Utah has done far and away the best summary of the activities of this administration going back to 1992 which either crossed the line or skirted the edge and has been lost in the sort of numbers of different occurrences.  So what the Senator from Utah has done is cut through all of this, summarize it, and give the Senate and the American public a clear indication of the sleaze factor that has ranked so high in this administration from the beginning to the end.  So I thank the Senator from Utah. I think it is the most important speech that I have heard in the Senate in many, many years. He has made an important contribution in this area, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here on the Senate floor and to have an opportunity to hear this important speech.  I yield the floor.
