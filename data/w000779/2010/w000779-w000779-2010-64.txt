4183 that would once and for all eliminate secret holds here in the Senate.  Senator Grassley and I, as part of a large, bipartisan group, have come to the floor of the Senate again and again simply seeking to abolish secrecy, not holds, in the way business is done in the Senate. These secret holds are an indefensible violation of the public's right to know.  I ask the leader at this time if he would be willing to modify his request to include this bipartisan amendment No. 4183 to finally eliminate secret holds in the Senate?
