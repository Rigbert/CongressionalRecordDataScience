Speaker, a few weeks ago, the Huntingtown community in my district experienced a tragic and untimely loss, a loss to the U.S. Postal Service, a loss to the 5th District of Maryland, a loss to a community, and a loss to many close family and friends. I wish to take a moment today to pay tribute to the memory of Michael Dean, Postmaster of the Huntingtown Post Office in Huntingtown, MD.  Mike Dean tragically died following a motorcycle accident on January 9, 2003. He was a highly respected Postmaster who had been recognized on numerous occasions for his outstanding work with the Postal Service. On many occasions, he was given the opportunity to advance his career by accepting a well-deserved promotion. He always refused, preferring to stay and serve the community of his beloved ``Downtown Huntingtown.''  His accomplishments within the Postal Service, within his community, and within his church are so numerous that it is impossible to list them all. For the Postal Service, Mike will be remembered as a loyal and trusted co-worker. He was a teacher and mentor to newly appointed Postmasters. He was a person his manager or a fellow Postmaster could call upon when help was needed anywhere, at any time. He was active for many years in the National Association of Postmasters of the United States. To his employees at the Huntingtown Post Office, he was much more than just ``the boss.'' He was a friend, advisor, teacher, and a leader by example.  Mike was appointed Postmaster of Huntingtown 24 years ago, and he grew along with the town. Until his death, the bond between Mike Dean and his community seemed unbreakable. He served people in every way imaginable with grace, humor, and always with a sense of selflessness. Mike served on theboard of directors of the United Way of Calvert County, and was a long-time volunteer with the Meals on Wheels program. He was active with local schools, serving on the PTA and establishing a ``Wee Deliver'' program to promote reading and writing skills. When a neighbor was ill, Mike was there to cut his grass. When a local farmer needed help, Mike was there to help strip tobacco.  As a member of St. John Vianney Catholic Church in Prince Frederick, he served enthusiastically as president of the Men's Club, raising funds for the parish for numerous projects. When the parish grew so large that it became necessary to create a new parish, he took a leadership role in the formation and development of Jesus the Divine Word Catholic Church. He leaves behind family, many friends, neighbors, and coworkers who mourn his loss deeply.  Michael Dean's own life was not without sorrow and loss, but he had the ability to work his way through the pain and difficulty, and to emerge from difficult times still strong in his faith, and ready to serve his fellow man. In this way, I would like to take a moment to honor the memory of a colleague, a dear friend, and beloved family member to so many.                          ____________________
