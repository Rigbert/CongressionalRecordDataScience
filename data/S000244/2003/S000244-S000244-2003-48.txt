Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Scott amendment.  Mr. Chairman, in order to put this amendment in context, it is important that we have a history lesson. When the Federal Prison Industries law was created in 1934, there was a compromise that was struck by President Roosevelt between the advocates and business and labor who objected to Federal Prison Industries that the results of inmate labor, whether it was Federal, State or local, would be prohibited from interstate commerce which meant the commercial market. This statutory prohibition is now codified in 18 United States Code 1761(a). Fifty-five years went by, and the statute was always interpreted to prohibit the commercial sale of the results of inmate labor products as well as services, even though the statute that was passed in 1934 did not explicitly mention services.  In 1998, Federal Prison Industries got a legal interpretation that did not come from the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel as most opinions come from, but in a legal memorandum from a special counsel in the Office of Enforcement Operations in the criminal division of the Department of Justice which supervises both FPI and the Bureau of Prisons. The new interpretation provided that FPI and the prison industries of the States and their local governments could sell inmate-furnished services, either directly or in partnership with the private sector, without restrictions; and those restrictions included restrictions against the displacement of noninmate workers or the payment of wages comparable to wages being paid outside the prison to noninmate workers of private firms that provide the same type of services.  With this new interpretation that came about as a result of a Department of Justice learned legal opinion in 1998, subminimum-wage prison inmates could compete directly in the services market, but not in the goods market, against people on the outside who have to receive minimum wage and also have to pay taxes on their wages.  The business community raised very strong objections in 1998 to this legal interpretation, and the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation of the Committee on Education and the Workforce held a hearing on this issue on September 20, 2000. What section 7 does is to make it explicit that the prohibitions that have been in the law since 1934 against goods entering the commercial market also covers services.  This, I guess, brings the law up-to-date as our economy has gradually evolved from a manufacturing and goods-oriented economy to a service-oriented economy.  The amendment of the gentleman from Virginia strikes section 7, and if his amendment is adopted, that means that Federal Prison Industries, as well as State and local prison industries organizations, can directly compete in the commercial market in the services sector of the economy.  When the compromise was struck during the Roosevelt administration, that door was supposedly slammed shut. This will make sure that the door is slammed shut so that the playing field is equal and FPI and State and local inmates cannot compete in the services market for subminimum wage. I hope that the amendment is defeated.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).  The amendment was rejected.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Are there further amendments to section 7?  If not, the Clerk will designate section 8.  The text of section 8 is as follows:     SEC. 8. CONFORMING AMENDMENT.
