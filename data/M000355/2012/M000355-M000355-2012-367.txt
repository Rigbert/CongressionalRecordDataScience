 President, today I wish to recognize a distinguished Kentuckian who has worked tirelessly and selflessly in public service for over 25 years. I am sad to report to my colleagues today that Mr. Ken Harvey, the longest serving tourism director for any county in the Commonwealth, is retiring today.  Ken has worked since 1986 as the executive director of the London-Laurel County Tourist Commission in southeastern Kentucky. During his tenure, tourism growth in the area has tripled, the number of motels in the area has more than doubled, and the number of restaurants has doubled. Ken's coworkers, friends, and neighbors know that such a feat would not have been possible without Ken's endless energy and enthusiasm in his work.  When Ken moved to London, KY, with his wife Cheryl many years ago, he was working for Kmart and was sent to Kentucky for a temporary assignment. But, in Ken's own words, London ``just felt like home.'' It is to the rest of the town and county's benefit that Ken and Cheryl decided to put down roots and make London their home.  In addition to his long tenure as executive director of the London-Laurel County Tourist Commission, Ken keeps busy with many other pursuits. He is a longtime board member of the Southern/Eastern Kentucky Tourism Development Association and has served as that organization's president. He has been a board member of the Kentucky Tourism Council Federation and served that group for several terms as chairman or vice chairman. He has served with the Kentucky Festival Association and the Kentucky Main Street Board. Ken is also an avid historian who has volunteered for the Kentucky Civil War Trail and helped coordinate Civil War reenactments.  Ken is also a member of the Optimist Club, the Laurel County Rotary Club, and a Leadership Tri-County graduate. He was named Laurel County Man of the Year by the News Leader in 1990. And I would certainly be remiss if I did not mention what many believe to be Ken's greatest achievement as tourism director--for many years he has been the driving force behind the World Chicken Festival.  The World Chicken Festival brings over 200,000 visitors to Kentucky each year for what has become one of the top 10 festivals in the Southeastern United States. It offers entertainment, talent shows, art exhibits, carnival rides, and of course food--particularly chicken. It has been noted for exhibiting the world's largest stainless steel skillet. Lasting 4 days, taking up 10 square blocks, and free to visitors, I am sure my colleagues will understand when I say that under Ken's leadership, the World Chicken Festival is one of Kentucky's most ``egg-citing'' events.  Ken's retirement will be Kentucky's loss but certainly his family's gain. I understand he is looking forward to spending more time with his 6-year-old grandson. On behalf of the people of London, Laurel County, and all of Kentucky, I want to thank Mr. Ken Harvey for his many years of service. He will be missed, and I certainly wish him all the best in his well-earned retirement.  Mr. President, a recent article printed in the Laurel County area publication the Sentinel Echo highlighted Mr. Ken Harvey's many achievements. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel Echo, Nov. 28, 2011]                            Harvey To Retire               Longest-Serving Tourism Director in State                           (By Nita Johnson)       Laurel County, KY.--What began as a year's assignment in      1982 evolved into the longest-running term of a tourism      commissioner in the state.       Ken Harvey, executive director of the London-Laurel Tourist      Commission, announced his plans to retire on Feb. 1, after      serving in that capacity for 26 years.       He has seen much growth during his tenure with the tourist      commission, with his latest focus on developing the Heritage      Hills property off Falls Street.       But the evolution of the World Chicken Festival, the Redbud      Ride, various athletic events and a motel tax are just a few      of the accomplishments that have brought revenue to the      tourism commission during Harvey's term--accomplishments he      credits to the board members with whom he has served.       Board members returned the compliment, with Tourism      Commission Board President Caner Cornett describing Harvey as      ``one of a kind.''       ``He's a self-propelled man. Ken only knows one speed--full      force,'' Cornett said. ``He's the kind who can talk to      someone on jail work release or the governor and show no      partiality. He has that kind of personality.''       Cornett said Harvey's exit as tourism director leaves      ``some big shoes to fill.''       ``He'll be hard to replace. His knowledge and experience is      invaluable,'' he added.       Though coming to London from Ohio, Harvey said just a few      months after settling here, he and wife Cheryl knew they      wanted to stay in the area.       ``It just felt like home,'' he said. ``When we came here,      there were 650 motel rooms. Now there are 1,300,'' he said.      ``Interstate 75 is an attraction in itself for travelers      going north or south. We have a good cross-section of dining      here and our board is made up of citizens whose home is      here.''       Other attractions that have increased the tourism business      are the annual Battle of Camp Wildcat, which Harvey considers      ``the best in the state,'' along with the location of the      Harley-Davidson dealership.       Harvey has been honored several times for his diligence in      promoting tourism in the London area and is proud that the      London commission is highly respected across the state. While      he readily admits he does not wish to retire, he realizes      that his ongoing health problems and three recent back      surgeries are limiting his ability to serve in the capacity      that he wishes to continue.       ``It's time. I hope they bring in someone with fresh ideas      that can continue to develop the Heritage Hills property and      give some new ideas for other developments,'' Harvey said.      ``Besides, I have a grandson who is six years old and I'm      looking forward to spending lots and lots of years with      him.''                          ____________________
