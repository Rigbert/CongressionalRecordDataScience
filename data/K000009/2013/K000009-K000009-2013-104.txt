Chairman, I rise in opposition to the very distinguished Member's amendment--Dr. Burgess--and simply say that his amendment would prohibit the Department of Energy from promulgating light bulb efficiency standards.  It is a common misunderstanding that there is some type of ban on the incandescent light bulb that effectively requires people to have the limited choice of only a compact fluorescent bulb. This is simply not true. Regulations require only that bulbs be more efficient.  So this debate really isn't about choice--or energy efficiency for that matter. It's about endangering American jobs, specifically American manufacturing jobs. Given that American manufacturers have committed to following the law regardless of whether or not it is enforced, the only benefit of this ill-informed rider is to allow foreign manufacturers who may not feel a similar obligation to import noncompliant light bulbs that will not only harm the investments made by U.S. companies, but place at risk the U.S. manufacturing jobs associated with making compliant bulbs.  Further, it is the equivalent of a $100 tax on every American family--that's $16 billion across our Nation--through increased energy costs.  The performance standards for light bulbs were established in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. At that time, the bill enjoyed strongbipartisan support of both Republicans and Democrats. Ninety-five House Republicans voted for final passage, and the bill was signed into law by President Bush.  As far as I'm aware, the issues that inspired this standard have not changed and, I would argue, have gotten worse. Families are struggling every day to meet rising energy bills, and there are real savings to be had by moving to more efficient light bulbs.  Further, while claiming that the incandescent bulb is dead makes for a great sound bite, it just doesn't reflect reality. As a result of the 2007 law, manufacturers already are making a variety of new energy-saving bulbs for homes, including more efficient incandescent bulbs. These bulbs look like and turn on like the bulbs we have been using for decades, but are upwards of 28 to 33 percent more efficient. And that's good for everyone. This is amazing progress in a very short time, considering that previously the basic technology of incandescent bulbs had not changed substantially since they were first introduced over 125 years ago.  Philips, GE, and Sylvania are among those currently manufacturing efficient incandescent bulbs. One is making them entirely within the United States, and the others are manufacturing the key components in their U.S. factories.  So I would urge my colleagues to please see the light and oppose this amendment. And my dear colleague, Dr. Burgess, knows that, despite the fact that we disagree on this issue, I have the highest respect for his service in this Congress to the people of Texas.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).  The amendment was agreed to.                  amendment no. 29 offered by ms. bass
