President, it is also my understanding that at least 27 States have statutes that criminalize the killing of a fetus or an ``unbornchild.'' Am I correct in understanding that there is no legal precedent where a court has held that any of these State statues in any way undermine abortion rights of a woman, as expressed by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, and subsequent decisions?
