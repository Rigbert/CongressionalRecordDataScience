 President, this Republican-led Congress is committed to fulfilling our promises to the American people. That work continues now as we consider legislation to push back against the harmful regulations from the Obama administration. On its way out the door, the Obama administration forced nearly 40--40--major and very costly regulations on the American people. Fortunately, we now have the opportunity to work with a new President to begin bringing relief from those burdensome regulations.  Last night, the House sent us two resolutions under the Congressional Review Act--one of the best tools at our disposal to undo these heavyhanded regulations.  This afternoon, the Senate will have the opportunity to pass the first of these resolutions, a measure to overturn the stream buffer rule.
