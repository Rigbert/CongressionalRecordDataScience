Speaker, some of the most pressing legislative items were nowhere to be found on the floor this week. We had an opportunity to make headway on critical legislation. Unfortunately, the leadership provided no action, not solutions, not action, only obstruction and delay.  First, student loan interest rates will double on July 1 if we do nothing, and we have done nothing.  Secondly, after losing 28,000 construction jobs last month, Congress still has not passed a highway bill, notwithstanding the fact that the Senate passed a bill with 75 percent of its Members in support, half of the Republican Conference in support, but it's nowhere on this floor as construction jobs languish and people look for work.  Speaker Boehner is now saying we might have to wait until November, even though it would create thousands of construction jobs. It seems to be ``my way or no highway.''  Third, we're headed for a fiscal cliff if Congress can't achieve a serious deficit reduction this year, and we've seen appropriations bills this week that break the budget agreement.  This has been another wasted week by a do-nothing Congress, and we're about to begin a weeklong recess once again. Congress could do better. Congress must do better. Americans expect Congress to do better. It ought to take action now, not delay until it's too late.                          ____________________
