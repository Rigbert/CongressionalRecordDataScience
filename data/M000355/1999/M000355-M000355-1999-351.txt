 President, I rise today to commend Wayne Perkey for 30 years of dedicated service to WHAS-AM radio and his listeners in Louisville, Kentucky.  Wayne's voice has been heard by thousands of listeners over the past 30 years as a constant in the life of morning talk radio. He has made an unforgettable impression on WHAS radio, and has carefully molded the station into what it is today. When Wayne began work at WHAS the station had primarily an all-music format, and Wayne spent years transforming the station from that format into the all-talk format that they have today.  Most stations would not have been able to accomplish that kind of transition without losing a number of listeners, but Wayne's voice on the morning airwaves clenched listener support and WHAS has enjoyed long-lived success. Wayne's positive, up-beat morning program made Wayne an icon in the Louisville market. Certainly he is a mainstay that will be missed.  He presented up-to-the-minute news to hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians for the past 30 years and used his position at WHAS to serve the community. Wayne says that one of the things that drew him to work at WHAS in the first place was the stations' Crusade for Children program. He immediately took an interest in the Crusade, and played an integral role as master of ceremonies for many of his 30 years.  The Crusade is known as the most successful single-station telethon in the United States, raising $70 million for the care and treatment of handicapped children in Kentucky and Southern Indiana since its inception in 1954. Wayne saw how vital this program was to the millions of children who benefit from the Crusade each year, and has committed to emcee the telethon for one last year. His sincere concern for Kentucky's children is admirable, and we commend him for his 30 years of commitment to this cause.  Wayne's leadership on the WHAS morning team produced numerous recognitions for its award-winning broadcasts over the years. Wayne was individually honored by receiving the very first Spirit of Louisville Award at the Mayor's Community Thanksgiving Breakfast in 1994. His professional talent will be remembered and revered, and will certainly follow him through life in whatever endeavors he pursues.  I am confident Wayne Perkey will continue to succeed both professionally and personally and, on behalf of my colleagues, I thank him for his service and commend him on his accomplishments.                          ____________________
