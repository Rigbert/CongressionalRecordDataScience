 It says Congress shall make no law--no law--abridging freedom of speech or of the press. I refer to freedom of the press because it is the robust exercise of that freedom which has brought us today to assault the freedom of speech. Over the past 5 years, the New York Times and the Washington Post have joined forces to publish an editorial an average of every 5\1/2\ days on campaign finance reform.  To buy that editorial space in the New York Times or the Washington Post, it would cost $36,000 and $8,000, respectively, for each editorial. Multiply that amount by the number of editorials of each paper, and it equals a total value of $8 million in unregulated soft money advertising that frequently mentions Federal candidates. Of course, that type of corporate, big media, soft money expenditure will not be regulated in this new law.  Why is the press, the institution that has unlimited free speech, so interested in restricting the speech of everyone else? Let's take a closer look. The unconstitutional issue ad restrictions in this bill purport to limit advertising within proximity to an election. However, it does not, interestingly enough, apply to newspaper ads. So the already powerful corporations that control the news--and, in many instances, the public policy--in America will get more power and more money under this new law. One has to wonder why that blatant conflict of interest has not been more thoroughly discussed in a debate about the appearance of such conflicts.  Outside groups such as Common Cause have devoted many years and millions of dollars to lobbying thisissue in the House and in the Senate. Why not? Their fundraising will explode if this bill passes. They no longer have to compete with party committees for soft dollars. Shays-Meehan permits every Member of the House and the Senate to raise soft money for these outside groups.  The bill we are about to pass allows Members of the House and Senate to raise soft money for these outside groups. I am told this unlimited, undisclosed, unregulated soft dollar fundraising has, in fact, already begun.  Although the facts about the provisions of this bill are almost always misrepresented, the driving mantra behind the entire movement is that we are all corrupt or that we appear to be corrupt.  We have explored corruption and the appearance of corporation before in this Chamber. You cannot have corruption unless someone is corrupt. At no time has any Member of either body offered evidence of even the slightest hint of corruption by any Member of either body. As for the appearance of corruption, our friends in the media who are part and parcel of the reform industry continue to make broad and baseless accusations.  It has been reported that the reform industry spent $73 million from 1997 to 1999 on this issue. Of course, that was all soft money. These are all soft dollar expenditures used to fuel negative perceptions of Federal officeholders and candidates. Scandal, or perceived scandal, sells papers and gets viewers. In the nonstop competition to be the next Woodward and Bernstein, the reform industry relentlessly works to raise questions in our minds.  In short, I believe the appearance of corruption is whatever the New York Times says it is. Add to that, cash-strapped, scandal-hungry newspapers and unlimited foundation donations to the reform industry, and you are in full-scale corruption mode. The actual facts are rarely relevant.  I request that these two articles documenting the hypocritical actions of the reform industry be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the National Review, Feb. 12, 2000]                       The Campaign-Finance Smear                            (By Rich Lowry)       No one has done more to create an ``appearance'' of      corruption in politics than campaign-finance reformers.       A typical complaint of campaign-finance reformers is that      politics is too negative and dishonest.       One might expect therefore that advocates of reform would      feel some obligation not to be so negative in the way they      depict politicians, or at the very least to be truthful when      they do decide to ``go negative'' against political      opponents.       Alas, no one has done more to create an ``appearance'' of      corruption in politics than campaign-finance reformers who      ignore or distort facts to make reckless charges of      corruption.       Consider The American Prospect, which has a heavy-breathing      editorial in its most recent issue decrying how corporations      have supposedly stolen away our democracy.       ``By buying politicians,'' The American Prospect writes of      Enron, ``a favored corporation promoting a new kind of scam      simply purchased immunity from regulatory oversight.''       Note that there is no ``seems,'' or ``appears,'' in this      sentence. It is an outright assertion of bribery, in the      cause of promoting corporate fraud.       Given the gravity of this charge, it would be nice if there      were some evidence for it.       What the Prospect offers is Wendy Gramm, who ``as chief      commodities regulator under Bush I, slipped in a midnight      rule-change after the 1992 election to exempt Enron's trades      from oversight.''       ``She was rewarded,'' according to the Prospect, ``with a      seat on the Enron board and hundreds of thousands of dollars      in income.''       Sounds pretty sinister. Except the Prospect conveniently      neglects to spell out what exactly was involved in this      ``Enron exemption.''       Actually, it wasn't an Enron-specific matter but a ruling      that affected a whole new class of trades--nine other      companies lobbied for it--that was coming to the fore in the      early 1990s.       Here's USA Today (apparently a more nuanced and      sophisticated source than the Prospect) on the rule:      ``Despite the appearance of a trade-off, even Gramm's critics      concede that the commission's ruling was a smart move. The      energy derivatives market was growing rapidly, and there were      worries that without an exemption, the Chicago Board of Trade      might sue anyone selling an energy derivative outside of its      centralized market.''       I frankly don't know enough about derivatives to say with      any assurance whether the Gramm ruling was a mistake or not,      but it's obviously a subject of dispute. So, before      condemning Wendy Gramm for her venal motives, it would be      nice to hear some arguments about why she was wrong.       The Prospect offers none.       Maybe the Prospect thinks that the Chicago Board of Trade,      which opposed this move, was right. But wouldn't Gramm then      have simply been doing the bidding of another moneybags      interest out to protect its business, the Chicago Board of      Trade?       This is why the campaign-finance reformers, on their own      terms, can always win the argument--there are well-heeled      interests on all sides of most disputes in Washington, so      someone can always be portrayed as selling out to some      interest or other.       But the Prospect's treatment of Wendy Gramm is almost      responsible compared to the way it smears her husband: ``When      Enron needed another favor in 2000, her husband, Sen. Phil      Gramm of Texas, got yet another regulation waived.''       As far as I can tell, this is a regurgitated charge that      Ramesh Ponnuru has already dissected on NRO: ``Public Citizen      had Gramm `muscling through' the offending provision. In      fact, Gramm had almost nothing to do with it.       ``He didn't write it: It came to the Senate from the House,      where it was part of a bill that passed by a large margin. He      didn't usher it through the Senate: It was considered by the      Agriculture Committee, of which he was not a member, rather      than the Banking Committee, which he chaired. Indeed, Gramm      blocked the bill that included the provision for several      months because he objected to other provisions. He did,      however, eventually vote for the bill, like most congressmen.      It included the offending provision, which had hardly been      altered during the legislative process.''       So, what's so amazing about the Prospect smear is that it's      a discredited one. The Washington Post, the Philadelphia      Inquirer, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution have already      run corrections for repeating this charge.       I called American Prospect editor Robert Kuttner to try to      ask him if he's going to do the same. He didn't return my      call. But it will be interesting to see if the Prospect,      which makes such a fuss in its editorial about ``corporate      accountability,'' cares as much about journalistic      accountability. [Ed. note--someone from the Prospect has e-     mailed saying that they will correct this.]       All this really amounts to what campaign-finance reformers      call ``mud slinging.'' That's why I can't understand why      McCainiacs and other campaign-finance reformers say they want      to raise the level of public discourse, when they so      relentlessly run it down by imputing corrupt motives to      everyone in Washington.       In the case the Prospect, however, this isn't quite      accurate--it wants to impute nasty motives not to everyone,      but to conservatives in particular.       ``The ideology of deregulation,'' it writes, ``provided      cover for the cronyism.''       This is rather extraordinary, to say in effect that a whole      way of looking at the world--a viewpoint based on philosophy      and ideas--is really only a cover for corruption. Not only is      this a stilted, cynical, and false charge, it is      ideologically loaded.       Nowhere in its editorial does the Prospect excoriate the      Clinton administration for signing the Kyoto treaty,      something that meant a lot to Enron. That's because      regulation is presumed to be public spirited, even if an evil      corporation is pushing for it.       Part of the liberal motive for campaign-finance reform is      clearly to try to systematically prevent American companies      from protecting themselves from government regulation. It      will be a corruption-free world, in short, only when liberals      get everything they want.       Until then, smear away.                                  ____               [From the National Review, Mar. 11, 2002]                       The Gaggers and Gag-Making            hyprocrisy among the campaign-finance reformers                         (By Bradley A. Smith)       It's a common scene in Washington. Lobbyists representing      powerful, well-financed special interests sit behind closed      doors with members of Congress drafting legislation. Outside      Washington, their dollars finance TV ad campaigns in the      districts of wavering House members, hoping to pressure them      into supporting the bill. Highly technical and complex      legislation is then unveiled in the middle of the night, and      most members of Congress have no time to read it before      debate begins the next morning. Efforts by grassroots groups      to amend the bill to protect their members are rebuffed, and      though the bill contains provisions that even its sponsors      admit are probably unconstitutional, such objections are      shunted aside.       You may think this is a description of a special interest      trying to benefit from some arcane budget bill, but in fact      it is a description of the Shays-Meehan campaign-finance-     regulation bill that passed the House in the wee hours of      February 14. The passage of Shays-Meehan shows that those who      think campaign-finance reform will reduce the influence of      money in politics are mistaken.       Supporters of campaign-finance regulation like to portray      themselves as an underfunded, scrappy grassroots coalition.      However, a study conducted last year for the     American Conservative Union by election-law attorney Cleta      Mitchell found that groups dedicated to promoting campaign-     finance reform spent over $73 million over the three-year      period from 1997 through 1999. By comparison, the Center for      Responsive Politics (CRP), one of the most prominent      campaign-finance-reform organizations, lists total political      spending by the ``mortgage banking'' industry at under $12      million, and by ``Health Services and HMOs'' at under $14      million, for the four-year period from 1997 through 2000.      Even the dreaded drug manufacturers contributed just $28      million over that four-year period, or 40 percent of that      spent in just three years by groups promoting campaign-     finance regulation. Yet the campaign-finance regulators      always portray these industries as colossally and harmfully      big spenders.       Actually, Cleta Mitchell's study understates the spending      by campaign-finance-reform groups. It does not include      spending by many of the groups' affiliated 501(c)(4)      committees, and misses some significant groups completely. To      give just one example, it does not include spending by the      National Voting Rights Institute (NVRI), which describes      itself as ``a prominent legal and public education center in      the campaign finance reform field.'' NVRI, which argues that      private campaign contributions violate the Constitution, is      frequently quoted in the New York Times and other major      papers. Meanwhile, the CRP overstates industry giving, as it      includes in its figures individual contributions by any      person employed by a company in the industry, and in certain      cases even contributions by the employee's spouse. Thus, if      the non-working spouse of an Enron employee earning $45,000 a      year gave $200 to the campaign of George W. Bush, the CRP      reports that as both an ``Enron'' contribution and a      contribution from the ``energy/natural resources'' industry.       Arguably, money is the only thing that has kept the issue      of campaign-finance regulation alive. With public-opinion      polls consistently showing that campaign-finance reform is of      little interest to the public, most of the groups advocating      reform rely on six- and even seven-figure grants from giant      foundations such as Ford, Carnegie, and Joyce for funds. With      the notable exception of Common Cause (which has a budget of      about $10 million a year), these groups usually have a few      individual supporters. Such individual support as they do      have comes almost entirely in the form of large gifts from a      handful of politically liberal multi-millionaires, such as      George Soros and Silicon Valley entrepreneur Steven Kirsch.       These groups respond that their money does not represent      ``special interests.'' But their scorekeeping belies this      claim. Surely if a $200 contribution by the wife of a mid-     level Enron employee is ``special interest'' money, so are      the six-figure expenditures made to promote campaign-finance      reform by investment banker Jerome Kohlberg. Similarly, the      Pew Charitable Trusts, to take just one example, have given      considerably more in grants to advocate campaign-finance      regulation than Enron gave in soft money to advocate energy      deregulation. And these foundations and groups have other      interests that are advanced by silencing their opposition.      Pew, for example, also advocates environmental regulation and      funds Planned Parenthood. If it can quiet political      opposition from business and National Right to Life, it      benefits. While one might describe foundations such as Pew,      or organizations such as CRP, as disinterested entities      concerned with the public welfare, one might just as      accurately describe them as unaccountable organizations with      lots of money and no members. Even Common Cause, the one      reform group with a membership base, is small fry compared      with other groups. With some 200,000 members, it describes      itself as a ``citizen's lobbying organization.'' But it      describes the National Rifle Association, which has over 4.2      million members, as a ``special interest.'' Indeed, many      corporations represent hundreds of thousands or even millions      of individual shareholders and employees. Why aren't they      ``citizen lobbies''?                     cynical campaign, cynical town       Pro-reform organizations have used their massive war chests      to run one of the most cynical campaigns in the history of      cynical Washington. Even though corporations and unions are      prohibited from making contributions directly to candidates,      a casual observer looking at CRP's website without reading      the fine print would conclude that the largest direct      contributors to every member of Congress are corporations and      unions. This is because of the center's practice of      attributing contributions by individuals to their employers.      Another trick, in an apparent effort to inflate the      perception of corporate influence, is to lump together      contributions made over many years. Thus, organizations such      as Common Cause and the CRP routinely issue press releases      and studies showing huge corporate contributions, significant      portions of which occurred as much as a decade ago. In some      cases, more than half the Congress has turned over in the      intervening years. Yet another misleading tactic is to lump      together all contributions by ``industries.'' So a 1997      Common Cause report on the influence of the ``broadcast      industry'' listed total contributions from the ``industry''      over a ten-year period. No allowance was made for the fact      that many of the contributions went to individuals no      longer--or perhaps never--in Congress or for the fact that      the ``broadcast industry'' is hardly monolithic: Affiliates      often quarrel with networks, networks with one another, radio      with television, and so on. The reform organizations also      frustrate any sense of perspective. In the current frenzy      over Enron, for example, it is not mentioned that Enron's      total soft-money contributions constitute a minuscule      fraction of 1 percent of total soft money raised over the      period cited.       Meanwhile, virtually every legislative action can be and is      portrayed as a sellout or payback to some ``special      interest.'' So if Enron got a favorable regulatory ruling      over opposition from the Chicago Board of Trade, it was a      payback to Enron. But since the Board of Trade is also a      powerful interest, any ruling the other way would not have      been portrayed as a victory for principle or a defeat for      Enron, but as a payback to the Board of Trade. All roads lead      to corruption. That politicians might actually be acting on      convictions or keeping campaign promises is given no      credence. Few have worked harder to convince the American      people that their representatives are corrupt, and their      votes and participation meaningless, than the campaign-     finance reformers. That they have done so on the flimsiest of      evidence only adds to the shame.       The Enron scandal, which pushed Shays-Meehan over the top,      is a perfect example. Reformers gleefully argued that the      Enron bankruptcy proved that Shays-Meehan was necessary, with      no evidence that Shays-Meehan could have prevented it. Even      Rep. Shays admitted that Enron is going to have access ``by      the fact of who it is and what it does'' (its money aside).      Reform advocates misleadingly claim that over 250 members of      Congress have received ``Enron'' contributions, when in fact      they mean that those members have received contributions from      people who worked for or owned stock in Enron. They do not      mention that Shays-Meehan does not limit these contributions,      and in fact raises the ceiling on them.       Then too, Shays-Meehan was supported down the homestretch      by a television ``issue advertising'' campaign funded by the      Campaign for America (CFA), a creation of Jerome Kohlberg.      These ads ran in the congressional districts of wavering      congressmen. In addition, CFA operated phone banks in 30      congressional districts. This campaign was paid for with      unregulated soft money. In a classic example of ``free speech      for me but not for thee,'' most of that spending would remain      legal under Shays-Meehan.       However, the heart of the operation to pass Shays-Meehan      was not grassroots lobbying, but old-fashioned Washington      lobbying. Though supporters had been pushing the bill since      the 107th Congress first met in January 2001, and though the      sponsors had been gathering signatures on a discharge      petition to force the bill to the floor since July, they      still spent the evening before the opening of the House      debate, and part of the day on which the bill was being      debated, redrafting the legislation. According to press      reports, pro-reform lobbyists, including former McCain 2000      counsel Trevor Porter, Democracy 21's Fred Wertheimer, and      Don Simon of Common Cause, drafted key portions of the bill,      at times working out of offices in the Capitol. The final      version of the complex, 86-page bill was unveiled a few      minutes before midnight.       The bill, as it emerged from this redraft, included a      highly technical provision allowing parties to pay off hard-     money debts incurred before the 2002 elections (hard money      being limited contributions from individuals and PACs, which      may be used for any purpose) with soft money (unlimited      contributions from corporations, unions, and wealthy      individuals, which normally cannot be used to expressly      advocate the election or defeat of specific candidates). The      provision favored Democrats, who have plenty of soft money      but are short on hard money. Republican operatives cried foul      and charged that the provision was an intentional effort to      benefit the Democrats. The more likely explanation is that it      was simply an error caused by the haste of last-minute      drafting. But imagine the outcry these same ``reform'' groups      would have raised had lobbyists for any other interest helped      draft a bill, and accidentally included a technical error      beneficial to the bill's primary supporters in Congress.      Would the reformers have given the drafters the benefit of a      doubt? Never. The error briefly jeopardized the bill and drew      a veto threat from the White House, before supporters used a      parliamentary maneuver to change the language before the      final vote.                         WHERE THE FAT CATS SIT       Assuming it becomes law, the bill will not end the      influence of money in politics, but instead will drive such      influence further underground. A glimpse of the future may      have occurred at a dinner last October that raised $800,000      for the Brennan Center, a pro-reform group. Co-chaired by      pro-reform senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer, and      featuring Sen. John McCain, the dinner was underwritten by      corporate donors, who were solicited to attend. Sponsors      included over two dozen large law firms with Washington      lobbying practices, plus such corporations as Coca-Cola,      Philip Morris, and, naturally, Enron. If money is truly      corrupting, corporations hoping to curry favor with      officeholders might decide that support for such groups is a      wise idea, or officeholders might ``suggest'' that      corporations with business before their committees make      donations to such groups. Shays-Meehan limits the right of      federal officeholders to solicit money for     political parties and other groups, but specifically allows      lawmakers to continue to solicit funds for entities such as      the Brennan Center.       Beyond that, the bill will probably strengthen special      interests, benefit incumbents, and harm grassroots politics.      The limits on soft-money contributions mean that corporations      and unions may be pressured to do more independent spending      to help their legislative allies. This will give these      interests more control over the process, and will reduce the      historical role of parties in brokering diverse and often      competing interests. The limits on issue ads in the 60 days      before an election will mean that such ads will run earlier,      making campaigns longer and putting a greater premium on      early fundraising. This will benefit incumbents, even as it      requires them to spend more time raising funds. True      grassroots politics--spontaneous political activity by      individuals and groups--suffers from regulation and has been      on the decline ever since the Federal Election Campaign Act      was first passed in 1971. The added complexity of this bill      will probably kill off such activity altogether. Indeed,      Federal Election Commission chairman Davis Mason says that      the incredible complexity of the bill is likely to lead to      ``invidious enforcement, singling out disfavored groups or      causes'' and ``subjecting regulated groups to harassment by      political opponents.''       However, the giant foundations that have financed the drive      for reform will remain untouched. So will the recipients of      their largesse, such as Democracy 21 and the Center for      Responsive Politics, and the lobbyists of Common Cause. Big-     business lobbyists also emerge unscathed--indeed,      corporations may devote more resources to lobbying. But      groups that rely less on lobbying and more on campaign      support to candidates, grassroots organizing, and issue ads      to rally public support will suffer.       But that, too, is a common Washington story.  Mr. McCONNELL. With no basis in fact or reality, the media consistently and repeatedly alleges that our every decision can be traced back to money given to support a political party. I trust that every Member in the Chamber recognizes how completely absurd, false, and insulting these charges are. We have been derelict in refuting these baseless allegations. I doubt we will ever see a headline that says 99 percent of Congress has never been under an ethics cloud. That is a headline we simply will not see.  Each Member is elected to represent our constituents. We act in what we believe is the best interest of the country and, obviously, of our home States. Does representing the interests of our State and our constituents lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption? These allegations are not an attack on us, they are an attack on representative democracy.  What we are talking about today is speech: the Government telling people how, when, and how much speech they are allowed. This wholesale regulation of every action of every American anytime there is a Federal election is truly unprecedented.  The courts have consistently upheld the free speech rights of individuals and of parties. Even in the most recent case of Colorado II, the Court made clear that parties are not to be treated any worse than any other organization in the protection of constitutional rights. This legislation falls far short of that charge. The Shays-Meehan bill weaves a bizarre web of restrictions and prohibitions around parties and candidates while simultaneously strengthening the power of outside groups and the corporations that own newspapers.  This legislation is remarkable in its scope. Indeed, this legislation seeks no less than a fundamental reworking of the American political system. Our Nation's two-party system has for centuries brought structure and order to our electoral process. This legislation seeks, quite literally, to eliminate any prominence for the role of political parties in American elections. This legislation favors special interests over parties and favors some special interests over other special interests. It treads on the associational rights of groups by compelling them to disclose their membership lists to a greater extent than ever before contemplated. It hampers the ability of national and State parties to support State and local candidates. It places new limits on the political parties' ability to make independent and coordinated expenditures supporting their candidates.  Many of these provisions are directly contrary to existing Supreme Court precedent.  Let me repeat that. Many of the provisions in this bill that is about to pass the Senate are directly contrary to existing Supreme Court decisions.  Equally remarkable is the patchwork manner in which this legislation achieves its virtual elimination of political parties from the electoral process. It seeks to achieve a pernicious goal via a haphazard means, and the real loser under this legislation is the American voter, who no longer can rely on the support of a major political party as an indicia of what that candidate stands for.  So let me walk you through how this legislation will affect all of us. First, let's look at the national parties. Shays-Meehan will eliminate nearly 50 percent of the fundraising receipts of the national parties. National parties will be forced to conduct their wide array of Federal and State party activities with only half the revenue. Shays-Meehan will eliminate 90 percent of the cash on hand of the national parties. If Shays-Meehan were law in 2001, the total cash on hand for all six national party committees would have dropped from $66 million to $6 million.  Let's go over that one more time. If Shays-Meehan had been in effect last year, the total cash on hand for the six national party committees would have dropped from $66 million down to $6 million: For the three national Republican committees it would drop from $56 million down to $19 million; and for the three national Democratic Party committees, from $10 million down to a debt of $13 million.  So, on this chart behind me, you can see on the reality of what Shays-Meehan does. You can see that for the national party committees last year, the year 2001, their actual cash, both hard and soft. You can also see what kind of cash on hand they would have under Shays-Meehan with the soft money eliminated.  You see the Republican National Committee would have gone from $34 million down to $16 million; the Democratic National Committee from $2 million down to a $10 million debt; the National Republican Senatorial Committee from $12 million down to $7.5 million, the Democratic Senatorial Committee from $4.1 million down to a debt of $50,000, the Republican Congressional Committee from $9.6 million to a debt of $4.3 million, and the Democratic Congressional Committee from $3.5 million down to a debt of $3 million.  What does that all mean? That means this bill eviscerates the national party committees. It singles out six national committees out of all the committees that may exist in America and takes away a huge percentage of their receipts. By eliminating so-called soft money, or non-Federal money, national party support for State parties and local candidates will be dramatically reduced if not entirely eliminated in the next cycle.  The national Republican Party committees gave $130 million to State parties and $13 million to State and local candidates in soft money in the last cycle, the 2000 cycle. The national Democratic Party committees gave $150 million to State parties--more than the national Republican Party committees did--$150 million to State parties and $6 million to State and local candidates in non-Federal money. Where will all the soft money go? Where will it all go?  It is going to go to outside groups. We, the Members of the Congress, will be able to raise it for them. The soft money will also go to the newspapers because they can sell advertising in proximity to the election when no one else can.  Let's go over that one more time. We are taking this money away from the parties, shifting it to outside groups, and restricting their ability to spend it on advertising in any media, except newspapers. No wonder the newspapers are for this bill. This is a great deal for them. Not only are they unregulated in their speech--and they should be, I defend their right to have unregulated speech--but their business managers are going to be pretty excited about this bill as well. It is going to be a windfall for them.  Let's take a look at coordinated versus independent expenditures under this bill. Shays-Meehan significantly limits party support of Federal candidates as well. We just talked about the impact on the State and local level, but Shays-Meehan also significantly limits party support of Federal candidates, people such as us. Under thisbill, parties are prohibited from engaging in both independent and coordinated party expenditures after a candidate has been nominated. The bill treats all party committees, from State and local to the national party, as a single committee. So let's take a look at how this works.  If the Atlantic City Republican Party makes a $500 independent expenditure on behalf of a Senate candidate in New Jersey, the party is then prohibited from making a permissible $900,000 coordinated party expenditure in New Jersey. If you are scratching your head wondering about this, let's go over it one more time.  The Atlantic City Republican Party in New Jersey makes a $500 independent expenditure on behalf of a U.S. Senate candidate in New Jersey. Then the national party committee is prohibited from spending the permissible $900,000 coordinated that we have been allowed to do for a quarter of a century.  The impact is even more severe for Presidential candidates. If a local party anywhere in America makes a $300 independent expenditure on behalf of a Presidential candidate, the nominee of that party will lose the entire party coordinated expenditure--roughly $13.7 million in 2000. Remember, even though the Presidential race is usually publicly funded after the convention, there is an amount of money that both national parties are able to spend on behalf of the Presidential candidate after the convention.  In 2004, the Democratic and Republican Presidential nominees are going to have to police every local committee in America. It is a big country, 50 States, incredible number of municipalities and party committees up and down the system. If any one of them makes a $300 independent expenditure on behalf of the Presidential candidate, then the candidate loses $13.7 million.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent time in New Hampshire lately. There are a number of aspiring Presidential candidates over there on the Democratic side. They ought to read this provision very carefully because, if they get the nomination, some errant Democratic local chairman somewhere in America who decides to go out and be helpful--or maybe to be mischievous if he is not in favor of the nominee--and makes an independent expenditure of $300, he could cost the nominee close to $14 million in coordinated expenditures in the general election.  This is fraught with the potential for mischief. One thing we know about politics, if mischief is possible, mischief will occur. I think we can stipulate that.  Now let us look at what Shays-Meehan does to party conventions.  Shays-Meehan will end national party conventions as we have known them. The soft money ban covers the committees that are created to host these grand events. In 2000, the Federal convention grant from the Treasury of the United States was $14 million for each major party. That is also about the same amount that was spent on security alone at each of the conventions. The rest of the money needed to put on the two conventions came in soft dollars. All of that will be gone.  Looking at the conventions in 2004, if you are chairman of the Democratic National Committee, or the Republican National Committee, you will be confronted with a very difficult decision: Do you want to put on a 4 day convention with 80 percent less funding? Or do you want to spend hard dollars that would otherwise be used to help elect the President to pay for the convention? All the soft money that you used to put on the convention the last time is now gone.  Come to think of it, maybe a middle-size town like my hometown, Louisville, might qualify to hold a convention. That would probably be a short convention with very few people at it. Louisville could make a pitch for both the Democratic and Republican Conventions in 2004. The parties will be able to spend only $15 million. It will probably only last for a day or two. There might be fewer people there. We could probably handle that in our hotels. It is always a bit of a stretch to put all the people up in hotels during Kentucky Derby time of the year. But we might be able to work that out. This could be a windfall for cities of roughly a million across America.  But do we really want to skinny down the conventions, or eliminate the conventions? I know a lot of our colleagues don't particularly like going to them. It is a nonstop event from morning until night. But if you are a precinct worker out in Oregon and have worked in the party trenches over the years and you get to be a delegate, it is a big deal. It is something you will remember the rest of your life. It is the only opportunity you will ever have to meet the county chairmen from some county in South Carolina on the other side of the country. It is the one time every 4 years that we have truly national parties where Republicans and Democrats from all over the country come together to nominate their candidate for President. Even though there has not been any suspense at the conventions for a long time, I can tell you the delegates who come to the Republican Convention--and I believe the delegates that go to the Democratic Convention--think it is a wonderful opportunity to participate in something that is important for America. Unfortunately, we may have seen the end of the conventions as we know them because this bill takes away about 80 percent of the funding of the national conventions.  In case you think that national conventions might be run through State parties, Shays-Meehan also closes that option by allowing the use of soft money only for State, district, or local political conventions. Perhaps the outside groups will step in and fill the gap. We will be able to raise money for them, or maybe even the unrestricted media will somehow find a way to fill the gap.  Now, what will be the effect of this new legislation on Federal officeholders and candidates? Shays-Meehan federalizes our every action and our every conversation. The big losers under this bill are State and local candidates and our State parties. Under Shays-Meehan, we can only raise money for State and local candidates within the hard money limits and restrictions, which is $2,000 per election.  Let me explain to my colleagues how that will work. In 39 States, statewide candidates are currently allowed to receive more than $2,000 per election, and some of them allow corporate contributions to candidates.  For example, the individual contribution limit in Wisconsin for a Governor's race is $10,000 per election. But Federal officeholders and candidates will only be able to raise $2,000 per election for the Governor's race. This bill federalizes our involvement in State and local races as well.  In Virginia, under state law, there are no contribution limits or restrictions for State and local candidates. But under this bill, Federal officeholders and candidates will only be able to raise $2,000 per election for statewide candidates.  Again, in Virginia--which allows unlimited individual corporate and union contributions directly to candidates with full disclosure--if Senator Warner or Senator Allen wanted to be involved in the Governor's race over there, they would be in a difficult position going to a fundraiser that they didn't sponsor, because it would have to be limited to $2,000 contributions for the candidate.  This bill federalizes the involvement of Senators and Congressmen in State and local races by making our rules apply to them no matter what the State law is. Under Shays-Meehan, we can only raise soft dollars for State parties within the hard dollar limits and restrictions, and $10,000 from individuals. But 40 States allow State parties to receive more than $10,000 per year. Some of them even allow corporate contributions to State parties.  For example, in Arizona, there is no limit on the amount an individual can contribute to a State party's State account. Federal officeholders and candidates will only be able to raise $10,000 per year for that State account, even though that is not Arizona State law.  In Illinois, there are no contribution limits or restrictions on contributions to a State party's State account.  But Federal officeholders and candidates who are involved in raising money for the State party State account in Illinois will only be able to raise $10,000 per year no matter what the Illinois law is.  But have no fear, my colleagues. The House has provided us with an alternative. We may not be able to do it forState parties except within the Federal regulations, but we can raise unlimited soft money from any source for outside groups so long as their primary purpose is not voter registration, voter identification, get out the vote, and generic campaign activity. Make sure the group's primary purpose is issue advocacy, and then raise as much as you can from anyone you can. Don't worry. It will never be disclosed.  The perverse effect of this is that we can do a lot more for an outside group than we can do for our own State party in our home State. Under this bill, if you fancy voter registration, voter identification, get out the vote, and generic campaign activity, you can raise $20,000 per year from individuals from any outside group specifically for those activities. All that money is soft money.  Let us go over it one more time.  If a Federal officeholder wants to raise money for a State party, Federal rules apply. But if a Federal officeholder wants to raise money for an outside group, its wide open. So there won't be any less soft money raised around here. My prediction is there will be more soft money around. It will just be raised for outside groups rather than for the party.  Let us take a look at the effect on State and local parties. State and local party operations are impacted dramatically by Shays-Meehan. This bill eliminates the national parties as a source of non-Federal support for their State activities. But it also heavily restricts how they operate.  Last year, we addressed in a limited way the problem of this bill federalizing generic voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. The so-called Levin amendment was adopted by a voice vote in the Senate to incorporate that change.  However, the House has placed such extensive restrictions on the fundraising and spending by State parties for voter activities that the so-called Levin provision is now virtually meaningless. State parties will be forced to use only hard-dollar, Federal dollars, to benefit State and local candidates.  Shays-Meehan prohibits party transfers, joint fundraising, fundraising by us for the State account, and also prohibits State parties from broadcasting generic, ``Vote Republican,'' or ``Register Democrat'' messages.  Not only are we the big losers under the House scheme, but State and local candidates who run in Federal election years suffer as well. State and local candidates who are running in Federal election years--that happens all the time, all the time, all across America. The big winners, yet again, are the outside groups and, of course, the news media.  As for hard-dollar contributions to State parties, Shays-Meehan actually lowers the total amount of hard money that an individual can contribute during a 2-year election cycle to State parties. Shays-Meehan creates a $37,500 per-cycle annual aggregate sub-limit that individuals can contribute to State parties. Under current law, if an individual were so inclined, he could give $50,000 per cycle in hard dollars to State parties. So we are actually going backward, and this is at a time when State parties are forced to do much more with much less.  Let's look at the effect on State and local candidates. National parties will be extremely limited in their ability to not only make contributions to State and local candidates, but also to promote issues of State and local importance in conducting voter drives. Members of Congress are similarly restricted in what assistance we can provide the State and local candidates.  Shays-Meehan even regulates the conduct of State and local candidates--from fundraising to advertising. State and local candidates will be forced to burn campaign funds to retain lawyers to guide them through the myriad State, and now Federal, regulations on their State and local campaigns.  Now, let's take a look at the outside groups and compare the outside groups to the national party committees.  Make no mistake about it, soft money will exist, and it will thrive under Shays-Meehan everywhere, except at the party committees.  Here are a few short examples: Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will continue to use 100-percent soft money to run issue ads. We have no idea how much they spend because corporations and labor unions do not disclose these details about their soft money. But, national parties will be forced to use 100-percent hard dollars. Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will continue to use soft money to raise the hard money for their PACs.  Let me repeat that. Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will continue to use soft money to raise the hard money for their political action committees. But national parties will be forced to use 100-percent hard money because there will no longer be any soft money for the parties to raise hard money.  As we all know, direct mail has high overhead, very high overhead. The national party committees will not only have to build their buildings with hard dollars, and put on their conventions with hard dollars, they will also have to do their direct mail fundraising with 100-percent hard dollars. But corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will use 100-percent soft dollars, even to raise hard money for their political action committees. Corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will even continue to use soft money for activities such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts.  According to news reports, the AFL-CIO plans to raise dues 60 percent to fund their $35 million effort this year. Again, we have no idea how much soft money the unions spend because they do not disclose it. National parties will have to use all hard dollars to do the very same thing that corporations, labor unions, and outside groups will be able to spend 100-percent soft dollars doing.  Stand-alone PACs, such as EMILY's List, for example, will continue to raise and spend a mix of hard and soft money, but not national parties. They will only be able to raise and spend hard dollars.  What about us Members? Members will still be allowed to maintain leadership PACs--that is good--and even have a soft dollar account for those PACs. So Members of Congress will be able to have leadership PACs that raise both hard and soft dollars. But national parties will only be able to raise and spend hard dollars.  The bottom line is this bill does not take money out of politics, it just takes the parties out of politics.  Now let's look at issue ad restrictions. The Shays-Meehan issue ad provision muzzles political speech based solely upon the timing of the speech. A person or a group must report to the Government whenever they mention the name of a candidate in any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. Corporations and labor unions are totally censored during that period. The censorship extends to nonprofit corporations such as the Sierra Club and the NAACP on the left, and the National Right to Life Committee and the NRA on the right.  Let me use a recent example of how this provision will work. Just this past week, within 30 days of the primary, the American Civil Liberties Union ran two issue advertisements in Illinois. One was a broadcast radio ad, the other was a newspaper ad.  If this legislation is passed today, the radio ad falls within the issue ad prohibitions and restrictions, so it could not be run, however, the newspaper ad is not affected. So in the following ad--run just this past week by the ACLU in Illinois--on the radio, the female announcer said:       [We're] waiting for our Congressman, Dennis Hastert, to      protect everyone from discrimination on the job.       As Speaker of the House, Representative Hastert has the      power to stop the delays and bring the Employment Non-     Discrimination Act--ENDA--up for a vote in Congress. It's      about fairness. It's time to ensure equal rights for all who      work, including lesbians and gay men, and make sure that it's      the quality of our work that counts, and nothing else.  And later in the ad, the male announcer says:       Protecting workers from discrimination, or more delays?  And the female announcer says:       Take action now. Send Speaker Hastert a letter urging him      to support fairness and bring ENDA to the floor. . . .  That is the radio ad. Under Shays-Meehan, it cannot be run.  But alas, a newspaper ad, under this bill, could be run.  The newspaper ad says:       Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep. Hastert      has the power to stop the     delays and bring the Employment Non-Discrimination Act--     ENDA--up. . . .  And on and on.  It is exactly the same as the radio ad. So under Shays-Meehan, if your ad is on the radio, you cannot run it; if your ad is in the newspaper, you are OK.  This kind of arbitrary and capricious stifling of political speech is the essence of the issue ad restrictions in this bill. Both advertisements are issue speech. Both advertisements ran at the same time. However, only one advertisement invokes the jurisdiction of a newly created speech police.  I ask unanimous consent that an ACLU press release be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:ACLU Double Play: New Ad Blasts Workplace Discrimination Against Gays,               Shows Flaws in Campaign Finance Legislation       Washington.--In a move that both showcases the problem of      workplace discrimination in America and the constitutional      flaws of campaign finance legislation, the American Civil      Liberties Union today began running a series of radio and      newspapers issue ads that would be outlawed under a campaign      finance bill likely to soon become law.       The advertisements are running in the Chicago media market      and urge Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, who represents      a suburban Chicago district, to use his position to bring the      Employment Non-Discrimination Act to a full vote in the      House.       ``This is a dramatic double play,'' said Laura W. Murphy,      Director of the ACLU's Washington National Office. ``Not only      have we highlighted the urgency of making employment non-     discrimination a top priority in Congress, but the ads also      demonstrate in practice how campaign finance legislation will      effectively gag political speech.''       The ACLU has long advocated a system of public financing as      a means of increasing access to the political process without      impinging on protected political speech. The ACLU's ad, which      Murphy argued is both completely non-partisan and politically      essential, is a perfect example of the beneficial political      speech that would be silenced by the Shays-Meehan bill that      the Senate is expected to take up on Monday.       The ads, because they are being broadcast during a 30-day      window before a primary election, would be forbidden if the      Senate passes and President Bush signs the Shays-Meehan bill.      The ACLU has long been a vigorous opponent of the measure and      its Senate counterpart, the McCain-Feingold bill, because      they would curb political speech.       ``Ironically, our radio ads would be outlawed by the      bill,'' Murphy said, ``but our virtually identical newspaper      ads that are running on Monday would continue to be      acceptable.''       The ACLU said that passage of ENDA would guarantee that      individuals could not be discriminated against in the      workplace based on their real or perceived sexual      orientation. The ads urge listeners and readers to visit the      ACLU's website--http://www.aclu.org/ENDA_where they can      learn more about the provisions of ENDA and send a free fax      to Speaker Hastert urging action in the House on the proposed      legislation.       ``It's important to remember that the ACLU would not be the      only group impacted by the new law,'' Murphy said. ``This ad      could just as easily be something from the NRA, Common Cause      or the Right to Life Committee. The censorship in Shays-     Meehan wouldn't be discriminating.''  Mr. McCONNELL. Reformers apparently are not concerned by the fact that this provision flies in the face of more than a quarter of a century of court decisions striking down such attempts to restrict issue speech. The FEC will be the speech police to track these ads, something that will prove nearly impossible to enforce in a Presidential election year when there will be only a couple of months without censorship somewhere.  Remember, in a Presidential election year, the primaries are going on at different times beginning in Iowa and going through the season. Since this bill cracks down on issue speech within 30 days of a primary, somewhere in America you will be within 30 days of a primary when you are running for President. So the blackout period will be in effect somewhere virtually throughout the entire year.  For those who dare to speak within the 30- to 60-day window--30 days before the primary or 60 days before the general election--they will have to report to the FEC. However, unlike every political committee registered with the FEC, the regulated speakers will only have to report receipts of $1,000 or more, not $200 or more as is required of other committees. Therefore, very few donations will end up being disclosed.  Conveniently for the Washington Post and the New York Times, the restriction and disclosure provisions apply only to broadcast ads and not to print ads. So, once again, we have sort of a capricious selection of preferred media--restrictions on the broadcast media but no restrictions on the print media. No wonder the newspapers are so enthusiastic about this legislation, not just on the editorial page but over in the business department. The newspaper business managers all across America are cheering for this bill.  By focusing only on broadcast media, this restriction allows unions to continue their efforts with unregulated and undisclosed soft money. The breadth of this provision may also restrict communications via the Internet and other high-tech modes of communication which are satellite based.  There are loopholes, of course, for outside groups. Reformers claim this bill will increase disclosure and shine the light on big money in politics. This is, of course, not true. Unions will continue to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars of hard-working union member dues into the political process without ever disclosing one red cent.  Last spring during the Senate debate, in a moment of rank hypocrisy, the Senate voted to reject a provision that simply required corporations and unions to disclose all of their political activities, just their political activities. It was voted down in the Senate.  Interestingly, the AFL-CIO just voted to increase, by 60 percent, the mandatory contributions collected by the unions from their members. These are mandatory contributions--these are not voluntary. In fact, in increasing the mandatory contributions, the unions eliminated all voluntary contributions.  In the 2000 cycle alone, unions contributed $83 million to political campaigns--that we know about. We will never know how many hundreds of millions of dollars the unions spent on many of their political activities because it is never reported. This bill does nothing to address that problem.  I submit two articles for printing in the Record. One is entitled ``The Organized Labor Loophole,'' and the other is entitled ``AFL-CIO To Boost Mandatory Donations.'' I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 16, 2002]                      The Organized Labor Loophole       For several years, there has been much hysteria about how      soft money has corrupted the political process. Democrats,      self-serving media organizations and Sen. John McCain (the      Keating Five-tainted presidential aspirant whose campaign was      trounced by George W. Bush) have been shedding crocodile      tears over soft money. As it happens, during the 1999-2000      electoral cycle, each of the two major political parties      raised about $250 million in soft money from corporations,      unions and individuals. Every dime of those evenly divided      soft-money donations was publicly disclosed. Any interested      voter was free to make his own informed judgment about the      source and the size of the soft-money contributions the      parties received.       The real scandal involving soft money, however, relates to      the fact that labor unions have been laundering the dues of      their members through their union treasuries and into the      coffers of the Democratic Party. This, despite the fact that      voter-exit polls have revealed that nearly 40 percent of      union workers and members of their households have voted for      the Republican presidential candidate since 1980. Yet, even      this scandal pales in comparison to the hundreds of millions      of dollars in indirect and in-kind contributions that labor      unions routinely make on behalf of the Democratic Party.      These sorts of contributions are, of course, never disclosed.      Indeed, labor economist Leo Troy of Rutgers University has      testified before Congress that unions regularly spend and      estimated $500 million during each two-year cycle to elect      Democrats. Yet, only a relatively small portion of these      funds--specifically, the soft-money donations and the      contributions from political action committees (PACs)--are      disclosed.       The audacious operations of the National Education      Association (NEA) demonstrate precisely how scandalous      labor's gambit has been. As the Landmark Legal Foundation has      meticulously documented in several complaints filed with the      IRS and the Federal Election Commission, the nonprofit, tax-     exempt NEA has literally spent tens of millions of dollars      since 1994 on political operations. Each year, however,      according to Form 990 that is required by the IRS, the      Washington-based NEA claims that not a dime of its resources      is expended on political matters. Since at least 1994, Form      990's line 81a, where the NEA is required to ``[e]nter the      amount of political expenditures, direct or indirect,'' has      been blank. Anyone who reviews Landmark's complaints, which      are     available on its web site (landmarklegal.org), can appreciate      how staggering the NEA's annual violations truly are.       While Landmark has concentrated on the NEA's national      affiliate, the Heritage Foundation has attempted to review      Form 990s filed with the IRS by teachers unions representing      the 100 largest, public-school districts and the 50      representing them at the state level. These included      affiliates of both the NEA and the American Federation of      Teachers (AFT), the other major teachers union.       By law, these NEA and AFT affiliates are required to      provide copies of their most recently filed Form 990s to      anyone requesting them. In fact, many affiliates refused      Heritage's request. Nevertheless, apart from the      contributions by their PACs, only two of the 63 Form 990s      examined by Heritage reported any ``political expenditures,      direct or indirect'' on line 81a. (National Education of New      York and the Hawaii State Teachers Association reported      ``direct or indirect'' political expenditures of $69,272 and      $136,285, respectively--political spending, if Landmark's      review of the NEA's national affiliate is any guide, that is      probably drastically understated.) Equally revealing was the      fact that those forms showed average-annual-dues income      exceeding $4.1 million, while expenditures for collective      bargaining--a union's principal purpose--averaged a mere      $103,000.       Once Senate Republicans cast the deciding, filibuster-proof      votes to ban soft money, which, in practice, Republicans have      used to balance the ``under-the-radar'' political spending by      labor unions on behalf of Democrats, those GOP senators will      have nakedly exposed themselves to the loophole-smashing      tactics of a labor-Democratic cabal.                                  ____                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 27, 2002] AFL-CIO to Boost Mandatory Donations, Hopes to Spend $35M on November                                Elections                           (By Sue Kirchhoff)       New Orleans.--John Sweeney, AFL-CIO president, said      yesterday labor leaders plan about a 60 percent increase in      mandatory contributions for political activities in order to      help the organization meet its goal of pouring $35 million      into get-out-the-vote and advertising efforts before the      November elections.       The proposal, which faces a final vote in May, was one in a      series of efforts by the AFL-CIO executive council, meeting      in New Orleans, to regroup in the face of a recession that      has hit workers hard. There are splits among unions over      specific issues, such as an energy bill now moving through      the Senate, and unease that labor has won few victories      despite its enormous financial support of Democrats.       New figures released yesterday showed an increase in union      membership in 2001, but the gains were nowhere near the goal      of recruiting a million workers a year. The AFL-CIO      membership rose by about 326,000 to 13.25 million. Most of      the increase, however, was due to affiliation with existing      unions. The AFL-CIO, which has consolidated some offices,      said it would shift dozens of workers to political activities      and union organizing. Union leaders approved an economic      agenda that focuses on health care, retirement security, and      jobs, and made it clear that a candidate's willingness to      actively support union organizing efforts would be a key      factor in endorsements and financial support.       ``We will advance an economic agenda for working families.      If we don't do it, no one will,'' said Sweeney, attacking the      Bush administration for what he called ``shameful''      insensitivity toward workers.       But labor's antagonism toward the White House does not      extend to all Republicans. Asked at a news conference whether      his goal was to elect a Democratic Congress, Sweeney said      carefully, ``It's fair to say that we want a House that's      controlled by supporters of the working-family agenda.'' He      said moderate Republicans had been willing to work with      unions.       Other union leaders emphasized their desire to focus on      issues, not party orientation. Union efforts are expected to      overwhelmingly favor Democrats, but more Republicans may get      support than in the past. With 36 governors races this year,      unions plan to focus more of their effort on state      activities.       ``They're [Democrats] getting nervous as we talk about      being issue-driven because no one likes to compete,'' said      Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees      International Union, the nation's largest. His group has      weathered criticism for supporting, among other issues, a      health proposal by New York's Republican governor, George      Pataki.       Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, who was received ``politely''      during private meetings, underscored White House efforts to      make inroads with select unions, such as the Teamsters, which      has split with Democrats to support a Republican plan to      drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. As the Senate      opens debate on the energy bill, autoworkers say they are      also worried about proposals to increase fuel-efficiency      standards.       ``I'm very much committed to fostering a good working      relationship with labor, but that has to be a two-way      street,'' Chao said. She promised the unions she would      carefully review a new lawsuit against the poultry industry      over ergonomics. The suit was announced yesterday.       Currently, the AFL-CIO funds political activities through a      6.5-cents-per-month assessment on workers and voluntary      contributions from member unions. Under the proposal, the      mandatory assessment would increase to 10.5 cents, but the      voluntary fund-raising would stop. The change, which would      take effect in July, would contribute $3.5 million of the      forecast $35 million for this election cycle. That total      includes $12 million, however, that has already been spent on      political activities. Union officials said there was fund-     raising fatigue and the desire to have more stable funding.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let's take a look at the media. One of the largest loopholes in this bill is reserved for the media. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of George Will's February 25 column from Newsweek and his March 10 column from the Washington Post be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, Feb. 25, 2002]                     Virtue at Last! (In November)                          (By George F. Will)       Presidential Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, pioneering new      frontiers of fatuity, says some parts of the Shays-Meehan      campaign-finance bill please his boss and others do not.      ``But ultimately the process is moving forward, and the      president is pleased.'' Ultimately, in Washington, the      celebration of ``process'' signals the abandonment of      principle.       President Bush's abandonment of his has earned him at least      $61 million (see below) and the approval of The New York      Times. It praises his ``positive role'' and gives him      ``considerable credit'' for the passage of the bill, which      has received so much supportive editorializing from the      Times, in news stories and editorials, that it should be      called Shays-Meehan-Times.       What pleased the Times is that Bush did next to nothing to      discourage--in fact Fleischer issued a statement that      encouraged--passage of a bill chock-full of provisions that      Bush, who swore an oath to defend the Constitution, has said      violate the First Amendment. Two years ago he affirmed this      principle expressed by Supreme Court Justice Clearance      Thomas: ``There is no constitutionally significant      distinction between campaign contributions and expenditures.      Both forms of speech are central to the First Amendment.''      When asked about the principle that it is hostile to First      Amendment values to limit individuals' participation in      politics by limiting their right to contribute, he said, ``I      agree.'' Asked if he thinks a president has a duty to judge      the constitutionality of bills and veto those he considers      unconstitutional, he replied: ``I do.''       Now he seems ready to sign Shays-Meehan-Times. Why? Could      it have something to do with the fact that the bill raises      from $1,000 to $2,000 the limit on individuals's      contributions to House, Senate and presidential candidates?      Candidate Bush got $1,000 contributions from 61,000 people.      If he can get just that many to give $2,000--for a sitting      president, that should be a piece of cake--the bill that he      says ``makes the system better'' will be worth an extra $61      million to him in 2004.       The ardent-for-reform Washington Post--the bill should have      been called Shays-Meehan-Times-Post--baldly asserts (talk      about the triumph of hope over experience) that the bill      ``will slow the spiral of big-money fundraising.'' Actually,      the 2003-04 election cycle probably will see the normal      increase in political spending. The difference will be that      in the next cycle much more of the political giving will be      more difficult to trace. The soft money that Shays-Meehan-     Times-Post bans--contributions to parties--must be reported.      Henceforth much of that money will go to independent groups      that will not have to report the source of the money that      finances their issue advertising.       One of the bill's incumbent-protection measures says that a      candidate whose opponent is very wealthy can receive      contributions larger than $2,000. But the Supreme Court has      held that the only constitutional justification for limiting      political contributions is to prevent corruption or the      appearance thereof. So this bill claims, in effect, that the      appearance of corruption from a large contribution varies      with the size of one's opponent's wallet.       Another incumbent-convenience provision makes it much more      difficult for independent groups--labor unions, corporations,      nonprofit entities (individuals are another matter; see next      paragraph)--to run ads that so much as mention a House,      Senate or presidential candidate within 30 days of a primary      or 60 days of a general election--if effect, after Labor Day.       In the name of protecting regular people from rich people,      the bill has this effect: A millionaire can write a check for      $1 million and run a political ad that the National Rifle      Association or the Sierra Club could not run using $1      contributions from 1 million individuals.       Most representatives who voted for the bill probably do not      know half of what is in it. They cannot know. No one will      know until there have been years of litigation about Federal      Election Commission regulations issued to ``clarify'' things.      What, for example, if meant by ``coordination''? Consider.       There are dollar limits on contributions to candidates, but      not on spending for political     advocacy by independent individuals or groups--unless they      are coordinated with the candidate. In that case they are      counted as contributions to the candidate, and thus limited.      The bill says coordination includes ``any general or      particular understanding'' between such an individual or      group and a candidate. If proper law gives due notice of what      is and is not permitted, this is not the rule of law.       Opinion polls invariably show negligible public interest in      campaign-finance reform, but almost every congressional      district has at least one newspaper hot for reform. Media      cheerleading for the bill has been relentless. For example,      NBC's Katie Couric, advocating passage of what should be      called the Shays-Meehan-Times-Post-Couric bill, wondered      whether Enron's collapse would make ``people say, `Enough is      enough! This has got to happen!' '' The media know that their      power increases as more and more restrictions are imposed on      everyone else's ability to participate in political advocacy.       The bill repeals the politicians' entitlement to buy      advertising at the lowest rate stations charge any buyer.      This will mean hundreds of millions of dollars of extra      revenue for broadcasters. Is this a reward for the media's      support? Is there an appearance of corruption here? Never      mind. But note this. Repeal of the entitlement is another      gift from incumbents to themselves. Challengers usually have      less money, so they will be most hurt by higher ad rates.       The bill's authors say soft money is (a) scandalous and (b)      not to be tampered with until after they have re-elected      themselves. That is, they refused to ban soft money until      they have spent all that their parties have raised and will      frenetically raise until November. It is going to be that      kind of year.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 2002]                        A Matter of Appearances                          (By George F. Will)       The New York Times and The Washington Post are guilty of      corruption. To be precise, they probably are guilty only of      the appearance of corruption, as they define it. But as they      so frequently tell us, the appearance of corruption is the      equal of actual corruption as a justification for campaign      finance reform, for which they have tirelessly campaigned.       The Supreme Court has said that preventing corruption or      the appearance of it is the only constitutional justification      for limits on political contributions, most of which finance      the dissemination of political speech. So advocates of the      House-passed Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill and of      its close cousin, the Senate-passed McCain-Feingold bill,      pretend (we shall come in a moment to what they are really      doing) that their aim is merely to prevent corruption and--     this is more important because it is more ubiquitous--the      appearance of it.       Well. Shays-Meehan, which the Senate will accept as a      replacement for McCain-Feingold, no longer contains a      provision that is in McCain-Feingold that would have      strengthened the requirement that television stations sell      time to candidates at the low rates the stations charge their      best customers. The House dropped this provision from the      bill.       Broadcasters lobbied hard for this action, which will be      worth many millions of dollars to television stations. But      that probably was not the primary reason the House did it.      Nor was the reason just gratitude for the media's      cheerleading for Shays-Meehan. Rather, the House probably did      it primarily to help incumbents: Challengers usually have      less money and hence are hurt more by high broadcasting      rates.       However, our concern is not with the motives of the House      in removing the provision, but with the appearance the      removal creates regarding two passionate advocates of Shays-     Meehan. The New York Times Co. owns eight network-affiliated      television stations, and The Washington Post Co. owns six      such stations. Shays-Meehan is potentially a windfall for      both companies. Gracious.       The Times and The Post incessantly instruct their readers      that the appearance of corruption exists when someone who has      benefited an elected official with a campaign contribution      then benefits from something the official does. But      contributions are not the only, or even the most important,      benefits that can be conferred upon elected officials. The      support by powerful newspapers for a political official's      legislation can be much more valuable to the politician than      the maximum permissible monetary contribution ($2,000 under      current law, $4,000 after Shays-Meehan becomes law) to his      campaign.       It probably would be unfair to ascribe the Times' and The      Post's support for Shays-Meehan to corruption. But it would      be no more unfair than are the Times, The Post and other      reform advocates in routinely impugning the motives of      politicians who are conservative (or liberal) and hence      support particular conservative (or liberal) policies      after, but not because, they have received contributions      from people who support those policies.       Stil, the appearance of corruption on the part of the Times      and Post, which are exquisitely sensitive about (other      people's) appearances, is compounded by this fact: The media,      which comprise the only intense constituency for campaign      finance reform, advocate expanded government regulation of      all political advocacy except that done by the media.       Many reformers' ostensible concern about the appearance of      corruption is just for appearances. The politicians' real      concern is to silence their critics. Recently John McCain      gave the game away.       He was discussing the bill's provision that puts severe--     for many groups, insuperable--impediments on any group      wanting to run a broadcast ad that so much as refers to a      candidate within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general      election. He said: ``What we're trying to do is stop''--note      that word--``organizations like the so-called Club for Growth      that came into Arizona in a primary, spent hundreds of      thousands of dollars in attack ads. We had no idea who they      were, where their money came from.''       McCain's attack was recklessly untruthful. He knows      perfectly well what the club is--a mostly Republican group      formed to support fiscal conservatives. The only ad the club      ran--a radio ad--contained not a word of attack: It was an      entirely positive endorsement of a candidate's views, and it      did not mention or even refer to anyone else. All      contributions to the club over $200 are disclosed.       But on one matter McCain, who wishes he could criminalize      negative ads, was candid. He--like the Times and Post--is      trying to stop others from enjoying rights they now enjoy.  Mr. McCONNELL. Shays-Meehan restricts the free speech rights of individuals, parties and groups, but not the media. The issue ad restrictions are so onerous that many individuals and groups will choose not to speak. But, of course, the media will still be free to speak their mind.  I ask unanimous consent that an article by Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, entitled ``Just A Gag? Congress Prepares To Repeal Freedom Of Speech,'' be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 13, 2002]                              Just a Gag?                           (By Pete Du Pont)       The anti-First Amendment crowd is at work in Washington      this week, attempting to limit political speech during      election campaigns. Their vehicle is the Shays-Meehan      campaign-finance bill, and their goal is to drive the money      out of politics--even if it requires driving free speech out      of political campaigns.       Rep. Harold Ford (D., Tenn.) wondered on television last      summer why ``any organization regardless [of whether] they      are Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, [should]      be allowed to come in and influence the outcome of elections      solely to advance some narrow interest of theirs.''       Why should they be allowed? Because the First Amendment      says it's their right. Because the framers of the      Constitution believed, as James Madison and Alexander      Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 51, that the civil rights      of citizens in the new republic depended on the voices of      many interests being heard. And because if only candidates      and the establishment media are allowed to speak in the 60      days before an election--which is the intent and effect of      the Shays-Meehan bill--ordinary people will be all but      voiceless and powerless in the crucial period during an      election.       No doubt members of Congress think that is a good idea,      because it is much easier to get re-elected if your opponent      lacks the resources to mount an effective campaign. What      elected official wants groups interested in some issue      mucking about in his voting record and being able to air what      they find in prime time?       But the question under debate is whether people of similar      beliefs--be they anti-death-penalty liberals or pro-life      conservatives, unions or corporations or nonprofits--may pool      their resources to increase their political impact by talking      on television about issues and candidates in the 60 days (the      only days that really count) before an election.       Shays-Meehan says no; journalists can talk on television or      radio, but others interested in an issue cannot. But the      First Amendment is very clear that our opinions as citizens      and the opinions of the press are equally protected.      (``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of      speech, or of the press.'') And so was the U.S. Supreme Court      in Buckley v. Valeo, the definitive and unanimous 1976      campaign-regulation decision: ``The concept that the      government may restrict the speech of some elements in our      society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is      wholly foreign to the First Amendment.''       What Shays-Meehan (and its Senate counterpart, McCain-     Feingold) does is restrict the speech of challengers and      enhance the speech of incumbents; it restricts the speech of      citizens and thus enhances the speech of the media on issues      they care about.       In an earlier column, I discussed some of the difficulties      of political speech bans. But consider the actual effect of      McCain-Feingold: Planned Parenthood and People for the      American Way, the National Rifle Association and Americans      for Tax Reform, your local Stop the Highway or Cut Property      Taxes Committee--all of them among Rep. Ford's ``narrow      interest'' organizations--would be forbidden to use their      resources to     run ``electioneering communications'' after Labor Day in an      election year. But every newspaper and television station in      your town and state could still support or denigrate every      candidate every day. Why would any sensible person vote to      limit the speech of individuals and organizations but not      that of the media, which have as many opinions and biases as      each of us does?       When McCain-Feingold was before the Senate last March, 40      senators voted for Sen. Fritz Hollings's proposed      constitutional amendment that would exclude campaign speech      from the protection of the First Amendment. As wrongheaded as      it is, it is at least honest. Shays-Meehan's supporters      propose to achieve the same result by stealth, for they know      full well that a constitutional amendment has no chance of      passing.       It is hard to imagine anything worse for the republic than      to have campaign speech regulated, supervised, watched,      controlled and authorized or prohibited by an agency of the      national government. Our Founding Fathers carefully wrote the      right to express our views on the issues of the day into the      Constitution, and we should make sure it is not written out.  Mr. McCONNELL. Many of Shays-Meehan's restrictions on political discussion by outside groups only apply to discussions in the broadcast media--not in the print media. If you happen to own a newspaper, or happen to be a newspaper, then these restrictions do not apply.  It is no mystery why the New York Times and the Washington Post have joined forces to run an editorial in favor of campaign finance reform once every 5\1/2\ days for the last 5 years. More than once a week, every week, for the last 5 years. The newspapers are huge winners under this bill--they have a blatant conflict of interest--which I don't recall reading about on any of their editorial pages. Nor do I recall seeing any news stories in their papers about their blatant conflict of interest and what big winners they are financially as a result of the passage of this bill.  Let's take a look at fundraising for outside groups. The largest loophole for outside groups is that we in Congress can raise soft money for them. This huge loophole was literally added at the 11th hour over in the House in order to secure enough support for this bill so that it would pass in the House of Representatives. This bill shuts off money to political parties but turns the spigot wide open on contributions to outside interests.  What the reformers don't tell you is that the soft money contributed to the national parties was already fully disclosed. Our friends up in the press gallery and the American public knows how much soft money the parties received. It has been disclosed for years. But for some reason, the reformers believe a system of raising undisclosed soft money for outside groups is better; it is better to allow Members of Congress to raise undisclosed soft money for outside groups than to allow Members of Congress to raise disclosed soft money for political parties. If you can make any sense of that, give me a ring sometime.  The parties will be replaced by an underground network of outside groups for whom we can raise unlimited, undisclosed sums of soft money. Let me be clear: There are numerous groups for whom Members can raise unlimited, undisclosed corporate and union soft money. Let me give you some names: Common Cause, the Sierra Club, the NAACP, NARAL, and NOW. This is a great day for them, a banner day for them.  Now there are other loopholes in Shays-Meehan for specific outside groups. Let's take a look at Indian tribes. In the 2000 cycle, Indian tribes contributed almost $3 million to Federal political campaigns. They used their general treasury for contributions, independent expenditures, and to run issue ads. This bill does not cover any of their activities.  A recent article from Fox News concluded that Indian tribes could soon contribute more money than any other interest group in America.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Natives Slip Through Big Loophole in Campaign Finance                            (By Katie Cobb)       Los Angeles.--Native American groups, or sovereign tribes      that live alongside other U.S. citizens but are subject to      several exemptions from U.S. tax and other laws, are getting      another break in the campaign finance reform law meant to      reduce the impact of special interests on political      campaigns.       ``They are basically just reaching into the till that is      full of business and gambling money and writing checks to      politicians and political parties,'' said Jan Baran, an      elections law attorney.       While most special interest groups will lose their ability      to donate soft money and are limited to low caps on direct      contributions if and when the campaign finance bill is      enacted, tribes which participate in the $5 billion a year      Indian gaming industry will not be subject to the same rules.       An existing rule by the Federal Elections Commission      already exempted tribes from the same contribution limits      that apply to other Americans. But lawmakers, who had an      opportunity to close the loophole during recent debate on the      measure, decided to leave the exemption in place.       ``Under the current law, individuals have an overall cap of      $25,000 a year that they can give to candidates and federal      political committees. Indian tribes don't have that overall      aggregate cap,'' said Ken Gross, a former council for the      FEC.       The exemption allows Indian tribes to donate the maximum      amount to every single candidate running for federal office,      easily totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash each      election cycle.       ``They have a big pot of money to use and make political      contributions and as long as they distribute it on a per      candidate or per committee basis within the limits, there is      no cap on how much they can spend so they are in a good      position,'' Gross said.       And give they do. During the 1994 election cycle, Indian      gaming groups gave more than $600,000 to federal candidates      and political parties. In 1996, they gave close to $2 million      and during the 2000 cycle, nearly $3 million. Millions more      went to state candidates.       ``We have taken a long time. We suffered a lot because we      didn't understand this political process and now that we have      learned the process and we have a level playing field, we      have got to be treated fair,'' said Erine Stevens, chairman      of the National Indian Gaming Association.       The exemption could put Indian tribes in a position to      donate more than any other single interest group in America.       Politicians don't seem to mind. Lawmakers don't appear in a      hurry to close the loophole during a House and Senate      reconciliation conference. And if the bill is signed into law      by the President, Indian groups can start cashing in their      chips.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let's take a look at the trial lawyers. Shays-Meehan does not cover trial lawyers who organize as partnerships--which most lawyers do these days--rather than corporations. Lawyers gave more than $112 million in the 2000 election cycle alone. They are free to run issue ads at any time without restriction. This bill does nothing to change that.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an editorial by James Wooton on this matter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 27, 2002]                    Campaign Finance Lawyer Loophole                           (By James Wooton)       A great irony could emerge from the 107th Congress: The      purportedly populist campaign finance reform bill being      considered by Congress would stifle debate on legal reform--a      vital consumer and shareholder issue--while creating a      loophole for the most powerful special interest in      Washington: plaintiffs' class action lawyers.       As it relates to independent expenditures and issue      advertisements, these bills don't cover trial lawyers because      lawyers commonly take their compensation as individuals and,      therefore, are not treated as ``corporations'' subject to the      restrictions in the legislation. Whether or not they intend      it, the bill's authors would grant a license to these trial      lawyers, who ante up tens of millions of dollars in campaign      contributions a year and, in doing so, would further empower      a new class of wealthy individuals with an aggressive      political agenda. The Shays-Meehan/McCain-Feingold bills      unwittingly step into a major public-policy battle between      plaintiffs' trial lawyers and the U.S. business community in      a way that's certain to produce a clear loser: The American      public. Legal reform is a concept abhorred by these lawyers      because it would rein in the filing of frivolous lawsuits and      put a lid on the lottery-like legal fees that have made some      trial lawyers fabulosuly rish. They remember well the bullet      they dodged when President Clinton vetoed the 1996 Federal      Products Liability bill. Since that bill's demise, the trial      bar has been rewarded handsomely: The total of the top 10      jury verdicts increased twelvefold from 1997 to 1999.       Because legal reform could help curb the ``lawyer tax''      that increases the cost of consumer goods and services by      $4,800 annually for a family of four and degrades the value      of investments, the public has a lot at stake in this battle.       Today, personal injury lawyers already are on top of the      world. Freshly infused with the expectation of billions in      fees from tobacco     litigation, they are investing heavily in Senate elections to      build a barrier against any future legal reforms. If lawyers      were ranked among industries, they would be No. 1 on the list      of donors to political campaigns. According to the Center for      Responsive Politics, lawyers contributed more than $110      million in the 2000 election cycle, $77 million of which went      to Democrats. Members of the Association of Trial Lawyers of      America alone gave $3.6 million to federal campaigns over the      same period.       The battle over legal reform takes place on many fronts,      from electing or selecting reform-minded officials, to      educating the public about the need for reform, to engaging      in grass-roots and legislative lobbying and, ultimately, to      enacting reform legislation. To be sure, personal injury      lawyers and American businesses both engage in these      activities. Unfortunately for the public, Shays-Meehan/     McCain-Feingold would hobble American businesses involved in      this debate while leaving trial lawyers armed to the teeth.       For instance, the legislation would impose a gag rule,      prohibiting corporations from running broadcast issue ads      that even mention the name of a candidate for a 60-day      blackout period before a general election and 30 days before      a primary. Personal injury lawyers would face no such      obstacle.       Shays-Meehan/McCain-Feingold contains other booby traps      that could confound business efforts to inspire needed      reforms to our legal system. A gag rule, for example, would      bar corporations from running ads that simply ask viewers to      ``Call Senator Jones and urge him to support legal reform      bill X.'' During the blackout period, corporations would even      be prohibited from running ads that name the principal      sponsors of this bill.       Undoubtedly these are unintended consequences of Shays-     Meehan/McCain-Feingold. The fact is that the courts are more      solicitous of the free speech rights of individuals than      corporations. Although some campaign reform advocates have      expressed disdain for the greedy plaintiffs' bar and      supported legal reform, the campaign finance bills would give      more power to personal injury lawyers while crippling the      business community's efforts to restore sanity to our civil      justice system. Any congressional supporters of common-sense      legal reform should be wary of a bill that could      significantly empower the plaintiffs' trial bar to block      these needed reforms.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let's take a look at a specific provision of this bill. The provision on ``coordination.''  In addition to protecting the American people's right to free speech and association, the first amendment protects the rights of Americans to petition their Government for redress of grievances. This right is essential to our representative democracy.  We meet with constituents and with citizens groups--who in this debate are simply referred to as ``special interests''--to help determine how best to effectuate the wishes of the American people. We meet with these folks every day. Our meetings with fellow Americans is thus one of the most important things that occurs in the democratic process.  The Shays-Meehan ``coordination'' provision affects our ability to meet with constituents and citizen groups. There is a danger posed by an overbroad coordination standard in this bill. By subjecting candidates, officeholders, and citizens groups to civil and criminal liability for innocuous--and, indeed, necessary--contacts, the ``coordination'' provisions in Shays-Meehan do great damage to the constitutionally protected right of Americans to petition their Government for the redress of grievances.  The Shays-Meehan coordination provisions repeal existing FEC regulations on coordination, and they direct the agency--they order the agency--to promulgate new ones. In doing so, the bill ties the FEC's hands by specifically prohibiting the FEC from issuing regulations that require ``agreement'' or ``formal collaboration'' before subjecting a candidate, officeholder, or citizens group to civil or criminal liability for a ``coordinated communication.''  Let's sum it up. In other words, Congress is prohibiting the FEC from drafting coordination regulations that meet the constitutional requirement of being neither vague nor overly broad. We have, by this act, given instructions to the Federal Election Commission that they cannot draft regulations that meet a constitutional requirement of being neither vague nor overly broad. This bill seeks to shut down the process of interacting with constituents.  Citizens groups and candidates will be subject to prosecution if the Government deems an otherwise lawful ``issue communication'' to be a prohibited corporate contribution simply because groups have met with candidates or officeholders about public policy issues and then run ads on those issues.  For example, if a Member meets with a group about legislation that both the Member and the group support, and the group then runs ads promoting that legislation or those policies, someone--anyone--could then file a complaint charging that the Member and the group ``coordinated'' the communication.  Because Shays-Meehan bars the FEC from requiring that there be an agreement or formal collaboration to establish that the ad was coordinated, a group and a candidate can be liable for receiving and making, respectively, prohibited contributions. It will not matter that the Member disagrees with the ad or even that he did not know anything about it. It won't make a bit of difference.  Instead of requiring an actual agreement or formal collaboration before liability can be established, Shays-Meehan allows the Government to use simple presumptions to show ``coordination'' when, in fact, it may not exist.  Citizens groups, both on the left and on the right, oppose Shays-Meehan's coordination provisions. These groups recognize they will face intrusive and costly investigations, prosecution, civil fines, and penalties, and even criminal liability--even criminal liability--simply because they meet with Members and candidates about issues and then promote a policy agenda that happens to overlap with the Member's policy agenda.  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Right to Life, the NRA, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the NAACP opposing the coordination provisions in Shays-Meehan be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  National Right to Life Committee                               and National Rifle Association,                                                   March 19, 2002.     Re Coordination Minefield in Section 214 of H.R. 2356.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Rules and          Administration, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Under current law, no relationship      of ``coordination'' exists unless there is an actual prior      communication about a specific expenditure for a specific      project which results in the expenditure being under the      direction or control of a candidate, or which causes the      expenditure to be made based upon information provided by the      candidate about the candidate's needs or plans.       However, Section 214 of the Shays-Meehan bill (H.R. 2356),      in the form passed by the House on February 14, 2002, would      obliterate that clear rule, and replace it with a new      standard for ``coordination'' that would place incumbent      lawmakers, advocacy groups, and unions at great legal risk      for engaging in cooperative or parallel activities in support      of common legislative goals--or even merely for transmitting      information about an incumbent lawmaker's position on public      polity issues.       Section 214 of the bill explicitly nullifies the current      Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations governing      ``coordination.'' The bill commands the FEC to develop new      regulations that ``shall not require agreement or formal      collaboration to establish coordination.'' [emphasis added]      The bill goes on to dictate a number of issues that must be      addressed in new regulations.                    ``substantial discussion'' trap       Section 214 requires new ``coordination'' regulations that      must, among other things, address ``payments for      communications made by a person after substantial discussion      about the communication with a candidate. . .'' [emphasis      added]       Many groups submit questionnaires to members of Congress      and other ``candidates,'' some of them covering many      different specific issues. Other groups use standardized      forms by which a candidate can ``pledge'' to endorse a      certain legislative initiative--for example, the balanced      budget amendment, or the Equal Rights Amendment, or ``a ban      on soft money.'' These written inquiries are often      accompanied by written or verbal communications intended to      convey why the position(s) advocated by the group are good      public policy, worthy of the support of a lawmaker or would-     be lawmaker. But even completing the questionnaire or pledge      alone could be sufficient to constitute ``substantial      communication,'' since the lawmaker presumably returns the      document to the group with the clear understanding that the      group intends to convey his or her position to members of the      public.       If the group does so by means that cost money, the group      may soon be the target of a complaint that it made an illegal      campaign ``contribution,'' due to the ``coordination'' that      occurred between the lawmaker and the group. Moreover, as      explained below,     if the group's spending constituted an illegal corporate      ``contribution,'' then the member of Congress has also      ``received'' an illegal corporate contribution (and, no      doubt, committed another violation by failing to report this      ``contribution''). Such a complaint may well do the incumbent      lawmaker both legal harm and political harm, even though he      did no more than convey his position(s) to a group of      interested citizens.       Here is another example of ``substantial discussion'' that      could lead to legal difficulties for a group (and for an      incumbent lawmaker). Early in a congressional session,      representatives of six groups met with Senator Doe to discuss      what language they, and he, will use to collectively promote      Doe's landmark bill to ban widgets. The six groups then spend      money to communicate with the public, including Senator Doe's      constituents, regarding the urgent need to enact the ``Doe-     Jones Widget Ban Act.'' The campaign manager for the      senator's challenger then files a complaint, alleging that      the groups have a ``coordinated'' relationship with Doe, and      therefore the expenditures promoting Doe's bill are actually      ``contributions'' to Doe's campaign. The legal      consequences for the groups could be grave, because      ``contributions'' by incorporated groups and unions have      long been illegal.       But the consequences for the incumbent lawmaker could be      equally grave, because if the groups' expenditures to promote      his bill are deemed to be ``contributions,'' then he also has      violated three provisions of law: (1) he has received illegal      ``contributions'' from corporations or unions; (2) he has      received ``contributions'' in excess of the $2,000 limit; and      (3) he has failed to report the `'contributions'' that he      received from the groups.                        ``Common Vendors'' Trap       The bill also commands that the FEC's new regulations must      address ``payments for the use of a common vendor.'' This      provision is a license for regulations under which both      members of Congress and groups would be at constant risk of      entering into a ``coordination'' relationship merely because      they both purchase services from the same pollster, ad      agency, or other ``common vendor.'' Under such a regulation,      a group can establish ``coordination'' with a member of      Congress without the lawmaker being able to prevent it, or      even knowing about it until after the fact. On the other      hand, a member of Congress could unilaterally make it more      difficult for numerous groups of their right to express      themselves about his record, merely by making purchases from      the leading vendor or vendors of certain services (e.g.,      mailing houses, pollsters) in a given area.       The bill also requires the new regulations to address      communications made by ``persons who previously served as an      employee of a candidate or a political party.'' The bill      contains no time limit on the ``disability'' that would      result from such prior employment. The bill's language would      permit, for example, the FEC to write regulations under which      involvement in a group's public communications by someone who      had worked for a political party years earlier would      automatically ``coordinate'' all federal candidates of the      same political party who is discussed in that group's      communications to the public.                      Political Action Committees       Above, we have described ways in which a member of Congress      could unwittingly and unknowingly become `'coordinated'' with      an incorporated group or union, and thereby be charged with      receiving illegal ``contributions.'' There is an additional      consequence once this has occurred: If the political action      committee (PAC) connected to the ``coordinated'' corporation      or union expends more than $5,000 on any activities in      support of the lawmaker (or in opposition to his opponent)--     even without any prior knowledge or involvement by the      candidate--then those contributions also would also be      regarded as illegal ``contributions.'' This is because once      the parent corporation or union is deemed to have become      ``coordinated'' in any of the ways outlined above, its      connected PAC also becomes ``coordinated'' and thus loses      its legal right to make independent expenditures in excess      of $5,000 to support or oppose any candidate--and the      candidate is guilty of ``receiving'' an illegal      contribution if the PAC makes such expenditures.       Consequently, a Member of Congress could easily become      guilty of violating federal election law if he unknowingly      becomes ``coordinated'' with a group, and the group's PAC      subsequently makes expenditures over $5,000 without the      Member's prior knowledge, much less consent.       In closing, we believe that the coordination provision      (Section 214) in the Shays-Meehan bill infringe upon our      First Amendment right to free speech and right to petition      the government for redress of grievances. Therefore, we      strongly oppose this provision.           Respectfully,     David N. O'Steen,       Executive Director, National Right to Life Committee.     Charles H. Cunningham,       Director, Federal Affairs, National Rifle Association.                                  ____         American Civil Liberties Union and National Association            for the Advancement of Colored People,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2002.     Senator Russ Feingold,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feingold: At your earliest convenience we      would like to meet with you and your staff to discuss the      coordination provisions of the House-passed version of the      Shays-Meehan bill (H.R. 2356) that the Senate may soon take      up.       We believe that Section 214 (provisions on coordination)      will have a chilling effect on our ability to communicate      with Members of Congress and our constituencies about      important issues that arise in the legislative context.      Because the provisions are so vaguely worded, we also think      that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) will have the      ability to subject groups to unwarranted investigations to      determine if our motivation is really to affect the outcome      of legislation or to affect the outcome of a campaign.       Shays-Meehan substantially changes current law by      explicitly nullifying the current (and clear) FEC regulations      governing ``coordination.'' Under current law, no      relationship of ``coordination'' exists unless there is an      actual prior communication about a specific expenditure for a      specific project, which results in the expenditure being      under the direction or control of a candidate. In addition,      under current law coordination exists if the expenditure is      made based upon information provided by the candidate about      the candidate's needs or plans.       Under Section 214 of the Shays-Meehan bill the FEC is      directed to issue regulations that cover communications we      have with federal candidates. These new regulations ``shall      not require agreement or formal collaboration to establish      coordination.'' Another part of Section 214 states that the      new FEC regulations should address ``payments for      communications made by a person after substantial discussion      about the communication with a candidate . . .'' We think      that these vaguely worded directives concerning our      activities could cause legal nightmares for our groups and      the candidates with whom they work.       The ACLU and the NAACP often meet with members of Congress      to learn about their positions on issues. After those      meetings we sometimes decide to assist them (or lobby against      them) on their legislative initiatives. After these      conversations our groups may decide to convey the substance      of these meetings through mass communications such as full      page advertisements in newspapers, mass mailings, radio      ads and the like. If we spend money to engage in these      communications, we could be the target of a complaint      accusing us that we made an illegal campaign      ``contribution'' due to the ``coordination'' that occurred      between the lawmaker and our groups. Indeed we have often      been asked by a lawmaker to mobilize our grass roots on an      amendment or bill that they may be offering. This has      happened numerous times on issues ranging from civil      rights laws to welfare reform. Just because we work      closely with a Senator or Representative on a policy issue      does not mean that we are secretly trying to endorse a      particular candidate for re-election. But the new Section      214 provisions of Shays-Meehan will make our activities      suspect and prone to investigation and perhaps sanctions      by the FEC.       Candidates are also very much at risk as a result of the      new coordination language. If the FEC deems that our groups'      issue communications really amount to an illegal contribution      to a candidate, then the candidate can be fined by the FEC      for accepting an ``illegal'' contribution.       Without completely eliminating this provision, we hope that      you will make adjustments in the language of this statute      before the Senate takes up the bill later this week. The      coordination provisions should not be so vague that they lead      to the regulation of communications that are constitutionally      protected and are not designed to support or oppose a      candidate for federal elective office.       Thank you for your consideration of this urgent request.           Sincerely,     Laura W. Murphy,       Director, ACLU.     Hillary Shelton,       Director, NAACP.  Mr. McCONNELL. I urge these groups and others who are concerned about their ability to continue to promote issues to join me in challenging the overbroad ``coordination'' provisions in this bill.  The proponents of this legislation urge that the result I have described to you is not what they have intended. They have inserted into the Record a clarification of how they envision their coordination provisions to operate.  However, neither a colloquy nor legislative history can change clear statutory language. If the drafters did not intend the troubling result I have described, then they should have used different language, or accepted my offer to modify the provision, which is one of the items I discussed with the Senator from Arizona early on in our discussions about the technical corrections to this bill. Instead, they insisted on directing the FEC to find ``coordination,'' when there is no agreement to coordinate.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that additional documentsfrom individuals and groups across the political spectrum, which highlight the fundamental problems with this legislation, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 13, 2002]                    It's Not Reform, It's Deception                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)       ``Washington think'' is less about logic than political      hustle. If you favor something, you attach it to a popular      cause--say, homeland security. If you oppose something, you      attach it to an unpopular cause--say, Enron. Bear this in      mind as the House debates the Shays-Meehan ``campaign finance      reform'' bill, named after sponsors Christopher Shays (R-     Conn.) and Martin Meehan (D-Mass.). The Enron scandal (it's      said) demonstrates the corruptness of big political      contributions and the need for an overhaul. The argument,      though highly seductive, is complete make-believe.       Only by the lax standards of ``Washington think'' would      anyone treat it seriously. It's all innuendo: Enron collapsed      because some executives behaved unethically; Enron executives      also made political contributions; therefore, the      contributions are tainted and the system is rotten. In      reality, Enron would have collapsed even if its executives      hadn't contributed a penny. The connection between the      bankruptcy and political giving is fictitious. Perhaps      contributions bought Enron some influence in shaping the      White House's energy plan. But given Bush administration's      pro-market views, does anyone truly believe the energy plan      would have been much different without Enron?       The real lesson is that when Enron desperately needed help,      its contributions bought no influence at all. In the 1999-     2000 election cycle, Enron, its executives and employees made      about $2.4 million in contributions, says the Center for      Responsive Politics. Republicans got 72 percent, Democrats 28      percent. That's a lot of money--but not compared with total      contributions. In the 2000 election, all House and Senate      candidates raised more than $1 billion. Bush and Gore raised      $193.1 million and $132.8 million. Political parties and      committees raised hundreds of millions more.       Even if Enron deserve help (it didn't), few politicians      would have risked public wrath by rushing to its aid. What      this episode actually shows is that the breadth of      contributions insulates politicians against ``undue''      influence by large donors. Since the early 1980s, the details      of campaign fundraising and spending have changed enormously.      But the debate's basic issues have stayed the same and can be      distilled into a few questions:       Is campaign spending too high? No. In 2000, all campaigns--     including state and local elections and ballot referendums--     cost about $3.9 billion, according to the forthcoming book      ``Financing the 2000 Election'' from the Brookings      Institution. This is less than four one-hundredths of 1      percent of our national income. It's less than Americans      spend annually on flowers ($6.6 billion in 1997).       Do contributions systematically favor one party over      another? No. Since the early 1980s, politics has become      more--not less--competitive. The closeness of the Bush-Gore      election and the present congressional split (Republican      House, Democratic Senate) attest to that. Candidates need to      raise a threshold of contributions to campaign effectively.      But more money doesn't guarantee victory. The Brookings book      cites many cases where poorer candidates won. In Michigan,      incumbent Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham spent $13 million      but lost to Debbie Stabenow, who spent $8 million.       Do rich contributors control Washington? No. Sure, the      wealth sometimes get underserved tax and regulatory breaks.      But generally they're fighting a rear-guard defense against      higher taxes and more regulations. Even after Bush's tax cut,      the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans pay roughly half of      all federal taxes. Most government benefits (for Social      Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) go to large      middle-class or poor constituencies.       Are big campaign contributions a large source of      discontent? No. In a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll,      respondents rated the government's top 10 priorities.      ``Campaign finance'' finished last, with 14 percent. Last      April--before terrorism and the declaration of a      recession--it was also last, with 15 percent.       Do restrictions on campaign contributions curb free speech?      Yes. Because modern communication--TV, mailings, phone banks,      Internet sites--requires money, limits on contributions      restrict communication. If communication isn't speech, what      is it? The Supreme Court mistakenly blessed some contribution      limits in Buckley v. Valeo (1976) but also equated free      speech with free spending. As long as the court maintains      that free speech involves free spending, putting more      restrictions on contributions to political candidates and      parties is self-defeating. It simply encourages outside      groups (unions, industry associations, environmental groups)      with their own agendas to increase campaign spending to      influence elections.       The true parallel between Enron and campaign finance is one      that ``reformers'' avoid. Enron's cardinal sin was deception.      The company evaded clear financial reporting. Similarly,      ``campaign finance reform'' fosters continuous deceptions.      Because politics requires money and is fiercely competitive,      every new restriction on contributions inspires ways around      the limits--evasions that, though legal, are denounced as      ``abuses.'' Why should writing laws that predictably invite      evasion be considered a good or moral act?       If Shays-Meehan becomes law, the cycle will continue. It      bars most ``soft money'' political contributions and      restricts some ``issue ads'' before elections. The Supreme      Court might toss out some or all of the new limits as      unconstitutional. If it doesn't, political operatives will      skirt the restrictions. Opinions are divided on which party      might benefit. Perhaps neither. Whatever happens, Shays-     Meehan will hardly take big money out of politics. The only      way to have true ``reform'' without this legislated hypocrisy      is to amend the Constitution and place limits on the First      Amendment. Somehow a distinction would have to be created      between ``spending to communicate'' and ``communicating.''       To make this case would be difficult. In this reporter's      opinion, it would also be undesirable. It would stifle      political competition and sow resentment. But perhaps      reformers can convince the American public otherwise. If they      think campaign money is fundamentally corrupting democracy,      honesty compels them to take the amendment route. Until they      acknowledge that, they will be guilty of the same sins as      Enron's executives. They will be describing the world as they      wish it to be seen, not as it actually is. Here lies the      geninue Enron analogy.                                  ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2002.       Dear Representative: We, the undersigned organizations and      individuals, represent a diverse array of non-profit public      policy advocacy groups. We have a shared belief that your      upcoming vote on Shays-Meehan today will create an important      record of your stand on the First Amendment rights of issue      advocacy groups in the United States. We urge you to oppose      this legislation because it contains unwarranted and      unconstitutional restrictions on our free speech rights.       We have heard a great deal about so-called ``sham issue      ads'' and the need to regulate such advertising. Until now in      the United States, under our First Amendment, we have had the      right to express our views through advertising about national      issues and about federal elected officials before, during and      after elections. Clearly most of Congress realizes that it      would be unconstitutional to silence an individual who wants      to take out broadcast advertising during this same period;      consequently, Shays-Meehan does not silence wealthy      individuals. But Shays-Meehan does silence groups like ours      that are collectively supported by millions of small      contributors who band together to make their views known.       Proponents of Shays-Meehan argue that their bill does not      silence our groups. They are wrong. Sections 201, 203, and      204 of H.R. 2356 (like its Senate counterpart) contain      unconstitutional restrictions on broadcast, cable and      satellite issue ads. The net effect of these provisions is to      ban many of our national groups and their affiliates, and all      other 501(c)(4) advocacy corporations (but not PACs) from      funding TV or radio ads that even mention the name of a local      member of Congress for 30 days before a state's congressional      primary or runoff, and for another 60 days before the general      election. This restriction applies to any ad that ``can be      received'' by 50,000 or more ``persons,'' including minors,      within a district--which covers nearly any TV or radio ad,      since few persons do not possess TVs and radios.       These restrictions would have widespread impact on issue      advocacy throughout the even number years in particular. For      example, even today (February 13, 2002) if the bill were law,      groups such as Common Cause and Campaign for America would be      banned from running a TV or radio ad today in California      (March 5th primary) or Texas (March 12th primary) saying      simply ``Call Congressman Jones to urge him to vote for the      Shays-Meehan bill.'' In effect, groups are being cut out of      the dialogue on major national issues.       The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that only express      advocacy, narrowly defined, can be subject to campaign      finance controls. Shays-Meehan redefines express advocacy in      a way that covers our legitimate speech, which is not telling      voters to vote for or against a particular candidate. If we      dare applaud, criticize or even mention a candidate's name      during this 30 day/60 day ``blackout'' period, we would have      to create a PAC where donor names would have to be      disclosed to the FEC in a way never before upheld by the      courts.       We believe that no group that wants to express its views      through broadcast ads should be forced to bear the      significant and costly burden of establishing a PAC just to      comment during this period. Separate accounting procedures,      new legal compliance costs and separate administrative      processes would be imposed on these groups--a high price to      exercise their First Amendment rights to merely mention a      candidate's name or comment on candidate records. Moreover,      having a PAC would by definition make the organization a      participant in partisan politics. Rather than risk violating      this new requirement, absorbing the cost of compliance or      being forced to take partisan stands during elections, it is      very likely that some groups will remain silent.       It is clear that the intent and net effect of Shays-Meehan      is to shut down legitimate, constitutionally protected issue      advocacy. Are you voting to do this to groups who represent      millions of Americans? We urge you to reject this approach.      Please vote against Shays-Meehan.           Sincerely,       Laura W. Murphy, Director, ACLU Washington Office; Joel      Gora, ACLU Campaign Finance Counsel, Professor of Law,      Brooklyn Law School; David N.

Dear Representative:  On behalf of the American Civil      Liberties Union we are writing to express our opposition to      the Shays-Meeham bill, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of      2001, H.R. 2356 as originally introduced and in its      subsequent permutations.       Shays-Meehan (in all its various iterations) would:       Unconstitutionally restrict robust political speech by      average citizens prior to federal elections (issue advocacy      restrictions).       Place restrictions on soft money contributions that support      issue advocacy activities (partial bans on soft money).       Create draconian penalties for non-partisan interactions      between groups and federal candidates (so-called      coordination).       Shays-Meehan penalizes people of moderate means who want to      band together to make their voices heard throughout the year,      before during and after federal elections. These bills      protect incumbents, wealthy individuals, PACs and the press.      We have enclosed a fact sheet that presents our objections to      Shays-Meehan in more detail.       We urge all members of Congress to vote against this      legislation.           Sincerely,     Laura W. Murphy.                                  ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                                   Washington, DC.                ACLU Campaign Finance Reform Fact SheetWhy Should Members of Congress Vote Against H.R. 2356, the Shays-Meehan                                  Bill?       1. Shays/Meehan is patently unconstitutional.       The American Civil Liberties Union believes that key      elements of Shays-Meehan violate the First Amendment right to      free speech because the legislation contains provisions that      would:       Violate the constitutionally protected right of the people      to express their opinions about issues through broadcast      advertising if they mention the name of a candidate.       Restrict soft money contributions and uses of soft money      for no constitutionally justifiable reason.       Chill free expression by redefining it as ``coordination''      through burdensome reporting requirements and greatly      expanded FEC investigative and enforcement authority.       H.R. 2356 would burden and abridge the very speech that the      First Amendment was designed to protect: political speech.       2. Shays-Meehan would have a chilling effect on issue      advocacy speech that is essential in a democracy. H.R. 2356      contains the harshest and most unconstitutional controls on      issue advocacy groups. The bill contains:       A virtual ban on issue advocacy achieved through redefining      express advocacy in an unconstitutionally value and over-     broad manner. The Supreme Court has held that only express      advocacy, narrowly defined, can be subject to campaign      finance controls. The key to the existing definition of      express advocacy is the inclusion of an explicit directive to      vote for or vote against a candidate. Minus the explicit      directive or so-called ``bright-line'' test, the Federal      Election Commission (FEC) will decide what constitutes      express advocacy. Few non-profit issue groups will want to      risk their tax status or incur legal expenses to engage in      speech that could be interpreted by the FEC to have an      influence on the outcome of an election.       A black-out on broadcast, cable and satellite issue      advertising before primary and general elections. The bill's      statutory limitations on issue advocacy would force groups      that now engage in issue advocacy--including non-profit      corporations known as 501(c)(4)s--to create new institutional      entities in order to ``legally'' speak within 30 days before      a congressional primary or runoff and 60 days before a      general election. This restriction applies to any ad that      ``can be received'' by 50,000 or more ``persons,'' including      minors, within a district--which covers almost all TV or      radio ads, since few persons do not possess TVs and radios.      If a group wanted to take out a broadcast, cable or satellite      ad during this period they would have to create a PAC where      donors would have to be disclosed to the FEC in a way never      before sustained by the courts. The opportunities that donors      now have to contribute anonymously (a real concern when a      cause is unpopular or divisive--see NAACP v. Alabama) would      be eliminated.       Being forced to establish a PAC as a condition of      commenting on campaign issues could entail a significant and      costly burden for many non-profit organizations. Separate      accounting procedures, new legal compliance costs and      separate administrative processes would be imposed on these      groups--a high price to exercise their First Amendment rights      to comment on candidate records. Moreover, forcing an      organization to take a partisan position is antithetical to      the mission of groups like the ACLU that are fiercely non-     partisan. It is very likely that some groups will remain      silent rather than risk violating this new requirement or      absorbing the cost of compliance. The only individuals and      groups that will be able to characterize a candidate's record      on radio and TV during this 60 day period will be the      candidates, wealthy individuals, PACs and the media. Further,      members of congress need only wait until days before a      primary or general election (as they often do now) to vote      for legislation or engage in controversial behavior so that      their actions are beyond the reach of public comment and,      therefore, effectively immune from citizen criticism.       3. Shays-Meehan redefines ``coordination with a candidate''      so that heretofore legal and constitutionally protected      activities of issue advocacy groups would become illegal.       If the ACLU decided to place an ad lauding--by name--     Representatives or Senators for their effective advocacy of      constitutional campaign finance reform, that ad would be      counted as express advocacy on behalf of the named      Congresspersons and, therefore, would be prohibited if the      ACLU had prior discussions with that member about those      issues. An expanded definition of coordination is disruptive      of proper issue group-candidate discussion.       4. Shays-Meehan would impermissibly limit soft money.       Unprecedented restrictions on soft money would make      national parties less able to support grassroots activity,      candidate recruitment and get-out-the-vote efforts.      Restrictions on corporate and union contributions to parties      not only trample the First Amendment rights of parties and      their supporters in a manner well beyond any compelling      governmental interest but they also dry up funds that expand      political participation. Further, Shays-Meehan would ban all      contributions from parties to non-profit organizations.      Political parties frequently give money to non-profit      groups to facilitate voter registration and issue-based      voter mobilization efforts. These restrictions threaten      the very survival of non-profit organizations that exist      for these purposes, and will likely further suppress voter      turnout by student and minority groups. Political parties      are the mainstay of our democracy and they require funds      for their electoral and issue advocacy activity. Any      concern with large contributions to political parties may      be addressed through the less drastic alternative of      disclosure.       5. Shays-Meehan does not do anything to ``Big Money'' in      politics except push money into other forms of speech that      are beyond the reach of the campaign finance laws.       The Shays-Meehan bill contains misguided and      unconstitutional restrictions on issue group speech and, as a      consequence, further empowers the media to influence the      outcome of elections. None of the proposals seek to regulate      the ability of the media--print, electronic, broadcast or      cable--to exercise its enormous power to direct news coverage      and editorialize in favor or against candidates. This would      be clearly unconstitutional. However, if the sponsors of      Shays-Meehan have their way, the only entities that would be      free to comment in any significant way on candidates' records      would be the media, wealthy individuals, PACs and the      candidates themselves. Corporations and unions need only to      purchase media outlet if they want to have influence over      candidates--their wealth and influence will not be abated by      these so-called ``reforms.'' Why, then, does Shays-Meehan      attack, burden and seek to effectively eliminate only citizen      group advocacy?       6. Shays-Meehan makes it harder for ethnic and racial      minority, women and non-mainstream voices to be heard prior      to an election.       What would happen, for example, if a candidate runs racist,      sexist or homophobic ads during the last days of an election      and interest groups like the NAACP, NOW or the National Gay      and Lesbian Task Force wanted to criticize that candidate by      name? Unless they undertook the complicated process of      forming a PAC, they would risk violating the issue ad      restriction in HR 2356 (the Shays-Meehan bill). Any broadcast      ads decrying the candidates behavior that uses the name or      likeness of a candidates 30 days before a primary or 60 days      prior to a general election--even ads that do not endorse or      oppose the candidates--would have to be funded through new      disclosed dollars only, not existing non-profit funds.      Further, the Shays-Meehan restrictions on soft money would      dry up dollars that parties need to conduct voter      registration and education, issue and platform development      and the like.       7. It creates a ``Big Brother'' governmental regime for      political speech.       This bill would permit the creation of a huge Federal      Elections Commission apparatus that would be in the full-time      business of determining which communications are considered      unlawful ``electioneering'' by citizens and non-profit      groups. None of the major proposals have funds to train or      defend citizens or interest groups under the proposed new      regulatory regime. Yet the Shays-Meehan legislation contains      harsh penalties for failure to comply with the new laws.       8. How does the Shays-Meehan bill compare to the Ney/Wynn      bill, H.R. 2360?       The Ney/Wynn bill is far less constitutionally flawed than      Shays/Meehan in that it regulates issue advocacy and soft      money less restrictively. But Ney/Wynn is still problematic      legislation in that it imposes unwarranted regulation of      issue advocacy thought registration, reporting and      disclosure. It creates a kind of ``Free Speech Registry'' for      any organized criticism of incumbent politicians. A group      would still have to register with the FEC if it sends      written, Internet and broadcast communications. These very      same kinds of regulations have been struck down by the      federal courts (See United States v. National Committee for      Impeachment, 469 F.2d 1135 (2d Cir. N.Y. 1972) and American      Civil Liberties Union v. Jennings, 366 F. Supp. 1041 (D.D.C.      1973)). The Ney/Wynn bill would adversely affect issue group      publications such as an ACLU Civil Liberties Voting Index      unless it was communicated only internally to members). Such      a communication would be subject to onerous and burdensome      regulations. Although both bills embody the flawed limit-     driven approach to political speech, the Shays/Meehan bill is      far more constitutionally onerous.       Shays-Meehan is unconstitutional, unwise and ineffective      legislation. The ACLU urges Representatives to vote against      H.R. 2356.  Mr. McCONNELL. Although this legislation will pass today, I am confident the Supreme Court will step in to defend the Constitution.  I commend the proponents of this bill for acknowledging the serious constitutional questions that are wrapped up in this legislation and for providing an expedited route to the Supreme Court for an answer to these questions. I am consoled by the obvious fact that the courts do not defer to the Congress on matters of the Constitution, and they should not.  Today is a sad day for our Constitution, a sad day for our democracy, and for our political parties. We are all now complicit in a dramatic transfer of power from challenger-friendly, citizen-action groups known as political parties to outside special interest groups, wealthy individuals, and corporations that own newspapers.  After a decade of making my constitutional arguments to this body, I am eager to become the lead plaintiff in this case and take my argument to the branch of Government charged with the critical task of interpreting our Constitution.  Today is not a moment of great courage for the legislative branch. We have allowed a few powerful editorial pages to prod us into infringing the First Amendment rights of everybody but them. Fortunately, this is the very moment for which the Bill of Rights was enacted. The Constitution is most powerful when our courage is most lacking.  Madam President, I congratulate Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for their long quest on behalf of this legislation and also Congressmen Shays and Meehan.  I particularly thank my devoted staff, who have been deeply involved in this issue--some of them going back to the late 1980s. The Minority Staff Director of the Rules Committee, Tam Somerville, was with me in 1994 when we had the last all-night filibuster in the Senate. It was on this issue. That was a time when we really did get out the cots because we really meant to use them, not just to have a photo op. Hunter Bates, my former Chief of Staff and the former Chief Counsel of the Rules Committee, has been a tower of strength on this issue and will still be, hopefully, involved in our effort as we go forward in the courts. Brian Lewis, my Chief Counsel at the Rules Committee, has been an invaluable member of this team. He is a very skillful lawyer, with a good political sense as well. He also has been deeply involved in the election reform issue, which Senator Dodd and I hope to move in the coming weeks. Leon Sequeira, my Counsel at the Rules Committee who works with Brian, is sitting to my right. He is also a valuable member of our team and a terrific lawyer who has made important contributions to this debate.  John Abegg, my Counsel in my personal office, is another bright lawyer, well steeped in the first amendment, who has made an important contribution.  Chris Moore and Hugh Farrish of the Rules Committee staff have also been helpful to me in this effort.  I say to all my staff who have worked on this issue, you make me look a lot better than I deserve, and I thank you so much for your outstanding work, not just for me but for the principles involved in this important debate.  In conclusion, this may be the end of the legislative chapter of this bill, but a new and exciting phase lies ahead as we go to court to seek to uphold the Constitution and protect the rights of individuals, parties and outside groups to comment and engage in political discourse in our country.  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator has 18\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.
