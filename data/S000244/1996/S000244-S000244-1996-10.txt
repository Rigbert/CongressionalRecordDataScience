Speaker, I rise today in tribute to the late Hon. Hamilton Fish, Jr., an outstanding American of great compassion, decency, and dignity.  Known to this friends as ``Ham,'' he dedicated his life to serving the United States. As a young American, he interrupted his education to enlist in the Navy during World War II. Later Ham joined the U.S. Foreign Service and served in Dublin as Vice Consul to Ireland from 1951 to 1953. In 1968 he began his 26 years of dedicated service to the people of New York's 19th Congressional District as their representative to Congress. His constituents appreciated his leadership and hard work, electing him by overwhelming margins as a result.  I observed Ham's legislative skills while serving with him on the Judiciary Committee. He was a master at working together with all Members to achieve a consensus. While in Congress, Ham focused his skills on passing legislative landmarks, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act. In addition, he was a leader in crafting copyright and antitrust law.  While he was well known for his legislative accomplishments, Ham Fish was best known as a great American. Friends and foes alike respected and admired Ham. His affable and kind personality positively impacted all who knew him.  Today America has indeed lost an outstanding citizen. I offer my condolences to the family and friends of the late Hon. Hamilton Fish, Jr.                          ____________________
