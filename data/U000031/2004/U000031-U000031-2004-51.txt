Speaker, as we come together as a nation to celebrate Veteran's Day, I would like to honor two American patriots who are receiving long-overdue medals commemorating their service to our country. The sacrifices that these heroes made to protect our country and defend freedom will never be forgotten.  Mr. David Matthew Bielski, a Vietnam War veteran from Kalamazoo, Michigan, has been awarded with the Silver Star and the Army Commendation Medal. From April 25th to April 26th, 1968, in the A Shau Valley of Vietnam, David gallantly fought enemy soldiers, and located trapped and wounded American troops. During his service, David was wounded three times, which he received the Purple Heart. In addition to these two high honors, David has also been awarded with the Vietnam Service Medal with 4 Bronze Service Stars and the Good Conduct Medal.  Mr. Miland W. Bills, a World War II veteran from Kalamazoo, Michigan, has been awarded with the POW Medal. During his service to our country, Miland was a POW in Germany from December 31, 1943 to May 3, 1945. In addition to the POW Medal, Miland has also received the Air Medal, Good Conduct Medal, American Defense Service Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 1 Bronze Service Star, World War II Victory Medal, and the Honorable Service Lapel Button, WWII.  The sacrifices that these two individuals gave to our country are immeasurable--they both answered their country's call to serve with great honor. I wish I could have been present to celebrate these awards with both Mr. Bielski and Mr. Bills. However, on behalf of the Sixth District of Michigan, I would like to extend my greatest wishes and tribute to these valiant heroes.                          ____________________
