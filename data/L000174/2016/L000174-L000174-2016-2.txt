President, whistleblowers play an essential role in providing transparency and accountability in the Federal Government and exposing waste, fraud, and abuse. It is important that all government employees have safe and effective avenues to come forward when they have evidence of wrongdoing, and to encourage themto come forward they must be afforded protections from retaliation. Unfortunately, under current law, FBI employees who report waste or misconduct are not afforded the same whistleblower protections as all other Federal employees. That is why I worked closely with Senator Grassley to author the FBI Whistleblower Protection Enhancements Act of 2016.  The bill Senator Grassley and I drafted was a comprehensive package. Not only did it extend protections to FBI employees who report waste, fraud, or abuse to supervisors in their chain of command, but it also provided clear guidance on the investigation and adjudication of retaliation claims so that those same employees are not denied whistleblower protections without reason or without opportunity to appeal. Unfortunately, the bill we have passed today has been stripped of many of these worthy reforms. While I am pleased we will finally update the law to provide whistleblower protections for FBI employees who blow the whistle within their chain of command, I am disappointed that the bill we have before of contains only a fraction of the reform that Senator Grassley and I worked so hard to move through the Senate Judiciary Committee.  This is a small but important step forward, but it is not sufficient. The Senate must work to pass comprehensive reform so that FBI employees are able to blow the whistle and not face repercussions for doing so. I hope we can revisit this important issue in the next Congress.                          ____________________
