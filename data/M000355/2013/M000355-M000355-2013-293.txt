 President, I stand before you today to honor and recognize a man whose legacy of service to the community, both as a physician and a citizen, is completely deserving of such recognition. I am speaking of Mr. Dennis Meyers of Clay County, KY. The Clay County Days Hall of Fame has chosen to induct Mr. Meyers for his excellent leadership of Manchester Memorial Hospital over the past 12 years.  Mr. Meyers' record of service can be traced back to 1969, when he served as a pastor in the Nebraska and Illinois conferences. After close to two decades of pastoral service, he pursued an occupational change that allowed him to aid others in the field of recreational therapy. He continued to pursue opportunities in medicine, moving into a registered nurse position at Hanford Hospital in 1986. Mr. Meyers then accepted the role of vice president of nursing at San Joaquin Community Hospital in 1990 and continued success brought him to Manchester Memorial, where he eventually served as president and chief executive officer.  Dennis Meyers' involvement in and care for his community have been immeasurable, especially when one considers the many community outreach initiatives he fostered. He helped the community by initiating Mission in Motion, public health screenings, Live It UP, and mission outreach programs.  Mr. Meyers' family shares his devotion to helping others, as his wife Susan also works for the hospital and his three children hold nursing degrees. He has recently retired from his lead role at Manchester Memorial Hospital but plans to stay involved through outreach and church programs.  At this time, I would like to ask my fellow Senators to join me in honoring Mr. Dennis Meyers for his induction into the Clay County Days Hall of Fame. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is all the richer because of his tireless spirit and his willingness to work, heal, and serve.  I also ask unanimous consent that an article in praise of Mr. Meyers that appeared in the Bell County-area publication The Manchester Enterprise be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           [From the Manchester Enterprise, August 30, 2012]            Dennis Meyers Led Manchester Memorial to Growth       Clay County Days Hall of Fame inductee Dennis Meyers      retired from the lead role of Manchester Memorial Hospital      recently after 12 years in the position.       Meyers began as a pastor in 1969 in Nebraska and Illinois.      In 1980, his career took a dramatic shift when he began      working as a recreational therapist at the Battle Creek      Sanitarium. In 1986 he transitioned to Hanford Hospital,      where he worked as a registered nurse.       Four years later, Meyers accepted a position as vice      president of nursing at San Joaquin Community Hospital.       From there, he became chief operating officer and vice      president of nursing at Manchester Memorial, and then      president and chief executive officer.       Several community outreach initiatives began under Meyer's      direction, including Mission in Motion, public health      screenings, Live It UP, and mission outreach programs that      enrich the community.       Meyers holds a bachelor of arts in religion, a bachelor of      science in nursing, and a master of divinity from Andrews      University.       He is married to Susan Meyers, who works for the hospital,      and all three of his children hold nursing degrees.       Meyers plans to continue helping the community that the      hospital serves through community outreach and church      programs.                          ____________________
