Mr. Speaker, I would ask, where are the timber jobs of yesteryear? We asked where the flowers were and where the moderate Republicans are, but where are the timber jobs of yesteryear? The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Yates] had the privilege of serving at one time as the chairman, and knows full good and well, he voted for the Tongass agreement to allow us, in fact, to have a sound economy, yet leaving over 15 million acres in southeast Alaska out of the mutiple-use timber base.  Good fiction never dies, especially fiction about the Tongass Forest that is being spread on this floor today. I can hardly believe my ears. Such a distinguished gentleman saying this would destroy the last standing rain forest of the great southeast Alaska, when there are 15 million acres already off limits to logging, and he has twice voted in this Congress to do so.  But we have lost 42 percent of our timber workers since the last act of this Congress on the Tongass in 1990.  This bill, as I suggested to the conference and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula], is not everything I would want. In fact, this Tongass issue is truly a red herring. All we are asking in this agreement is to freeze a land base of 1.7 million acres, the amount of land agreed to in 1990 that would be available for timber over a 100-year period. The amendment says that the land base can no longer be taken away. And remember, we have 15 million acres of land available for wildlife and old growth habitat today. We are talking about a very small, tiny land base for timber.  Harvesting does not change, in fact, what can be harvested, does not increase at all under the provision. It does not tell the Forest Service what they can do, other than the fact it says ``You can no longer take away any of that land base that we made available in two previous acts of Congress.''  This, in fact, is further than I would have gone, but my senior Senator in fact has agreed to this. He sits on the conference. I am going to suggest, this conference report must pass.  I listened to the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer] yesterday saying ``We can solve these problems if we just send the appropriation bills to the President.'' We are going to do that today. We will send him a bill that should be signed, a bill that does take care of the problem, a bill, in fact, that does keep a moratorium on mining, which the gentleman wishes to do. That is what he wanted.  This is good legislation, but I again would like to put to rest this constant misinformation, this constant fiction about the Tongass National Forest. We are talking about 1.7 million acres available for harvest but not cut, and we are talking about 15 million acres of rain forest unavailable for logging, 15 million acres for the future generations to study those great old trees and watch them become gray and fall down. We have already done that. Let us vote for this conference report. This is good legislation. Let us support the chairman.                              {time}  1445
