 President, I say to my friend from Arizona, the leader was hoping to schedule a vote at 9:30. You graciously agreed to let it be on this amendment. As to when the debate occurs, we can accommodate the Senator from Arizona on that.  Mr. McCAIN. I ask both the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Vermont, if it is agreeable, I don't need more than 10 minutes. We could start, say, at 9:10 with the amendment, if the leader insists on a vote at 9:30, if that is agreeable.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me suggest we have the vote at 9:45 and start at 9:30.
