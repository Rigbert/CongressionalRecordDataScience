 Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I had intended to offer an amendment, but pending a colloquy with the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis], I will withhold on that amendment.  Mr. Chairman, what the amendment was about was adding $429,000 to the Court of Veterans Appeals. The $429,000 was cut by the committee from the 1995 appropriation level. According to the Chief Justice of the Court of Veterans Appeals, this cut will kill the pro bono legal program for low income veterans, as well as further delay hearings and timely decisions on all claims appealed to the court.  I would like to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis] about his intentions regarding the sum of money.
