 Madam Speaker, it is very hard to find an honest man in life, and I would like to place on the record that David Obey is an honest man and that he served the people of his district admirably all these years. Some have wondered about his contentious nature on occasion, but you'd really have to understand what a ``Badger'' is to know where that all comes from.  He has been a phenomenal husband, as I know his wife agrees, and has been a very, very good father. He has been a friend to all the Members who have served. He has treated us fairly, and his brilliance reflected in his books and in the laws and in the efforts that he has made here over decades and decades simply cannot be replaced. We from the Midwest know what we are losing as he chooses to leave this institution.  I want to thank him for all he has done for the Great Lakes Region, for the people of Ohio, for our country, and for setting a standard, for those who follow, that will be very, very hard to meet and that will probably never be fully met.  I want to thank this great Badger for his years of service to America and helping move liberty forward.  God bless you and your family, Dave.
