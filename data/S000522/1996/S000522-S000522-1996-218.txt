Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, in a major policy speech delivered in Stuttgart, Germany, Secretary of State Christopher presented his vision for the future of a ``New Atlantic Community'' and called for the elaboration of a formal charter between NATO and Russia as an integral aspect of the alliance's process of enlargement. The headstrong determination of the Clinton administration to forge ahead with some form of formal partnership between Russia and NATO should give cause for concern.  I am not convinced that such an initiative--which is fraught with risks--is warranted.  In his address, Secretary Christopher boldly proclaimed that ``a Democratic Russia can participate in the construction of an integrated, Democratic Europe.'' Frankly, Mr. Speaker, Russia's Democratic credentials are not yet firmly established. One need look no further than the killing fields of Chechnya to see the limits of the Kremlin's commitment to genuine democracy. Let us not forget that President Yeltsin signed the decrees, later made public, that launched the large-scale Russian military operations which laid waste to Grozny, leveled scores of towns and villages, led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Russian and Chechen civilians, and resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am particularly disturbed by Secretary Christopher's attempts to gloss over Moscow's campaign of death and destruction in Chechnya. ``Though their [the Russian people's] struggle is far from complete,'' Christopher acknowledged, ``as the 20-month assault on Chechnya demonstrated, the Russian people have rejected a return to the past and vindicated our confidence in democracy.'' In keeping with the tendency of the Clinton administration to turn a blind eye toward Chechnya, the Secretary's remark papers over the Chechnya's negative consequences for democracy in Russia.  Instead of heeding the Kremlin's brutality in Chechnya as a wakeup call of the threat to Russia's fledgling democracy, Secretary Christopher and others in the administration seemed content to push the snooze button and roll over while thousands of innocent men, women, and children were killed and those truly committed to Democratic principles increasingly came under fire for their opposition to Yeltsin's Chechen policy.  Russia must consolidate democracy, human rights, and rule of law at home, Mr. Speaker, before she can ever be considered a credible partner in constructing an integrated, Democratic Europe, envisioned by Mr. Christopher. Welcoming the Russians as full partners in building a new Europe that is free of tyranny, division, and war, as the Secretary has done, is premature at best. A fundamentally new relationship with Russia can only be built on a firm foundation of trust and confidence based on concrete deeds.  Secretary Christopher's smug assertion that no power in Europe now poses a threat to any other belies the fact that Russian missiles, once targeted at the United States, can be reprogrammed within a matter of minutes. His claim is also easier made in Stuttgart than in places like Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, or for that matter, Kiev.  While the United States should continue to encourage cooperation among countries in the Baltic region, Mr. Speaker, it is important to keep in mind that such cooperation cannot substitute for NATO membership.  We cannot ignore that historical relationship between Russia and her neighbors, many of whom have understandable concerns for their sovereignty and independence, given decades of brutal domination and suppression by Moscow. Such apprehension can only be heightened by the current leadership crisis in the Kremlin and by the fact that some Russians yearn for the recreation of their empire. All the while, Russia's neighbors continue to seek normal relations with the Russian Federation based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.  I would remind Mr. Christopher that Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who earlier headed the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, has been one of the chief proponents of the reestablishment of a Russian sphere of influence in the newly independent States of the former Soviet Union, the so-called ``near abroad.''  Should the United States decide to pursue a formal charter between NATO and Russia several key issues must be addressed. First, the Russian Federation must not be given a veto, or implied veto, over the timing or conditions for the admission of new members into the alliance. Second, such an accord must firmly oppose any moves by Moscow to establish ``spheres of influence'' in East Central Europe. Third, the charter must in no way impede the development of enhanced relations between NATO and nonmembers, such as Ukraine.  Mr. Speaker, let us now lose sight of the fact that an essential element of any partnership is, and must be, trust. The reality is that much time is needed to heal the wounds inflicted by the war in Chechnya and establish Moscow's credentials as a trustworthy partner. In the meantime, the single greatest contribution Russia can make to the construction of an integrated and Democratic Europe would be to consolidate democracy, human rights, and rule of law at home.                          ____________________
