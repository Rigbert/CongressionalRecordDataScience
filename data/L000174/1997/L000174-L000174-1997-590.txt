President, on behalf of Senator Jeffords and myself, I commend to the attention of our colleagues Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy's inauguration address before the Vermont House of Representatives on January 31, 1997, and submit thetext to the speech for the Record, as printed in the Times Argus of Barre, VT, on February 1, 1997.  The text of the speech follows:         Inaugural Address of Chief Justice Jeffrey L. Amestoy       Three weeks ago, at the occasion of my nomination for the      position of chief justice, I said I had so many people to      thank I didn't know where to end.       Today the task is even more difficult.       But I still know where to start: Thank you, Governor Dean.       To my ``particular friend,'' Susan Lonergan Amestoy: I      could not have made this journey without you--and it wouldn't      have been as much fun.       To Katherine, Christina, and Nancy Amestoy--for whom this      is the third visit to the State House this month--thank you      for your patience.       I thought the events of the past 30 days might have been      bewildering to our daughters, but Katie Amestoy had it      exactly right when she told a friend on the day of my second      interview with the governor:       ``I can't come over today. My Dad's trying out for Chief      Justice.''       I thank my mother, Dianna Wood Amestoy, for being here      today and for always being there in times of need.       For those of you for whom a desire to impress your parents      is a part of your motivation, I offer the following      cautionary tale.       When I called my mother to tell her of my nomination, she      replied:       ``That's wonderful, I've just been hang gliding in      Montana.''       If I can bring one half of my mother's energy, and one      quarter of her sense of humor to my new responsibilities,      Vermont will be well served.       Thank you (Wisconsin) Attorney General (James) Doyle, and      thank you Attorney General Malley for your generous words.       Present today are colleagues--current and former--from the      National Association of Attorneys General. They, together      with the staff of the Vermont Attorney General's Office, have      not only supported me professionally during the last dozen      years; they have been among my closest friends.       And if it is true, as I believe it to be, that one can be      judged by the friends one treasures, then you will understand      why their being here today means so much to me.       There are also here individuals to whom I cannot ever make      an adequate expression of thanks.       When I became a candidate for public office, the best      advice I ever received was: ``Never pass an old friend to say      hello to a new one.''       Today is special for many reasons, but most of all because      our old friends are here.       Twenty years ago, as a young assistant attorney general, I      spent a Sunday in the law library preparing for an oral      argument the next day before the Vermont Supreme Court.       Then, as now, the law library was next to the court. But in      those days, the doors to the Supreme Court were unlocked      during the weekend.       And so when I finished a long day's preparation, I went      into the empty courtroom and sat in the seat of a Vermont      Supreme Court Justice.       The next morning I appeared before the Court. As chance      would have it, as I began my argument, I was interrupted by      Justice Larrow.       Some here may remember Justice Larrow's reputation as an      incisive interrogator. If you argued before him you will      recall his habit of clearing his throat just before he      reached the most penetrating portion of his inquiry.       ``Mr. Amestoy,'' he began, ``would you please tell this      court what gives you the right * * *'' and at this point, as      Justice Larrow began clearing his throat, I was struck with      the awful realization that it was Justice Larrow's seat I had      sat in the previous afternoon.       For one terrible moment I thought I was going to be asked:      ``What gives you the right to sit in the seat of a justice of      the Vermont Supreme Court?''       There may be some here who have a similar question. If so,      I am grateful to you--as I was to Justice Larrow that day--     for not asking.       I believe, if I meet the standards I have set for myself,      the question will occur to you less often in the future.       I am privileged to join a court comprised of individuals      with whom I have worked and for whom I have great respect.       Justice Johnson and I worked closely together at the Office      of Attorney General, where she was an unexcelled chief of the      Public Protection Division.       I have known Justice Morse since his service as defender      general and his work as one of Vermont's finest trial judges.       Justice Dooley and I worked together when he served as      Governor Kunin's legal counsel and secretary of      administration. More recently, I participated with Justice      Dooley in the court/prosecution program in Karelia. Joining      us in Russia was, among others, Maryland Attorney General      Joseph Curran.       Hence, Attorney General Curran is the only attorney general      in the country that knows both John Dooley and me. It was      that knowledge that led the Maryland attorney general to      offer the observation, when he learned that John and I were      being considered for chief justice, that I was a strong      second choice.       That is an opinion, I know, that is not exclusive to the      state of Maryland.       Justice Gibson, as all who know him would anticipate, has      been extraordinarily generous and helpful to me.       All here know, I am sure, that Justice Gibson's career is      consistent with the unparalleled contributions to public      service by the Gibson family.       What may be less well known is that Justice Gibson plays      first base for the combined court/attorney general softball      team.       As a rookie second baseman, I was saved from several errors      by the sure grasp and long range of first baseman Gibson.       I will rely on that same grasp and range to minimize the      errors of a rookie chief justice.       I also take the liberty today of expressing my gratitude to      former Chief Justice Allen--not just for his courtesies to      me, but for his service to Vermont.       In the 1980s, history linked the chief justice of Vermont      and the attorney general of Vermont more closely than either      one of us would have chosen. Although I do not know all that      occurred during the unhappy years enveloped by the ``judicial      misconduct'' controversy, I know more than all but a few in      this chamber.       It may be that another individual in the position of chief      justice during those troubled years could have struck the      critical balance necessary to keep the court functioning      without sacrificing the integrity of the institution.       But I, for one, am glad that we do not have to test the      hypothetical.       And surely it is difficult, even as a hypothesis, to      imagine another chief justice who could have brought the      court through those difficult days and led the court to a      point where, by every objective measure, it is now more      efficient than at any time in its history.       So today I deliver my first opinion as chief justice. It is      one which I know to be unanimous. It is an opinion which will      be corroborated by the judgment of history:       Frederic Allen was a great chief justice.       Fred Allen's shoes are being ones to fill.       But--I brought my own shoes.       If a span of years in which to serve as chief justice is      granted to me by God and the Legislature (that's an      alphabetical listing, Mr. Speaker!), I shall judge my      success, or lack thereof, against three objectives.       First, and by far the most important: Did I contribute to      the faith of Vermont's citizens in our judicial system, and      to their trust in the character of those entrusted with its      authority?       Second: Did I, as chief appellate judge of Vermont,      contribute to a body of law that clearly and concisely      communicates to litigants, lawyers, and trial judges the      standards to be used to achieve the just and timely      resolution of disputes?       Third: Did I, as chief justice, ensure that the judiciary,      as a separate and co-equal branch of government, has the      resources necessary to fulfill its responsibilities and the      accountability for the use of those resources?       For that work, I will need the help of all, most especially      the judges and staff of the trial courts who honor me with      their presence today.       When it became apparent that I was to assume the duties of      a new position, I received several calls from those most      directly affected by my status.       The callers were cordial but all had the same message,      which may be summarized as follows:       1. I should remember who had trial court experience and who      didn't.       2. I should realize that there were many in their group      that were equally or more qualified than I.       3. I should never forget that, while I might now have the      impressive title, the real work was done in the trenches of      the day-to-day business of the trial courts.       I am referring, of course, to the calls I received from      state's attorneys when I was first elected attorney general!       I trust that my past work will offer some guide to what the      future may hold. In any event, I shall do my best to avoid      the example of the Vermonter who--when asked by his neighbor      if he had an opinion about a controversial issue to be heard      at Town Meeting--replied: ``Not yet. But when I do take a      position, I'm prepared to be bitter!''       I believe in ``civility in public discourse and constancy      in private affection.''       And I believe, with Learned Hand, that ``the spirit of      liberty is the spirit that is not too sure it is right.''       We will need that spirit more than ever to meet the changes      that the new century will surely bring.       Two years ago, I spoke to new citizens at a naturalization      ceremony in Newport, Vermont. The event coincided with the      completion of the debate in the Vermont Legislature over the      proposed resolution relating to the flag burning amendment.       That probably accounted for the fact that the hosts for the      ceremony--the American Legion--were somewhat less      enthusiastic about my presence than when the invitation to      speak was extended.       But whatever one's view of that proposed amendment, it is      remarkable, as I observed then, that upon taking the oath of      citizenship, had one of the new citizens refused to recite      the pledge of allegiance, neither the attorney general of      Vermont, nor the attorney general of the United States, nor      the entire United States government, could have compelled      recitation of the pledge.       Indeed, the judicial system would have protected the new      citizen and provided redress for any attempted compulsion.       But, of course, each of the new citizens recited the pledge      of allegiance of their own     free will and with more meaning than I am accustomed to      hearing.       It is an inherent American trait to look at the courts to      vindicate one's rights. With God's grace, it shall always be      so. But it is neither law nor courts that shall secure our      future.       ``Liberty,'' said Learned Hand, ``lies in the hearts of men      and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no      court can save it; no constitution, no law, no court can even      do much to help it.''       So although I have much to learn about judging, it seems to      me that Curtis Bok was right when he said of his own judicial      experience ``. . . there still remains a mystery . . . that      defies analysis.''       ``Perhaps,'' wrote Judge Bok, ``it would be better to say      that a judge's cases take hold of him and pull things out of      him, and that it is his business to be sure to keep the      proper supplies on hand, so far as he can be the master of      that.''       If ``the proper supplies,'' or at least a portion of them,      are integrity and hard work, compassion and common sense, an      abiding respect for the dignity of the individual and the      value of community--then, to the extent I start today with      those ``supplies,'' it is because of the people in this room      and the Vermont we love.       And it is because of one who is not here, nor ever could be      the seven other times his son took the oath of office in this      historic chamber.       More than four decades ago, a young father took his son to      Hand's Cove on Lake Champlain for a day of duck hunting.       But the father soon understood that of his son a hunter he      could not make.       So he turned the day into a history lesson, for Hand's Cove      is where Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys gathered      before their raid on Fort Ticonderoga in the early morning of      May 1775.       From the father's description of the events sprung a boy's      interest in history and the individuals and ideas that shape      it.       Many years later--when the boy was much older than the      father had been on that day--his interest in law led him to      Learned Hand.       And to the realization, which somehow seemed fitting, that      Hand's Cove was the home of--indeed had been named for--the      Vermont ancestors of the great judge.       Logic tells me that there is no connection in the      coincidence of a place from which sprung the beginning of      this state, and the family of a remarkable jurist, and a      father's gift to his son.       But my heart tells me otherwise.       And I believe in the ``restless wisdom of the heart.''       And I believe, too, in the wisdom of the poet who says to      each of us--a chief justice no less than the child who even      now gazes out a window, perhaps on Leonard Street: ``We see      but what we have the gift of seeing''; to this life, ``What      we bring, we find.''                          ____________________
