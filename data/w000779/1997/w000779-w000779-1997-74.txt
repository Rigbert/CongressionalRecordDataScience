President, today I am introducing legislation with Senator D'Amato to reauthorize the Self-Employment Assistance [SEA] Program. The Self-Employment Assistance Program takes an innovative and cost-effective approach to helping eligible dislocated workers become self-sufficient: It enables them to use their weekly unemployment checks to start their own businesses. The law has helped turn the unemployment safety net into a trampoline of opportunity for thousands of unemployed.  Today, in 38 States the unemployed who wish to start their own businesses are forced to give up their weekly unemployment compensation checks as soon as their company starts generating revenue--but before it provides enough income to support them. It is exactly this problem the Self-Employment Assistance Program is designed to correct. It gives many skilled workers the chance to get back to work faster and helps create new jobs as well.  In a few short years, the Self-Employment Assistance Program (Public Law 103-182; title V) has enabled thousands of unemployed Americans to use their unemployment compensation to establish new businesses. Modeled on experiments in Massachusetts and Washington, self-employment programs can create jobs at no cost to the taxpayer. Using existing funds, the Massachusetts program created dozens of new businesses but actually paid $1,400 less unemployment per worker than the State average. The Washington program created more than 600 new jobs and the firms were paying an average of $10.50 an hour to workers they had hired.  In Oregon, 122 UI claimants enrolled in SEA last year; 76 completed the program. These entrepreneurs are now running an auto repair shop, a marine maintenance and repair shop, distributing cleaning products to resorts and restaurants along the Oregon Coast and setting up a computer cleaning service.  In Grants Pass, OR, one participant said she could not have developed her publication business without SEA. It helped keep her afloat financially while she pursued her self-employment goal. She received counseling from the local Small Business Development Center, and through the Center she was able to contact potential customers.  In Sweet Home, OR, another woman said the SEA program gave her the chance to have an income as she was starting up her day care business. She presently cares for nine children by herself and has plans to increase enrollment and add another teacher and three aides. The Small Business Development Center at Linn-Benton Community College helped her develop herbusiness plan and locate financial resources.  Over the past 3 years, 10 States used the 1993 legislation to create Self-Employment Assistance programs: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island. To date, DoL has approved six States plans (California, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Oregon) and four of these--Delaware, Maine, New York and Oregon--are actually up and running.  Here's how the program works. States are given the flexibility to establish Self-Employment Assistance [SEA] programs as part of their unemployment insurance [UI] programs. It permits States to provide income support payments to the unemployed in the same weekly amount as the worker's regular unemployment insurance [UI] benefits would otherwise be. It permits claimants to work full-time on starting their own business instead of searching for traditional wage and salary jobs.  The law directs the DoL to review and approve State SEA program plans. In States that operate SEA programs, new UI claimants who may be eligible for SEA are identified through worker profiling--automated systems that use a set of criteria to identify those claimants who are likely to exhaust their UI benefits and need reemployment assistance. State SEA program provide participants on a weekly or biweekly basis the same amount as regular UI benefits while they are getting their business off the ground. SEA participants are required to participate in technical assistance programs--entrepreneurial training (accounting, cash flow, finances, taxes, etc), business counseling (business plans, marketing, legal requirements, insurance, etc.), and finance--to ensure they have the skills necessary to operate a business. Finally, SEA programs are required to operate at no additional cost to the unemployment trust fund: the law stipulates that the payment of SEA allowances may not result in any additional benefits charges the unemployment trust fund.  Individuals may choose at any time to opt out of the SEA program; they may resume collection of regular unemployment compensation until the total amount of regular unemployment compensation paid and the SEA paid equals the maximum benefit amount. States, through the title III of the Job Training Partnership Act and Small Business Development Centers, support the costs of providing basic SEA program services, like business counseling and technical assistance, but may allow participants to pay for more intensive counseling and technical assistance.  In effect, the program eliminates a high hurdle for those who have the ingenuity, motivation and energy to start their own businesses. In those States with SEA programs, an unemployed worker no longer has to choose between receiving UI benefits and starting a new business.  Mr. President, as we move into the global economy of the 21st century, we must adopt fresh strategies so that our skilled but unemployed workers can start anew in the private sector. Harvard Business School reported last year that from 1978 to 1996, 22 percent of the workforce, or 3 million workers, at the country's top 100 companies had been laid off, and that 77 percent of all the layoffs involved white collar workers. Many of these highly-skilled and motivated workers want to start their own firms. Congress should not stand in their way. Renewal of the Self-Employment Assistance Program will give those States with programs continued flexibility to help unemployed workers create their own businesses and should encourage those without programs to establish them.  Our bipartisan bill promotes the spirit of entrepreneurship. It carries forward a reasonable and sensible reform of the unemployment insurance system at no cost to the taxpayer.  I would like to thank Senator D'Amato for joining me as an original cosponsor of this bill. New York has a very active and successful Self-Employment Assistance Program, and I look forward to working closely with him to see this important program reauthorized.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 897       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
