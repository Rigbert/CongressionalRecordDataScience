Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I would like to say to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) that I do not think that there is a Member of this institution on either side of the aisle and in either Chamber who is more dedicated and more fervent and more committed to serving the needs of hungry people in our country and in other countries than is the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall).  We have tried very, very hard and done the best that we could to the moment in this bill we are bringing to the floor to deal with the emergency needs across this country in our feeding kitchens. We know that they are there, and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) has made us more aware of these needs. I could not let the moment go by without recognizing him and his dedication to this cause.  On the merits, he is absolutely correct. I know that this is the case in our State of Ohio, with all of the changes made in welfare reform, and I understand the pressures that our chairman was under as we tried to mark and cut and trim and do everything we could to produce a bill that satisfied across the board.  I would say to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) that I will work very hard, as we move toward conference, with him and with our chairman and with the conferees to try to see if we cannot do better than we have done to this point.  One of the changes that we did make in the bill was to provide greater administrative flexibility to the States in the administration of the $135 million that is in the measure for these programs. This should free up some commodities to food banks. It is still not enough, but we would hope that the States and the Governors would pay particular attention to these changes. That does not solve the gentleman's problem, which is the gross amount included for this account. I wanted to give the gentleman an opportunity to expand on his earlier statements, if he wishes at this point.
