President, I thank my friend from Virginia. For over a quarter of a century we have been accommodating each other. I refer to the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia as ``my Senator'' when I am away from home. I have had the privilege of living part time during the year in his beautiful State, and we have tried to accommodate each other. I think this is the easiest way out of it. Otherwise, we would be in a quorum call. I do thank him.                          ____________________
