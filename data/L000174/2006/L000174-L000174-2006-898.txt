Kennedy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 350       Whereas the Bill of Rights to the United States      Constitution was ratified 214 years ago;       Whereas the Fourth Amendment to the United States      Constitution guarantees to the American people the right ``to      be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,      against unreasonable searches and seizures'';       Whereas the Fourth Amendment provides that courts shall      issue ``warrants'' to authorize searches and seizures, based      upon probable cause;       Whereas the United States Supreme Court has consistently      held for nearly 40 years that the monitoring and recording of      private conversations constitutes a ``search and seizure''      within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment;       Whereas Congress was concerned about the United States      Government unconstitutionally spying on Americans in the      1960s and 1970s;       Whereas Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), commonly      referred to as ``FISA'', to provide a legal mechanism for the      United States Government to engage in searches of Americans      in connection with intelligence gathering and      counterintelligence;       Whereas Congress expressly enacted the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act of 1978, and specified provisions of the      Federal criminal code (including those governing wiretaps for      criminal investigations), as the ``exclusive means by which      domestic electronic surveillance . . . may be conducted''      pursuant to law (18 U.S.C. 2511(2)(f));       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978      establishes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      (commonly referred to as the ``FISA court''), and the      procedures by which the United States Government may obtain a      court order authorizing electronic surveillance (commonly      referred to as a ``FISA warrant'') for foreign intelligence      collection in the United States;       Whereas Congress created the FISA court to review      wiretapping applications for domestic electronic surveillance      to be conducted by any Federal agency;       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978      provides specific exceptions that allow the President to      authorize warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign      intelligence purposes (1) in emergency situations, provided      an application for judicial approval from a FISA court is      made within 72 hours; and (2) within 15 calendar days      following a declaration of war by Congress;       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978      makes criminal any electronic surveillance not authorized by      statute;       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978      has been amended over time by Congress since the September      11, 2001, attacks on the United States;       Whereas President George W. Bush has confirmed that his      administration engages in warrantless electronic surveillance      of Americans inside the United States and that he has      authorized such warrantless surveillance more than 30 times      since September 11, 2001; and       Whereas Senate Joint Resolution 23 (107th Congress), as      adopted by the Senate on September 14, 2001, and House Joint      Resolution 64 (107th Congress), as adopted by the House of      Representatives on September 14, 2001, together enacted as      the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-     40), to authorize military action against those responsible      for the attacks on September 11, 2001, do not contain legal      authorization nor approve of domestic electronic      surveillance, including domestic electronic surveillance of      United States citizens, without a judicially approved      warrant: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That Senate Joint Resolution 23 (107th Congress),      as adopted by the Senate on September 14, 2001, and      subsequently enacted as the Authorization for Use of Military      Force (Public Law 107-40) does not authorize warrantless      domestic surveillance of United States citizens.
