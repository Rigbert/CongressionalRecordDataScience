Speaker, I would just say to the gentleman that this particular Member is going to support the gentleman's motion to recommit and then will end the evening by voting against the bill, which I apologize to the subcommittee chair and to the full committee chair. It was not my intention as a loyal member, having gone through all those meetings, to do that. And I would urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on final passage as well, and I feel sad to do that today.
