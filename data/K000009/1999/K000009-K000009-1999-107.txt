Chairman, I say to the gentlewoman that she is correct about the lack of funding for historically black colleges and universities. While the bill contains programmatic funding for these institutions, such as capacity-building grants, we must do more for historically black colleges and universities that can make valuable contributions to agricultural research and really deserve the support of this Nation.  I promise that I will work with the gentlewoman and the chairman, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) of our subcommittee and mycolleagues on the full committee to address this problem as the bill moves through the process and through conference, particularly starting with report language to require the Department to report back to us on what is currently being done, if anything, so we can establish the baseline for the future.
