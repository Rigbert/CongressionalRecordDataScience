Chairman, quite obviously there is a strong feeling among some that OSHA ought to be cut very substantially. In fact, in committee we have had amendments suggesting cuts of 25 percent across the board and higher.  We believe that would be very deleterious to the health and welfare and safety of the workers of America, not to mention to the cost of businesses, which, in my opinion, have been advantaged by lower insurance rates as a result of working with OSHA and its State complementary agencies to make their workplaces safer.  Mr. Chairman, I would hope this amendment would be rejected, because, again, I do not really think, not withstanding the debate, that it is directed at vocational education, lest we would not have had the guts we talked about earlier, but at getting at OSHA and some of the problems that folks believe exist with respect to OSHA.
