Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule for the week to come.  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9:00 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday, no votes are expected in the House.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today.  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act, sponsored by Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers. This bill will continue our efforts to improve America's energy infrastructure by streamlining the FERC licensing process for hydropower projects.  The House will also consider two good jobs bills: first, H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act, sponsored by Representative Bradley Byrne. This bipartisan legislation will ensure small businesses and franchises across America receive fair government treatment rather than confusing regulations that harm workers.  Second, the House will consider H.R. 2201, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, sponsored by Representative Tom Emmer. As part of our Innovation Initiative, this bill creates a smarter way for entrepreneurs to start new ventures or grow existing businesses.  Now, lastly, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the House. If anything is added to our schedule, I will be sure to inform my friend and all Members.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.
