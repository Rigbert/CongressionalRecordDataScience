President, for offering an amendment, it would require, of course, unanimous consent. I have not included, just because it gets too complicated--that is why I wanted to work out with the distinguished chairman when such amendments might be offered. It would allow Senators to speak, but any Senator speaking, if they wanted to offer an amendment, would still require unanimous consent then. Rather than trying to micromanage this all the way down the line, I will let each Senator make that request.
