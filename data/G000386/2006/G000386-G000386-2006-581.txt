 President, the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate about the concerns regarding the problems encountered in implementing the new drug benefit. It expresses the Senate's support for the administration's efforts to fix them. These efforts have proven to be much speedier in getting the problems fixed, and fixed fast, than any legislation can do. To that point, one amendment offered yesterday has provisions that are completely unnecessary because administrative actions have already taken care of it. I see no point in legislating for the sake of legislating.  Moreover, legislative action on top of administration action will undermine and complicate progress to date.  I urge my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.
