President, before he leaves the floor, we have seen with Chairman Kennedy over the last 2 minutes why he is so admired by Senators on both sides of the aisle. We have seen how he has engineered critically important bipartisan legislation that helps our working families in the education area. We have heard him speak eloquently about fallen firefighters. We admire them so tremendously in Boston and across the country. Of course,once again, when we think of Senator Warner--I will have more to say about him in the days ahead--Senator Kennedy has spoken for all of us this morning as he talked about how much we value Senator Warner's counseled insight. I want him to know how much I appreciate his leadership and how much I value his counsel in the Senate.
