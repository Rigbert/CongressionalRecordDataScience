 Speaker, I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.                        Regarding School Choice      (By Kristy Lamb, Peter Hicks, Halie Paradee, and Nick Smith)       Kristy Lamb: School choice is an issue that our Vermont      legislature is currently voting on. What we are here to      discuss is how choice within school is as important as choice      between schools, and its importance on all levels.       A school is made up of both faculty and students. As a part      of that school, students should be allowed to help in the      process of making decisions that affect us. Choices are made      every day about scheduling, open campus, and many other      things, but hardly ever are the students asked what they want      and how they feel. It seems as if no one thinks our opinions      are valid. But it is our education, it is our learning      environment, so we should have a choice.       Peter Hicks: With this, we would like to have the statewide      student body count as one vote in Vermont in the House of      Representative.       Halie Paradee: And we would also like the student body to      count as one vote in the local decision-making. And students      should receive credits for hours on incentives for any      involvement in the specific process, like being here today,      we should be recognized for it by our school.       Nick Smith: I'm discussing another section of education      reform. High school students across the state and nation have      a serious lack of interest in interest and stamina in high      school that has encouraged a serious look at education      reform.       The average day of a high school student about is about      seven hours long. This can be broken down into three parts:      Six hours and 45 minutes of sitting, sometimes sleeping; 13      minutes of moving; and 2 minutes of actual decision-making.      We are all familiar with the reading of boring books, reading      the seemingly useless notes, hand cramps, headaches, and      overall lack of stamina contribute to the long school day.       No matter how many hours of sleep the night before, a day      like this is still tiring. What is the use of education if      the student is not awake? One may go to school with a      determined attitude to learn, but soon the constant work      causes them to give in and see school as a tedious chore.       Opponents to the idea of recess will argue that free time      will encourage tardiness, illegal behaviors, or longer days.      But this isn't necessarily so. The proposed recess would      consist of a small break, maybe 15 minutes in length, in      which students could be somewhat free and active for one time      in their day. This activity would result in the      revitalization of energy, creating a higher interest in the      boring books and a higher stamina to take the seemingly      useless notes. These measures will reduce the headaches and      increase the effectiveness of education.       Students are often told the high school is preparing us for      today's society. The President of UVM informed us this      morning that choices are an important part of today's      society. But how with can he prepare for reality if we're not      given the chance to make choices for ourselves. How can the      leaders of the group define themselves? How can we solve the      rising problem of lower test scores and higher dropout rates?      We can do it with a small reform reaping large benefits. We      can do it with a 15-minute recess.                  Regarding Genetically Modified Foods                            (By Travis Buck)       TRAVIS BUCK: I am going to talk about genetically modified      foods, and also their organisms.       Let's start out with a definition of what genetically      modified organisms are, to make sure everyone knows what I'm      talking about. They're plants that have been modified by      inserting genes of another organism that's been engineered to      change that original plant in some way.       GMOs are quite dangerous to the environment and peoples'      health, and also to the rural economy of Vermont and other      states. GMO studies have shown that they damage good insects      that help plants grow, and create produce, and they also      pollute the ground and transport genetic pollution to other      plants around the area. And they create superweeds, and      superweeds can't be killed by conventional chemicals, so you      have this breed of plants that are taking over the crops.       And in human health, there are many risks, such as allergic      reactions that are increased, and resistance to antibiotics.      And antibiotics are--it's been a lot of genetically      engineered plants and chemicals used in antibiotics, and      people aren't as resistant to them. And there has also been      some studies that proved that growth and internal organs of      humans have been damaged due to the intake of genetically      engineered products.       With GMO seeds, which are the main concern, it increases      the cost of farming the seeds will be more expensive. And the      seeds are going to make more food, but in the end, that will      decrease the price of the produce, so the farmer can't make      as much money, putting him or her in a hardship.       Other countries, many other countries, like Europe and      Asia, look to the United States for the effects of      genetically modified foods, and we have been sort of an      experimental subject, without our consent, which is illegal      and hasn't really been looked as an issue.       Many markets for the U.S. farmers have decreased      significantly from the use of GMO products. The markets in      Europe and Asia reject these products, seeing what has      happened in the United States, and from their studies, they      found they have harmful effects.       And another issue is, many people have said, or many      companies say we need to, or the GMOs will help stop world      hunger all over, and that is actually incorrect. Right at      this point, we are producing more food per person than ever      before, and all we need to do is make the food more      accessible to the people that need the food, rather than      trying to create more food, and wrongly use--create more food      with genetically engineered products. It is not going to help      anyone; it is just going to hurt the environment.       And a metaphor similar to this is that the Pandora's box      has been opened, and now all these genetically engineered      products and foods and organisms have leaped out, and out      there to do bad, in most cases. And it is very hard to put it      back into the box. And if we would have waited many years and      done studies to learn more about what the effects could be,      it would be better, and we could bring the genetically      modified foods out into the community with more knowledge,      and it would help the community more than bringing them out      so early, at this point.                               ____________________
