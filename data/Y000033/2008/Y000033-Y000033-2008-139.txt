Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce today the Marine Mammal Cooperative Agreements in Alaska Amendments of 2008.  The 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act created section 119 of the Act, titled ``Marine Mammal Cooperative Agreements in Alaska,'' which allows the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations. These cooperative agreements have been very successful in creating statewide and regional Alaska Native Marine Mammal Commissions protecting species such as the polar bear, walrus, sea otters, beluga whale, harbor and ice seals, and Steller sea lions. The cooperative agreements have provided grants to Alaska Native Marine Mammal Commissions to conduct important marine mammal data collection efforts, marine mammal research, and monitor subsistence activities.  Alaska Natives have been excellent stewards of Alaska's natural resources for centuries. The Alaska Native Marine Mammal Commissions have continued this tradition by working cooperatively with the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to successfully manage the species under their respective jurisdictions. In order to further this success, the Commissions have advocated for management of subsistence activities. Section 119 of the MMPA does not currently allow for management of subsistence activities prior to a depletion finding under the Act.  In 2000, the Clinton Administration sent Congress a draft bill to reauthorize the MMPA and included in it authorities for the Alaska Marine Mammal Commissions to manage and enforce subsistence activities. The Bush Administration followed suit including similar language in its own draft bill to reauthorize the MMPA.  I have not taken the exact approach of the Clinton and Bush proposals, however, I do believe this legislation will achieve the same result. I have worked with the administration, the Alaska Native Marine Mammal Commissions, and State of Alaska representatives to develop a bill that allows for management prior to a depletion finding under the MMPA.  The Whaling Convention Act of 1949, which governs the Bowhead whale subsistence activities, and the more recently passed legislation implementing the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Treaty, governing the subsistence take of polar bears, are two excellent examples of legislation Congress passed to authorize marine mammal management activities.  This legislation will further refine the cooperative management process under the MMPA to ensure that Alaska Natives and the Federal agencies with marine mammal management authority have the tools they need to continue their successful management efforts.  I urge my colleagues to support this important conservation legislation.                          ____________________
