Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, it is the intent of the chairman of the committee to divide time based upon requests that are made by Republican Members on this side. I have no idea how time on the Democratic side will be divided, since I would assume that the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the subcommittee, will be recognized for 20 minutes to manage the time on the Democratic side.
