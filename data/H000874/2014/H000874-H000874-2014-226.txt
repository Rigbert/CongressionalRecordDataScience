Speaker, the Anacostia Watershed Society, a nonprofit organization based in Maryland and Washington, DC tasked with restoring the Anacostia River for the health and enjoyment of its watershed communities, is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. Since its founding, it has been cleaning the water, recovering the shores, and honoring the heritage of the Anacostia River for the benefit of all who live in its watershed and for visitors.  Founded in 1989 by Robert Boone, the Anacostia Watershed Society overcame early challenges as it sought to raise awareness of the deteriorating health of the river and its watershed after nearly two hundred years of urban settlement and industrial activity. Mr. Boone worked with local activists and attorneys to take steps to turn the situation around by working to relocate plans to build a new football stadium away from the river, to stop the Navy Yard from dumping toxic waste into the water, and to end the flow of sewage into the river--a project that will be completed in 2022 with the opening of underground tunnels built to capture and treat sewage overflows.  During this time, Mr. Boone and program manager Jim Connolly were also working to raise consciousness in the local community about the river. Mr. Boone and Mr. Connolly hosted trash clean-ups, tree plantings, and numerous public events to get Marylanders and Washingtonians engaged with the river and to promote it as a source of outdoor recreation. The programs and events they developed in the early days of the Anacostia Watershed Society set the stage for the many important activities the organization undertakes today.  Over the next twenty-five years, the Anacostia Watershed Society grew to become a powerful advocate for the river, its watershed, and the communities it benefits. The organization has expanded to include four departments essential to its success: Stewardship, Education, Advocacy, and Recreation. The Anacostia Watershed Society engages local residents of all ages in the cleanup and restoration of the river while involving the community in advocating for policies to reduce and regulate the pollutants entering its waters.  I have been proud to serve as an advocate for the Anacostia and its watershed throughout my time in Congress. My first association with the Anacostia Watershed Society was as a cosponsor of an Earth Day boat tour of the river, aimed at gaining attention in Congress for the Society's advocacy efforts. Later, I was proud to work in Congress to promote policies authorizing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help restore the Anacostia. Throughout my involvement with the Anacostia Watershed Society, I have met many engaged and energized local activists who are deeply concerned about the future not only of the river but of our region as a sustainable place to raise healthy families.  The Anacostia Watershed Society's vision for the future includes a river that is fishable and swimmable--as per the Clean Water Act--and serves as an urban oasis and destination for those in Maryland, Washington, DC, and visitors from around the country. I congratulate its members on twenty-five years of service to the communities of our region, and I look forward to continue to work with them to advance the Society's mission for many years to come.                          ____________________
