President, this bipartisan amendment would provide $20 billion in much needed fiscal aid to the States. Forty-nine States are struggling with budget deficits. This won't relieve them of the obligation to make painful budget choices, but it will recognize the difficult financial strains under which they are operating.  Half of the money would go for an increase in the FMAP rate under Medicaid. The other half would be used for a flexible grant program that would be allocated between the States and localities.  I yield the remainder of my time in favor of the amendment to the Senator from Nevada, if he wishes to speak.
