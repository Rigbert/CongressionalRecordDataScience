Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the communityof Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Don Harriger, General Manager of the Western Municipal Water District is one of these individuals. On Wednesday, January 28, 2004, he will be honored at a special retirement dinner.  Don was appointed General Manager in 1989, and has been responsible for the planning, direction, management, and overall supervision of the activities and operations of the District.  Prior to his appointment as General Manager, Don served the District as Assistant General Manager. In that previous position, he was appointed by the court to two Watermaster Committees, appointments he currently still holds. The Western-San Bernardino and the Santa Ana River Watermaster Committees were established as part of the 1969 Stipulated Judgments that settled the massive water rights issues in the Santa Ana Watershed. In June of 2003, Don was elected chairperson of the Santa Ana River Watermaster Committee.  Before joining Western, Don was Chief Engineer and Assistant Manager of the Santa Ana Watershed Planning Agency, the forerunner of the present-day Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority (SAWPA), a joint powers agency responsible for regional water resources planning and project implementation. At SAWPA, he was primarily responsible for the technical direction of the development of the Santa Ana Watershed Basin Plan. Prior to his position at SAWPA, Don was associate engineer with the State of California, Department of Water Resources.  A California registered professional engineer, Don received his Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois and his Master of Science Degree from California State University Sacramento. He and his wife Arvina reside in Riverside.  Don's leadership at the Western Municipal Water District has contributed immensely to the betterment of the District and the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Don a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
