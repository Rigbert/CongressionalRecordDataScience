President, as I stand here today, we are hours away from beginning a month long recess and we have yet to reauthorize a critically important piece of legislation that protects our nation's youth. It has been over two months since both the House and Senate have passed S. 249, The Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act, and we have still not voted on final passage.  There is no good excuse for why the Senate has not passed and sent to the President this noncontroversial piece of legislation. I had some minor concerns with the House amended version of S. 249, but after receiving some clarification and assurances on these concerns, I decided that these House add-on could be dealt with at later time and should not keep this important piece of legislation from passing. I have cleared the differences on our side of the aisle, but I am afraid I cannot say the same for my colleagues on the other side who continue to hold up final passage of this bill.  The Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 reauthorizes programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and authorizes funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Both programs are critical to out nation's youth and to our nation's well-being.  In addition to providing shelter for children in need, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act ensures that these children and their families have access to important services, such as individual, family or group counseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources to help these young people and their families get back on track. As the National Network for Youth as stressed, the Act's programs ``provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the country.''  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provide extremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families facing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the National Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 missing children. The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and law enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which provides free services to parents in search of their children and have also developed extensive training programs.  S. 249 should be passed today. There is absolutely no reason to stall on this legislation, but as we get down to the wire to begin August recess, it looks like we will once again face another delay. We will return to our states and to our constituents who run these crucial programs and we will be unable to tell them that we have protected the programs that allow them to ensure children and families access to their services by reauthorizing the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. I am frustrated once again at the inaction of the Republican majority on this matter and believe that The Missing Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act should be passed immediately.                          ____________________
