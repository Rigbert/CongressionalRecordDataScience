For example, if someone gets into long-term cancer therapy that is going to be very expensive over a long period and the insurance company decides halfway through they will cut them off, we now protect people so that they can continue to get the care they need. They can't be limited.  Isn't it also true that the effort of the Senator from Wyoming would protect the right of the insurance companies to literally cancel one's policy because of an error made in the application for the policy, to rescind the policy?  I might add, it is my understanding that this rescission is abused in my State more than any other in the Nation. The rescission rate on health insurance in Illinois is three times the national average. We have had over 5,000 people who have had their health insurance canceled. When they went to the company and said: I am facing surgery, I am facing cancer therapy, and I need coverage and want to make sure I have it, they ended up getting their policies canceled.  I ask the Senator, would the effort by the Senator from Wyoming take away these protections we are now building into the law to make sure health insurance is there when people need it the most?
