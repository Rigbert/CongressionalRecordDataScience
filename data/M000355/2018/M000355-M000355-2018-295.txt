 President, on an entirely different matter, this is an exciting week for the Senate. For one thing, we are beginning to welcome several new Members to our ranks. They may not be sworn in until January, but these new Senators-elect are already arriving in town for orientation events and to vote in their party's leadership elections.  I know I speak for all of my colleagues in issuing each of our future colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, our hearty congratulations and a warm welcome. We are looking forward to working with all of these new colleagues.                          ____________________
