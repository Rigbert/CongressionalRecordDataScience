President, for the information of colleagues, I do not intend to use all that time. At some point, I am going to yield back a considerable amount of time. I know there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who have commitments tonight, some connected with the debates of the two parties' Presidential nominees. It is my hope we will be voting fairly early this afternoon--a vote on the Thompson point of order and final passage.  I yield such time as the Senator from Massachusetts needs, and I ask unanimous consent that I then be able to yield to the Senator from California.
