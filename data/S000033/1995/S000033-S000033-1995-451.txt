 Speaker, I submit the following article for the Congressional Record:              (From the Christian Science Monitor, June 1, 1995)The Average American Has Reason To Be Angry--Low Pay, Long Hours, and a                    Widening Gap Between Rich and Poor                          (By Bernard Sanders)       It has recently been widely reported that the average      American is angry. Well, the average American should be      angry.       Since 1973, the working people of this country have worked      longer hours, earned less, and lost much of the economic      security they previously had. During the last 22 years, 80      percent of American families have experienced falling or      stagnant real incomes. Meanwhile, average Americans are      experiencing a major drop in their standard of living, while      the rich and powerful have never had it so good.      [[Page E1184]]        New statistical studies show that the wealthiest 1 percent      of the population own nearly 40 percent of the wealth of this      country, more than the bottom 90 percent. That is the      greatest concentration of wealth in the industrialized world      and, most significantly, it is a trend accelerating faster      here than anywhere else.       In 1959, the richest 4 percent of American families earned      as much income as the bottom 35 percent. By 1989, that top 4      percent earned as much as the bottom 51 percent. In 1980, the      average pay for a chief executive officer of a major      corporation was 42 times as high as that of a factory worker.      Today, the CEO earns 149 times as much.       Meanwhile, while profits soar and CEOs reap huge salary      increases, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has      declined by 26 percent over the last 20 years. Many of the      new jobs being created are low-wage, part-time, or temporary,      without benefits. As major corporations continue to      ``downsize,'' the number of temporary jobs in America has      exploded form 962,300 in 1987 to 1,657,700 in 1993.       Tens of millions of American workers are experiencing      extraordinary financial insecurity and pressure. Will they      have their jobs tomorrow, or is the owner moving the company      to China where he can get workers for 20 cents an hour? Will      their limited health-care benefits be cut even further? Will      they ever collect on the pension plan they've been promised?       From 1988 to 1993, worker productivity in the private      sector increased by 5.9 percent. Average hourly earnings,      however, declined by 4 percent. By 1993, the typical family      had lost $1,400 of the buying power it had in 1991. People      are working longer, harder, and more productively--and      they're becoming poorer. Should the average American be      angry?       Given the crisis facing the American middle class, what has      the new Republican-controlled Congress been doing to address      our nation's underlying economic problems?                                  jobs       There is nothing in the ``Contract With America'' to      address our $160 billion trade deficit, the decline of our      manufacturing base, and the loss of missions of decent-paying      manufacturing jobs. How do we get corporate America to      reinvest in this country, rather than in cheap, unprotected      labor abroad? This is apparently not a subject of much      interest to the Republicans, who have recently received huge      amounts of corporate campaign contributions.                       declining living standards       At a time when the rich are getting richer and the middle      class and the poor are getting poorer, the Republicans have      adopted a series of bills to cut benefits drastically for      working people and the poor-making life more difficult for      those already hurting the most. The Republicans are proposing      major cuts in child nutrition, fuel assistance, education,      affordable housing, Medicare, Medicaid, and college financial      aid.                                tax cuts       Fifty percent of the individual tax breaks passed by the      Republican House will go to people making a $100,000 a year,      and the upper 1 percent will get more in tax breaks than the      bottom 60 percent. For the lower middle class, there will be      virtually no tax reductions at all.       Should the average American worker be angry?       If we are to turn this country around and create an economy      that provides well for all the people, and not just the rich,      we must focus on the real causes of our problems--and demand      real solutions.       Most importantly, we must have the courage to take on the      big money interests who--through their control of the      economy, the political parties, and the media--make most of      the decisions that affect our lives now and those of our      children, too.                               ____________________
