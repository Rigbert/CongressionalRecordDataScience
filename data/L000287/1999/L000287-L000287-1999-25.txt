Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax bill is a ``do-nothing'' bill. It does nothing to protect Social Security, nothing to strengthen Medicare, nothing to reduce our national debt, and next to nothing to help working Americans.  Mr. Darrell Stinchcomb is a fifth grade teacher in the Atlanta public school system. Darrell loves to teach and works hard to educate the next generation. In return, he earns $32,000 a year. Unfortunately, this Republican tax bill does almost nothing to help working Americans like Darrell. Under the Republican plan, Darrell would get a tax cut of just $20 a month, $240 a year. Yet a person earning $200,000 a year or more would get a tax break of over $9,000. $240 for working people like Darrell, $9,000 for the richest people in America. That is not right. That is not fair. That is not just. It is a shame and a disgrace.  Most working Americans will receive little or nothing under the Republican tax bill. It does nothing, not one thing, to protect Social Security and Medicare. Nothing, but nothing, to reduce the national debt. A thousand for the rich, pocket change for working Americans. That is the Republican tax bill.  Mr. Speaker, when I was growing up in rural Alabama, I was responsible for raising the chickens. The first lesson I learned was never, ever to count your chickens before they hatch. This Republican tax bill spends billions of dollars before we have it in the bank. It is a mistake. It is irresponsible. It is not the right thing to do.  We finally have an opportunity to protect the future of Social Security and Medicare, not just for ourselves and our parents but for future generations. The Republican tax bill is a step in the wrong direction. It is a step backward. I urge my colleagues to defeat this irresponsible bill.
