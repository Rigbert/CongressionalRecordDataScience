 It is time to get the job done.  From the beginning of this debate, I had aimed to give Senators a chance to advance bipartisan compromise legislation through the regular order. That is why I offered extension proposals that sought to create the space needed to do that. But as we all know, by now, every effort to temporarily extend important counterterrorism tools--even noncontroversial ones--was either voted down or objected to.  So here is where we are. We find ourselves in a circumstance where important tools have already lapsed. We need to work quickly to remedy this situation. Everyone has had ample opportunity to say their piece at this point. Now is the time for action.  That is why, in just a moment, I will ask for unanimous consent to allow the Senate to consider cloture on the House-passed FISA bill, along with amendments to improve it, today--not tomorrow but today.  There is no point in letting another day lapse when the endgame is clear to absolutely everyone--we know how this is going to end--when we have seen such a robust debate already, a big debate, not only in the Senate but across the country, and when the need to act expeditiously could not be more apparent.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the pending cloture motion on H.R. 2048, the U.S. FREEDOM Act, and that if cloture is invoked, that all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the pending amendments under the regular order; that upon disposition of the amendments, the bill be read a third time, as amended, if amended, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.
