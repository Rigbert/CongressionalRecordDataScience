Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3662, the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. I would like to thank Chairman Regula and Representative Yates for their work, which has been all the more difficult because of misguided Republican budget priorities.  I realize that this measure has many serious shortcomings. H.R. 3662 makes excessive cuts in important energy initiatives. In addition, the bill's allocation for our national parks falls short of meeting the increasing demand for visitor services, park maintenance, and resource protection. I am disappointed that the Republican majority created these problems by insisting on budget plans that fail to recognize the importance of our parks.  However, this debate has substantially improved this legislation. By approving the Dicks amendment, the House preserved the integrity of the Endangered Species Act. By adopting the Sanders amendment, the House restored needed funds for the low-income home weatherization program, which conserves energy and provides vital assistance to low-income Americans.  Furthermore, this measure helps to preserve a vital part of our Nation's heritage. H.R. 3662 renews the Federal commitment to the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, the birthplace of the American industrial revolution. Drawing on the hard work and ingenuity of the region's people, this affiliated area of the National Park System is a model partnership between the private and public sectors that deserves our strong support.  I take pride in the great strides that we are making in the Blackstone Valley, and I willvote to preserve the Federal commitment to these endeavors. I look forward to working with Chairman Regula, Representative Yates, and our colleagues in the Senate to ensure that the final version of this legislation more effectively protects all of our Nation's environmental resources.
