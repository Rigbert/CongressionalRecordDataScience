 President, could I just say, at the risk of being redundant--and I do not want to get intoa spirited debate with my friend and colleague over this--the facts are we were just handed a 100-page Lautenberg amendment about an hour ago. I have 39 Members here, all interested in that issue. It is simply impossible for me to clear voting on an amendment of 100 pages in duration that I just got an hour ago.  The reason I had suggested--and I was hopeful that maybe it would be a good way forward--we vote on the Crapo amendment, which everybody understands has been out there since Tuesday, and a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is fairly brief, I assume--a very brief sense of the Senate that Senator Baucus was going to offer--is because both sides fully understand those two measures. They are not 100 pages long and enormously complicated. We did not just receive them.  So I do not want to get into an extensive back and forth with the majority leader, but I would say to him through the Chair, sincerely, it strikes me a good way to just get started would be to vote on these two issues, the Crapo motion and the Baucus amendment that both sides fully understand.
