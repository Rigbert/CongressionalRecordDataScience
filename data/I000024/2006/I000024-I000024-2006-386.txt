President, I think it is very appropriate the Senator asks that question. We have had a chance to discuss that at some length with a large number of people, and I have stood pretty fast to my belief. Now, keep in mind I am one of the few people around here who is not a lawyer, and therefore sometimes that puts me in a better position to understand the law than some of my lawyer friends. But I would say that when we write down, ``unless otherwise authorized or provided by law, no person has a right, entitlement, claim,'' et cetera, in the bill, which is the form of the bill that you have seen and that we have all been working on, so my feeling is that language takes care of any problem within the existing law that is on the books.
