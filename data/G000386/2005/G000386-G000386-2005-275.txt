 President, before Senator Baucus and I give our opening statements, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina for a statement on another subject, and then I presume the Senator from New York wants to follow him for 5 minutes. So there will be 10 minutes beforewe start this bill, but the 10 minutes is off the 20 hours allotted to this bill.
