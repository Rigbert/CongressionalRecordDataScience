I urge the House of Representatives to consider this important piece of legislation honoring Mr. Paderewski, Polish-Americans and the Polish people.                               H. Res. 58       Whereas Ignacy Jan Paderewski, born in Poland in 1860, was      a brilliant and popular pianist who performed hundreds of      concerts in Europe and the United States during the late 19th      and early 20th centuries;       Whereas Paderewski often donated the proceeds of his      concerts to charitable causes;       Whereas, during World War I, Paderewski worked for the      independence of Poland and served as the first Premier of      Poland;       Whereas in December 1919, Paderewski resigned as Premier of      Poland, and in 1921 he left politics to return to his music;       Whereas the German invasion of Poland in 1939 spurred      Paderewski to return to political life;       Whereas Paderewski fought against the Nazi dictatorship in      World War II by joining the exiled Polish Government to      mobilize the Polish forces and to urge the United States to      join the Allied Forces;       Whereas Paderewski died in exile in America on June 29,      1941, while war and occupation imperiled all of Europe;       Whereas by the direction of United States President      Franklin D. Roosevelt, Paderewski's remains were placed along      side America's honored dead in Arlington National Cemetery,      where President Roosevelt said, ``He may lie there until      Poland is free.'';       Whereas in 1963, United States President John F. Kennedy      honored Paderewski by placing a plaque marking Paderewski's      remains at the Mast of the Maine at Arlington National      Cemetery;       Whereas in 1992, United States President George H.W. Bush,      at the request of Lech Walesa, the first democratically      elected President of Poland following World War II, ordered      Paderewski's remains returned to his native Poland;       Whereas on June 26, 1992, the remains of Paderewski were      removed from the Mast of the Maine at Arlington National      Cemetery, and were returned to Poland on June 29, 1992;       ``Whereas on July 5, 1992, Paderewski's remains were      interred in a crypt at the St. John Cathedral in Warsaw,      Poland; and       Whereas Paderewski wished his heart to be forever enshrined      in America, where his lifelong struggle for democracy and      freedom had its roots and was cultivated, and now his heart      remains at the Shrine of the Czestochowa in Doylestown,      Pennsylvania: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes the accomplishments of Ignacy Jan Paderewski      as a musician, composer, statesman, and philanthropist; and       (2) acknowledges the invaluable efforts of Ignacy Jan      Paderewski in forging close Polish-American ties, on the 11th      Anniversary of the return of Paderewski's remains to Poland.                          ____________________
