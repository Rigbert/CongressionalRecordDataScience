President, Loretta Lynch is an historic nominee. What I worry about is this body is making history for the wrong reasons. Senate Republicans have filibustered her. She becomes the first out of 82 Attorneys General in our Nation's history to face a filibuster.  On one hand she is an historic nominee for the right reason; the first African-American woman for Attorney General, a woman who is highly, highly qualified. Everybody agrees with that. But what a shame that we have the second part of history, to have her be the first out of 82 Attorneys General to be filibustered--to be held to this very disturbing double standard. This woman has had to face double standards all her life--why one more? I will proudly vote for her.  I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time.
