Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring to the floor H.R. 2822, the fiscal year 2016 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.  As we begin, I want to personally thank Chairman Rogers for his leadership and support. Under his guidance, the Committee on Appropriations is again setting the standard for getting things done in the House. The Interior bill is the seventh appropriation bill to come to the floor so far this year.  I also want to thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), my good friend and ranking member, for her partnership and work on this bill.  Finally, I want to thank each of our subcommittee members for their efforts and the collegiality that continues to be the hallmark of our subcommittee's deliberations. Even though we may have differences of opinion within this bill, I greatly appreciate the Members' constructive contribution, and I mean that sincerely.  The committee has made very difficult choices preparing this bill. As reported by the Committee on Appropriations, the fiscal year 2016 Interior and Environment bill is funded at $30.17 billion, which is $246 million below the fiscal year 2015-enacted level and $3 billion below the budget request. We have made a sincere effort to prioritize needs within our 302(b) allocation. I would like to point out a few of the highlights.  Again, this year, the committee has provided robust wildland fire funding. Fire suppression accounts at the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service are fully funded at the 10-year average level. The hazardous fuels program was increased by $75 million to $526 million in the fiscal year 2015-enacted bill, and that increase has been maintained in this bill.  This bill also continues critical investments in Indian Country, a nonpartisan priority of the committee. Building upon the bipartisan work of the former subcommittee chairmen Mike Simpson, Jim Moran, and Norm Dicks, this bill continues to make investments in education, public safety, and health programs in Indian Country.  Overall, funding for the Indian Health Service is increased by $145 million, or 3 percent, while funding for the Bureaus of Indian Affairs and Education is increased by $165 million, or 6 percent, from fiscal year 2015 levels, the largest percentage increase in this bill.  This bill provides full funding in fiscal year 2016 for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes, or PILT, payments. PILT payments are made to 49 of the 50 States as well as to the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  The bill provides $2.7 billion for the National Park Service, including more than $60 million in new funding, relating to the centennial of the Park Service.  We have also addressed a number of priorities within the Fish and Wildlife Service accounts. The bill funds popular cost-shared grant programs above the fiscal year 2015-enacted levels. It also provides additional funds to combat international wildlife trafficking, protects fish hatcheries from cuts and closures, continues funding to fight invasive species, and reduces the backlog of species that are recovered but not yet de-listed.  The bill provides $248 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, programs that enjoy broad support--bipartisan support, for that matter. Some Members would prefer more funding; others would prefer less for LWCF. We have attempted to forge a middle ground that begins to return the emphasis of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to its original intent of recreation and State and local acquisitions.  Overall, funding for EPA is reduced by $718 million, or 9 percent, from fiscal year 2015-enacted levels. Members from the Great Lakes region will be pleased to know that the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is maintained at the fiscal year 2015-enacted level of $300 million. Rural water technical assistance grants and many categorical grants, including radon grants, are level funded at the fiscal year 2015 enacted level.  Again this year, there is a great deal of concern over the number of regulatory actions being pursued by the EPA in the absence of legislation and without clear congressional direction. For this reason, the bill includes a number of provisions to stop unnecessary and damaging regulatory overreach by the Agency.  Before closing, I would like to address the Endangered Species Act provisions in this bill. We have no interest in interfering with science or letting any species go extinct, but we are concerned about Federal regulatory actions lacking in basic fairness and common sense. The provisions in this bill address problems created by an ESA driven not by science, but by court orders that drain limited Agency resources and force the Department to cut corners to meet arbitrary deadlines. Nowhere is this more evident than with the sage-grouse.                              {time}  1300  States are rightfully concerned that a listing or unnecessarily restrictive Federal land use plans will jeopardize existing conservation partnerships with States and private landowners. These partnerships are necessary to save both the sagebrush ecosystem and local economies.  So long as sage-grouse are not under imminent threat of extinction, cooperative conservation must be given a chance to work. That is why this bill maintains a 1-year delay on any decision to list sage-grouse along with full funding to implement conservation efforts.  House consideration of this bill is the next step in a long legislative process. I hope over the coming months we will come together, as we do each year, to find common ground. In that spirit, I look forward to continuing to work with Ms. McCollum and the Members of the House on both sides of the aisle.  In closing, I want to thank the staff on both sides for their hard work on this bill. On the minority side, I would like to thank Rick Healy, Rita Culp, Joe Carlile, as well as Rebecca Taylor. They have played an integral role in the process, and their efforts are very much appreciated.  On the majority side, I would like to thank subcommittee staff Kristin Richmond, Jackie Kilroy, Betsy Bina, Jason Gray, Darren Benjamin, and Dave LesStrang. I would also like to thank Ian Foley, Rebecca Keightley, Alexandra Berenter, and Tricia Evans on my personal staff for their great work.  Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill. It deserves the support of the Members of this body.  I reserve the balance of my time.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.001[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.002[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.003[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.004[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.005[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.006[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.007[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.008[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.009[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.010[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.011[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.012[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.013[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.014[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.015[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.016[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.017[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.018[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.019[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.020[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.021[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH25JN15.022  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First, I would like to acknowledge and thank Ranking Member Lowey for her support and her mentorship as I start working on this very first appropriations bill on the House floor.  I would like to thank my subcommittee chairman, Ken Calvert, for the effort he has put into this bill. I appreciate that even as Chairman Calvert grappled with an inadequate funding allocation, he carried out his work in an open and thoughtful manner. The chairman is to be commended for his diligence in holding 14 budget hearings, where we received testimony from nearly 150 witnesses.  Let me also, along with the chairman, express my appreciation to the subcommittee staff on the minority and majority sides for their hard work during another difficult budget year.  Unfortunately, the inadequate 302(b) allocation given to the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations sets this bill up for failure. The majority's refusal to adopt a sufficient overall budget allocation for discretionary appropriations has led to a bill that severely underfunds investments and protections that are priorities for the American people.  The subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for FY 2016 is $246 million below the current year's enacted level. When added to the cuts of the past 5 years, this bill is more than $2 billion below the FY 2010 enacted level. In fact, when adjusted for inflation, this bill invests less than what was appropriated in 2005.  But it gets worse. The rising emergency costs of combating wildland fires, court-ordered Native American contract support costs, and the majority's decision to abandon mandatory funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program, otherwise known as PILT, means the remaining funding available for other critical public programs is far below the FY 2015 enacted.  PILT has been mandatory spending in the past, and almost 2,000 counties use this compensation for lost tax revenue to provide vital services. PILT should not be in this discretionary bill. It should be returned to mandatory spending.  The courts have ruled that Congress must pay full contract support costs to tribal nations. Contract support costs are true mandatory spending, and they should not be in this discretionary bill.  Catastrophic wildland fires are natural disasters and, just as any other natural disaster, they should be treated as such emergency spending. Catastrophic wildland fires should not be subject to discretionary spending caps in this bill.  Together, spending on these three activities consumes $5.4 billion, or 18 percent of the bill's budget allocation. It is time for the authorizing committees to stop ignoring this problem and responsibly address what are truly mandatory costs, because these costs are burning through our budget allocation.  So what does that mean for the rest of the programs funded by H.R. 2822? After years of cuts and flat funding, it means we are going backwards and undermining efforts to preserve America's natural and cultural heritage, failing to meet our commitments to the social and economic well-being of Native Americans, and causing real and lasting harm to the environment.  We received compelling testimony this year on the unmet needs in Indian Country, especially in the areas of education and health. Yet this bill's inadequate allocation means that many Native American programs receive far less funding than what the President requested and what Native Americans indeed deserve.  This is unfortunate because, as the chairman pointed out, he and I share a deep bipartisan commitment to bettering the lives of Native Americans and to uphold our Federal trust and treaty obligations.  Last year, attendance at our national parks was at a record high. With the upcoming centennial of the National Park Service in 2016, visitation is expected to increase. But what will visitors find when they come to the centennial celebration?  Without additional funding, they will find historic hotels in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks that have serious health, safety, and accessibility issues. They will find closed facilities at Yosemite due to 70-year-old sewer lines that are failing. And under the Republican spending plan, what visitors will not find are the hundreds of seasonal rangers that the Park Service needs to hire to restore staffing capacity to 2010 levels.  Under H.R. 2822, less than 16 percent of the funds requested for the National Park Service's centennial are provided. By underfunding the Centennial Challenge, this bill misses the opportunity to allow the American public to support their parks through matching donations.  The National Park's Civil Rights initiative fares only slightly better, with just 19 percent of the request funded. It is our responsibility to act now to preserve the stories and monuments of the civil rights movement.  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is cut by more than 25 percent below the FY 2015-enacted level, continuing the pattern of shortchanging conservation.  Wildlife programs are underfunded as well, with cuts or flat funding to programs that assist in the recovery of species or help to prevent their listing in the first place. Funding decisions such as these set up the Endangered Species Act to fail.  However, the most significant and devastating cuts are again targeted at the Environmental Protection Agency. The bill cuts the EPA by $718 million from the FY 2015-enacted level, a 9 percent cut. This is on top of the nearly 20 percent cut the Agency has received over the past 4 years.  The air every American breathes and the water every American family drinks are all at risk by the funding cuts and policy attacks in this bill. When the majority says it wants to rein in the EPA, what they are really doing is denying the protection of our air and water.  The consequences of abandoning public health and environmental protection will be negatively felt in communities across this Nation. Why? Because this bill cuts the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Revolving Funds by more than half a billion dollars. The revolving funds are part of a partnership with our communities to build and repair infrastructure that protects America's drinking water and prevents sewage from contaminating our water. And when we invest in these water systems, we are also creating jobs in communities all across the country.  Earlier this month, the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior released their latest summer fire forecast, which showed that fire costs are likely to exceed FY 2015-enacted levels by nearly $300 million.  Wildland fires burn up 12 percent, or $3.9 billion, of the bill's allocation. And without some relief, these numbers will only continue to grow.  In just the past 3 years, we have had to make up a total of a billion-dollar shortfall that forced agencies to borrow funds from other accounts to pay for fire costs. We know the answer to this problem. Many of us are cosponsors of Mr. Simpson's bill, H.R. 167, to treat a portion of these wildfire costs as they are--disasters.  Yet as problematic as the funding decisions in this bill are, what is even more troubling are the more than two dozen problem legislative riders and funding limitations contained in the bill, with seven of these being new this year.  These provisions do not belong in the bill. These are proposals that should be moved through the authorizing committee, where open, transparent, and thoughtful debate can take place.  The riders the majority have hung on this bill undermine our Nation's bedrock environmental laws, endanger public health and safety, and deny the impact that climate change is having on our planet.  Several of these riders would require that Agency scientists and procedures be ignored, saying that they ``can't be trusted.'' Yet other provisions would overturn Federal court decisions and limit judicial review.  As lawmakers, we create the legislation that guides our Nation, but my colleagues in the majority seem to need a reminder that we are only one of three branches of government. Clearly, we are the most important branch. But the other two branches have jobs to do as well.  For a majority that complains about the Federal rulemaking process, it issurprising to see that the bill contains directives that certain Federal rules be issued. It would appear that the majority is okay with Federal rulemaking, but only as long as the rules are the ones they want.  With the inadequate funding and special interest provisions, I share the administration's concerns about this bill. I will submit the Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2822, which is eight pages and includes a veto threat.                   Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 2822--Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related                    Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016                          (Rep. Rogers, R-KY)       The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R.      2822, making appropriations for the Department of the      Interior, Environment, and related agencies for the fiscal      year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. The      bill drastically underfunds core Department of the Interior      programs as well as the Environmental Protection Agency's      operating budget, which supports nationwide protection of      human health and our vital air, water and land resources.      Funding levels in the bill would prevent investments that      reduce future costs to taxpayers by facilitating increased      energy development and maintaining facilities and      infrastructure in national parks, refuges, forests, public      lands, and Indian Country. They would make it harder for      States and businesses to plan and execute changes that would      decrease carbon pollution and address the challenges the      Nation faces from climate change. They would also reduce      support for partnerships and effective collaboration with      States, local governments and private entities on efforts to      restore and conserve natural resources. Further, the bill      includes numerous highly problematic ideological provisions      that have no place in funding legislation. These provisions      threaten to undermine the ability of States and communities      to address climate change and protect a resource that is      essential to America's health--clean water, as well as the      most basic protections for America's special places and the      people and wildlife that rely on them. If the President were      presented with H.R. 2822, his senior advisors would recommend      that he veto the bill.       Enacting H.R. 2822 and adhering to the congressional      Republican budget's overall spending limits for fiscal year      (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments      in middle-class priorities. Sequestration was never intended      to take effect: rather, it was supposed to threaten such      drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that      policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and      reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms. The      Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding      for both non-defense and defense for FY 2016 to the lowest      real levels in a decade. Compared to the President's Budget,      the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's      most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start,      millions fewer workers receiving job training and employment      services, and drastic cuts to research awards and grants,      along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the      middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle      class.       Sequestration funding levels would also put our national      security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on      defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID,      Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help      keep us safe. More broadly, the strength of our economy and      the security of our Nation are linked. That is why the      President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in      sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to      defense without also fixing non-defense.       The President's senior advisors would recommend that he      veto H.R. 2822 and any other legislation that implements the      current Republican budget framework, which blocks the      investments needed for our economy to compete in the future.      The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress      to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense      priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and      tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both      parties have urged.       The Administration would like to take this opportunity to      share additional views regarding the Committee's version of      the bill.                 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)       EPA Operating Budget. The Administration disagrees strongly      with the bill's reduction to EPA's operating budget by $474      million, or 13 percent, compared to the FY 2016 Budget      request. This reduced level of funding would significantly      undermine implementation of the Clean Power Plan and the      recently finalized Clean Water Rule. The Clean Power Plan is      a flexible and practical approach to addressing the risks of      climate change by reducing carbon pollution from the electric      power sector, the largest source of carbon pollution in the      United States. Climate change is not only an environmental      challenge, it is also an economic, public health, and      national security challenge. Unabated climate change is      projected to hamper economic growth in the United States and      put the health and well-being of the Nation at risk from      extreme weather events, wildland fire, poor air quality, and      illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease carriers      such as mosquitos and ticks. Failing to address climate      change would also exacerbate poverty and contribute to      environmental degradation in developing countries,      potentially resulting in resource shortages, political      instability, and conflict. Meanwhile, the bill also reduces      funding to implement the recently finalized Clean Water Rule      that would ensure waters protected under the Clean Water Act      are more precisely defined and predictably determined. By      delaying implementation of this rule, business and industry      face a more costly, difficult, and slower permitting process.       State Categorical Grants. The Administration opposes the      $118 million reduction to State and Tribal Categorical grants      compared to the FY 2016 Budget request. Often, States and      Tribes implement environmental programs through delegated      authorities. However, the bill reduces these grants to States      and Tribes to carry out activities such as water quality      permitting, air monitoring, and hazardous waste management      programs. In addition, the bill reduces funding for      brownfields projects by $35 million, or 32 percent, from the      FY 2016 Budget request. This reduced level of funding      severely limits opportunities for local communities to      revitalize their contaminated lands to improve environmental      quality and spark economic redevelopment.       State Revolving Funds (SRFs). The Administration objects to      the funding levels provided for EPA's Clean Water and      Drinking Water SRFs. The bill reduces SRF funding by a      combined $527 million from the FY 2016 Budget request,      reducing necessary support to help communities finance water      infrastructure improvements, resulting in approximately 200      fewer projects being funded nationally.       Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Limits for Power Plants. The      Administration strongly objects to section 428 of the bill,      which would prohibit the use of funds to propose, finalize,      implement or enforce carbon pollution standards for fossil      fuel-fired electric generating units that are the largest      source of carbon pollution in the United States. The bill      seeks to derail Administration efforts to address under      section 111 of the Clean Air Act the urgent economic,      public health, and national security impacts of unabated      climate change. Failure to reduce the utility sector's      carbon footprint places the Nation at risk from extreme      weather events, wildland fire, poor air quality, global      instability, accelerated environmental degradation, and      illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease carriers      such as mosquitos and ticks.       Clean Water Act (CWA). The Administration believes that the      CWA provisions in the bill undermine efforts to protect      America's clean water resources, which are critical to      American families and businesses. The Administration strongly      objects to section 422 of the bill in particular, which would      disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the      scope of CWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and create      significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and      guidance.       Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The Administration regards the      SCC as an essential component of the environmental rulemaking      process and opposes the Congress' interference with the      Interagency Working Group's (IWG) development of the SCC. The      Administration strongly objects to section 437 of the bill,      which would force the IWG to revise the SCC using only the      discount rates and ``domestic'' SCC values stated in      Executive Order 12866 and Office of Management and Budget      Circular A-4. This revision would ignore the trans-boundary      movement of carbon, fail to capture key costs of carbon      emissions, and disrupt dozens of upcoming rules that would      use the SCC to monetize carbon reduction benefits.       Limitations on Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP)      Program under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Administration      objects to section 435 of the bill, which would block the      finalization, implementation, and enforcement of a rule to      prohibit certain uses of climate super-pollutants known as      hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Domestic action to reduce use of      HFCs is consistent with U.S. advocacy for addressing HFCs on      a global basis, such as through an amendment to the Montreal      Protocol.       National Ocean Policy. The Administration objects to      section 425 of the bill, which prohibits any funding provided      in the bill from being used to implement the marine planning      components of the National Ocean Policy. This provision would      prohibit the Department of the Interior (DOI) and EPA from      participating in marine and coastal planning efforts, a      process to better determine how the ocean, the Nation's      coasts, and the Great Lakes are managed in an efficient      manner.       Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and      Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) Financial Assurance. The      Administration objects to section 427 of the bill, which      prohibits the use of funds to develop, propose, finalize, and      implement financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA      108(b). On May 19, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit ordered EPA to develop an      expedited schedule for financial responsibility rules for the      hardrock mining industry and for three other industries. This      provision would severely limit EPA's ability to develop these      rules in a timely manner and abrogates EPA's responsibilities      laid out in CERCLA 108(b).       Classification of Forest Biomass Fuels as Carbon-Neutral.      The Administration objects     to the bill's representation of forest biomass as      categorically ``carbon-neutral.'' This language conflicts      with existing EPA policies on biogenic CO2 and      interferes with the position of States that do not apply the      same policies to forest biomass as other renewable fuels like      solar or wind. This language stands in contradiction to a      wide-ranging consensus on policies and best available science      from EPA's own independent Science Advisory Board, numerous      technical studies, many States, and various other      stakeholders.       e-Manifest. The Administration objects to the elimination      of funding for e-Manifest development, EPA's system for      electronically tracking the transport of hazardous waste.      While the Administration acknowledges the concern about the      pace of development of the e-Manifest, eliminating the      requested $7 million in funding at this time would jeopardize      EPA's ongoing progress to develop the system and begin      operations in the coming years.       Lead Test Kits. The Administration objects to section 426      of the bill that would disrupt EPA's current activities under      the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting rule until EPA      approves a commercially available ``improved'' lead paint      test kit. This provision would undermine EPA's efforts to      protect sensitive populations from exposure to lead, a known      toxin to children and developing fetuses, during home      renovation projects.                    Department of the Interior (DOI)       Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Topline. The Administration      opposes the $159 million, or 5 percent, reduction to BIA as      compared to the FY 2016 Budget request. This funding level      would limit DOI's ability to make key investments in      education and wrap-around services to support Native youth,      eliminating all increases to post-secondary scholarships and      $10 million for education program enhancement funds to allow      Bureau of Indian Education to drive school improvement and      reforms. The bill reduces funding for initiatives aimed at      supporting tribal self-determination through the creation of      a one-stop portal to facilitate access to Federal resources      and funding to address data gaps in Indian Country, and the      creation of an Office of Indian Affairs Policy, Program      Evaluation, and Data to support effective, data-driven,      tribal policy making and program implementation. In addition,      this bill eliminates all increases to natural resources      management on tribal lands, including funds to help tribal      communities prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate      change.       National Park Service (NPS) Centennial. The Administration      opposes funding levels provided for the NPS Centennial. The      bill fails to provide adequate funding to prepare for the      Centennial in 2016, resulting in the delay of roughly 70      percent of line-item park construction projects and 36      percent of repair and rehabilitation projects, and forgoes      millions in matching private donations. The bill also fails      to provide funding for engaging youth and cultivating the      next generation of conservation-minded individuals, including      funding for transportation assistance to students from Title      I schools.       Onshore Inspection Fees. The bill does not include a      proposal in the FY 2016 Budget request to institute a new      onshore oil and gas inspection fee program. The proposal,      which is similar to the program already in place for offshore      operations, would cover the cost of inspection activities and      reduce the net cost to taxpayers of operating the Bureau of      Land Management's (BLM) oil and gas program. Failure to adopt      the new fees and associated funding would hamper the BLM's      ability to protect human safety, conserve energy resources,      facilitate the proper reporting of oil and gas production,      and ensure environmental requirements are being followed in      all phases of development.       State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. The Administration      opposes the 15 percent reduction to State and Tribal Wildlife      Grants compared to the FY 2016 Budget request. This important      program allows States and Tribes, key partners in      conservation, to strategically protect wildlife and conserve      habitat in a way that complements Federal investments and      yields better results for the public.       Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT). The bill provides $452      million for PILT, which the Administration has proposed to      fund through a separate mandatory appropriation in line with      its previous congressional enactment. While the      Administration appreciates the Committee's support for PILT,      inclusion of these funds in the bill comes at the expense of      all other programs funded by the bill.       Carcieri Land into Trust. The bill fails to include the      provision in the FY 2016 Budget request to clarify and      reaffirm the Secretary of the Interior's authority to acquire      land in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). In      Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 397 (2009), the Supreme Court      held that the Secretary could acquire land in trust under the      IRA only for tribes that were ``under Federal jurisdiction''      in 1934. A legislative solution would help achieve the goals      of the IRA and tribal self-determination by clarifying that      DOI's authority under the law applies to all tribes, whether      recognized in 1934 or after. Such legislation would be      consistent with the longstanding policy of assisting Tribes      in establishing and protecting a land base sufficient to      allow them to provide for the health, welfare, and safety of      tribal members, and in treating all tribes equally for      purposes of setting aside lands for tribal communities.       Hydraulic Fracturing: Section 439 of the bill would block      DOI from implementing, administering or enforcing the Bureau      of Land Management's recently-finalized Hydraulic Fracturing      rule. This would leave the agency reliant on 30-year old      requirements and prevent it from taking key steps to improve      the safety of oil and gas drilling activities and improve      opportunities for BLM to coordinate standards and processes      with States and Tribes to reduce administrative costs and      improve efficiency.       Stream Buffer Regulation. Section 423 would prohibit DOI's      Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement from      updating 30-year-old stream protection regulations to reflect      modern science and technology and better protect people and      the environment, provide industry more certainty, and address      recent court decisions.       Hunting, Fishing and Recreational Shooting. Sections 421      and 424 would substantially impair the enforcement of a      longstanding ban on the use of lead ammunition in the hunting      of migratory waterfowl, and would complicate in other ways      the overall implementation of hunting, fishing, and      recreational shooting on public lands.       Wildlife Trafficking. Section 120 would interfere with      ongoing Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) actions to combat      wildlife trafficking, curb the poaching of African Elephants,      and restrict trade in ivory, which would impair U.S.      leadership in the global fight against ivory poaching.       Endangered Species Act Restrictions. Sections 117, 121, and      122 of the bill undercut the Endangered Species Act by      limiting the ability of the FWS to properly protect, based on      the best available science, a number of species, including      the greater sage grouse, northern long-eared bat, and certain      gray wolf populations. Language provisions, like those      affecting the sage grouse, would only create additional      uncertainty and undermine unprecedented efforts to conserve      the sagebrush landscape and the Western way of life.       Federal Acknowledgement of American Indian Tribes. Language      under the heading ``Bureau of Indian Affairs, Administrative      Provisions'' in the bill would block DOI from finalizing,      implementing, administering, or enforcing the      Administration's proposed Federal acknowledgment rule,      preventing DOI's effort to improve the regulations governing      the process and criteria by which the Secretary of the      Interior acknowledges an Indian Tribe.        DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service       Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The Administration      objects to the drastic reduction of $152 million, or 38      percent, to the requested discretionary funding for DOI and      USDA LWCF programs. LWCF is a cornerstone of Federal      conservation and recreation preservation efforts. This      funding level would severely impede agency capacity to      further protect our Nation's natural heritage. To date, the      LWCF has contributed to the protection of key public lands,      such as Rocky Mountain National Park, Mount Rainier National      Park, and portions of the Appalachian Trail, among others, as      well as State and local recreation projects and important      cultural heritage sites.       Wildland Fire Suppression. The Administration's cap      adjustment for wildfire suppression was not included in this      bill. Continued inaction on this proposal, which has      bipartisan support, would increase the likelihood of      disruptive funding transfers for suppression and away from      the very restoration and fire risk reduction programs that      are meant to restore landscapes and reduce suppression costs      and restore landscapes.       Land Management Operations. The Administration opposes the      $502 million, or 8 percent, reduction to operational funding      to land management agencies, relative to the FY 2016 Budget      request. This reduction would undermine support for the      provision of basic public and business services that support      the long-term health and resilience of national parks,      forests, refuges, and other public lands.       Water Rights on Federal Land. Section 434 prohibits      agencies from conditioning land use authorizations on the      transfer, relinquishment, or impairment of a water right, or      on the acquisition of a water right in the name of the United      States. This language is unnecessary for its intended      purpose, and would preclude land management agencies from      protecting the public interest. The provision would eliminate      the ability of land management agencies to maintain      sufficient water for other congressionally-designated      purposes and ensure water rights are tied to the activities      for which they were developed. These restrictions would also      hamper cooperative work with land users to improve land      conditions, such as range improvements, or conduct habitat      mitigation activities as part of land use agreements.            Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service       Land Management Improvements. The bill provides $357      million for capital improvement and maintenance of the      national forest system, a 5 percent increase from the FY 2016      Budget request. While the Administration supports the capital      improvement and maintenance of the Nation's public forests in      order to increase its health, resilience, and accessibility,      the increase in this bill comes at the expense of other      needed priorities.                Department of Health and Human Services       Indian Health Service (IHS) Topline. The Administration      strongly opposes the reduction to funding for Native American      health     care programs and facilities of the Indian Health Service      (IHS) by $300 million, or 6 percent, below the FY 2016 Budget      request. This would result in inadequate funding for the      provision of health care to a population that is sicker and      poorer compared to national averages. For example, compared      to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill reduces funding by      nearly $50 million for Purchased and Referred Care, a program      that supports health care not available in IHS and tribal      facilities, which would exacerbate existing levels of denied      care and waiting lists for services.       Contract Support Costs. The Administration objects to the      limitation in funding for tribal Contract Support Costs (CSC)      for BIA and IHS. Specifically, the bill would limit funding      for CSC that could perpetuate the funding issues described in      the Supreme Court's Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter decision.      The Congress should pursue a long-term solution for CSC      appropriations, providing an increase in funding in FY 2016      as part of a transition to a new three-year mandatory funding      stream in FY 2017, as proposed in the President's Budget.                            Other Provisions       Smithsonian Institution. The bill reduces funding for the      Smithsonian Institution by $116 million, or 12 percent, below      the FY 2016 Budget request--a reduction that can be expected      to reduce public access to the Smithsonian as well as      increase safety concerns through delays in planned      renovations. With over 30 million visits to Smithsonian      facilities recorded in 2014, it is important to ensure the      museums, galleries, National Zoological Park, and nine      research facilities that make up the world's largest museum      and research complex remain open, maintained, and available      to the generations of Americans who make use of this unique      institution each year. Specifically, the bill reductions      would delay renovation for the National Air and Space Museum,      where the museum has had to establish temporary covered      walkways to protect the public from potential falling debris      from its facade, and would reduce operating hours for the      museums, including the new National Museum of African      American History and Culture.       Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA      Act). The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the      FY 2016 Budget requests for DOI and EPA to implement the DATA      Act. This funding would support efforts to provide more      transparent Federal spending data, such as updating      information technology systems, changing business processes,      and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.       U.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration urges the      Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget requests for DOI      and EPA to develop U.S. Digital Service teams. This funding      would support managing the agency's digital services that      have the greatest impact to citizens and businesses.                        Constitutional Concerns       Several provisions in the bill raise separation of powers      concerns.       The Administration looks forward to working with the      Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, we owe it to our constituents to be good stewards of the environment, to be protectors of public health, and to be defenders of the public good. We can do better than what this bill offers. H.R. 2822 falls short of our responsibilities to present and future generations. As such, I cannot support the bill in its current form.  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
