The minority whip stood in the well and castigated the Democrats for spending. He has $950,000 of earmarks in the bill.  The woman from Colorado has $150,000 of earmarks in the bill.  If the gentleman is so sincere, let's entertain a unanimous-consent request.  Mr. Chairman, is it in order to make a unanimous-consent request?  The Acting CHAIRMAN. It depends on the nature of the request.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the Republicans be allowed to voluntarily strip their $45 million of earmarks from this bill, which would save one-quarter of the amount of money that the gentleman is trying to save by cutting all the funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The order of the House allowing only certain amendments may not be varied by the Committee of the Whole.  Mr. DeFAZIO. In conclusion then, we have a bit of hypocrisy here. They want to complain at the same time as they put the projects in their pocket and they go home and brag about it. They brag about how they want to cut spending in Washington, and they brag about the money they bring home.  I believe in investment in America in many ways, and this bill is making many crucial investments in America.
