 And that is our unemployment. England's unemployment is lower than western Europe, but what they forgot to tell us was interesting. Do you know what the wages in England were compared to Western Europe? They were, according to the New York Times, 40 percent less, 40 percent lower. So what they sacrificed were decent wages, and they created a whole lot of low wage jobs, which is what we are doing in this country.  In this country, 20 years ago the United States led the world, we were No. 1 in terms of the wages and benefits, highest wages in the world, we were No. 1. I know that we do not see it on CBS too often. Rupert Murdochdoes not talk about it too often, but today we are 13th in the world. German manufacturing workers make 25 percent more than our workers. These people have 6 weeks paid vacation. They have a national health care system. Their kids can often go to college for free. We do not talk about that too much.
