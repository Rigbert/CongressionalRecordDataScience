 President, today I am introducing ``The Business Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998.'' As Members of this body may remember, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission submitted a list of recommendations to Congress in October of last year. So far, the public has tended to focus on the consumer bankruptcy recommendations, which unfortunately would have made it easier to get into bankruptcy and would have given consumers even more of an upper hand. I think that these recommendations were fatally flawed, and that's why I introduced the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act with Senator Durbin last year to tighten up the bankruptcy system and provide new consumer protections when creditors use abusive tactics.  The legislation I am introducing today will make many badly-needed reforms to the business provisions of the bankruptcy code. This legislation will provide--for the first time ever--new protections for patients of hospitals and HMOs and nursing homes that declare bankruptcy. Under current law, the bankruptcy process is oriented toward protecting the interests of creditors and helping the debtor corporation reorganize. And that is all we need most of the time.  But hospitals and HMOs and nursing homes are different. Patients are uniquely vulnerable and Congress needs to take special care to ensure that patients are protected during the bankruptcy process. For that reason, this bill allows a bankruptcy judge to appoint a patient ombudsman to make sure that the bankruptcy process is fair to patients. If the ombudsman determines that the quality of patient care is declining, he must notify the bankruptcy court so that corrective action can be taken.  This legislation also requires that the bankruptcy trustee ensure patients are transferred to other hospitals when a health care provider is winding down. Under current bankruptcy law, there's no such requirement. Under current law, patients could just be thrown out and have nowhere to go. Congress can't let that happen.  Importantly, to the extent that there are some State laws which already require a State agency to place patients when health care providers go under, this legislation will allow those agencies to recoup their expenses from the estate of the bankrupt health care provider. Otherwise, the bankruptcy code forces State taxpayers to pay for something which should be paid for by the defunct health care provider.  Following a recommendation of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, this legislation provides an important new protection for employee health care and pensions. Under current law, if money is withheld from wages to pay for health care insurance or pension contributions, but a company declares bankruptcy before the withheld money is actually transferred, then the bankruptcy code prohibits the company from transferring this money. In practical terms, this means that workers lose their health insurance and forfeit pension contributions. I think this is wrong. So, my legislation will create a special carve out so that withheld money can go for its intended purpose.  The Business Bankruptcy Reform Act also makes several changes to the way securities transactions are treated under the bankruptcy code. Many of these changes are supported by the administration. I would call my colleagues' attention to one provision in particular. As we all know, home mortgage rates are at an all time low, allowing many Americans to purchase homes for the first time or to move into a larger home to accommodate a growing family. One factor in keeping mortgage interest rates very low is the existence of a robust secondary market where mortgage lenders can spread the risk by issuing securities backed up by home mortgages. With the risk spread by a securities market, mortgage bankers can make loans at lower interest rates.  Unfortunately, a provision of the bankruptcy code threatens to undermine the viability of this important secondary market. And if the secondary market dries up, then lenders will have to raise interest rates. Under current law, it isn't clear that the income stream going to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities will continue if the lender declares bankruptcy. In my bill, we expressly say that the income stream belongs to the securities purchaser and not the bankrupt lender. This change will help ensure that the secondary market stays strong by providing much-needed certainty to purchasers of mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities.  On another topic, this legislation enacts the model law on international bankruptcies. When I held a hearing on international bankruptcies before my subcommittee last year, I learned that many times bankruptcy proceedings in this county are hampered because foreign countries won't cooperate with our bankruptcy courts. This model law would provide for standard procedures for recognizing and cooperating with foreign bankruptcy proceedings. If other countries--especially our trading partners--follow our lead in enacting this model law, then our bankruptcy proceedings will be treated fairly and American creditors will be able to get a fair shake for the first time when trying to collect from a foreign corporation which has declared bankruptcy.  The development of bankruptcy systems is a critically important factor in ensuring that international trade will continue to expand and benefit the United States economy. Many international insolvency specialists tell me that the lack of a good bankruptcy system in the Asian countries is making the Asian financial crisis even worse. When we finally get to consider the IMF funding bill, I intend to offer an amendment which would require the IMF to push for meaningful bankruptcy reforms when they provide loans to countries in economic trouble. I hope that my colleagues will support me in this effort.  Finally, the legislation I'm introducing today will provide for special fast-track procedures for businesses that declare bankruptcy which have less than $5 million in debt. Right now, these cases often languish for years in bankruptcy without a real hope of reorganizing. I believe that the bankruptcy code should identify cases which have no realistic chance of reorganizing and get them into chapter 7 as quickly as possible. In this way, creditors will get more of what they are owed. Most of these special fast-track proceedings were recommended by the Bankruptcy Review Commission, although I've added some changes to reduce the chances that clever bankruptcy lawyers will find a way to keep a company in chapter 11 which should be liquidated. The Business Bankruptcy Reform Act also contains special tax provisions so that taxing authorities will receive effective notice of a bankruptcy.  Mr. President, I believe that this bill will do much good for patients, for creditors and for all Americans whose lives are increasingly affected by business bankruptcies. I hope that we can pass this bill in this Congress.                                 ______                                       By
