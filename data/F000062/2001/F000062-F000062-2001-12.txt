 President, today I am introducing a bill to authorize the CALFED Bay Delta Program. I am pleased that Senator Boxer has agreed to co-sponsor this bill with me. The bill that I am introducing today is also supported by Senator Bingaman, the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He has committed to helping move this bill through his committee and hopefully through the Senate.  The most important thing about this new bill is that it fully authorizes the CALFED Record of Decision and all the projects associated with it with Federal costs of less than $10 million. Any projects of more than $10 million that are ready to be constructed will be reported to the authorizing committees in a package every 2 years.  This bill authorizes $2.4 billion to cover the one-third Federal share of the CALFED program. The State and water users will each be responsible for the other two-thirds.  California's population is 35 million today and could reach 50 million within the next 20 years. There simply is not enough water in the system to meet the future demand. CALFED is the best hope we have to increase our water supply, preserve the environment and protect against a water emergency. I don't believe we can wait any longer.
