Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, it is my sad duty to inform you that Senator Frank Lautenberg has passed away. He died from complications from viral pneumonia this morning at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Frank Lautenberg was 89 years old.  I join with my friends and colleagues from our delegation--and, I know, withthe entire House--in expressing our profound sorrow to his family--his wife, Bonnie, his six children, and his 13 grandchildren. Senator Lautenberg will be deeply missed.  We will have a Special Order to honor this wonderful man, but just one point: that with his passing he is the last of World War II--of the Greatest Generation--to serve in the United States Senate, and I want everyone to know he will be deeply missed. I, personally, worked very closely with him on a number of issues, in particular on combating anti-Semitism, so I just want to say that we are all in sorrow for his passing. We pray for him and for his family.  I would like to yield to my good friend and colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) for any comments he might have.
