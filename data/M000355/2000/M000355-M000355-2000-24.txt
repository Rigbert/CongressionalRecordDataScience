 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lawrence and Kim Butterfield for their commitment to higher education, and their generosity to the many students who will be able to attend Spalding University because of their gift.  Spalding University has 2.5 million reasons to be grateful to Lawrence and Kim Butterfield of Louisville, Kentucky. Their recent $2.5 million contribution to Spalding University will allow the school to expand their current overseas travel and study programs, and provide additional student scholarships. The Butterfield's kindness and generosity will ensure that countless students from all backgrounds will receive a quality education and the opportunity to succeed in whatever field of study they choose. Their contribution also will enable students to have the incredible experience of traveling and studying abroad. Students who could not otherwise have afforded this opportunity will now be able to participate because of Lawrence and Kim.  Spalding University will benefit from the many students who will be able to attend classes because of the Butterfield's gift of scholarship funds. The gift of an education is truly the gift that keeps on giving. When Lawrence and Kim provide a scholarship for a student at Spalding, they give the student a quality education and lifelong career opportunities. But the gift goes further than the individual recipient--it also is a gift to the University and to the Louisville community.  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I offer sincere thanks to the Butterfield's for their gift to the students and faculty at Spalding University, to the Louisville community, and to the education of today's youth.                          ____________________
