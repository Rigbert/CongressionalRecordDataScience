 Mr. President, I am fortunate enough to know both of these gentlemen: Adm. Bob Natter, an extraordinary naval officer who has been confirmed as a four-star admiral; and, most particularly, I am pleased that my colleagues have confirmed the nomination of Col. Daniel Kaufman to be a brigadier general in the U.S. Army and dean of the Academic Board at West Point.  I have known Dan Kaufman for over 30 years. I was a plebe at West Point in Company C-2 when he was a first classman in the summer 1967. He is an extraordinary individual, a great soldier, a distinguished scholar.  I also recognize the gentleman whom he is succeeding, Gen. Fletcher Lamkin, who is the current dean. General Lamkin has done an outstanding job at West Point. I thank him for his service.  But I am delighted to be able to stand here in the well of the Senate to commend Dan Kaufman. He is a soldier first, a soldier of war above everything else.  After graduating from West Point in 1968, he volunteered for training as an Army ranger. He sought an assignment as an armor officer. He was a platoon leader with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Vietnam.  He received a Bronze Star for valor in action and received two Purple Hearts leading his platoon in Vietnam.  He returned to the Army in the United States and pursued his graduate education at the Kennedy School at Harvard, and once again Dan Kaufman and I were together. After he received his master's degree at Harvard, and subsequent service with the 82nd Airborne Division, he received a Ph.D. in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  He combines these two virtues and values: A soldier's soldier and a scholar's scholar.  He is the ideal choice for the deanship at West Point today, for a school in transformation, for an Army in transformation. As a soldier, he has seen war. He understands that one of the greatest privileges an American can ever have is the privilege of leading American soldiers. Also, one of the greatest honors an American can have is to lead those soldiers well. He has won such an honor.  He is also someone who is in touch with the greater Army. He is someone that has been actively involved in numerous issues that deal with the Army, not just academically but very much in its day-to-day activities.  He is not an ivory tower scholar. He is an actively engaged soldier. He will instill in the cadets vital skills: the ability to analyze a changing world; and a zest to learn throughout their careers, and to help the Army and move it forward.  He is also a family man. His wife Kathryn, his son David, his daughter Emily--they all serve too, and serve the Army extraordinarily well.  The mission at West Point is to train young men and women of character for a career of selfless service to the Army and the Nation.  Dan Kaufman will expand that mission and move it forward for a generation of West Point cadets who will enter our Army and will do so better prepared, as soldiers who are able to lead as thoughtful members of our military forces.  And something else. Because of his example, because of the choices he will make, their hearts and their lives will march to a very simple but profound cadence: Duty, honor, country.  I thank the majority leader and yield back my time.                          ____________________
