President, I am going to make this very brief, but I do want to make a comment. This bill that we passed is a good bill. We heard all kinds of criticism. It is always difficult when you are dealing with formulas, but this is the first time in the history of this process that we have done it without going into something such as a minimum guarantee program that is purely political. I would like to have had all the States get up to 95 percent sooner. We just could not make it happen.  We have a safety portion of this bill that we never had before. We have environmental streamlining. I would have liked to have gone a lot further on that issue. Hopefully, we will be able to do it. Maybe we can do some good in conference. Nonetheless, we will get a lot more miles, literally, for the dollar than we ever have before.  I thank, one more time, Senator Reid, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Bond. We worked very closely together. This certainly was not a partisan effort.  I thank our staffs, too. I am going to name my staff: staff director, Andy Wheeler; Ruth Van Mark; Marty Hall; James O'Keeffe; Nathan Richmond; Greg Murrill; Mitch Surrett; Laura Berry; Genevieve Erny; Frank Fannon, Angie Giancarlo; Loyed Gill; Ryan Jackson; Michele Nellenbach; John Shanahan; Jonathan Tolman; Brydon Ross; and Cori Lucero.  I say this very sincerely. I know it sounds mundane, but the public should know the hours people work up here on something like this. I am talking about all night long, several nights, and I just applaud them for doing it. I know other staff and Members have worked equally hard, so let me thank all of them for their dedication and the effort. I think we made history in terms of the length of time in which we were able to get a bill of this magnitude passed.  I yield the floor.
