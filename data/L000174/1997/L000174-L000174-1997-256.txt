President, I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution with Senator Abraham. I feel strongly that the Senate needs to speak out on the importance that our future telecommunications policy will play in the growth of commerce on the Internet.  The Internet was born in 1974, but I missed the birth announcement. Like many who later would become avid Internet users, I let several years slip by before realizing the incredible potential of this new tool--that computers could virtually connect you to anyone, anywhere, anytime.  The Internet is changing more than the speed of communications; it is changing the very dynamics of communication. Though still in its infancy, it already is beginning to change the way we do business. Over the past 2 years, sales generated through the Web grew more than 5,000 percent. And Net merchants are expected to sell billions of dollars worth of goods by the end of the century. This is a tremendous potential market for businesses.  While Internet growth has been explosive, concrete standards for Internet commerce have not been set. Most online users still do not buy and sell goods over the Internet because they are afraid online hackers will steal their financial information. These are legitimate concerns that still have to be addressed by emerging security technologies.  That is why I have worked with industry leaders during the past two years to find ways to promote more secure encryption technology. Better encryption means safer online commerce. We should be working with the private sector to help set standards that provide a secure Internet where people are safe paying their bills from their home computers. We should also encourage greater dialogue between Local Exchange Carriers and the Internet community. We do not wantto choke Internet growth with excessive phone charges for Internet access.  I use the Internet on a daily basis for anything from finding the latest Batman movie clips to online chats with Vermont schools. My work on Internet issues has earned me the nickname of ``the Cyber Senator.'' I have had many nicknames in my life. Some have been better than others but I am proud of this nickname because as the Cyber Senator, I can help Vermonters. That is why the Internet is so important to me.  In two key ways, the opportunities opened by the Internet are a perfect match for Vermont.  First, cyber-selling compliments our community-centered, environmentally-conscious style. In the past 25 years, Vermonters have shown uncommon stewardship in preserving our State's quality of life. Other States that only now are discovering these values will have trouble recapturing what already has eroded. Since the Internet allows anyone to work anywhere in the world, why not in Vermont where you can enjoy a unique lifestyle?  Second, throughout this century, we Vermonters have been held back because we are not geographically near any major markets to sell our goods. Now, through the Internet, we can sell our goods in the blink of an eye to anyone in the world.  Some pioneering Vermont businesses are already venturing into cyberspace. My home page on the World Wide Web is linked to Web sites of more than 100 Vermont businesses, ranging from the Quill Bookstore in Manchester Center to Jay Peak Ski Resort. For instance, The Flying Noodle in Waterbury Center now sells about 30 percent of its gourmet pasta and sauces over the Internet and has regular customers in Japan, Guam, Germany, France, and South Korea.  We all have visions of what we want for Vermont as we enter the 21st century. My vision is that the Internet will unlock the potential for any Vermonter--and especially, our children--to stay in our beautiful state to earn a living. The Internet is a place where Vermonters can exchange ideas with people across the world with the stroke of a key or the click of a mouse.  Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Michigan for submitting this resolution. It is strongly supported by the American Electronics Association, Business Software Alliance, and many other groups devoted to the growth of Internet commerce. I urge my colleagues to support our resolution.                          ____________________
