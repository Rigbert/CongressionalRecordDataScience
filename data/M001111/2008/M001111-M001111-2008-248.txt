 President, I come to the floor this afternoon to speak about the economic stimulus, but before I go to that, I wished to take a moment of personal privilege to recognize a special member of the Senate family whose last day in the Senate is today, and that is someone we all know well: Marty Paone. He has been a tremendous asset to all of us. His good will, his steadfastness, the way he works with all of us, because he loves the Senate and understands the dignity of it and yet had a great passion for the work he was doing, will be missed.  Marty came to the Senate nearly 30 years ago and joined the Democratic cloakroom back in 1979 and worked his way up to become secretary of the minority back in 1995 and currently as secretary of the majority. He has been a tremendous asset to every one of us. I speak on behalf of myself as well as all Members of the Senate in saying he will be greatly missed, but we wish him absolutely the best in his new career.                          ____________________
