I only asked for 5 additional minutes because I want to go back to negotiating with him and his staff on it. As you know, Senator Kennedy has done yeoman work on this and has been very involved in this as well. I think we are going to have good input and involvement on both sides of the aisle if we try to finish it up.  I think it is important that the Senate and the country understand that what we are talking about is ensuring that straightforward, honest conversation could take place between doctors, nurses, chiropractors, therapists, and their patients. That is all we are talking about here--information, and those honest, straightforward discussions. Right now, because of these gag clauses, that kind of communication so often can't take place. That is not right. That is what we are going to try to change.  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for the additional time. I yield the floor.
