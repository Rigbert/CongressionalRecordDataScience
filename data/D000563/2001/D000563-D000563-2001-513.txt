President, this amendment says that if you have materially violated the law, if you have exploited the poor victims in America who can lose their homes because of predatory lending, you cannot have the protection of the bankruptcy court. Senator Grassley from Iowa, who is on the floor, held hearings on this in State after State.  This is a scourge on retired people and people on fixed incomes. Will we come to their rescue? Watch the vote.
