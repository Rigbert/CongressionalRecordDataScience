Speaker, not a single person has read this bill. It was filed at 8 o'clock last night. If we had put this on the floor, not a single one of those on the other side of the aisle would have voted for it. Not one.  They have demagogued for years about reading the bills. This doesn't come close to their 3-day layover rule. Not close. It is being rushed through because some have fundraisers, perhaps, this weekend, or have flights or codels they want to go on. We have wasted 6 months in passing the appropriations bills, which, supposedly, should have been passed by September 30 of last year.  No one can be proud of this process. The Speaker said, when we set the caps, that he would bring a bill to the floor. He promised the 73 of us that made it possible to set these caps--because you don't have the votes on your side--that he would bring to this floor a fix for the Dreamers who are at risk of being kicked out of the country. I know there is a case, but it is short-term, not permanent. The Speaker did not keep that promise. It has not been on the floor.  What we now have on the floor is an appropriations bill. I think most of us know what is in this appropriations bill. These are earmarks. You don't call them earmarks. You call them authorizing language. They are bills thatnobody in the Appropriations Committee has read. If you have, stand up and correct me. As I said, nobody has read that either.  This is report language. Come to the well if you have read this language.                              {time}  1200  None of you--none of you--would support this process if we had offered it.  Now, the good news is that what the Appropriations Committee has done is quality work; and I congratulate Mrs. Lowey, Mr. Frelinghuysen, the subcommittee chairs, and the ranking members. It is worthy of support. But I am waiting for all the Tea Party people who harangued me and others on my side about reading the bills, giving us sufficient time to consider them. The Speaker of the House said, when he became Speaker: We will take issues one at a time.  Is there no shame?  Is there no realization of the hypocrisy that is being displayed?  Mr. Speaker, the product is a good one. And I say that about the appropriations bill. I have no idea what all the report language says.
