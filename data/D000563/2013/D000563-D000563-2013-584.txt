I can tell you, as a downstater in Illinois, I can identify with so many things he said about his State and his pride in his State and his feelings about his responsibility as the new Senator from the Hoosier State.  I thank him so much for that comment and look forward to working with him for many years to come as we represent adjoining States.                 Amendment No. 745 to Amendment No. 741  Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask that it be called up.
