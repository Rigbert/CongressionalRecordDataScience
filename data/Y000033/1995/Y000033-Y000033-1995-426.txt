Mr. Speaker, this Nation has had an enviable and successful record, both domestically and internationally, of fostering sound conservation and scientific management of wildlife and marine resources. Through statutes, regulation and international treaties, the United States has traditionally taken a leadership role in demanding science-based information and data upon which to shape policy and programs for the conservation of plants, animals, and fish. An integral part of wildlife and resource management is the concept of consumptive use of such renewable resources under proper and professional management.  In the February issue of the American Spectator there is a most thought provoking article by David Andrew Price regarding the issue of whaling by coastal and island nations. With the exception of a small science-based harvest of whales by natives in Alaska, the United States is no longer a consumer or producer of whale products. For other nations, however, whale products have been a traditional source of food for thousands of years. The serious question is whether or not such traditional harvests should be blocked when limited taking in no manner would have an adverse impact on populations stocks. Further, ignoring science in the management of one species of wildlife based upon a response to a protectionist philosophy sets a dangerous precedent. Wildlife and marine resources cannot afford to be managed on the basis of some subjective ethic that ignores science and appropriate management.  I commend Mr. Price's article to my colleagues on a most important issue of sustainable use of renewable marine resources and the role of the United States in that policy.              [From the American Spectator, February 1995]                            Save the Whalers                        (By David Andrew Price)       One morning last January, Arvid Enghaugen, a resident of      the Norwegian coastal town of Gressvik, found his whaling      boat sitting unusually deep in the water. When he climbed      aboard to investigate, he found that the ship was in fact      sinking; someone had opened its sea cock and padlocked the      engine-room door. After breaking the lock, Enghaugen      discovered that the engine was underwater. He also found a      calling card from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a      small, California-based environmentalist group that      specializes in direct actions against whalers. Counting      Enghaugen's boat, Sea Shepherd has sunk or damaged eleven      Norwegian, Icelandic, Spanish, and Portuguese vessels since      1979.       The boat was repaired in time for the 1994 whaling season,      but Enghaugen's problems weren't over. On July 1, while he      was looking for whales off the Danish coast, live Greenpeace      protesters boarded the ship from an inflatable dinghy and      tried to take its harpoon cannon. Enghaugen's crew tossed one      protester into the sea, and the rest then jumped overboard;      the protesters were picked up by the dinghy and returned to      the Greenpeace mother ship.       A week later, after Enghaugen's boat shot a harpoon into a      whale, a team from another Greenpeace vessel cut the harpoon      line to free the wounded animal. A group again tried to board      the whaler, and the crew again threw them off. Enghaugen cut      a hole in one of the Greenpeace dinghies with a whale      flensing knife. For the next two weeks, Enghaugen and crew      were dogged by Greenpeace ships and helicopters.       Although the activities failed to stop Enghaugen's hunt,      their public relations war in America has been a different      story. Over the past twenty years, the save-the-whales      movement has been so successful in shaping public sentiment      about the whaling industry that the U.S. and other nations      have adopted a worldwide moratorium on whaling. Part of the      credit must go to the animals themselves, which are more      charismatic on television than Kurds, Bosnians, or Rwandans,      who have engendered far less international protection. The      movement owes most of its success, however, to the      gullibility of Hollywood and the press in passing along bogus      claims from whaling's opponents.       The mainstay of the case against whaling--that it threatens      an endangered species--is characteristic of the      misinformation. It is true that European nations and the      United States killed enormous numbers of whales during      commercial whaling's heyday in the nineteenth century, but to      say that ``whales'' are endangered is no more meaningful than      to say that ``birds'' are endangered; there are more than      seventy species of whales, and their numbers vary      dramatically. Some are endangered, some are not. The blue      whale, the gray whale, and the      [[Page E451]]  humpback were indeed depleted, but those      species were later protected by international agreement long      before the existence of Greenpeace or Sea Shepherd. (There      have been abuses. Alexei V. Yablokov, special adviser to the      president of Russia for ecology and health, has revealed that      the whaling fleet of the former Soviet Union illegally killed      more than 700 protected right whales during the 1960's but      the International Whaling Commission's institution of an      observer program in 1972 essentially put an end to the Soviet      fleet's illegal activities.)       The only whale species that Enghaugen and his fellow      Norwegian whalers hunt is the minke, which Norwegians eat as      whale steaks, whale meatballs, and whaleburgers. As it turns      out, minke whales are no more in danger of extinction than      Angus cattle. In 1994, thirty-two Norwegian boats killed a      total of 279 minkes, out of an estimated local population of      about 87,000 and a world population of around 900,000.       In 1982 the IWC voted to suspend commercial whaling for a      five-year period starting in 1986. The ostensible purpose was      to permit the collection of better data on whales before      hunting resumed. Norway lodged a reservation exempting itself      from the moratorium, as the IWC treaty permitted, but it      complied voluntarily.       Whaling nations soon learned, though, that the majority of      nations in the IWC--including the United States--intended to      maintain the ban indefinitely, no matter what the numbers      showed. Canada left the IWC in 1982, and Iceland left in      1992. Norway terminated its voluntary compliance in 1993. To      protest the commission's disregard of the facts about whale      stocks, the British chairman of the IWC's scientific      committee resigned that year pointing out in his angry letter      of resignation that the commission's actions ``were nothing      to do with science.'' The IWC continued the moratorium anyway      at it next meeting.       A 1993 report by the Congressional Research Service      observed that the data on whales undercut the conservationist      argument, and that ``if the United States argues for      continuing the moratorium on commercial whaling, it may have      to rely increasingly on moral and ethical appeals.'' The ban      on whaling is no longer about conservation, in other words,      but about the desire of many Americans and Western Europeans      to impose their feelings about whales upon the whaling      nations (which include Iceland, Russia, Japan, and the Inuits      of Canada and Alaska).       Popular notions of whales' human-like intelligence, often      cited by opponents of whaling, have little real support.      Whales possess large brains, but that proves nothing about      their mental agility. Margaret Klinowska, a Cambridge      University expert on cetacean intelligence, holds that the      structure of the whale brain has more in common with that of      comparatively primitive mammals such as hedgehogs and bats      than with the brains of primates.       Whales can be trained to perform stunts and other tasks,      but so can pigeons and many other animals that have never      been credited with the cerebral powers of homo sapiens. And      the idea that whales have something like a human language is,      at present, pure folklore. Like virtually all animals, whales      make vocalizations, but there is no evidence that they are      uttering Whalish words and sentences. Their famed ``singing''      is done only by the males, and then during but half the      year--a pattern more suggestive of bird-song than human      speech.       Much of the popular mythology about cetacean intelligence      comes from crank scientist John Lilly, a physician who became      convinced in the 1950s that whales and dolphins are not only      smarter and more communicative than humans, but also have      their own civilizations, complete with philosophy, history,      and science that are passed down orally through the      generations. His conclusions about the animals' mental skills      were based partly on his observations of captive dolphins at      his lab in the Virgin Islands, but mainly on wild flights of      conjecture. Lilly also predicted in the late seventies that      the State Department would eventually negotiate treaties with      the cetaceans, and that humanity's progress in its dealings      with them would lead the Galactic Coincidence Control Center      to send agents to planet Earth to open the way for      extraterrestrial contacts with us. The anthropomorphization      of the whale reached new heights with a 1993 open letter to      the Norwegian people from Sea Shepherd president Paul Watson,      who predicted, ``The whales will talk about you in the same      vein as Jews now talk of Nazis. For in the eyes of whalekind,      there is little difference between the behavior of the      monsters of the Reich and the monsters behind the harpoon.''       Cetacean behavior researchers have rejected Lilly's claims.      Dolphin investigator Kenneth Norris of the University of      California Santa Cruz, who was among the first to study      dolphins in the wild and is responsible for much of our      knowledge about dolphin sonar, writes that they have ``a      complicated animal communication system, yes, but for an      abstract syntactic language like ours, no compelling evidence      seemed, or seems, to exist.'' The late David and Melba      Caldwell, who studied dolphin behavior at the University of      Florida, maintained flatly that ``dolphins do not talk.'' In      their view, ``dolphins probably are just exceptionally      amiable mammals with an intelligence now considered by most      workers, on a subjective basis, to be comparable to that of a      better-than-average dog.''       Louis Herman, director of the University of Hawaii's marine      mammal laboratory and an opponent of whaling, has been      studying the behavior of captive dolphins since 1967. Herman      says he has seen no evidence that the natural vocalizations      of dolphins constitute a language. And for whales? ``There's      no reason to think the situation would be different with      other cetacean species,'' he answers.       What American policy on whaling enforces is simply a      cultural preference--one comparable to our distaste for      horsemeat, which is favored in France. The whale-savers have      succeeded in shaping policy by selling the idea that whales      are different; that they are endangered underwater Einsteins.      That's why Icelandic filmmaker Magnus Gudmundsson, who has      produced a documentary showing Greenpeace's machinations on      the issue, is correct in calling the movement ``a massive      industry of deception.''                               ____________________
