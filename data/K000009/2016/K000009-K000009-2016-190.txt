Speaker, I rise to honor the Reverend I. J. Johnson and his wife, First Lady Betty Johnson as they celebrate their Diamond Anniversary of sixty years in pastoral service. The congregation of St. Mark's Missionary Baptist Church in Toledo, Ohio celebrates the milestone this month. Incredibly, I stood in this chamber ten years ago to recognize Pastor and First Lady Johnson's fiftieth jubilee.  As I noted then, born in Troy Alabama, one of eleven children of Mary and Levi Johnson, ``Reverend Johnson entered the ministry at age twelve. By nineteen, he began pastoring in his home state of Alabama. He received his Bachelor of Theology degree from Easonian Baptist Seminary in Birmingham Alabama, and served four churches until coming to Ohio in 1955. In July of that year, he was invited by Dr. Israel Walker to conduct a revival at St. Mary's Baptist Church. During this visit he met the woman who would become his wife. On August 26, 1958, Reverend Johnson and Mother Betty Rae Johnson were married. Together they raised four children: Reverend C.L. Johnson, Reverend Michael Johnson, Denisee Williams and Angela Taylor. In October of 1955, Pastor Johnson founded and organized St. Mark's Missionary Baptist Church. Started with just three members, the church grew over the half-century to more than 2,000 souls.''  Pastor Johnson is a man devoted to the Gospel. In addition to his spiritual leadership at St. Mark's, Reverend Roberts has conducted revivals throughout the Eastern half of the United States. Many have been called to Christ through him and he has given wise counsel to countless people. His legacy continues through his sons, both called to preach in their own right.  A leader in our community as well, Pastor Johnson has served the Baptist Ministers Conference, the Fairside Community Organization,Northwestern Ohio Missionary Baptist Association, Lucas County Mental Health Board, Interracial Interfaith Committee, Evangelical Board of the National Baptist Convention, and NAACP.  A beloved father, grandfather, great-grandfather, friend and mentor, Reverend Johnson has been a guiding light in our community for generations. Always alongside him, First Lady Johnson has been a nurturing mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, friend and confidant. Their union is a dynamic partnership which has been a beautiful example to all.  Together, Pastor and First Lady Johnson have turned hearts toward Jesus Christ and his message of Love. They exemplify the words of Thessalonians 1:3, ``We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.'' The congregation of St. Mark's, their family and our community celebrate Rev. I.J. and Mrs. Betty Johnson in their life's work. We congratulate you, reminisce with you, and look toward the future together.                          ____________________
