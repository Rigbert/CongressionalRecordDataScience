Speaker, I rise in support of the rule allowing consideration of H.R. 4101, the Fiscal Year 1999 Agriculture Appropriations Bill.  This rule allows for the orderly consideration of the Agriculture Appropriations Bill.  It waives points of order against unauthorized programs in the bill.  The rule also self-executes an amendment that waives the statute of limitations for minority farmers who have complaints against the Department of Agriculture for discriminatory actions that occurred in the past. This language has been cleared with the Judiciary Committee and the Administration, and we support its inclusion in this bill.  The amendment self-enacted by the rule also provides the necessary offsets for scoring against the bill resulting from both the lan- guage providing relief to minority farmers and the scoring created by the provision excluding agricultural exports from sanctions against India and Pakistan.  Again, I support this rule and the amendment it provides for.  My only disappointment is that the rule did not make in order an amendment by Congresswoman Lowey which would provide for civil penalties to be used a tool against meat and poultry plants which violate food safety laws. I support the efforts of the gentlelady from New York on behalf of American consumers, and will work with her to ensure the enactment of that provision.  Mr. Speaker, again I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the Agriculture Appropriations Bill. I thank my colleagues on the Rules Committee, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.  The previous question was ordered.  The resolution was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
