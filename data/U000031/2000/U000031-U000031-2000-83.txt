Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to come today before this House and the American people to formally thank and honor a true American hero, Capt. Joseph Avveduti, for his great and long service to our nation.  Captain Avveduti served as commander of the U.S.S. Kalamazoo from September 1995 to August 1996, and will be retiring from the U.S. Navy in July of this year. His retirement will not only be a great loss to our Armed Forces, but our nation as a whole.  Joseph Avveduti first came to my attention as commander of the U.S.S. Kalamazoo, a vessel whose namesake is Kalamazoo, MI, a city in my district. Like the residents of Kalamazoo, Captain Avveduti represents the best America has to offer.  In reviewing his distinguished service record, Captain Avveduti's dedication to his country is immediately evident. Throughout his many years of meritorious service to our country, he has been awarded the Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service Medals, the Air Medal and the prestigious Legion of Merit in addition to service and campaign medals too numerous to name here.  Captain Avveduti should be embraced as a shining example for many young men and women who are entering our Armed Forces today. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1974, he was designated a naval aviator and served his initial aviation tour with the helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron in Jacksonville, FL.  Mr. Speaker, Captain Joseph Avveduti has not only spoken of dedication and service to our nation throughout his career--he's lived it. Between 1983 and 1985 while serving as the assistant air officer of the U.S.S. Guam, Joseph Avveduti saw combat in Grenada and in Beirut, Lebanon. Just a few years later, Captain Avveduti was once again called to arms to defend democracy during Operation Desert Storm. During this conflict, by all accounts, Captain Avveduti served valiantly aboard the U.S.S. Saratoga in the Red Sea as part of the team that successfully defeated Saddam Hussein and restored freedom to the people of Kuwait.  After returning to the United States, in 1997 Captain Avveduti graduated from the National War College here in Washington, DC, and, in his tradition of continuing dedication, he currently holds the Chief of Naval Operations Chair at that institution.  Mr. Speaker, I believe I speak for every Member of this Congress and a grateful nation when I extend to Captain Avveduti, his wife Carol, and his sons Joseph and David, our best wishes for a happy, healthy, and productive retirement. Because I am humbled by his dedication and achievements, I ask your indulgence in making these remarks part of the permanent record of the Congress so that all Americans, now and in the future, can read and reflect on the honor, distinguished service and achievements of a great American--Capt. Joseph Avveduti.                          ____________________
