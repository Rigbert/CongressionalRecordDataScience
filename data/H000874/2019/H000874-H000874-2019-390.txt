We have a process. The bill has just been introduced. It will be referred to committee, and the committee will have it under regular order to consider. I cannot predict what the committee will do with that bill, but I understand the gentleman's strong feelings. I respect those; and I respect the fact that this is an issue that is current.  But, again, my answer to the distinguished Republican Whip is that we will be considering that in the regular order and, at that point in time, I am sure that he will be able to testify before the committee, if and when thereis a hearing, and that others will as well, including the sponsor. But we are going to pursue the regular order on this bill and other bills as well.
