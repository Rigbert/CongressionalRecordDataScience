 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the total of $62 billion that we have authorized FEMA to spend is designated already in present law. FEMA already knows what they can and cannot spend that money on, and that I know has created some frustrations with people. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say this is too much money, and we do not know how to spend it, yet be frustrated when FEMA is complying with the law and when they are spending the money. That creates a problem.  As the gentleman knows, the problem is we have a disaster unlike we have seen in this country, not just the hurricane but the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people for a very long period of time and displaced not just out of the area but out of their State, which has created new concerns and new problems; and we are trying to address those immediately.  But the administration is addressing many of these issues within the law through waivers or redesigning certain programs, and a lot of it is being taken that way. But there are some things that we must do. The committees, hopefully working in a bipartisan way, are looking at all of those kinds of issues; and that is where the six or eight bills that we have passed over the last 2 weeks have been coming from.  Understanding that those students, for instance, that may have lost their Pell Grants, in anticipation of going to universities that have closed, need some fix. We fixed that. We tried to develop a system where we could make available more TANF funds earlier, and we fixed that. We went down the line fixing those things that we thought needed fixing immediately. We are still working on others.  I have to tell you that the Senate does not see it the same way, and they are sitting on these bills and not passing them, and I would urge all Members of the House to contact their Senators and talk to them about picking up these bills and passing them, because they are incredibly important to people that need these changes.
