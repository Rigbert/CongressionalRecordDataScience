 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Hanover High School in Hanover, NH, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. George. By supporting affirmative action it is being      demonstrated that content of character is less important than      the color of skin. Students are being accepted not because      they have the qualifications, but because they are Asian,      African or Spanish. They are being put into an environment      that they are not necessarily ready for. It is like putting a      team of basketball players on the     ice with hockey players and saying, All is fair; compete.       The problem is not mixing minorities and whites so all are      fairly represented, but rather the continuing problem of      minorities being lesser qualified. They are being      inadequately educated in kindergarten through 12th grade and      the government doesn't step in until after graduation. It is      not making amends for the injustices of slavery or separate      equality but what it is doing is converting, covering up      problems with the current system, problems of funding for      proper books and classrooms in public schools. Public      schools, that means it is the government's problem with      money, not entirely of race.       As of 1995, the University of California was accepting only      about half of their students based on grades and test scores.      The rest were a complex equation that awarded points to      minorities and women, and while 565 black students applied to      Northwestern in 1996, only 120 were among the entering class      of 1,850. In 1993, out of approximately 400,000 black high      school seniors nationwide, only 1,644 had combined scores of      1,200 and better on SATs.       Finally, in 1995, Pete Wilson, Governor of California as      President of the University of California's Board of Regents      voted to end affirmative action programs that considered      race, gender or ethnic origin on admissions. At the same time      polsters of two-thirds of California's voting population and      a growing majority of men opposed quotas. We need to stop      compensating for the lack of early education and start      teaching.       Ms. Newman. Although the United States has made progress      toward protecting its people from discrimination, our nation      hasn't come far enough. If our goal is to create a society of      equal opportunity, there are a lot of things that we as a      country need to do to make that happen.       Since the late 1960s our nation has instituted an      affirmative action program. The purpose of affirmative action      was originally to end discrimination in the workplace. It has      been a futile attempt, however, to make up for years of      neglect by our society and its government to do something      about racism.       One example of the inadequacy of affirmative action can be      found in Texas. In 1994, the University of Texas law school      was sued because it had to set up separate admissions      standards for white and black students. In a mirror image of      the 1950s, the different standards were not to keep out      qualified blacks but qualified whites. The reason for this      which the lawsuit revealed was looking at the LSAT results in      1992, only 88 blacks in the country had scores higher than      the median for white students at the highly selective law      school. On scores alone, the school would have admitted nine      black applicants to its engineering class of 500 students.      Yet affirmative action called for a certain proportion of      African Americans to graduate from Texas colleges.       This huge discrepancy between black and white scores has to      do with problems that our government is neglecting to solve      within minority groups. Ignoring the fact that the black      scores weren't sufficient enough for admission will not solve      our problems nor will the other laws that require businesses      to accept a certain number of people from a certain minority.      They only worsen them. They produce the feeling of      inferiority among minorities and create negative stereotypes      in the minds of the majority. White, educated, upper-middle-     class residents are getting angry because they are losing      their privileges. They feel that they are now the      discriminated segment of our population.       We have given affirmative action a chance to lessen      tensions among the people who make up our society, yet it      hasn't been enough. There needs to be a different approach to      this program and it needs to be stronger than simply handing      out privileges. Our government needs to focus on resolving      issues of poverty, of unemployment, of public education and      the collapse of family structures that face minority groups      in America.       If people start feeling good about themselves, if they      start feeling like they have a chance to be just like anybody      else without unfair advantages from the government, only then      will they feel that they are an equal citizen of the United      States. Only then will there be space provided for      individuals of any color and any religion, any background in      either gender to achieve the success that has to be won, not      provided for.       Mr. George. What they are doing now is unnecessary--they do      not always accept people or advance people based on--they are      doing it too much on the color or by their gender.       Ms. Newman. I think it is definitely appropriate for the      government to recognize that there aren't as many of the kind      of person, a race in something like a police department or      whatever, I think it is appropriate for the government to say      maybe there is a problem, maybe there is discrimination, but      for the government to make laws that say that maybe a certain      number of white students cannot be accepted into a college      because there has to be a certain number of black students,      that is not appropriate.       Mr. George. There are blacks that have achieved and there      are Jackie Robinsons, there are Jesse Jacksons, I mean there      are blacks that can succeed and if you teach kids in school      that they can achieve just as much as a white student can,      then they think it is a lot more possible.       Ms. Newman. I do not think you can say ``tough luck'' but      you cannot wait until people are--how do I say this? If you      want to promote the feeling that I can be this kind of      person, I am a women and even though I never see any women      carpenters I can be that person if I want to, but that has to      be promoted before. People have to work at that when people      are young, when people--like using the black example again,      if a black person says I cannot be this kind of person      because I am black and because there is discrimination, that      problem has to be solved not by giving that person an      advantage which would be an unfair advantage, they have to      solve that problem by fixing the situation.                               ____________________
