 Madam President, most Senators are probably unaware of the real differences between the military retirement system for Reserve components compared to Active components of our military forces. A person who joins the active-duty military and has 20 years has the option to retire at that point and draw half their pay. A young person at age 18, with 20 years in service--age 38, still relatively young, moves on to a new career, new source of income--still receives half of their military pay.  For a member of the Guard and Reserve, it is different. As you might expect, retirement pay from a part-time career is lower than at the end of a full-time active-duty career. It makes sense.  The major difference, however, lies in the length of time the reservist retiree must wait to start to receive retirement pay. Under the current system, a person who completes 20 years in the Reserve component becomes eligible to receive retired pay but cannot begin to draw the pay until they reach the age of 60. In the Reserves, a young person age 18 can enlist, complete 20 years of dedicated service to our country, and at the end of 20 years reach the age of 38 and retire. But that person has to wait 22 years before receiving the first penny of retirement pay.  That is entirely too long. Many have recognized the system needs to be changed. The Military Officers Association, Reserve Officers Association, National Guard Association, Enlisted Association, the National Guard, all have called for Reserve retirement age to bereduced from age 60 to 55. There have been several Senate proposals to accomplish it.  I offered this bill in the last Congress. Senators Corzine and Graham introduced bills in the current Congress. I am a cosponsor of both bills. All are worthy approaches to accomplish our goal.  Unfortunately, the plan that has been offered in the form of the amendment by the Senator from Georgia, Senator Chambliss, falls short of being a good age 55 Reserve retirement proposal. In fact, I have some concerns and I offer an alternative approach. The Chambliss amendment offered a modest reduction in the retirement age and then only offers it to about half the members of the Guard and Reserve. Under the Chambliss amendment, half of all reservists still draw no retirement pay until the age of 60. It rewards only those who are called up. There is little or no incentive to stay. This amendment lowers the retirement age for those called up for an extended period in support of major military operations and then only reduces the retirement age by 3 months for every 3 months the member spends on duty.  At this point, more than 450,000 reservists have been mobilized since September 11, 2001. Over 330,000 have been deployed overseas. But we must remember, there are roughly 860,000 members in the select Reserve. That is, members of the National Guard and Reserve who dedicate a minimum in service in the Reserve of 1 weekend each month plus 2 weeks each year to maintain military readiness. So while roughly half of our reservists have been called up for duty, about half of them have not. They have continued to perform every weekend, gone to their annual training periods.  For this segment of our dedicated force, I am afraid the Chambliss amendment does nothing at all. A retirement system should create an incentive to serve. The Chambliss amendment rewards mobilization but does nothing to create the incentive for further service. It simply provides a future benefit to those who get called up. We want to honor the members of the Guard and Reserve who are selected in order to go overseas. Yes, we want to reward service that takes members of the Guard and Reserve away from their families and careers for a year and puts them in harm's way. But we must ask ourselves if such a modest adjustment in the retirement pay eligibility age is the best way to do it.  With recruiting targets being missed by our Reserve components and retention holding steady, but under severe pressures, what we need to do is to revise the retirement system so that it is both fairer to members of the Guard and Reserve and a more powerful incentive to continued service. We should make changes to the system which reward long and continued service, not just volunteering--or being involuntarily selected--for a mobilization.  We can do better for our men and women in uniform.  The amendment I offer is a substitute approach. Under my amendment, members of the National Guard and Reserve are encouraged to stay in the force by offering them a 1-year reduction in the retirement age for every year of service beyond 20 years. That is an incentive to stay in the force. A reservist can begin to draw retirement pay as early as age 55, but in order to do so, they would need to serve an additional 5 years.  By providing a way for reservists to draw retirement pay at age 55 rather than being forced to wait until age 60, this amendment brings the retirement age for reservists down to the Federal civil service retirement age, as was intended when the reservist retirement age was set 50 years ago. Our reservists make tremendous sacrifices. They risk their lives in combat zones. And, in far too many instances, they give their lives for our country. At the very least, they should have the same retirement age as Federal civil servants.  By replacing the current, inflexible approach with a sliding scale that provides earlier receipt of retirement pay in exchange for more years of service, we can create a powerful system of incentives to retain our personnel and maintain a strong Reserve.  This is the approach my amendment takes.  Many of my Republican and Democratic colleagues who, like me, are cosponsors of S. 337, the Guard and Reserve Retention Act, introduced earlier this year by my friend and distinguished colleague, the Senator from South Carolina, will no doubt recognize this concept. The mechanisms are very similar.  I invite my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in making a meaningful reform of the Reserve retirement age--one that encourages long and continued services, not simply rewarding after mobilization; one which will incentivize all of the force to stay in service longer, not just the half--roughly, 50 percent--who are tapped for a callup.  The amendment is endorsed by some significant groups: the National Guard Association of the United States, the Military Officers Association of the United States, the Reserve Officers Association, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States.  I ask my colleagues, as you consider the Chambliss amendment and my modification to that amendment, keep in mind the organizations that represent the men and women in uniform in the Reserve, who are literally serving our country and risking their lives, believe the approach I am suggesting is preferable. I hope my colleagues will feel the same.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Stephen Koper, retired brigadier general from the U.S. Air Force, who serves as president of the National Guard Association of the United States, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Guard Association of the United States, Inc.,                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 2005.     Senator Richard Durbin     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing on behalf of the members      of the National Guard Association of the United States      (NGAUS) in support of your amendment to reduce the age at      which reserve component members receive their retirement      pension.       An active component member retiring at 20 years of service      may receive a pension immediately upon retirement. A reserve      component member serving the same amount of years cannot.      Reducing the age from 60 to 55 will be a big step in      mitigating this disparity. A more equitable retirement      program will aid greatly in recruiting and retaining members      in the National Guard. When the age limit for receipt of      retired pay by National Guard members was set decades ago,      the National Guard was not relied upon the way it is today.       The objective of NGAUS is to support the reduction of the      age for retirement eligibility from its current level.       I look forward to working together in support of a strong      and viable National Guard. Again, on behalf of the members of      NGAUS, thank you for all your hard work on our behalf.           Sincerely,                                                 Stephen M. Koper,                       Brigadier General, USAF, (Ret.), President.
