The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, brought up his amendment in the second degree to the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment. The distinguished Senator from Utah is one of the sponsors of Hatch-Biden-Sessions. He withdrew it, thus withdrawing the second-degree amendment by Senator Robb. The distinguished Senator from Virginia is thus waiting for time to bring his amendment back up for consideration.
