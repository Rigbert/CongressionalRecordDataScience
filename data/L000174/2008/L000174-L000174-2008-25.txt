President, on July 1, G. Wayne Clough became the new Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Last week, the New York Times wrote a profile on Dr. Clough that highlights his markedly different leadership and style. This style is a welcome one to me.  As a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, I look forward to working with Secretary Clough on the many challenges that face the Smithsonian. So all Senators and their staff can see that he is off to a solid beginning, I ask unanimous consent that the article in the New York Times be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the the New York Times, Sept. 15, 2008]            Smithsonian Chief Hopes To Institute Big Reforms                          (By Robin Pogrebin)       It is hard to picture G. Wayne Clough dropping $14,000 of      the Smithsonian Institution's money to charter a Learjet, or      $724 to put his family up at the Four Seasons for a night.      Part of his mandate, after all, is to guard against the      abuses that brought the ouster of his high-spending      predecessor, Lawrence M. Small.       But Dr. Clough, the new secretary of the Smithsonian--its      chief executive--is expected to do far more than set a good      example. He is charged with nothing less than transforming a      162-year-old bear of an institution--with 19 museums and      galleries, a zoo, 9 research centers, and an operating budget      of $1 billion--into an ethical, tightly run organization. ``I      go to work every day a little bit nervous,'' he said in an      interview last week in New York.       The Smithsonian has been through the wringer over the last      two years, with disclosures of improper spending and sharp      criticism from Congressional committees about sloppy      governance.       So after taking over on July 1, Dr. Clough, 66, a widely      respected former president of the Georgia Institute of      Technology, spent much of his first two months calling on      members of Congress. Winning back the good will of lawmakers      will be crucial, since the federal government provides 70      percent of the Smithsonian's operating budget.       Dr. Clough (pronounced cluff) said he had assured      legislators that reforms were already under way to guard      against future misconduct.       The Smithsonian's museum directors must now have their      travel approved by an undersecretary of the institution, Dr.      Clough said. Every new executive must undergo a thorough      background check, and ethics is a regular topic of discussion      among the Smithsonian's management.       Dr. Clough's own travel must now be approved by the      Smithsonian's chief financial officer. Dr. Clough has also      resigned from his salaried positions on three corporate      boards. From 2000 to 2006 his predecessor, Mr. Small, spent      64 business days serving on corporate boards that paid him a      total of $5.7 million.       Mr. Small's salary was $916,000 in 2007, but the      Smithsonian is paying Dr. Clough $490,000. He pays his own      rent on a town house near the fish market in southeast      Washington; Mr. Small used a Smithsonian housing allowance      for his town house in an affluent neighborhood in northwest      Washington. Dr. Clough's home is about a quarter-mile from      the Smithsonian museums, so he can walk to work; Mr. Small      used a chauffeur.       While he is earning less than he did at Georgia Tech, where      his salary package was worth $551,186, Dr. Clough said he      hadn't looked back. ``This is something I wanted to do,'' he      said.       He said he was excited by the idea of collaborations      between art and science at the Smithsonian, by the depth of      expertise to be found at its various museums and research      centers and by the Smithsonian's potential to be an education      resource for the country.       And he seems to be having a good time. He cited some      serendipitous encounters, like happening upon a photographer      at the National Museum of Natural History who had completed a      folio of rare plants with the help of Smithsonian biologists.      He observed researchers examining endangered languages at the      National Anthropological Archives of the Smithsonian in      Suitland, Md. And he watched the wing of a German World War      II plane being readied at the Paul E. Garber facility, also      in Suitland, for the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy      Center near Dulles International Airport, an extension of the      National Air and Space Museum.       ``I'm thrilled by these little pleasures,'' he said.       On his visit to New York, Dr. Clough spent four hours on      Thursday at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, another      Smithsonian museum, meeting the director, Paul Thompson, and      curators; viewing its collections; and talking with the      textile artist Sheila Hicks, who happened to be there.      ``During all of these discussions, his interest in and      knowledge of design was very apparent,'' Mr. Thompson said.       It is clear that Dr. Clough will set a different tone. Mr.      Small came from the corporate corridors of Fannie Mae, but      Dr. Clough has spent his career on college campuses in the      unglamorous field of engineering.       Born in Douglas, Ga., Dr. Clough exudes a low-key Southern      charm. He is plain-spoken, unvarnished and sometimes a little      corny.       Asked about the tension at the Smithsonian between art and      science, he said: ``I love the arts. I love beauty. Every day      I try to notice something beautiful. It could be a flower, it      could be a painting, it could be a sculpture, it could be a      piece of music.''       As for setting the Smithsonian back on course, some changes      in governance were adopted before he arrived by the board of      regents, the organization's governing body, and by Cristian      Samper, who was appointed acting secretary after Mr. Small      resigned in March 2007. (Mr. Samper has returned to his post      as director of the natural history museum.)       The board now meets four times a year, not three. The      Smithsonian's inspector general, who conducts audits and      prevents waste, now reports directly to the board chairman,      not the secretary.       Dr. Clough said he planned to decentralize the institution,      to reduce the number of undersecretaries from four to three      and to give them more decision-making authority. ``I don't      want to have everything come to me if it doesn't need      to,'' he said. ``We have got to be an agile institution.''       ``My feeling on organizations is they should be as little      top-heavy as possible,'' he added. ``Let's take the money we      might be spending on the superstructure and give it to the      museums.''       He said he also hoped to improve coordination. The      Smithsonian has about a dozen educational centers, for      example, he said, ``but no pan-institutional concept'' for      education.       While he said he believed the federal government should      maintain its financial support, Dr. Clough said he embraced      Congress's message that the Smithsonian should raise more of      its own money to cover expenses. ``We need to get more self-     reliant,'' he said.       That means a major capital campaign of $1 billion over five      to seven years, a first for the institution, which will start      next year.       Dr. Clough said he would devote considerable effort to      cultivating donors. ``If we're going to get facilities gifts,      we need to have opportunities for people that they can      emotionally attach to,'' he said, like particular      exhibitions. ``You've got to work with donor intent.''       At the same time, he said, he recognized the perils of      giving contributors too much of a say in how their money is      spent, a challenge with which the Smithsonian is already      familiar. Last year some regents questioned the      appropriateness of a $5 million gift from the American      Petroleum Institute for the Ocean Initiative exhibition hall      of the natural history museum. The gift was rescinded.       ``A donor might want programming input there is always      going to be that element of nuance there,'' Dr. Clough said.      ``You have to understand the dangers and the possibilities.''       He said he also hoped to compete for federal money beyond      the direct annual appropriation. If the Smithsonian set out      to develop a school science and technology curriculum, for      example, Dr. Clough said, ``we     might go to the Department of Education and get that funded,      as opposed to sitting back and hoping that money comes to      us.''       Other ideas include appealing to foundations and seeking      revenue-generating activity on the Web, making the      Smithsonian's extensive photography collection available for      commercial purposes, for instance. ``We're not looking to      make a profit,'' he said. ``We're just looking to recover our      costs.''       During his nearly 14 years as president of Georgia Tech,      Dr. Clough oversaw two capital campaigns that raised nearly      $1.5 billion in private gifts. Annual research expenditures      increased to $425 million from $212 million and enrollment to      more than 18,000 from 13,000. Georgia Tech has consistently      ranked among the nation's Top 10 public research      universities.       At the Smithsonian, Dr. Clough said he planned to spend the      next year developing a strategic plan ``to help us get a fix      on where we are'' and to set fund-raising priorities. He said      he wanted to consult people across the institution, with the      added dividend that it ``will help restore some of the      morale.''       The Smithsonian needs to be lean, but it must maintain the      basic levels of staffing that, for instance, allow the zoo to      keep feeding the animals, Dr. Clough said. The institution's      employment levels have shrunk in recent years, declining by      nearly 600 employees since fiscal year 1993 to the current      level of 5,960.       ``We have to stabilize it,'' Dr. Clough said. ``We can't be      the institution we hope to be if we sit around and let that      happen.''       At the same time he understands Congress's concerns and      says he is ready to be grilled when the time arrives, perhaps      next spring, when appropriations hearings are usually held.       ``It's O.K. for us to be asked our relevance and what we're      doing for the country,'' he said. ``I think we can make that      case.''       This article has been revised to reflect the following      correction: An article on Monday about plans for the      Smithsonian Institution outlined by G. Wayne Clough, its new      chief executive, misstated the goal of the institution's      capital campaign. It is to raise more than $1 billion over      five to seven years, not $5 million to $7 million.                          ____________________
