 President, I am very pleased to rise, along with the ranking member of the full Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and my other colleagues who are in the Chamber tonight, to offer this amendment to boost funding for Amtrak to a level that was included in our Transportation appropriations bill that was reported back in July of last year.  Six months ago, the Appropriations Committee unanimously reported a bill that funded Amtrak at the level of $1.2 billion. That is the same level that was requested of us by the Amtrak board of directors.  Some people seem to believe that the funding level of $1.2 billion represents a massive funding increase for Amtrak. As all Members know, the appropriations bills that we approved last year have now been rewritten by the majority to reflect their priorities, and those new bills are now before us. For Amtrak, that means a cut of $374 million below the level we provided back in July. It also means a $318 million cut, or a 27-percent cut, below the level the railroad received in fiscal year 2002.  I am not familiar with the funding level proposed for every single program that is funded in this massive bill, but I suspect there are very few, if any, other programs that have been singled out for a 27-percent cut below last year's level.  There is no question that at this funding level Amtrak is heading straight for bankruptcy. That is not a debatable point. That representation is simply not true.  We have a letter from Amtrak's new president and chief executive officer, Mr. David Gunn, that makes it clear that Amtrak will be insolvent by spring should this funding level become law.  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       National Railroad Passenger                                                  Corporation,                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Chair, Subcommittee on Transportation, Committee on          Appropriations, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: I appreciate the opportunity to have      met with you and your staff yesterday to discuss the crisis      that will occur this Spring at Amtrak if the FY03 funding      level is below $1.2 billion. Neither the revised Senate level      of $826 million nor the House level of $762 million will be      adequate. As I said to you yesterday, any level less than      $1.2 billion, will leave us with no choice but to begin plans      for a total shutdown of the railroad, including all      operations in the Northeast Corridor in the Spring. We are      into the second quarter of the fiscal year and we are beyond      the point where we can make significant changes to avoid a      shutdown. None of us want to repeat a financial crisis      similar to the one we experienced last year.       As I told you, Amtrak's FY03 request of $1.2 billion is, in      reality, a small increase of the money made available to      Amtrak in FY02. Including $310 million in supplemental      funding, Amtrak received a total funding of $1.4 billion last      year. The number currently in the Senate bill is a      significant cut from the FY02 level.       We have taken significant steps to stabilize Amtrak. We      have opened our books and made them available to the United      States Department of Transportation and the appropriate      oversight committees in Congress as you have requested. As I      told you yesterday, we are making progress to stabilize the      organization. I hope that you will be able to convince your      fellow Senators to give me a chance to turn this railroad      around by restoring the money to the level that was      previously recommended by the full Appropriations Committee.           Sincerely,                                                    David L. Gunn,                            President and Chief Executive Officer.
