Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Chairman, I have a speech that is written here on this bill. Let me read my colleagues the first paragraph.       Mr. Chairman, I urge the Members to support this bill. The      gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Taylor) and the gentleman      from Arizona (Mr. Pastor) have fashioned a bill that will      serve the legislative branch well next year.  That paragraph, of course, was written before a determination was made unilaterally to change this bill, to undermine the premise on which that paragraph was written.                              {time}  2230  I regret that unilateral change which, as the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) has pointed out, was not taken in a bipartisan way. I said this earlier on another bill. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Taylor) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) both led this bill through its two phases, subcommittee and full committee, in a bipartisan, fair fashion. It was that procedure that I respected and that bill that I was going to support. Unfortunately, however, after it left the bosom of our committee, other forces were brought to bear, the bill will now be changed, and I do not believe it will serve this institution as well as it should.  There are some things in this bill that I am pleased about, such as the transit subsidy program for the roughly 4,000 employees of the Library of Congress. Approximately 140 Federal agencies, including the House and Senate, and numerous private-sector employers, offer their employees similar benefits to encourage use of public transportation. Last year we extended those benefits to our own employees at the option of each Member. That was a good step for us to take. This year we are extending it to the employees of the Library of Congress, another significant step forward. By expanding this transit-subsidy program to Library employees, we can help to ease highway congestion, reduce demand for scarce parking, reduce pollution.  I was very pleased that the bill, as reported, funded the succession initiatives in the Library and the Congressional Research Service, and hope the reductions to be taken in the Young amendment can be restored in conference. Over the next few years, numerous senior Library/CRS employees will leave Federal service for their well-earned retirement. These succession initiatives would enable the Library to ensure that key personnel pass their knowledge and expertise on to successors prior to their departure.  I am also pleased, Mr. Chairman, that the reported bill includes the amendment offered in the committee by the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr). The committee adopted it by voice vote. But as the gentleman from California, I am sure, will observe and as I will lament, the only provision in this bill that is not protected by the rule is a provision to say that we will protect the environment and recycle paper, as we expect every other Federal agency to do.  It is a shame that the Committee on Rules would not see that as a sufficiently important policy position for this bill to take for our institution. This is not extraneous. This is about the legislative body.  I would hope that no one would rise to make the point of order. I would say that this matter is in the jurisdiction of the committee of which I have the privilege of being the ranking member. I would hope that we would not claim jurisdiction on this issue. It ought not to be controversial.  As the gentleman from California pointed out, the House recycling program does not work as well as it should. One year it earned $7.51. Last year, however, it earned $25,000. But it has been suggested, Mr. Chairman, that the program could earn $150,000 if we recycled just 60 percent of our high grade paper. Think of that, $25,000. Now, the good news is what happens with this $25,000 under the Farr amendment. Mr. Chairman, the bill provides that recycling proceeds would go to our child-care center. Is there one of us that does not have an employee with a problem getting proper child care, and therefore needs the House child care center? Under the Farr amendment, not only do we get the opportunity to recycle, and to help our environment by reusing materials that are fully reusable, but we can also get to help our employees' children and be a more family-friendly institution.  Mr. Chairman, most Members and staff want to recycle, and they deserve a program that will facilitate it.  Finally, there is one item not in this measure but which I believe should appear in the final version. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina, our chairman, who has been very receptive to this issue. I believe in the final version we should include funding for the U.S. Capitol Police Information Technology Services. These services are mission-critical, but are now provided through the Senate Sergeant at Arms at whatever level of funding and support he has available after his primary responsibilities to the Senate are met. This item ought to be included in our bill and I look forward to working with the chairman on this issue in conference.  Mr. Chairman, I ask the Members to oppose the Young amendment and support the bill as originally reported by the subcommittee and full committee.
