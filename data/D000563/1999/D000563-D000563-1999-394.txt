They just cannot help themselves. Whenever it comes time for a tax break, they always want to give it to Donald Trump. I think Mr. Trump is doing well. I think Mr. Gates is doing very well. I don't think they need a tax break to be inspired to go to work tomorrow. The Republicans insist that is the case.  Look what it does: For the top 1 percent of wage earners in America, the Republican plan, the Republican tax breaks give an average of almost $23,000 a year. Of course, for those bottom 60 percent, people with incomes below $38,000 a year, they receive $139 a year.  The Republicans say: Wait a minute, the rich are paying all the taxes; they should get the tax break; it should come back to them.  Yet when you look at it, they are taking them at the expense of working families who are concerned about the future of Social Security, concerned about the future of Medicare, and want to make certain we keep up with our basic commitments to education and environmental protection.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator's time has expired.
