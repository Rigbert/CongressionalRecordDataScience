Mr. Chairman, we don't need any sanctuaries in this bill. We don't need some outside groups telling the fishermen, the communities, and the scientists--it is our belief--when they know little about it.  I happen to have the largest coastline in the whole of the United States all put together, and we have done the job we should be able to do. This bill makes this job easier for the United States of America for giving us the ability to have a sustainable yield of fish and the communities to be taken care of.  With that, Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge the passage of this legislation.
