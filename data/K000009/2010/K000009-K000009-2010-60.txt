This is so serious for our country, it's serious for our generation, it's serious for the next generation.  If we look at the abuses of the financial system over the last 30 years, let's say, every time something bad happened, the government bailed them out. And then the next crisis was worse than the one before it. I came here during the 1980s. I saw what happened, and I saw a huge debt put on the American people, $140 billion at that point. And rather than strengthening the laws to prevent moral hazard, we loosen them. And then we got a worse crisis.  If you look back to Enron, if you look back to everything that happened during the 1990s, rather than repairing it, what we did was we gave them more latitude--it's inexplicable what occurred--and the moral hazard got greater. And now with this, this is so much larger than the last two crises, and it's a real question as to whether the so-called ``reform'' coming out of the Congress will actually work.  I would like to place in the Record an interview with Professor William Black, an attorney who was recently on television, that I think is very, very probing about the enormous potential here for financial fraud, control fraud, the lack of investigators inside the FBI, and as Congresswoman Speier mentioned, inside of the SEC. And then also an interview with Dr. Simon Johnson of MIT and Mr. James Kwak about what is actually happening in this crisis and how we are not addressing it fully in the reform bills proceeding through this Congress.  So I just appreciate you giving me the opportunity to say that and to say we are in common cause here. I appreciate your comments very much. I am very worried about where we're headed as a country. I see community banks being destroyed in my region. I see these big money center institutions that have been prone to moral hazard having greater and greater authority in our country. And the amount of money they give to political campaigns, and with the recent decision by the Supreme Court to allow endless funding by any group in our political campaigns. Any one of them could wipe us out.  That's not what this country was set up for. We were set up for opportunity. We were set up for the individual to matter, for our communities to matter, for the equity that our people, when they create it in their homes, that they just don't lose it because these people think of some scheme to raid them. And yet that's what we're facing now.  So we have an enormous obligation to educate the American people and learn from them and hear their best advice on how we can dig ourselves out of this hole.  I thank you for allowing me a few moments of your time. Interview: Excerpts From Bill Moyers Journal, April 23, 2010, Guest:                                Bill Black       Bill Moyers: Bill Black is with me now. One of the      country's leading experts on crimes in high places he teaches      economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City,      and wrote this book, ``The Best Way To Rob a Bank Is To Own      One.''       Welcome back to the Journal.       William K. Black: Thank you.       Bill Moyers: What did you think of the President's speech      late this week?       William K. Black: It's a good speech. He's a very good      spokesman for his causes. I don't think substantively the      measures are going to prevent a future crisis. And I was      disappointed that he wasn't willing to be blunt. He used a      number of euphemisms, but he was unwilling to use the F word.       Bill Moyers: The F word?       William K. Black: The F word's fraud in this. And it's the      word that explains why we have these recurrent, intensifying      crisis.       Bill Moyers: How is that? What do you mean when you say      fraud is at the center of it?       William K. Black: Well, first, when you deregulate or never      regulate, mortgage bankers were never regulated, you      effectively have decriminalized that industry, because only      the regulators can serve as the sherpas, that the FBI and the      prosecutors need to be able to understand and prosecute these      kind of complex frauds. They can do one or two or maybe three      on their own, but when an entire industry is beset by wide      scale fraud,     you have to have the regulators. And the regulators were the      problem. They became a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure,      because they, President Bush appointed people who hated      regulation. I call them the anti-regulators. And that's what      they were.       Bill Moyers: This hearing that, where you testified this      week, looking into the bankruptcy at Lehman Brothers, had      something on this.       Timothy Geithner: And tragically, when we saw firms manage      themselves to the edge of failure, the government had      exceptionally limited authority to step in and to protect the      economy from those failures.       Ben Bernanke: In September 2008, no government agency had      sufficient authority to compel Lehman to operate in a safe      and sound manner and in a way that did not pose dangers to      the broader financial system.       Anton Valukas: What is clear is that the regulators were      not fully engaged and did not direct Lehman to alter the      conduct which we now know in retrospect led to Lehman's ruin.       Bill Moyers: The regulators were not fully engaged. I mean,      this is an old story. We all know about regulatory capture      where the regulated take control of the regulators.       William K. Black: Yeah, but this one is far worse. That's      not very candid testimony on anybody's part there. The Fed      had unique authority. And it had it since 1994 to regulate      every single mortgage lender in America. And you might think      the Fed would use that authority.       And you might especially think that, if you knew that      Gramlich, one of the Fed members, went personally to Alan      Greenspan and said, there's a housing bubble. And there's a      terrible crisis in non-prime. We need to send the examiners      in. We need to use our regulatory authority. And Greenspan      refused. Lehman was brought down primarily by selling liar's      loans. It was the biggest seller of liar's loans in the      world.       And when we look at these liar's loans, we find 90 percent      fraud. 90 percent. And we find that most of the frauds are      not induced by the borrower, but they're overwhelmingly done      by the loan brokers.       Bill Moyers: And liar's loans are?       William K. Black: A liar's loan is we don't get any      verified information from you about your income, your      employment, your job history or your assets.       Bill Moyers: You give me a loan, no questions asked?       William K. Black: No real questions asked. Certainly no      answers checked. In fact, we just had hearings last week      about WaMu, which is also a huge player----       Bill Moyers: Washington Mutual----       William K. Black [continuing]: In these frauds. Washington      Mutual, which used to make, run all those ads making fun of      bankers who, because they were stuffy and looked at loan      quality before they made a loan. Well, WaMu didn't do any of      that stuff. And of course, WaMu had just massive failures.      And who got in trouble at WaMu? Who got in trouble at Lehman?      You got in trouble if you told the truth. They fired the      people who found the problems. They promoted the people that      caused the problem, and they gave them massive bonuses.       Bill Moyers: I watched the testimony where you were present      the other day in the Lehman hearings. And there was a very      moving moment with a former vice-president of Lehman Brothers      who had gone and tried to blow the whistle, who tried to get      people to pay attention to what was going on. Take a look.       Matthew Lee: I hand-delivered my letter to the four      addressees and I'll give a quick timeline of what happened,      May 16th was a Friday, on the Monday I sat down with the      chief risk officer and discussed the letter, on the Wednesday      I sat down with the general counsel and the head of internal      audit, discussed the letter. On the Thursday I was on a      conference call to Brazil. Somebody came into my office,      pulled me out, and fired me on the spot without any      notification. I stayed, sorry.       Bill Moyers: Matthew Lee, vice-president of Lehman      Brothers, fired because he tried to blow the whistle. What      does that say to you?       William K. Black: Well, it tells me that they were covering      up the frauds, that they knew about the frauds and that they      were desperate to prevent other people from learning.       Bill Moyers: Matthew Lee told the accounting firm Ernst &      Young what was going on. Isn't the accounting firm supposed      to report this, once they learn from somebody like him that      there's fraud going on?       William K. Black: Yes, they're supposed to be the most      important gatekeeper. They're supposed to be independent.      They're supposed to be ultra-professional. But they have an      enormous problem, and it's compensation. And that is, the way      you rise to power within one of these big four accounting      firms is by being a rainmaker, bringing in the big clients.       And so, every single one of these major frauds we call      control frauds in the financial sphere has been--their weapon      of choice has been accounting. And every single one, for many      years, was able to get what we call clean opinions from one      of the most prestigious audit firms in the world, while they      were massively fraudulent and deeply insolvent.       Bill Moyers: I read an essay last night where you describe      what you call a criminogenic environment. What is a      criminogenic environment?       William K. Black: A criminogenic environment is a steal      from pathology, a pathogenic environment, an environment that      spreads disease. In this case, it's an environment that      spreads fraud. And there are two key elements. One we talked      about. If you don't regulate, you create a criminogenic      environment because you can get away with the frauds. The      second is compensation. And that has two elements. One is the      executive compensation that people have talked about that      creates the perverse incentives. But the second is for these      professionals. And for the lower level employees, to give the      bonuses. And it creates what we call a Gresham's dynamic. And      that just means cheaters prosper. And when cheaters prosper,      markets become perverse and they drive honesty out of the      market.       Bill Moyers: You also wrote that the New York Federal      Reserve knew about this so-called three-card monte routine.      But that, the man who led it, at the time, Timothy Geithner,      now the treasury secretary, testified that there was nothing      he could do.       Timothy Geithner: In our system the Federal Reserve was a      fire station, a fire station with important, if limited,      tools to put foam on the runway, to provide liquidity to      markets in extremis. However, the Federal Reserve, under the      laws of this land was not given any legal authority to set or      enforce limits on risk-taking by large financial institutions      like the independent investment banks, insurance companies      like AIG, Fannie and Freddie, or the hundreds of non-bank      financial firms that operated outside the constraints of the      banking system.       Bill Moyers: Now, what I hear is the gentleman who was then      chairman of the New York Fed, saying, I, we had this job to      do, but we didn't have the authority to do it.       William K. Black: Yeah.       Bill Moyers: We were the fire truck, but we didn't have any      water in our hose.       William K. Black: Yeah, this was pretty disingenuous,      because other portions of his testimony, he explained why      there was this gap. And he said it was because we repealed      Glass-Steagall. Well, the Fed pushed for the repeal of Glass-     Steagall.       Bill Moyers: Glass-Steagall was the act that was repealed      in the late nineties that separated regular banks from      investment banks, right?       William K. Black: Correct. So this is a deliberately      created regulatory black hole, created by the Fed. And then      the Fed comes into the hearing, eight years later, and said,      we were helpless. Helpless to do anything, because of a black      hole we designed. Interview: Excerpts From Bill Moyers Journal, April 16, 2010, Guests:                       Simon Johnson and James Kwak       Simon Johnson is a former chief economist at the      International Monetary Fund. He now teaches at MIT's Sloan      School of Management and is a Senior Fellow at the Peterson      Institute for International Economics.       James Kwak is studying law at Yale Law School--a career he      decided to pursue after working as a management consultant at      McKinsey & Company and co-founding the successful software      company, Guidewire. Together James Kwak and Simon Johnson run      the indispensable economic website BaselineScenario.com.       Welcome to you both.       Let me get to the blunt conclusion you reach in your book.      You say that two years after the devastating financial crisis      of '08 our country is still at the mercy of an oligarchy that      is bigger, more profitable, and more resistant to regulation      than ever. Correct?       Simon Johnson: Absolutely correct, Bill. The big banks      became stronger as a result of the bailout. That may seem      extraordinary, but it's really true. They're turning that      increased economic clout into more political power. And      they're using that political power to go out and take the      same sort of risks that got us into disaster in September      2008.       Bill Moyers: And your definition of oligarchy is?       Simon Johnson: Oligarchy is just--it's a very simple,      straightforward idea from Aristotle. It's political power      based on economic power. And it's the rise of the banks in      economic terms, which we document at length, that it'd turn      into political power. And they then feed that back into more      deregulation, more opportunities to go out and take reckless      risks and--and capture huge amounts of money.       Bill Moyers: And you say that these this oligarchy consists      of six megabanks. What are the six banks?       James Kwak: They are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,      JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.       Bill Moyers: And you write that they control 60 percent of      our gross national product?       James Kwak: They have assets equivalent to 60 percent of      our gross national product. And to put this in perspective,      in the mid-1990s, these six banks or their predecessors,      since there have been a lot of mergers, had less than 20      percent. Their assets were less than 20 percent of the gross      national product.       Bill Moyers: And what's the threat from an oligarchy of      this size and scale?       Simon Johnson: They can distort the system, Bill. They can      change the rules of the game to favor themselves. And      unfortunately, the way it works in modern finance is when the      rules favor you, you go out and you take a lot of risk. And      you blow up from time to time, because it's not your problem.      When it blows up, it's the taxpayer and it's the government      that has to sort it out.       Bill Moyers: So, you're not kidding when you say it's an      oligarchy?       James Kwak: Exactly. I think that in particular, we can see      how the oligarchy has actually become more powerful in the      last since the financial crisis. If we look at the way      they've behaved in Washington. For example, they've been      spending more than $1 million per day lobbying Congress and      fighting financial reform. I think that's for some time, the      financial sector got its way in Washington through the power      of ideology, through the power of persuasion. And in the last      year and a half, we've seen the gloves come off. They are      fighting as hard as they can to stop reform.       Simon Johnson: I know people react a little negatively when      you use this term for the United States. But it means      political power derived from economic power. That's what      we're looking at here. It's disproportionate, it's unfair, it      is very unproductive, by the way. Undermines business in this      society. And it's an oligarchy like we see in other      countries.
