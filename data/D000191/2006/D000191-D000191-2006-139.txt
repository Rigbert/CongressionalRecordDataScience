  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, so a back room deal has been cut for the UAE takeover of a number of U.S. ports. Now, just what does it mean? They do not say they are going to sell their interests. They say they are going to transfer their interests to a U.S. entity. So they are going to set up a wholly-owned and controlled subsidiary in Delaware and claim that somehow this resolves the issue?  Besides that, the issue is bigger than the UAE takeover of the U.S. port facilities. It is about other foreign takeovers of our assets. The administration is still rushing ahead to allow foreign airlines to control U.S. airlines, and there are a host of other areas where our infrastructure is up for sale.  Congress still needs to act and put in place rules to bring about the wholesale sell-off of America and its security interests.                          ____________________[Pages H848-H849]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       UAE TAKEOVER OF U.S. PORTS  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
