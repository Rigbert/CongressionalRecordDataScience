President, Senator Ashcroft feels strongly about the validity of citizen initiatives. So do I. So does Margaret Morrow. As she explained to the Committee when she testified and reiterated in response to written questions, she fully respects and honors voters choice.  Ms. Morrow has explained to the Committee that she is not anti-initiative in spite of what some would have us believe. In response to written questions, she discussed an article she wrote in 1988 and explained, in pertinent part:       My goal was not to eliminate the need for initiatives.      Rather, I was proposing ways to strengthen the initiative      process by making it more efficient and less costly, so that      it could better serve the purpose for which it was originally      intended. At the same time, I was suggesting measures to      increase the Legislature's willingness to address issues of      concern to ordinary citizens regardless of the views of      special interests or campaign contributors. I do not believe      these goals are inconsistent.       . . . . The reasons that led Governor Johnson to create the      initiative process in 1911 are still valid today, and it      remains an important aspect of our democratic form of      government.  Does this sound like someone who is anti-democratic? No objective evaluation of the record can yield the conclusion that she is anti-initiative. No fair reading of her 1988 article even suggests that.  After the November 1988 elections in California, she was writing in the aftermath of five competing and conflicting ballot measures on the most recent California ballot. They had been placed there by competing industry groups, the insurance industry and lawyers each had their favorites, and each group spent large sums of money on political advertising campaigns to try to persuade voters to back their version of car insurance restructuring. It was chaotic and confusing for commentators and voters alike.  Rather than throw up her hands, Margaret Morrow wrote in a bar magazine as President of a local bar association that lawyers could contribute their skills to make the process more easily understood by those voters participation is limited to reading the ballot measures and descriptions and voting.  Her concerns were not unlike those of our colleague from Arizona, who proclaimed last year that when the voters of Arizona adopted a state ballot measure to allow medical use of marijuana, they had been duped and deceived. Indeed, Senator Kyl criticized that ballot initiative passed by the voters of Arizona during the last election and said: ``I believe most of them were deceived, and deliberately so, by the sponsors of this proposition.''  Senator Kyl proceeded at a December 2, 1996 Judiciary Committee hearing to focus on the official description of the proposition on the Arizona ballot as misleading. His approach was similar to what the majority did on the 9th Circuit panel that initially held the California term limits initiative unconstitutional, but that does not make Senator Kyl a ``liberal judicial activist.''  I also recall complaints from conservative quarters when the people of Houston reaffirmed their commitment to affirmative action in a ballot measure last fall. They complained that the voters in Houston had been deceived by the wording of the ballot measure.  There have been problems with citizen initiatives and the campaigns that they engender. But that problem is not with Margaret Morrow or her commitment to honor the will of the voters. The problem is that they are being utilized in ever increasing number to circumvent the legislature and the people's will as expressed through their democratically-elected representatives. They are no longer the town meeting democracy that we enjoy in New England but the glitzy, Madison Avenue, poll-driven campaigns of big money and special interest politics.  Margaret Morrow was right when she pointed out that these measures, their ballot descriptions and their advertising campaigns ought to be better, more instructive, more clearly written. The thrust of that now-controversial article was that lawyers should contribute their skills better to draft the measures so that once adopted they are clear and controlling, so that they are not followed by court challenges during which courts are faced with difficult conflicts over how to interpret and implement the will of the people.  We know how hard it is to write laws in a way that they are binding and leave little room for misinterpretation. With all the staff and legislative counsels, and legal counsels and specially-trained legislative drafters and Congressional Research Service and hearings and vetting and comments from Executive Branch departments and highly-skilled and experienced and highly-paid lobbyists, Congress has a difficult time writing plain English and passing clear law. Were it not for the administrative agencies and supplemental regulatory processes even more of our work product would be the target of legal actions by those who lost the legislative battle over each contested point.  For those who preach unfettered allegiance to initiatives, I commend their rhetoric but note that it does not advance us. The questions in most of the subsequent legal challenges to voter-passed ballot measures are either what does it mean or was it passed fairly. Both those questions are premised on an acceptance of the will of the voters.  For example, the first challenge to the California term limits initiative was not that in Federal court that resulted in the split opinion by a panel of the Ninth Circuit that is later reversed. No, the earlier challenge was in the state courts and reached the California Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court was required to determine, what did the ballot measure say, was it written to be a lifetime ban or a limit on the number of consecutive terms that could be served.  That was not an easy question given the poor drafting of the measure and the official materials that described it to the voters. Indeed, the California Attorney General, a conservative Republican, argued that the measure meant only to be a limit on the number of consecutive terms. After three levels of state court proceedings and months and months and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees the case was decided by a split decision of the California Supreme Court.  The Federal challenge to the statute followed on the alternative ground that the voters were not clearly informed what the measure meant. This is only important for those who cherish the will of the voter and want to protect against voter fraud.  On citizen initiatives, Margaret Morrow has told the Committee:       I support citizen initiatives, and believe they are an      important aspect of our democratic form of government. . . .       I believe the citizen initiative process is clearly      constitutional. I also recognize and support the doctrine      established in case law that initiative measures are      presumptively constitutional, and strongly agree with [the]      statement that initiative measures that are constitutional      and properly drafted should not be overturned or enjoined by      the courts.  Contrary to the impression some are seeking to create about her views, she told the Committee:       In passing on the legality of initiative measures, judges      should apply the law, not substitute their personal opinion      of matters of public policy for the opinion of the      electorate.  I am disappointed to see that some have sought to make the nomination of Margaret Morrow into a vote about guns; it is not. During two years of consideration by the Judiciary Committee and through two sets of hearings and waves of written questions, no one even asked Ms. Morrow about guns.  Nonetheless, some who have sought to find a reason to oppose Ms. Morrow have fastened upon a few phrases taken out of context from a National Law Journal article from October 1993 that discussed the 67th California State Bar conference. This meeting followed the July 1993 killings in the San Francisco offices of the law firm of Pettit & Martin.  The National Law Journal's report notes that the representatives of the local voluntary bars considered 100-plus resolutions for referral to the State Bar's Board of Governors. The fact missed by those who are seeking to criticize this nominee is that the State Bar took no anti-gun action.  The National Journal report noted that the widow of one of the victims pleaded at a reception that the convention ``take action on gun control.'' What has gone unrecognized is that in spite of the emotional rhetoric at the conference, the California State Bar took no such action. Instead, mindful of the legal constraints on bar associations and the United States Supreme Court decision in Keller v. State Bar, the conference scaled back anti-gun resolutions. A resolution calling for a ban on semiautomatic handguns from the San Francisco delegation was reworded as a safety measure for judges, other court personnel and lawyers. A resolution from the Santa Clara delegation was turned into a mere call for a study.  The Chairwoman of the conference was not Margaret Morrow but Pauline Weaver of Oakland. Margaret Morrow was not installed as the new President of the California State Bar until the end.  Ms. Morrow told the National Law Journal that the bar should act like a client and do what is right by following the legal advice of its lawyers. That is what the California State Bar did under Margaret Morrow. In fact, and this is the key fact missed by those who seek to criticize Ms. Morrow, the California State Bar followed the law as declared by the United States Supreme Court and did not take action on gun control.  Mindful of the strictures of law, Margaret Morrow appointed a special committee of the Board of Governors to review the resolutions that had been recommended at the conference. Based on the recommendations of that committee, the Board of Governors of the California State Bar did not take a stand on gun control and did not even adopt the resolutions passed at the State conference.  This is hardly a basis on which to oppose this outstanding nominee. First, she was not involved in the efforts by some to push gun control resolutions through the State Bar, following the horrific killings in the San Francisco law offices a few months before. Second, she was not installed as the President of the State Bar until the end of the conference. Third, the actions she took as President were essentially to make sure the Board of Governors understood the law and the limits on what they could do.  So, in spite of the emotional plea by victims and the desires of certain activists, the California State Bar did not adopt gun control resolutions in 1994 and did not act to use mandatory dues for political activities. Far from demonstrating that she would be a judicial activist or is anti-gun, these facts show how constrained Margaret Morrow was in making sure the law was followed and everyone's rights were respected.  I grew up hunting and fishing in the Vermont outdoors and I enjoy using firearms on the range. I believe in the rights of all Americans to use and enjoy firearms if they so desire. I voted against the Brady bill and other unconstitutional anti-gun proposals. I have no reason to think that Margaret Morrow will judicially impose burdens on gun ownership.  I urge others to review the facts. I am confident that they will come to the same conclusion that I have with respect to the nomination of Margaret Morrow and the lack of any basis to conclude that she is anti-gun.  I ask unanimous consent that a January 15, 1998 letter to Senator Boxer signed by 11 members of the Board of Governors of the California State Bar that year be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 January 15, 1998.     Re Margaret M. Morrow: Judicial nominee for the Central          District of California.     Hon. Barbara Boxer,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Boxer: We write concerning the nomination of      Margaret M. Morrow to the United States District Court for      the Central District of California. It has recently come to      our attention that various individuals and/or groups have      charged that Ms. Morrow ``vowed to push a gun control      resolution'' through the State Bar of California during the      year she served as President of that association.       Each of us was a member of the State Bar Board of Governors      during Ms. Morrow's year as President. We represent a broad      spectrum of political views. We are Republicans and      Democrats, liberals and conservatives. We write to inform you      that Ms. Morrow did not advocate that the State Bar take a      position on gun control, and that the association in fact did      not take a position on the issue during the 1993-1994 Board      year.       The assertion that Ms. Morrow vowed to push gun control      appears to emanate from an article that appeared in the      National Law Journal concerning the 1993 State Bar Annual      Meeting. At that meeting, the Conference of Delegates, which      is comprised of representatives of voluntary bar associations      throughout California, passed two resolutions that called      upon the State Bar to study the possible revision of laws      relating to firearms, and propose and support measures to      protect judges, court personnel, lawyers, lawyers' staffs and      lawyers' clients from gun-related violence. These resolutions      were passed in the wake of a shooting incident at a prominent      San Francisco law firm that took the lives of several of the      firm's lawyers and employees.       At the time the Conference resolutions were passed, Ms.      Morrow had not yet assumed the office of President. When      asked how the Board of Governors would respond to the      resolutions, she told the National Law Journal that she would      ``discuss Keller strictures with the Board,'' and also that      she believed the bar ``should act more like a client, . . .      that is, get legal advice, `assess the risks and then do what      is right.' '' Ms. Morrow's reference to ``Keller strictures''      was a reference to the United States Supreme Court's decision      in Keller v. State Bar. That case held that the bar could not      use mandatory lawyers' dues to support political or      ideological causes.       On its face, therefore, the National Law Journal article      does not support the assertion that Ms. Morrow ``vowed to      push a gun control resolution'' through the State Bar.      Rather, it reports that she vowed to discuss legal      restrictions on the bar's ability to act on such a resolution      with other members of the Board.       Ms. Morrow's actions in the months that followed the Annual      Meeting further demonstrate that she followed the law as it      relates to this subject. Consistent with usual State Bar      procedure, the resolutions passed by the conference of      Delegates were considered by the Board of Governors. Because      of the legal issues involved, Ms. Morrow appointed a special      committee of the Board to review the resolutions and      recommend a position to the full Board. Based on the      committee's recommendation, the Board did not adopt the      resolutions passed by the Conference. Rather, it adopted a      neutral resolution that called on lawyers to ``participate in      the public dialogue on violence and its impact on the      administration of justice,'' and suggested that the State Bar      sponsor ``neutral forums on violence and its impact on the      administration of justice.'' The even-handed tone of the      resolution was due, in large part, to the belief of Ms.      Morrow and others that the Board should not violate Keller's      spirit or holding. Stated differently, Ms. Morrow and the      Board followed the law, and avoided taking a stand in favor      of or against gun control.       We hope these comments help set the record straight with      respect to Ms. Morrow's actions as President of the State      Bar.           Very truly yours,         Michael W. Case,         Maurice L. Evans,         Donald R. Fischbach,         Edward B. Huntington,         Richard J. Mathias,         James E. Towery,         Glenda Veasey,         Hartley T. Hansen,         John H. McGuckin, Jr.,         Jay J. Plotkin, and         Susan J. Troy.
