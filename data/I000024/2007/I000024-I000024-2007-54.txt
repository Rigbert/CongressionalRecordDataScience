So it went down to one-third below the baseline by 2050. That is my understanding. I think that is accurate. So there is not that much difference. If anything, it is lower because this is one-third below the baseline, and this one is 65 percent below. It would be even more of a cut by 2050.  The reason I bring up this point is because these issues don't happen in a vacuum. These are issues that are very costly. The term ``tipping point'' was used recently. I agree there is a tipping point, and I am going to be reserving more than 2 hours in the next few days on the floor, and I don't want my good friends to endure the whole 2 hours but at least give consideration to what is happening right now, and it is unbelievable.  I have never seen such a change in science as we have witnessed in the last 5 months. The entire speech I am going to give is talking about what has happened in the last 5 months. Let me give an example.  In August alone, the University of Washington claims to be ``the first to document a statistically significant globally coherent temperature response to the solar cycle.'' They came out and said it is due to natural causes. They were on the other side of this issue before.  A Belgium weather institute, August 27--all of this is in August of this year, 2 months ago--natural causes.  A peer-reviewed study published in ``Geophysical Research Letters'' finds natural causes.  Here is a significant one now because over and over, I say to my good friend from California, we have heard that 1998 was the hottest year. Now NASA has come along and said, no, it was 1934. Interestingly enough, 1934 precipitated the largest increase in CO2 going into the atmosphere. After 1940, there was an 80-percent increase going into the atmosphere.  But here is the one, if my colleagues are not listening to anything else, and I have a feeling they are not, I say to my friend from California.
