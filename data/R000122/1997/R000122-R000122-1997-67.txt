President, last November, the people of Rhode Island gave me the great honor of succeeding one of this Chamber's true giants: Senator Claiborne Pell. Throughout his years of service, Senator Pell committed himself to increasing access to education and, fittingly, his name has become synonymous with the fight to open the doors of higher education to all of our Nation's citizens, regardless of income.  Senator Pell also dedicated himself to increasing access to the arts for all Americans, regardless of an individual's or a community's wealth. He recognized the power of the arts to inspire people of all ages, through national and local exhibitions as well as arts education. With his wise and steadfast leadership, Congress made a commitment to advancing these aims, creating a National Endowment for the Arts.  I am proud to follow in Senator Pell's footsteps in supporting the NEA and a strong Federal commitment to the arts. Across the country and in my home State of Rhode Island, the arts enhance our culture and strengthen our economy.  The events of recent years in Rhode Island's capital city of Providence are a testament to the power of the arts. The last half decade has seen the revitalization of Providence's downtown area. One major factor in this rebirth has been the emergence of Waterplace Park, which uses architecture to take advantage of the Woonasquatucket and Providence Rivers' natural beauty. This summer, with NEA support, the WaterFire exhibition was introduced to the park. In the few short months since its installation, this artistic display has already encouraged thousands of Rhode Islanders to rediscover Providence's treasures.  The arts have also contributed to Providence's revival in other ways. Institutions like the recently renovated Providence Performance Arts Center and Trinity Repertory Company, both of which receive NEA support, provide our State's residents with opportunities to see well-renown and innovative theatrical works. In addition, the passage of new tax incentives for artists residing in downtown Providence has attracted a vibrant and increasingly active artistic community to the city. Taken together, these developments led USA Today to name Providence a ``Renaissance City'' in 1996.  The Federal investment in the NEA is minimal. The $100 million this bill would provide for the NEA, for which I commend the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, represents less than 40 cents for each of our Nation's citizens.  But with this tiny investment, the NEA does great things, offering our Nation's citizens increased access to all forms of the arts. In my State, the NEA supports not only theatrical productions, but also the work of the Children's Museum of Rhode Island, the youth concerts given by the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra, and the interactive music program that Rhode Island Hospital offers to its patients. In my hometown of Cranston, the NEAsupports the annual Labor and Ethnic Heritage Festival, which brings people of diverse backgrounds together to celebrate and learn about each others' traditions and cultures.  These programs reach a wide range of Rhode Islanders, but even those who choose not to participate in these events benefit from NEA support and our State's vibrant arts communities. There is a close relationship between the arts in Rhode Island and economic growth.  Working closely with the NEA, the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts supports many arts organizations, social service organizations conducting arts programs, and arts educators. One of the Rhode Island Council's funding categories, which supports 26 of the State's largest arts organizations, is known as general operating support. In 1995-96, the council's grants in this category totaled $355,000, with an average grant size of $10,000.  For this investment of $355,000, the State of Rhode Island saw an enormous return. The 26 general operating support organizations directly contributed more than $24 million into the Rhode Island economy. More than 1.1 million people attended these organizations' programs last year, further spurring the economy. Using modest Department of Commerce multipliers, these figures suggest that the activities of the general operating support organizations alone contributed a total of more than $97 million to Rhode Island's economy last year. The figure for all arts organizations would be even greater.  These impressive findings are repeated on a national scale. Recent studies have shown that the national nonprofit arts industry generates some $36.8 billion annually in economic activity; supports 1.3 million jobs; and produces $790 million in local government revenue and $1.2 billion in State revenue. For each dollar the NEA invests in communities, there is a twentyfold return in jobs, services, and contracts. Without question, this is a wise investment of our resources.  We must also recognize the importance of national leadership in the arts, which only a strong, sufficiently funded National Endowment can provide. As my colleague from Utah, Mr. Bennett, noted yesterday, the NEA's seal of approval helps countless organizations across the country to raise matching funds from private sources to support the arts.  In addition, by identifying arts education and increased access to the arts as its priorities, the NEA has promoted these issues nationwide. In recent years, we have seen a resurgence of our commitment to include the arts in elementary and secondary school curricula in Rhode Island, largely spurred by the NEA's emphasis on how exposure to the arts helps young people to grow more proficient in all subjects.  I am proud to serve on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which has examined many of these issues. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1020, which the committee passed earlier this year by a bipartisan 14-to-4 vote. S. 1020 reauthorizes and continues to reform the NEA, while maintaining a strong Federal commitment to the agency and its ideals. I look forward to the consideration of this important legislation on the Senate floor.  Standing on this floor 32 years ago, Senator Pell observed that ``the arts throughout history have greatly enriched all truly worthwhile civilizations. The arts can put into tangible form the highest of man's creative ideas, so that they may become permanently memorable.''  Today, I wish to echo Senator Pell's wise counsel. I urge my colleagues to support the NEA at the funding level requested by the subcommittee and to preserve a strong Federal commitment to the arts.                          vanishing treasures
