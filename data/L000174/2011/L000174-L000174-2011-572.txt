We adopted the committee amendments, and we proceeded to have five additional amendments offered to the bill. This morning I will be offering a managers' amendment, along with the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, that incorporates additional improvements being made at the suggestions of Senator Coburn, Senator Schumer, Senator Coons, Senator Bennet, and others.  When we adopt this managers' amendment, I believe we will move very close to a consensus bill the Senate can and should pass to help create good jobs, encourage innovation, and strengthen our recovery and economy.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Statement of Administration Policy from the Obama administration and the Edward Wyatt article.
