President, Aurora, IL, is blessed with a long history of visionary leadership. The first public school district in my State was founded in Aurora in 1851. Aurora was a center of abolitionist activism before the Civil War.  In 1881, Aurora, of Chicago's northwest suburbs, became one of the first cities in America to line its streets with electric lights, and people began to call it a City of Lights--Paris on the Plains.  Sadly, last month, 2 days after Christmas, one of Aurora's brightest lights was extinguished. Former Aurora mayor Tom Weisner died after a long, brave, and public struggle with cancer. He was 69 years old.  Tom Weisner spent his earliest years in nearby Batavia, IL. He came to Aurora in the 1960s to attend Marmion Military Academy. It was during his time at Marmion that Tom met his future wife, Marilyn Hogan, who was then a student at Marmion's ``sister school,'' Aurora Madonna High School.  What a great pair. As a young couple in the 1980s, Tom and Marilyn served together in the Peace Corps, helping rainforest dwellers in the highlands of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. They were married for 46 years.  After finishing their Peace Corps service in 1986, Tom and Marilyn returned to Aurora, and Tom was hired by the city's then-mayor, David Pierce, to be Aurora's director of emergency services. Over the next 18 years, he headed a number of city agencies, including the departments of motor vehicles, public property, and community services and organizational development.  ``It was in his three terms as Aurora's mayor, from 2005 to 2016, that Tom Weisner left his greatest mark. His keen understanding of organizational efficiency, his commitment to public service, and his passion for children, for a vibrant, sustainable economy, for the arts and environment, and many other concerns helped to make Aurora a better place to live, own a business, and raise a family.  There is one statistic that says a lot about the kind of leader Tom Weisner was: In his 11 years as mayor, Aurora rehabilitated 11 bridges. At a time when government at all levels is struggling and often failing to maintain basic public infrastructure, Aurora repaired 11 bridges in 11 years. The strengthened bridges helped spur a rebirth of Aurora's downtown.  The Fox River is one of Aurora's greatest economic and cultural assets. Mayor Weisner authorized the city's first long-term plan for the river. He oversaw the removal of a dam on the Fox River, which opened up space for bike paths and new commercial ventures, and he helped organize a regional coalition of communities to improve the southern portion of the Fox River.  Tom Weisner championed new conservation and sustainability policies that made Aurora a greener city. At the same time, he supported changes that made it easier and faster to obtain city building and other permits.  He oversaw the construction of a new police headquarters, with new tools and more resources, and crime in Aurora decreased.  Children were a special concern of Mayor Weisner. Under his leadership, Aurora created a new program called SPARK to help children from birth to age 5 to prepare for kindergarten. SPARK stands for ``Strong, Prepared, and Ready for Kindergarten.'' It is a collaboration involving Aurora's public schools and public library, the local United Way, and other groups. Nearly 5,500 children and their families have benefited from its services.  Next year, a new Paramount School of Performing Arts will open and offer young people a chance to study under some of the best teaching artists and professionals in the country. Tom helped raise money to make this happen.  The DuPage Mayors and Managers Conference honored Tom in 2015 as its Governmental Leader of the Year. The American Public Works Association awarded him its Exemplary Service Award in 2017, the year after Tom retired.  Tom Weisner's public achievements are even more remarkable, given the private pain that he and Marilyn endured during his years as mayor. In 2006, they lost the younger of their two sons, Thaddeus, to complications of cerebral palsy. The following year, Tom was first diagnosed with colon cancer. He continued to serve the people of Aurora through two surgeries and long bouts of treatment. When his cancer became public, he used his own health challenges as a public service reminder, urging people to get colonoscopies and early treatment.  In 2013, Aurora welcomed RiverEdge Park, a tremendous new waterfront open space and concert venue. Years earlier, when the Great Recession threatened to derail the project, Mayor Weisner helped ensure that it continued. In 2016, the Aurora city council voted unanimously to rename the park in Tom Weisner's honor. It is a fitting tribute to a leader who loved few things more than enjoying music in his city's parks, dressed in a brightly printed Tommy Bahama shirt and sandals.  Loretta and I offer our condolences to Tom's wife Marilyn, their son Anthony, their two granddaughters, and to Tom's many friends.  He ran the race, he fought the good fight. Now he is gone, but the light that Mayor Tom Weisner helped to bring to Aurora will continue to shine for a long while.                          ____________________
