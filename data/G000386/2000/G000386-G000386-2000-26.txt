 President, for our majority leader, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until the hour of 10 a.m. on Thursday, December 7. I further ask consent that on Thursday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and that the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 2 p.m. with Senators speaking for up to 10 minutes each with the following exceptions: Senator Murray, 10 to 11 a.m.; Senator Thomas or his designee, 11 to 12 noon; Senator Graham of Florida, from 12 to 12:30, and the remaining time be equally divided in the usual form.
