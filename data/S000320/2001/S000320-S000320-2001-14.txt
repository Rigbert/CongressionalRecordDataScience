 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Larry Wade Morris from Alexander City, AL who assumed the presidency of the Alabama State Bar this past July. Larry has worked hard throughout his extensive career to gain a reputation as one of the premier trial lawyers in the Nation. He has also endeavored to become a civic leader and an outstanding public servant. I want to congratulate Larry on his tremendous accomplishments and to recognize his progression from promising young lawyer out of the University of Alabama in 1968 to the distinguished President of the Alabama State Bar in 2001.  If you looked up the definition of a true Alabamian in the dictionary, you would not find a better description than Larry Morris. His character and work ethic are beyond reproach, and the Southern values instilled in him in from his youth continue to guide him today. Born in Alexander City, AL, Larry grew up attending public school in Montgomery. He graduated from Robert E. Lee High School and finished his undergraduate education at Auburn University. At that point, Larry made the decision to attend law school at the University of Alabama and join the long list of prominent Alabamians who have attended this respected legal institution. He received his law degree from the University in 1968, and had the distinction of serving as the president of the Student Bar Association. After graduation, Larry returned to his hometown of Alexander City to begin his impressive career in the legal profession. Larry is now the Senior Partner in the firm of Morris, Haynes & Hornsby.  Larry has demonstrated exceptional leadership abilities throughout his scholastic and professional careers. His service as president of the Student Bar Association was very highly regarded and helped to hone the skills that he has demonstrated during his professional and political life. In 1973, he served as the president of the Young Lawyer's Section of the Alabama State Bar. He is a past president of the Chamber of Commerce for Alexander City, has served on the Task Force for Judicial Elections for the Alabama State Bar and is also a past president of the Alabama Trial Lawyers Association. From 1974 through 1978, he was elected to serve in the Alabama State Legislature. During this time, he had the distinction of being named Outstanding Freshman Legislator by the Alabama Press Association.  Larry Morris is a loyal, dedicated man who has always been very generous with his time and support for community affairs. In addition to his duties as president of the Alabama State Bar Association, Larry is also a member of the University of Alabama Law School Foundation and the Leadership Committee for the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Alabama. He is a member of the American Board of Trial Advocates, and serves on the Task Force for Multidisciplinary Practice for the Alabama State Bar.  The many accomplishments and accolades of Larry Morris attest to his dedication to civic leadership and his deep belief in the law. I could not think of a better individual to represent the state of Alabama as the president of the State Bar Association. I join Larry's wife, Beverly, and their four children, Mark, Clark, Brian and Kevin Russell, in honoring his achievements. I know that they are proud of Larry, as are the many of us who have known him over the years.                          ____________________
