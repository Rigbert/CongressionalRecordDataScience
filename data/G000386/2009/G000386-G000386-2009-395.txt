 President, I rise for the purpose of supporting the Bunning amendment. What I say will have some rebuttal to what the distinguished chairman of the committee has said just.  Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Plan were created to cover low-income children. An income of more than $63,000 for a family of four is not low income. I know the Senators from the State of New York and New Jersey will argue that $63,000 is low income in their States. I know they will talk about the cost of living in those States.  As an example, the median home price in Des Moines is greater than that in Binghampton, Buffalo, or Rochester in the State of New York.
