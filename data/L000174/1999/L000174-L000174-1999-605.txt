President, I think the distinguished majority leader is saying it is not a positive development. Of course it is. We have cut back very substantially on the number of amendments. On this side, we cut out two-thirds of our amendments. We have worked very closely. I have not had a single Senator on the Democratic side who failed to agree to a time agreement every time the distinguished majority managing Senator wanted it. They have agreed, in fact, to each and every single one. In fact, we have had Senators who brought up amendments who took less time to debate the amendments than some of the rollcalls have taken while we have waited to see who had to leave.
