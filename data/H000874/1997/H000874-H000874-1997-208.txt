Chairman, I thank my chairman for his comments on that issue.  I believe for the reasons stated by the gentleman that we ought to reject his amendment, not reject his investigation, not reject going forward to find out whether there was wrongdoing here--that is appropriate and we ought to do it--but I say to my friends that this activity occurred prior to the budget agreement. The budget agreement entered into by both sides contemplated and agreed to the full funding of this program.
