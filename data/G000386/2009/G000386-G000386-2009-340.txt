'' I also told him about the Miller case heretofore referenced. I urged Senator Inhofe to ask Secretary Cohen and Chief Financial Officer Lynn five questions on straight pay at an upcoming hearing.  Mr. Lynn attempted to clarify the Department of Defense position on straight pay in a letter dated June 18, 1999. That is document No. 14.  I ask unanimous consent to have document No. 14 printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Under Secretary of Defense,                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1999.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: This is in reply to your recent      letter to the Honorable William S. Cohen, Secretary of      Defense, concerning the Department of Defense responses to      your questions submitted for the record following a March 2,      1999, hearing before the Senate Budget Committee. Enclosed is      the Department's response to your questions.           Sincerely,                                                  William J. Lynn.       Enclosure.       Responses to the Questions of Senator Charles E. Grassley       Question. The General Accounting Office (GAO)--in report      No. AIMD-99-19--states that Mr. Hamre's policy authorizes the      Navy to delay recording obligations in excess of available      budget authority for up to five years. The GAO further      indicates that the purpose of the policy allowing such delays      in recording obligations in the books of account is to avoid      a potential over obligation and violation of the      Antideficiency Act. Are these two statements accurate and      correct?       Answer. The policy referenced in GAO report No. AIMD-99-19      is not intended to and, in fact, in no way does, shield any      DoD Component from a violation of the Antideficiency Act.      Similarly, in no instance is the policy intended to allow any      DoD Component to willingly defer the recording of a known      valid obligation in excess of available budget authority.       The Department's policies require that an obligation be      established at the time a contract is entered into or a good      or service is ordered, and to be recorded within 10 days of      the date on which the obligation is incurred. Additionally,      prior to making a disbursement, the applicable technician is      required to verify that an appropriate contract or other      ordering instrument exists, that a government official has      verified that the goods or services have been received and      that a proper invoice requesting payment has been received.      Also, depending on the amount of the payment, the technician      may be required to prevalidate an obligation. (Prevalidation      is the process of checking to ensure that a matching      obligation has been recorded in the accounting records prior      to making a disbursement.) Additionally, the technician also      is required to identify the proper appropriation to be      charged and the accounting office responsible for the related      obligation. Further, the disbursement should be matched to      the applicable obligation at the time the disbursement is      made, if feasible, or as soon thereafter as is feasible.       The GAO report referred to above addresses in-transit      disbursements. In-transit disbursements occur when the paying      office (the office making the disbursement) is different than      the accounting office (the office accounting for the      obligation). In such instances, in addition to determining      the existence of a contract or ordering document and      verifying the receipt of the goods or services before making      the payment, and deducting the amount of the payment from the      cash balance of the appropriation involved, the paying office      also must forward the disbursement information to the      accounting office to enable the disbursement to be recorded      against the related obligation. (Only the applicable      accounting office, and not the paying office, can record a      disbursement against its related obligation. Thus, this      latter action is required irrespective of whether the      disbursement was prevalidated prior to payment.)       Since the amount of in-transit disbursements is deducted      from the cash balance of the applicable appropriation at the      time of disbursement, the Department can determine if the      cash balance of the appropriation involved is positive or      negative. Since a negative cash balance is an indication of a      potential Antideficiency Act violation, if an appropriation      has a negative cash balance, the Defense Finance and      Accounting Service is required to stop making any further      payments chargeable to the appropriation. Additionally, the      DoD Component involved is required to initiate an      investigation of a potential Antideficiency Act violation.      Except in very rare instances, in-transit disbursements do      not result in a negative cash balance in the applicable      appropriation. Since the appropriations charged have a      positive cash balance that means that amounts disbursed from      those appropriations are not in excess of available budget      authority.       As stated above, when the paying office is different than      the accounting office, the paying office must forward the      disbursement information to the accounting office to enable      the disbursement to be recorded against the related      obligation. During the time that the information is being      transmitted from the paying office to the accounting office      the information is said to be in-transit, and the      disbursement is said to be an in-transit disbursement. Once      the information is received by the accounting office, the      accounting office attempts to match the disbursement to an      obligation, and the disbursement no longer is considered to      be an in-transit disbursement. At that point, the      disbursement becomes a matched disbursement, an unmatched      disbursement or a negative unliquidated obligation.       Over 90 percent of in-transit disbursements are matched to      an obligation within 60 days of arriving at the applicable      accounting station. However, in some instances the      information does not arrive at the applicable accounting      office or the information that does arrive is not sufficient      to allow the applicable accounting office to attempt to match      the disbursement to an obligation. In such circumstances, the      accounting office must take additional steps to research and      obtain the information required to allow it to attempt to      match the disbursement to an obligation.       Until the 1990s, the Department had no policy regarding      such research efforts and did not require that obligations be      recorded for unresolved in-transit disbursements. The policy      addressed in the referenced GAO report recognized that,      consistent with DoD policy, in most instances, obligations      are established at the time an applicable contract is entered      into or goods or services are ordered. However, in those      instances where an accounting office does not receive      detailed information on an in-transit disbursement, this lack      of detailed information often precludes the accounting office      from being able to attempt to identify the disbursement to an      obligation. Establishment of a new obligation for such      disbursements, in many instances, could result in a duplicate      obligation. In order to avoid such duplicate obligations, the      Department allows the DoD Components time to conduct      additional research. Often, this requires a considerable      period of time and involves significant manual research. This      is especially so for those in-transit disbursements made by      one of the over 300 former paying offices that now have been      closed.       Question. If a bill for $499,999.99 is submitted to the      Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Columbus Center      for payment and the responsible technician is unable to      identify a matching obligation, and Mr. Lynn's waiver is used      to authorize the payment, exactly how is the payment posted      in the books of account? Without a valid, matching      obligation, there are just three options: (a) post it to a      bogus account; (b) post it to the wrong account; or (c) don't      post it. How does DFAS do it?       Answer. In the example described above, the technician at      the DFAS Columbus Center would not be required to validate      that an obligation was recorded in the official accounting      records prior to making the payment because the dollar amount      would be below the prevalidation threshold amount in effect      at the DFAS Columbus Center. (However, at any DFAS location      other than the Columbus Center, this amount would be above      the prevalidation threshold amount and the technician would      be required to match the proposed disbursement to the      applicable obligation prior to making the disbursement.)      Although in the above example, the technician at the DFAS      Columbus Center would not be required to match the payment to      an obligation prior to payment, the technician would be      required to determine that the payment otherwise is valid.      This would require that the technician verify that an      appropriate contract or other ordering instrument exists and      that a government official verified that the goods or      services were received. Also, the technician would be      required to identify the proper appropriation to be charged      and the accounting station where the related obligation is      recorded. Generally, this information would reside, and could      be found, in the payment system at the DFAS Columbus Center.       Irrespective of whether a disbursement is matched to an      obligation prior to payment, once a payment is made by the      DFAS Columbus Center, the amount of the disbursement would be      deducted from the cash balance of the applicable      appropriation charged and information concerning the      disbursement would be forwarded to the applicable accounting      station. When that information arrived at the applicable      accounting station, the accounting station would: match the      disbursement to the applicable obligation recorded in the      accounting system; or if the amount of the disbursement      exceeded the amount of the applicable obligation, match the      disbursement to the applicable obligation but record a      negative unliquidated obligation against the same account for      the amount of the difference between the disbursement and the      obligation; or if no corresponding obligation record can be      found in     the accounting system, treat the disbursement as an unmatched      disbursement.       Question. While the DFAS attempts to identify the matching      obligation, is the payment placed in the ``in-transit''      status?       Answer. The Columbus Center, using the Department's      existing finance network, would forward information on the      disbursement to the applicable accounting station. That      information would be considered to be ``in-transit'' for the      period of time necessary for the information to be forwarded      from the Columbus Center to the applicable accounting      station. Once the information arrived at the accounting      station, the accounting station would match the disbursement      to the applicable obligation and the transaction no longer      would be considered to be in an in-transit disbursement.       Question. If a valid, matching obligation cannot be found,      how is the problem resolved?       Answer. If a valid, matching obligation cannot be found,      the disbursement is treated as an unmatched disbursement. In      the case of an unmatched disbursement, the applicable      accounting station and DoD Component involved are given 180      days to conduct research to identify the matching obligation.      If, after the 180-day period, a valid matching obligation      cannot be found, the DoD Component involved is required to      establish a new obligation for the disbursement.
