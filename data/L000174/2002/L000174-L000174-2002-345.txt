President, as I said earlier, we will continue to move at a faster pace on the nominees for President Bush than the Republicans ever did with nominees of President Clinton. I will continue to move at a faster pace for them. I will continue to try to overcome the objections to hearings on Senator Hatch's nominees, and we will have a hearing.  I yield the remainder of my time.
