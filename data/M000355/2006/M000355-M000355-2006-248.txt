 Two amendments are pending and we anticipate additional amendments to be offered on Monday, for a series of votes on Tuesday. Senators should be consulting with the bill managers in order to get their amendments in the queue and to finish this bill, we hope, in short order. While the leader has indicated that we will not have any rollcall votes until Tuesday, we need to continue to move forward on this bill, and Senators are encouraged to offer and debate their amendments on Monday next and early in the week.  Everyone should also remember that Monday will mark the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attack known as 9/11. We will have a bipartisan, bicameral ceremony at 6 p.m. On Monday evening on the East Front of the Capitol at exactly the same time we all joined on the Capitol steps on the evening of 9/11.  All Members obviously are urged to join us and to participate in remembrance of that event on the steps of the Capitol at 6 p.m., September 11, 2001.                          ____________________[Page S9281]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
