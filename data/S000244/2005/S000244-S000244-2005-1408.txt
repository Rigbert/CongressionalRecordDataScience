 Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) has said that the Private Relief Bill is the way to go rather than the legislation that is before us. If the Private Relief Bill were introduced or came over from the Senate, Terri Schiavo would be dead before we could consider it.  I would draw the Members' attention to rule XIII clause 1(a)(3) of the rules of the House of Representatives that says that the Private Calendar is provided in clause 5 of rule XV to which shall be referred all private bills and all private resolutions.  There is no exception to that.  And rule XV clause 5 says that the private calendar shall be called only on the first Tuesday of every month, and at the Speaker's discretion, in addition, the third Tuesday of the month.  Furthermore, clause 5 of rule XV says that the Speaker may not entertain a reservation of the right to object to the consideration of the bill or resolution under this clause.  That means that private bills go through without debate.  And furthermore, under the clause that I have just cited, two Members may object to the private bill in which case it is recommitted to the committee.  So if only two Members are opposed to a private bill and come to the floor and object, that kills it once and for all.  Now, those are the procedural hurdles against the private bill coming up. And that is why the only way to deal with this issue in a timely manner is through public legislation such as the bill that is currently under consideration.  Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson).
