 The first is amendment No. 1197 introduced by Senator Thune. Border security should be the number one priority in any immigration discussion, and building this fence which is already required by law will help in that endeavor.  The second is Amendment No. 1228 introduced by Senator Vitter. This requires that the biometric border check-in and check-out system be fully implemented prior to any legal status being granted to an illegal alien. Our national and economic security depends on us knowing who is in our country, and this amendment will help achieve that goal.  While I strongly disagree with granting amnesty to those who broke the law, on the chance that this bill passes I want to make sure that amendments like the two of these are included in the final legislation.                          ____________________
