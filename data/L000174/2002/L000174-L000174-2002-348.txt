President, in June 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a pair of decisions that altered the legal landscape with respect to intellectual property. I am referring to Florida Prepaid versus College Savings Bank andits companion case, College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid. The Court ruled in these cases that States and their institutions cannot be held liable for damages for patent infringement and other violations of the Federal intellectual property laws, even though they can and do enjoy the full protection of those laws for themselves.  Both Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank were decided by the same five-to-four majority of the justices. This slim majority of the Court threw out three Federal statutes that Congress passed, unanimously, in the early 1990s, to reaffirm that the Federal patent, copyright, and trademark laws apply to everyone, including the States.  I believe that there is an urgent need for Congress to respond to the Florida Prepaid decisions, for two reasons.  First, the decisions opened up a huge loophole in our Federal intellectual property laws. If we truly believe in fairness, we cannot tolerate a situation in which some participants in the intellectual property system get legal protection but need not adhere to the law themselves. If we truly believe in the free market, we cannot tolerate a situation where one class of market participants have to play by the rules and others do not. As Senator Specter said in August 1999, in a floor statement that was highly critical of the Florida Prepaid decisions, they ``leave us with an absurd and untenable state of affairs,'' where ``States will enjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitors.''  This concern is not just abstract. Consider this. In one recent copyright case, the University of Houston was able to avoid any liability by invoking sovereign immunity. The plaintiff in that case, a woman named Denise Chavez, was unable to collect a nickle in connection with the university's alleged unauthorized publication of her short stories. Now, just a short time later, another public university funded by the State of Texas is suing Xerox for copyright infringement.  The second reason why Congress should respond to the Florida Prepaid decisions is that they raise broader concerns about the roles of Congress and the Court. Over the past decade, in a series of five-to-four decisions that might be called examples of ``judicial activism,'' the current Supreme Court majority has overturned Federal legislation with a frequency unprecedented in American constitutional history. In doing so, the Court has more often than not relied on notions of State sovereign immunity that have little if anything to do with the text of the Constitution.  Some of us have liked some of the results; others have liked others; but that is not the point. This activist Court has been whittling away at the legitimate constitutional authority of the Federal Government. At the risk of sounding alarmist, this is the fact of the matter: We are faced with a choice. We can respond, in a careful and measured way, by reinstating our democratic policy choices in legislation that is crafted to meet the Court's stated objections. Or we can run away, abdicate our democratic policy-making duties to the unelected Court, and go down in history as the incredible shrinking Congress.  Just last month, the Court decided to intervene in another copyright dispute, to decide whether Congress went too far in 1998, when we extended the period of copyright protection for an additional 20 years. Many of us on the Judiciary Committee cosponsored that legislation, and it passed unanimously in both Houses. A decision that the legislation is unconstitutional could place further limits on congressional power.  About 4 months after the Florida Prepaid decisions issued, I introduced a bill that responded to those decisions. The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of 1999 was designed to restore Federal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights by states.  I regret that the Senate did not consider my legislation during the last Congress. It has now been nearly 3 years since the Court decisions opened such a troubling loophole in our Federal intellectual property laws. We should delay no further.  Last month, the Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on the issue of sovereign immunity and the protection of intellectual property. I want to thank again everyone who participated in that hearing, which helped greatly to clarify the issues and challenges posed by the Court's new jurisprudence.  Today, I am pleased to be reintroducing the Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act with my friend and fellow Judiciary Committee member, Senator Brownback. I commend the Senator from Kansas for taking a stand on this important issue. I am also proud to have the House leaders on intellectual property issues, Representatives Coble and Berman, as the principal sponsors of the House companion bill, H.R. 3204.  This bill has the same common-sense goal as the three statutes that the Supreme Court's decisions invalidated: To protect intellectual property rights fully and fairly. But the legislation has been re-engineered, after extensive consultation with constitutional and intellectual property experts, to ensure full compliance with the Court's new jurisprudential requirements. As a result, the bill has earned the strong support of the U.S. Copyright Office and the endorsements of a broad range of organizations including the American Bar Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, the International Trademark Association, the Motion Picture Association of America, the Professional Photographers of America Association, and the Chamber of Commerce.  In essence, our bill presents States with a choice. It creates reasonable incentives for States to waive their immunity in intellectual property cases, but it does not oblige them to do so. States that choose not to waive their immunity within 2 years after enactment of the bill would continue to enjoy many of the benefits of the Federal intellectual property system; however, like private parties that sue States for infringement, States that sue private parties for infringement could not recover any money damages unless they had waived their immunity from liability in intellectual property cases.  This arrangement is clearly constitutional. Congress may attach conditions to a State's receipt of Federal intellectual property protection under its Article I intellectual property power just as Congress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of Federal funds under its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach conditions to the Federal benefit is part of the greater power to deny the benefit altogether. And no condition could be more reasonable or proportionate than the condition that in order to obtain full protection for your Federal intellectual property rights, you must respect those of others.  I hope we can all agree on the need for corrective legislation. A recent GAO study confirmed that, as the law now stands, owners of intellectual property have few or no alternatives or remedies available against State infringers, just a series of dead ends.  We need to assure American inventors and investors, and our foreign trading partners, that as State involvement in intellectual property becomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual property rights are backed by legal remedies. I want to emphasize the international ramifications here. American trading interests have been well served by our strong and consistent advocacy of effective intellectual property protections in treaty negotiations and other international fora. Those efforts could be jeopardized by the loophole in U.S. intellectual property enforcement that the Supreme Court has created.  The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act restores protection for violations of intellectual property rights that may, under current law, go unremedied. We unanimously passed more sweeping legislation earlier this decade, but were thwarted by the Supreme Court's shifting jurisprudence. We should enact this legislation without further delay.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2031       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are to--       (1) help eliminate the unfair commercial advantage that      States and their instrumentalities now hold in the Federal      intellectual property system because of their ability to      obtain protection under the United States patent, copyright,      and trademark laws while remaining exempt from liability for      infringing the rights of others;       (2) promote technological innovation and artistic creation      in furtherance of the policies underlying Federal laws and      international treaties relating to intellectual property;       (3) reaffirm the availability of prospective relief against      State officials who are violating or who threaten to violate      Federal intellectual property laws; and       (4) abrogate State sovereign immunity in cases where States      or their instrumentalities, officers, or employees violate      the United States Constitution by infringing Federal      intellectual property.

SEC. 4. CLARIFICATION OF REMEDIES AVAILABLE FOR STATUTORY                    VIOLATIONS BY STATE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.       In any action against an officer or employee of a State or      State instrumentality for any violation of any of the      provisions of title 17 or 35, United States Code, the      Trademark Act of 1946, or the Plant Variety Protection Act (7      U.S.C. 2321 et seq.), remedies shall be available against the      officer or employee in the same manner and to the same extent      as such remedies are available in an action against a private      individual under like circumstances. Such remedies may      include monetary damages assessed against the officer or      employee, declaratory and injunctive relief, costs, attorney      fees, and destruction of infringing articles, as provided      under the applicable Federal statute.     SEC. 5. LIABILITY OF STATES FOR CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS                    INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.       (a) Due Process Violations.--Any State or State      instrumentality that violates any of the exclusive rights of      a patent owner under title 35, United States Code, of a      copyright owner, author, or owner of a mask work or original      design under title 17, United States Code, of an owner or      registrant of a mark used in commerce or registered in the      Patent and Trademark Office under the Trademark Act of 1946,      or of an owner of a protected plant variety under the Plant      Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 et seq.), in a manner      that deprives any person of property in violation of the      fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution, shall      be liable to the party injured in a civil action in Federal      court for compensation for the harm caused by such violation.

(e) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to violations      that occur on or after the date of enactment of this Act.     SEC. 6. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.       (a) Jurisdiction.--The district courts shall have original      jurisdiction of any action arising under this Act under      section 1338 of title 28, United States Code.

The      Court's decisions give States an unfair advantage in the      intellectual property marketplace by shielding them from      money damages when they infringe the rights of private      parties, while leaving them free to obtain money damages when      their own rights are infringed. These decisions also have the      potential to impair the rights of private intellectual      property owners, discourage technological innovation and      artistic creation, and compromise the ability of the United      States to advocate effective enforcement of intellectual      property rights in other countries and to fulfill its own      obligations under international treaties. The Intellectual      Property Protection Restoration Act of 2002 creates      reasonable incentives for States to waive their immunity in      intellectual property cases and participate in the      intellectual property marketplace on equal terms with private      parties. The bill also provides new remedies for State      infringements that rise to the level of constitutional      violations.       Sec. 1. Short Title; References. This Act may be cited as      the ``Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of      2001.''       Sec. 2. Purposes. Legislative purposes in support of this      Act.       Sec. 3. Intellectual Property Remedies Equalization. Places      States on an equal footing with private parties by      eliminating any damages remedy for infringement of State-     owned intellectual property unless the State has waived its      immunity from any damages remedy for infringement of      privately-owned intellectual property. Intellectual property      that the State owned before the enactment of this Act is not      affected.       Sec. 4. Clarification of Remedies Available for Statutory      Violations by State Officers and Employees. Affirms the      availability of injunctive relief against State officials who      violate the Federal intellectual property laws. Such relief      is authorized under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.      123 (1908), which held that an individual may sue a State      official for prospective relief requiring the State official      to cease violating federal law, even if the State itself is      immune from suit under the eleventh amendment. This section      also affirms that State officials may be personally liable      for violations of the intellectual property laws.       Sec. 5. Liability of States for Constitutional Violations      Involving Intellectual Property. Establishes a right to      compensation for State infringements of intellectual property      that rise to the level of constitutional violations.      Compensation shall be measured by the statutory remedies      available under the federal intellectual property laws, but      may not include treble damages.       Sec. 6. Rules of Construction. Establishes rules for      interpreting this Act.
