 President, I have a few closing remarks regarding the nomination of Goodwin Liu. Yesterday, I outlined my objections to this nominee in some detail. As I stated, my objections to this nominee can be summarized with five areas of concern: his controversial writings and speeches; an activist judicial philosophy; his lack of judicial temperament; his troublesome testimony and lack of candor before the committee, and his limited experience.  I hope the President will withdraw this nomination and send to the Senate a consensus nominee to fill this vacancy. We have demonstrated over and over again our cooperation in moving forward on consensus nominations. The President needs to nominate mainstream individuals, who understand the proper role of a judge.  Nominees who would bring a personal agenda or political ideology to the courtroom will have great difficulty in being confirmed.  Yesterday, a few Senators met with Mr. Liu. After that meeting, one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle made the following statement, ``The court of appeals is where law is made, and we need the finest minds in the world for that.'' I am troubled by that statement on more than one level.  First, intellect is an important element I consider in the confirmation process. Mr. Liu does have an outstanding academic record. His intellect is not the issue. The nominee himself noted there was more to being a judge than intellect. He stated, with regards to the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts, ``[t]here's no doubt Roberts has a brilliant legal mind. . . . But a Supreme Court nominee must be evaluated on more than legal intellect.''  He then voiced concerns that ``with remarkable consistency throughout his career, Roberts ha[d] applied his legal talent to further the cause of the far right.'' Mr. Liu went on, demonstrating a lack of judicial temperament, to disparage Justice Robert's views on free enterprise, private property and limited government. In my statement yesterday I made my views very clear on how I feel about Mr. Liu's remarks, so there is no reason to repeat that.  The point is, intellect is only one component. Using Mr. Liu's standards, a nominee ``must be evaluated on more than legal intellect.'' Mr. Liu does have a fine intellect, but he has used his talent to consistently promote views that are far out of the mainstream. Shortly after President Obama was elected, he said, ``Now we have the opportunity to actually get our ideas and the progressive vision of the Constitution and of law and policy into practice.'' I do not intend to give Mr. Liu that opportunity.  The second problem I have with the statement is the assertion that ``The court of appeals is where law is made.'' We have heard this view before. While serving as a circuit judge, Sonia Sotomayor stated that the court of appeals ``is where policy is made.''  Now I understand there are elements of our society who wish this were the case. Those who can not get their policy views enacted through the legislative process, as our Constitution requires, often turn to the courts. But I flatly reject this notion.  The Constitution vests the legislative power in the Congress, not the courts. Judges are simply not policymakers. The court of appeals is not where law is made. The courts are vested with the judicial power. That means they are to decide cases and controversies. They are to apply the law, not make the law.  Unfortunately, this philosophical disagreement occasionally finds its way into the debates on nominations. But let me remind the Senate where this started. Going back to the nomination of William Rehnquist in 1971, Democrats have used or attempted to use the filibuster to delay or defeat judicial nominees. Fortunately, it is a rare occasion. There have been a total of 46 cloture votes, including this one, on 32 different judicial nominations in American history. Of the 32 judicial nominees subject to cloture votes, 22 were against Republican nominated judges. Between 1971 and 2000, there were 11 cloture votes on judicial nominees. Most of those filibusters, attempted by Democrats, were unsuccessful and cloture was invoked.  However, beginning in 2002, Senate Democrats changed the rules. There were 30 cloture votes on 17 of President Bush's judicial nominees. Eight of President Bush's nominees are not on the bench because of the filibuster or threatened filibuster by Senate Democrats.  This does not include a number of Bush's nominees that were subjected to the so-called ``pocket filibuster'' in Committee by the Democratic majority in the 110th Congress, including Peter Keisler to the DC Circuit and Robert Conrad to the 4th Circuit, among others.  We hear about the notion of ``extraordinary circumstances'' as a justification or requirement for extended debate. That was an outcome of an agreement in the 109th Congress. However, even after that time, Senate Democrats have used a broad and inconsistent application of that term. Even after that agreement, Senate Democrats attempted to filibuster judicial nominees. However, they do not seem to find it applicable to the nominee before us today. I disagree. The nomination of Goodwin Liu does raise extraordinary circumstances, as I outlined in depth yesterday.  I have no personal animosity towards Mr. Liu. I recognize he has a fascinating personal story and has accomplished much. This debate is not about his ethnic background or personal history.  I wish Mr. Liu well in his academic career. But a lifetime position on the Federal bench is not where he belongs. Therefore, I will vote no on the cloture motion and urge my colleagues to do the same.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record documents in opposition to the nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 3, 2011]       Miguel Estrada on Goodwin Liu's Contemptible Mud-Flinging                             (By Ed Whelan)       More on Richard Painter's insipid argument (see point 2      here) that Goodwin Liu's attacks on the nominations of Chief      Justice Roberts and Justice Alito shouldn't be held against      him:       Former D.C. Circuit nominee Miguel Estrada, whose      unsuccessful nomination Richard Painter despicably tried to      invoke in support of his shoddy Huffington Post defense of      Liu, strongly disagrees with Painter. In an e-mail to me,      Estrada writes (emphasis added):       No one doubts that Senators from both parties have behaved      shamefully toward nominees of the other party. The treatment      of then-Judge Alito by Democratic members of the Judiciary      Committee is not yet all that far in the rear-view mirror,      and some of President Obama's nominees have waited far too      long. There is much to be said, therefore, for the      proposition that the degradation of the judicial confirmation      process is a problem that cries out for a long-term solution.      The one thing that ought to be reasonably clear, however, is      that someone who personally contributed to the sorry state of      the confirmation process, by jumping in the mud pit with both      feet and flinging the mud with both hands, is not well      positioned to demand that standards be elevated solely for      his benefit. Surely Mr. Painter can find a better case than      this to dramatize the need for reform.                                  ____                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 2, 2011]      Richard Painter's Deceptive Portrayal of Goodwin Liu--Part 1                             (By Ed Whelan)       On Huffington Post, law professor (and former Bush White      House ethics adviser) Richard Painter offers an extensive,      but badly flawed, defense of Goodwin Liu that falsely accuses      me of ``invent[ing] a series of myths about Liu with no basis      in reality.'' The opening part of Painter's essay consists of      regurgitating ill-informed or utterly conclusory endorsements      of Liu from various folks, including some conservative who      ought to know better. See, for example, my critique of the      letter that Ken Starr submitted (jointly with Akhil Amar).       Given that Liu's hearing starts soon, I'm going to race      through Painter's supposed myths in this post and the next      (in the same order as he lists them):       1. According to Painter, I have propagated the ``myth''      that ``Liu believes judges `may legitimately invent      constitutional rights to a broad range of social ``welfare''      goods, including education, shelter, subsistence, and health      care.' '' My actual quote states that Liu argues in a law-     review article that ``judges (usually in an `interstitial'      role) may legitimately invent constitutional rights to a      broad range of social `welfare' goods, including education,      shelter, subsistence, and health care.'' It's telling that      Painter has to excise the italicized parenthetical in order      to falsely accuse me of misstating Liu's views. Nor does he      address (much less take issue with) my detailed posts on the      matter.       2. According to Painter, it is a ``myth'' that Liu      ``believes in a `freewheeling constitutional approach' that      allows people `to redefine the Constitution to mean whatever      they want it to mean.' '' Painter cherry-picks the most      innocent-sounding of Liu's statements and ignores the      controversial ones. (See, for example, the material in this      post of mine.).       3. According to Painter, it is a ``myth'' that Liu ``is a      supporter of racial quotas in the schools, and he supports      school choice only insofar as it furthers that goal.'' That      is no myth, as I have documented. Painter doesn't even      address my arguments.       4. According to Painter, it is a myth that Liu ``supports      racial quotas forever.'' Painter doesn't address my argument,      and he hides behind a ridiculously narrow definition of      quotas.       5. According to Painter, it is a ``myth'' that Liu supports      ``reparations for slavery'' and a ``grandiose reparations      project.'' Painter pretends to provide a full account of      Liu's discussion of ``solutions for racial equality'' but      somehow completely omits the remarks of Liu's that I've      highlighted, including:       Then there's a further issue, which is that maybe there are      white families who were not     involved as directly or even indirectly with the slave trade,      but who still benefited from it. And then there is the whole      question, which you put on the table, about people who came      to America after, and, you know, like my family. And why is      it that this movie speaks to me so deeply yet?       And so, what I would do, I think I would draw a distinction      between a concept of guilt, which locates accountability in a      sort of limited set of wrong-doers, and, on the other hand, a      concept of responsibility, which is, I think, a more broad      suggestion that all of us, whateverour lineage, whatever our      ancestry, whatever our complicity, still have a moral duty to      . . . make things right. And that's a moral duty that's      incumbent upon everybody who inherits this nation, regardless      of whatever the history is.       And I think, to add one more point on top of that, the      exercise of that responsibility . . . necessarily requires      the answer to the question, ``What are we willing to give up      to make things right?'' Because it's gonna require us to give      up something, whether it is the seat at Harvard, the seat at      Princeton. Or is it gonna require us to give up our      segregated neighborhoods, our segregated schools? is it gonna      require us to give up our money?       Its gonna require giving up something, and so until we can      have that further conversation of what it is we're willing to      give up, I agree that the reconciliation can't fully occur.                                  ____                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 2, 2011]      Richard Painter's Deceptive Portrayal of Goodwin Liu--Part 2                             (By Ed Whelan)       I'll continue with Painter's last three supposed ``myths''      and then offer some broader comments on Painter's defense of      Liu:       6. Painter says it's a ``myth'' that Liu supports ``direct      judicial imposition of interdistrict racial-balancing      orders'' in public schools. Painter tries to give his readers      the impression that Liu accepts Milliken v. Bradley as      settled law. But he somehow doesn't disclose that Liu (in      remarks that he failed to disclose to the Senate Judiciary      Committee) called for Milliken to ``be swept into the dustbin      of history.''       7. Painter says it's a ``myth'' that Liu supports ``using      foreign law to redefine the Constitution.'' Painter relies      entirely on Liu's self-serving confirmation testimony and      clips a passage to omit the fact that Liu wrote in 2006 that      it ``is difficult for [him] to grasp'' how anyone could      resist the ``use of foreign authority in American      constitutional law.''       8. Painter says it's a ``myth'' that Liu supports ``the      invention of a federal constitutional right to same-sex      marriage.'' I addressed this matter in detail just yesterday      and fully stand by my account. (Painter falsely attributes to      me the claim that Liu's amicus brief in the California      supreme court was ``truly an argument under the U.S.      Constitution.'')       I'll briefly add some closing comments:       If Painter were really interested in a real debate on Liu,      he wouldn't have waited until the day of the hearing to      launch his shoddy attack on me. He could have done so at any      time over the last eight months. Instead, he's tried to gain      some tactical advantage by depriving me of a fair opportunity      to respond. (I've had to write these responsive posts within      the space of two hours or so of discovering Painter's essay,      and I'm sure that there's much that I would say better, or      more fully, if I had time.)       Painter claims to have ``reached the conclusion that Liu      deserves an up-or-down vote in the Senate and ought to be      confirmed'' only after ``reading Liu's writings [and]      watching his testimony?'' But the fact of the matter is that      Painter, evidently suffering a severe case of battered-     conservative-academic syndrome, raced onto the Liu bandwagon      without having any understanding of what was at issue, and      (both now and in a previous op-ed) he has resolutely ignored      or distorted the many highly problematic aspects of Liu's      record.                                  ____                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 3, 2011]      Richard Painter's Deceptive Portrayal of Goodwin Liu--Part 3                             (By Ed Whelan)       I'll limit myself to a couple of additional observations      (beyond my Part I and Part 2 posts) on Richard. Painter's      deeply defective Huffington Post defense of Goodwin Liu:       1. In addition to failing to confront my actual arguments,      Painter relies heavily on the argument-by-authority fallacy.      As he puts it:       ``Now, you can believe the top experts in the areas of      Liu's scholarship and prominent conservatives such as Ken      Starr and Clint Bolick--or you can believe National Review      Online's Ed Whelan. I know where I would put my marbles.''       Set aside that Painter, having evidently lost his marbles,      would have to find them first before he could put them      anywhere. Painter leaves the false impression that folks like      Starr and Bolick have actually responded to my critiques of      Liu and of their misunderstandings of his record. So far as      I'm aware, they haven't.       (It's also amusing that Painter can't even be evenhanded in      his mistaken argument by authority. While he invokes various      credentials of Liu supporters, he identifies me only as      ``National Review Online's Ed Whelan.'')       2. Towards the end of his piece, Painter tries to dismiss      the relevance of Liu's demagogic and irresponsible arguments      against the confirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and      Justice Alito. According to Painter, ``[i]t is critically      important . . . that people feel free to speak their minds      about Supreme Court and other judicial nominations without      fear of retribution.'' But as I explained ten months ago when      Painter made the same bad argument, Painter completely misses      the point: The shoddy quality of Liu's opposition to Roberts      and Alito reflects very poorly on him. There is no reason to      encourage cheap attacks like Liu's by not holding him      accountable.                                  ____                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 3, 2011]              Painter Shouldn't Distort Whelan's Arguments                             (By John Yoo)       I've seen Richard Painter's post criticizing Ed Whelan for      his posts on the nomination of Goodwin Liu. Painter      accurately reports that I've said that Liu (a colleague of      mine at Berkeley Law) is a good nominee to the Ninth Circuit      for a Democratic president. However, I don't want that to be      thought of as endorsing, in any way, what Painter says about      Ed's writings on Liu.       What bothers me about Painter's post is that he accuses Ed      of distorting Liu's record, but I believe that that's what he      has done to Ed. He should provide in full or link to Ed's      criticisms of Liu and let the reader decide, rather than      describing (or misdescribing) and dismissing Ed's posts in a      short sentence or two. I don't think the Painter post is fair      on this point. To me, such posts actually may hurt Liu if it      appears that his supporters are not fully engaging his      critics and their best arguments.                                  ____                [From nationalreview.com, Mar. 10, 2011]             Clint Bolick: Richard Painter Is ``Off-Base''                             (By Ed Whelan)       A follow-up to my refutation (Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3)      of Richard Painter's smears against me in his deeply      defective Huffington Post defense of Ninth Circuit nominee      Goodwin Liu:       Clint Bolick, whose support for Liu Painter cites      repeatedly, has invited me to publish this statement of his:       Although Ed Whelan and I have taken different positions on      the judicial nomination of Prof. Goodwin Liu, I believe that      Richard Painter has mischaracterized a number of Ed Whelan's      arguments as ``myths.'' In particular, Painter's assertions      are off the mark regarding Whelan's criticisms of Liu on the      creation of welfare rights, reparations, racial balancing,      and the use of foreign law. Obviously, opinions vary      regarding the merits of the nomination, but Painter is off-     base on several crucial assertions.       Given our bottom-line differences on the Liu nomination, I      am particularly grateful to Clint Bolick, as I also am to      John Yoo, for standing up against Painter's smears. It's      striking that two of the very small number of conservatives      that Painter relies on for their support of Liu have      repudiated Painter (versus zero, so far as I'm aware, who      have endorsed his smears). Further, another conservative,      Miguel Estrada, whose own nomination battle Painter tried to      use in support of Liu, has emphatically condemned Liu's      mudslinging against the Roberts and Alito nominations.       At this point, it should be clear that it would be reckless      at best for anyone to accept Painter's propositions at face      value. I am not arguing that the reader must accept my word      on Painter (or Bolick's or Yoo's) or on Liu. Rather, the      interested reader should carefully examine the competing      accounts (both on the matters that Bolick identifies above      and on those he doesn't address) and determine who has argued      responsibly and effectively and who hasn't. I am confident of      the judgment that the intelligent and fair-minded reader will      reach.                                  ____          Confused Amar/Starr Letter in Support of Goodwin Liu                             (By Ed Whelan)       Law professors Akhil Reed Amar and Kenneth W. Starr have      sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a badly confused letter      in support of Goodwin Liu's nomination to the Ninth Circuit.      The core of their letter is dedicated to the proposition that      Liu has ``independence and openness to diverse viewpoints as      well as [the] ability to follow the facts and the law to      their logical conclusion, whatever its political valence may      be'' (or, as they later put it, the ``ability to discharge      faithfully an abiding duty to follow the law'').       Amar and Starr offer two examples in purported support of      their proposition, but neither helps. First, they cite Liu's      limited support of school-choice programs. As I've explained,      Liu supports school-choice programs only insofar as they      advance racial quotas. Once one understands that (and there's      no indication that Amar and Starr do), it's difficult to see      how Liu's position on school choice evidences his      ``independence and openness to diverse viewpoints,'' and his      position certainly has no relation to his supposed ``ability      to follow the facts and the law to their logical      conclusion.''       Second, Amar and Starr cite Liu's correct prediction that      the California supreme court would uphold Proposition 8      ``under applicable precedents'' (their phrase). They assert     that his correct prediction shows that Liu ``knows the      difference between what the law is and what he might wish it      to be.'' But this is a glaring non sequitur. Liu wasn't      stating how he would rule; he was predicting how the      California supreme court would. Moreover, in an op-ed, Liu      stated that the challenge to Proposition 8 was a ``good      argument, but one that faces difficult precedents,'' and he      argued that ``there are good reasons for the California      Supreme Court to rethink its jurisprudence in this area.'' So      much for his ``know[ing] the difference between what the law      is and what he might wish it to be.''       Amar's and Starr's assertion of Liu's ``ability to follow      the facts and the law to their logical conclusion'' is also      curious, as it's not really his ``ability'' that anyone has      questioned. It's his willingness and commitment. Further,      anyone familiar with Liu's gauzy constitutional theorizing      would recognize that the whole concept of following the law      doesn't have much substance in his framework. Take, for      example:       The problem for courts is to determine, at the moment of      decision, whether our collective values on a given issue have      converged to a degree that they can be persuasively      crystallized and credibly absorbed into legal doctrine. This      difficult task requires keen attention to the trajectory of      social norms reflected in public policies, institutions, and      practices, as well as predictive judgment as to how a      judicial decision may help forge or frustrate a social      consensus.       It is, of course, theoretically possible that someone who      advocates a freewheeling judicial role could himself be quite      scrupulous in following a whole body of precedent that he      detests. But Amar and Starr provide zero reason for anyone to      believe that Liu would carry out the judicial role in that      manner, and there is nothing in his record to support      speculation that he would.
