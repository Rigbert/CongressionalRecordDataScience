President, as I said earlier, this is dangerously close to debate in the Senate, and I am glad we are doing it. My feeling is this: When you say: What are you entitled to? Well, we are entitled to be protected from discrimination. That is an entitlement to every American. We are entitled to be protected from discrimination. And the 1964 Civil Rights Act says one of the things you cannot be discriminated against is your national origin, where you were born. We say in America, no, you cannot be discriminated against based on national origin. And based on that provision in the Civil Rights Act, we will provide, when it comes to essential services, appropriate language assistance to help those who are availing themselves of the services.  As I said earlier, in Chicago, that may be Polish or a Filipino dialect. But basically what we have said is, yes, you are entitled not to be discriminated against.  Now, if the Senator wants to wipe away that entitlement, he should make it clear. But I am not sure that he wants to. If he does, I hope he will say so.
