President.  Without the amendment that the Senator from Arizona and I are offering, all of those legislatures that I mentioned specifically, which we talked about initially more than an hour ago, are going to have to act immediately in order to carry out the spirit of this commission. I can't believe that is what the Senate wants, and I am very hopeful that the Senators will join groups like the National Retail Federation, the Information Industry Association, the Home Business Association, and scores of other small business groups supporting the amendment.
