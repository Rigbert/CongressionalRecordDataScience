I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, undercover videos show and expose Planned Parenthood directors cheerfully talking about dismemberment and crushing babies to death all while altering abortion methods in a way that preserves organs and body parts for sale.  Watch the videos.  One senior director who talks about preserving a liver says they use ultrasound guidance because that is where they will know where to put the forceps. Of course, forceps are used to literally rip the child to pieces in what is called a dismemberment abortion.  One technician, Holly O'Donnell, talks about getting brain tissue. She said her supervisor ``gave me the scissors and told me that I had to cut down the middle of the face. I can't even describe,'' she says, ``what that feels like.''  Some of our colleagues on the other side have said that there is no evidence. Watch the videos. There is ample evidence.  I would suggest and I would ask Congresswoman Castor to join us in a letter that asks the Attorney General of the United States to investigate this. Will you?  I yield to the gentlewoman.
