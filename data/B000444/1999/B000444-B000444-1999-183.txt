 President, today I am submitting a resolution designating October 15, 1999, as ``National Mammography Day''. I have submitted a similar resolution each year since 1993, and on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for the fight against breast cancer by approving it.  Each year, as I prepare to submit this resolution, I look at the latest information from the American Cancer Society about breast cancer. This year, the news is depressingly familiar: in 1999, an estimated 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and an estimated 43,300 women will die of this disease.  In the midst of these gloomy numbers, however, one statistic stands out like a beacon of hope: the 5-year survival rate for women with localized breast cancer is a whopping 97%. Moreover, we already know one sure-fire method for detecting breast cancer when it is at this early, highly curable stage: periodic mammograms for all women over age 40. Periodic mammography can detect a breast cancer almost 2 years earlier than it would have been detected by breast self-examination. The importance of periodic mammography for women's health is recognized by health plans and health insurers, and virtually all of them cover its cost. Low-income women who do not have health insurance can get free mammograms through a breast cancer screening program sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Given all this, that modern mammography is highly effective in discovering breast cancer at a very early stage, rarely causes any discomfort, and generally cost nothing, why aren't all women over 40 getting this valuable test every year? One answer is that we are human, and we all forget things, especially as we get older. Even if we remember that we need a mammogram, we often have so many things going on in our lives that we just keep putting the mammogram off for that ``less busy'' day that never comes. Consequently, we need a ``National Mammography Day'' to remind us that we need to make sure all the women in our lives don't overlook this crucial preventive service.  How should we use ``National Mammography Day'' to achieve our goal of fighting breast cancer through early diagnosis? This year, National Mammography Day falls on Friday, October 15, right in the middle of National Breast Cancer Awareness month. On that day, let's make sure that each women we know picks a specific date on which to get a mammogram each year. I well understand how easy it is to forget do something that comes around only once per year, but for each of us there are certainly some dates that we don't forget: a child's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day our taxes are due. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of these dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, your wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to get a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself and for the others that love you and want you to be part of their lives for as long as possible.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast cancer by cosponsoring this resolution to designate October 15, 1999, as National Mammography Day.                          ____________________
