Madam Speaker, last week I visited six schools in Atlanta: Inman Park Preschool, Morningside, Adamsville, Cook Elementary School, Walden Middle School, and Grady High School. What parents, teachers, administrators, and students all told me was we should not allow Republicans to take money away from our public schools and give it to private and religious schools.  Madam Speaker, the American people want strong public schools, not private school vouchers for a privileged few. Nine out of 10 children attend public schools. Each and every one deserves a first-class education. That is why Democrats want to invest in public schools.  What do the Republicans propose? Abolish the Department of Education, divert resources to private and religious schools. And today we consider a sneaky plan that uses the Tax Code to undermine support for public schools.  Madam Speaker, our children deserve better than easy schemes and quick-fix solutions. Stop scheming and invest in public education.                          ____________________
