Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable American, Mr. Jim Findlay, who has proudly served our Nation as an Air Force veteran and our Toledo community throughout his life as a successful entrepreneur, extraordinary philanthropist, and a true friend to so many.  Jim Findlay is the epitome of a gentleman. His influence and compassion have impacted the lives of thousands. He served as a coach to our youth, a mentor to our young adults. He is always there for those who seek a champion for their causes. His support of local initiatives is deep and legendary. He has been the fundraising chair for so many activities, a 70-year member of Glenwood Lutheran Church, and a founding board member of the House of Emmanuel.  Jim attended Scott High School, then the University of Toledo where he began his lifelong love affair with the UT Rockets, as well as with 1947 Homecoming Queen Celia Koontz Findlay. He and Celia were married for more than 50 years until her passing in 2004. His loving care for her during her prolonged illness inspired all who knew them. Jim is a dedicated family man to his children--Jim, Jr., Sarah, Jon--a beloved grandfather to Ally and Jonathon, and a wonderful companion to PJ Schaefer.  Jim founded Impact Products, and upon his retirement--in typical Jim Findlay fashion--he gave the company to his employees. The company's name, Impact, is a testament to the impact that one person can selflessly make on the lives of so many.  We, the family of Toledo and northwest Ohio, are blessed and honored to know and to pay tribute to our dear friend, Jim Findlay, who, in good times and in times of great struggle, teaches us by way of his courageous and generous example. May blessings flow to Jim now and to his loved ones.  We love you, Jim, now and always, and we thank you.                          ____________________
