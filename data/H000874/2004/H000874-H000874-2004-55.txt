 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I just have to slightly disagree with the gentleman in that the house that is colored white, I cannot say they have agreed to the number of the bill, but I do know that they played a significant part in holding down the spending on the bill and particularly spending that would add to the deficit. And I must say, without getting into a lot of detail, that has been set aside. The other body is just having problems coming to some agreement amongst themselves. We are ready to move on our side. I serve on the conference committee. We are ready to move in the House. Unfortunately, the other body is not ready.
