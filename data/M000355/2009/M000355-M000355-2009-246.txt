The Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce recently was named      the best chamber of its size in the nation, chamber officials      announced today.       ``I can't tell you what a great feeling it is to say we're      the No. 1 chamber in the nation,'' said Jim Hizer, president      and CEO of the Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce.       Each year, the American Chamber of Commerce Executives, a      national group of chamber leaders, chooses the top chambers      in the nation. Chambers are separated into three categories      based on their revenue; the Bowling Green Area Chamber of      Commerce won in the mid-size category, beating about 45      chambers that were invited to apply for the award.       When choosing the top chamber of commerce, ACCE officials      look at ``the entire scope of the chamber, from its financial      practices all the way to programs and special events,'' said      Tonya Matthews, vice president of chamber operations. ``They      really don't miss a beat in digging into the chamber.''       This is the second year the local chamber has been a      finalist--last year, it was one of the top three chambers,      but did not pick up the top award.       ``All I was thinking about was to be a finalist two years      in a row and not come home with an award would be an empty      feeling,'' Hizer said. ``But we don't have to worry about      that.'' The chamber of commerce works to boost the business      community by attracting new companies to the area and helping      existing businesses expand.       ``Our principle responsibility is to bring wealth and      prosperity to our community for the benefit of our business      members, partners and for all citizens,'' Hizer said.       About 7,000 chambers exist in the United States and 1,400      of those are members of the ACCE. This year, two other cities      that sit along Interstate 65 won ACCE awards--Nashville's      chamber won the large division and Columbus, Ind., won the      small division, according to the chamber.       In 2008, about 26 businesses either located or expanded      operations in the Barren River area with a total investment      of about $105 million and 2,092 additional jobs, according      the chamber.       And because of its new businesses and expansion efforts,      southcentral Kentucky received several national recognitions      last year--the area was named by Forbes Magazine the 12th      best small place in the area for businesses and careers. It      was also ranked 33rd of 363 metropolitan areas in job growth      and employment.       ``The fact that the Bowling Green metropolitan area, by      virtually every measure, has been . . . the fastest growing      metropolitan area in the state of Kentucky, is evidence that      we are achieving our objective in spite of a challenging      economic environment,'' Hizer said.       As for future economic development, the ACCE award will      help attract new businesses and convince existing businesses      to consolidate here or expand, Hizer said.       ``This sent a message to the rest of the world that there      are some special things happening here in southcentral      Kentucky,'' Hizer said. ``And that in and of itself will draw      additional interest to our community.''
