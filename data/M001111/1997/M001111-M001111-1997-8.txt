 President, I rise join the Washington World Affairs Council in congratulating Ambassador Booth Gardner on his selection as the 1997 recipient of the World Citizen Award.  The World Affairs Council is a 1,200 member nonprofit organization of business and community leaders with more than 40 years of experience bringing the world to Washington State. From the widely popular Public Programs, which includes the annual lecture series to the nationally recognized International Visitors Program, the World Affairs Council has been an instrumental force in bringing together varied and diverse cultures as well as exposing Washington State to changing political environments around the globe and the importance of international trade.  Booth Gardner was first elected to public office in 1972 where he served 3 years as a State senator followed by election as Pierce County Executive in 1980. In 1984, Booth Gardner realized his boyhood dream with his election to Washington's governorship. A widely popular Governor, Booth was re-elected to a second term in 1988.  As Governor of the most trade dependant State in the Nation, Governor Gardner was exposed on numerous occasions to the importance of international cooperation and negotiation. Trade missions to Europe and Asia allowed Governor Gardner to boost Washington's ties abroad creating new business, cultural, and educational opportunities.  After completing his second term, Governor Gardner was appointed by the newly elected President Clinton to become the first U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization. Assuming the much deserved title of Ambassador, Booth Gardner played a major role in shaping this important organization and particularly representing U.S. interests. Throughout his service to the WTO, he carefully balanced the needs of the United States with the goals of multilateral cooperation. Ambassador Gardner set the standard for U.S. participation at the WTO.  Congratulations Ambassador Booth Gardner. Your public service from Washington State to capital cities throughout the world makes all of Washington very proud.                          ____________________
