Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Lowey amendment, which strikes language in the bill that protects States from being forced to alter their State laws or constitutions to pay for abortions. We defeated this motion last August and I urge defeat of it again today.  At least 12 States have been sued by the abortionists because of the administration's twisted interpretations of the 1993 Hyde amendment, which Members should recall allowed but did not require taxpayer funding for abortions in cases of rape and incest. A dozen more States acquiesced rather than face litigation from the abortion industry.  The Clinton order has had some disastrous consequences in some States. For example, in Arkansas the people voted and approved a State constitutional amendment endorsed by then Gov. Bill Clinton to prohibit State funding of abortion except to save the life of the mother. A Federal judge, however, has set aside the entire constitutional amendment because in the view of the judge it conflicts with Federal law, thus ordering that State to pay for abortions on demand.  I do not think anybody wants to be part of that, having that State being forced to underwrite and subsidize the cost for all abortions. The Clinton order has also invalidated the State laws of Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming that contained a requirement that rape or incest be reported to a law enforcement agency. I happen to believe that that isa modest request when the death of the baby is being procured. We should be trying to apprehend and hopefully prosecute these people who commit these heinous crimes of rape, rather than let them get off the hook in terms of the reporting requirement.                              {time}  1500  I would hope all States that have any kind of rape or incest would have that kind of requirement. These have been nullified by the Clinton order.
