Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very eloquent remarks.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson), who serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee. He has long pushed for transparency and led a landmark effort on Federal payments to Federal abortions providers. He recently led an amicus brief supporting his State's right not to be forced to fund Planned Parenthood.
