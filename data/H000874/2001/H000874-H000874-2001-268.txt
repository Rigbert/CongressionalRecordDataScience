Speaker, I rise today to give recognition to Charles County public schools. The Charles County public schools received the Daisy Bates National School District Award for its minority achievement program. Under the direction of Superintendent James E. Richmond, Charles County public schools have made the success of all students a major priority, and addressing the performance of minority students is a major component of this effort. Charles County public schools has developed a 5-year plan for academic achievement, personal responsibility,and career readiness. In this plan, everyone is responsible for successful attainment of the objectives. The superintendent, board members, instructional staff, principals, certificated and support staff, all play major roles in addressing the ``success for all'' approach.  Designing programs that best meet the needs of the students is a major key of their success. In order to make programs like these work, systems must first look at the needs of the students and then develop the programs. Charles County public schools sought to fit the program to the students, not the students to the program. Their programs are successful because of the dedication and commitment of their teachers. They truly believe that all children can and will learn to read if given instruction and additional time to read and write in an environment that supports and challenges them. This system provides continuous training for teachers and assistants, limits class size, and provides current, appealing, and appropriate materials for their schools.  Mr. Speaker, and colleagues, please join with me in wishing the Charles County public schools continued success and congratulations on their achievements toward the academic success of their students.                          ____________________
