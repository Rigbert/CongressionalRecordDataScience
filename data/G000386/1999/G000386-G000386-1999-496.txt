 President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of1999 with my colleague, Senator Reid. This legislation will enable seniors to receive medically necessary rehabilitative services based on their condition and health and not on arbitrary payment limits. We introduced similar legislation last Congress.  The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 is a very important accomplishment and one that I am proud to say I supported. However, in our rush to save the Medicare Trust Fund from bankruptcy, Congress neglected to thoroughly evaluate the impact the new payment limits on rehabilitative services would have on Medicare beneficiaries.  The BBA included a $1500 cap on occupational, physical and speech-language pathology therapy services received outside a hospital setting. This provision became effective January 1, 1999, and after just 31 days of implementation, an estimated one in four beneficiaries had exhausted half of their yearly benefit. According to a recent study, these limitations on services will harm almost 13 percent or 750,000 of Medicare beneficiaries because these individuals will exceed the cap. While many seniors will not need services that would cause them to exceed the $1500 cap, others, like stroke victims and patients with Parkinson's disease, will likely need services beyond what the arbitrary caps will cover. Unfortunately, it is those beneficiaries who need rehabilitative care the most who will be penalized by being forced to pay the entire cost for these services outside of a hospital setting.  The bill I am introducing would establish certain exceptions to the $1500 cap, for beneficiaries who have medical needs that require more intensive treatment than this benefit limit would allow. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services would be required to implement the exceptions, and providers would be required to demonstrate medical necessity based on the criteria outlined in the bill. In essence, the bill attempts to accomplish the primary goal of the $1500 cap, budgetary savings, but without harming the Medicare beneficiary. Payment is based on the patient's condition and not on an arbitrary monetary amount. Help us provide access to services for those beneficiaries who will need these services or risk further complications, establish a system that makes sense, and still achieve the budget savings sought from the BBA without reducing Medicare benefits.  Please join me and my colleagues in passing this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and additional materials be printed in the Record.                                 S. 472       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Rehabilitation      Benefit Improvement Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To provide certain medicare beneficiaries with an      exemption to the financial limitations imposed on physical,      speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy services      under section 1833(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.      1395l(g)).       (2) To direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to      conduct a study on the implementation of such exemption and      to submit a report to Congress that includes recommendations      regarding alternatives to such financial limitations.     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF EXEMPTION TO CAP ON PHYSICAL,                    SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY, AND OCCUPATIONAL                    THERAPY SERVICES.       (a) In General.--Section 1833(g) of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 1395l(g)) is amended by adding at the end the      following:       ``(4)(A) The limitations in this subsection shall not apply      to an individual described in subparagraph (B).       ``(B) An individual described in this subparagraph is an      individual that meets any of the following criteria:       ``(i) The individual has received services described in      paragraph (1) or (3) in a calendar year and is subsequently      diagnosed with an illness, injury, or disability that      requires the provision in such year of additional such      services that are medically necessary.       ``(ii) The individual has a diagnosis that requires the      provision of services described in paragraph (1) or (3) and      an additional diagnosis or incident that exacerbates the      individual's condition, thereby requiring the provision of      additional such services.       ``(iii) The individual will require hospitalization if the      individual does not receive the services described in      paragraph (1) or (3).       ``(iv) The individual meets other criteria that the      Secretary determines are appropriate.       ``(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as      affecting any requirement for, or limitation on, payment      under this title (other than the financial limitation under      this subsection).       ``(D) Any service that is covered under this title by      reason of this paragraph shall be subject to the same      reasonable and necessary requirement under section 1862(a)(1)      that is applicable to the services described in paragraph (1)      or (3) that are covered under this title without regard to      this paragraph.''.       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Paragraphs (1) and (3) of      section 1833(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.      1395l(g)) are each amended by striking ``In the case'' and      inserting ``Subject to paragraph (4), in the case''.       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to services provided on or after the date of      enactment of this Act.     SEC. 4. STUDY AND REPORT TO CONGRESS.       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services      shall conduct a study on the amendments to section 1833(g) of      the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(g)) made by section      3 of this Act, including a study of--       (1) the number of medicare beneficiaries that receive      exemptions under paragraph (4) of such section (as added by      section 3);       (2) the diagnoses of such beneficiaries;       (3) the types of physical, speech-language pathology, and      occupational therapy services that are covered under the      medicare program because of such exemptions;       (4) the settings in which such services are provided; and       (5) the number of medicare beneficiaries that reach the      financial limitation under section 1833(g) of the Social      Security Act in a year (without regard to the amendments to      such section made by section 3 of this Act) and subsequently      receive physical, speech-language pathology, or occupational      therapy services in such year at an outpatient hospital      department.       (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human      Services shall submit a detailed report to Congress on the      study conducted pursuant to paragraph (1), and shall include      in the report recommendations regarding alternatives to the      financial limitations on physical, speech-language pathology,      and occupational therapy services under section 1833(g) of      the Social Security Act and any other recommendations      determined appropriate by the Secretary. Such report shall be      included in the report required to be submitted to Congress      pursuant to section 4541(d)(2) of the Balanced Budget Act of      1997 (42 U.S.C. 1395l note).                                  ____    Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999--Summary       This bill will provide certain Medicare beneficiaries with      an exemption based on medical necessity to the financial      limitation imposed on physical, speech-language pathology,      and occupational therapy services under part B of the      Medicare program. It will also direct the Secretary of Health      and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study on the      implementation of such an exemption, and then submit a report      to Congress that includes recommendations regarding      alternatives to such financial limitations.       The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 imposed a $1500 cap      on all therapy effective January 1, 1999. There is a combined      $1500 cap for physical and speech-language pathology and a      separate $1500 cap on occupational therapy services received      outside a hospital setting. An estimated 750,000      beneficiaries will reach the cap this year. These patients      may be victims of stroke, brain-injury, or other serious      conditions requiring additional services.       This bill establishes certain criteria in order for      Medicare beneficiaries to be eligible for an exemption from      the $1500 cap and allows the Secretary of HHS to establish      additional criteria if necessary. The criteria include:       (1) the beneficiary must be diagnosed with an illness,      injury, or disability that requires additional physical,      speech-language pathology, or occupational therapy services      that are medically necessary in a calender year, or       (2) the beneficiary has a diagnosis that requires such      therapy services and has an additional diagnosis or incident      that exacerbates his/her condition (ie: diabetes), which      would require more services, or       (3) the beneficiary will require hospitalization if he/she      does not receive the necessary therapy services, or       (4) the beneficiary meets other requirements determined by      the Secretary of HHS.       The bill also requires the Secretary of HHS to conduct a      study and to report to Congress two years after the date of      enactment of this Act. This study will include:       (1) the number of Medicare beneficiaries that receive      exemptions to the cap;       (2) the diagnoses of the beneficiaries;       (3) the types of therapy services that are covered due to      such exemptions;       (4) the settings in which services are provided; and       (5) the number of beneficiaries that reach the $1500 cap.                                  ____                                         American Speech-Language-                                          Hearing Association,                                 Rockville, MD, February 19, 1999.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington,          DC       Dear Chairman Grassley: The American Speech-Language-     Hearing Association     (ASHA) is pleased to support the ``Medicare Rehabilitation      Benefit Improvement Act of 1999.'' ASHA is the professional      and scientific organization of more than 96,000 speech-     language pathologists, audiologists, and speech, language,      hearing scientists. Our members provide services in a number      of practice settings, including hospitals, clinics, private      practice, and home health agencies.       There is a clear need for exemptions from the Medicare      financial limitations for beneficiaries receiving outpatient      rehabilitation services. Since the provision went into effect      on January 1, 1999, ASHA has received numerous calls and      letters of concern from our members regarding the problems      created by the financial limitation. Patients are actually      refusing medically necessary treatment for fear that they may      have a more acute episode or injury later in the year and      want to keep their $1500 ``banked'' for such a possibility.      Essentially, the cap's arbitrary limit is indirectly forcing      patients to inappropriately ration needed care that we      believe will ultimately cost the Medicare program more.       A patient who requires both speech-language pathology      services and physical therapy services is placed in a true      dilemma. If the patient who has suffered a stroke chooses to      receive speech-language pathology services, the patient may      not have sufficient funding for physical therapy at the      conclusion of the speech-language pathology treatment.      Conversely, the patient who selects physical therapy may not      have adequate funding for the speech-language pathology      services. A third situation arises when the patient receives      both rehabilitation services concurrently and the programs      for both are inadequate because the financial limitation is      not sufficient for receipt of both health care services.       I am enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to Congress      that ASHA received early this year from a family member whose      mother is receiving speech-language pathology services for a      swallowing disorder. Ms. Carol Eller McCaffrey of Lawrence,      Kansas, begins her letter with:       ``I am the daughter of an 87-year-old woman whose brain      stem stroke left her unable to swallow or speak well and      weakened her right side, and whose quality of life will      suffer greatly with $1500 Medicare cap.       ``The new cap will all but completely discontinue . . .      treatment thus requiring increased hydration through an      alternative feeding tube which we have left intact for these      emergencies. Taking away the very important . . . therapy      causes the need for more nursing care. Also, her quality of      life is `down the tubes' when mother is unable to eat and      drink comfortably.''       This is but one example of the problems that arise because      of the arbitrary Medicare financial limitation. As 1999      progresses, there will undoubtedly be more examples of      difficulties caused by the cap unless legislation such as      yours can restore reasonable benefits in the program.       The members of the American Speech-Language-Hearing      Association are committed to improving the health and safety      of those who suffer communication and related disorders. Your      legislation will make it possible for more Americans to      receive the care they need. ASHA commends you for your      efforts to seek a remedy to the cap that ensures patient      access to medically-needed services through the ``Medicare      Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999.''           Sincerely,                                                    Donna Geffner,     President.                                  ____                                                  January 1, 1999.       Honorable Congressional Leaders: I am not a professional in      the medical world nor am I very knowledgeable about the      logistics of medicare. I am the daughter of an 87 year old      woman whose brain stem stroke left her unable to swallow or      speak well and weakened her right side and whose quality of      life will suffer greatly with the $1500.00 medicare gap.       With them help of our speech and physical therapists,      Mother has come a long way. Although she still doesn't speak      well, she eats normal food in the dining room with fellow      residents. Mother has a problem with thin liquids that causes      choking and probable aspiration. A new treatment called Deep      Pharyngeal Neuromuscular Stimulation (DPNS) is being taught;      our speech therapist has treated Mom with DPNS, resulting in      a 90% improvement. In my mother's case, the problem is that      several months after treatment, the benefits wear off.      Periodically, Mother needs another round of DPNS.       The new cap will all but completely discontinue this      treatment thus requiring increased hydration through an      alternative feeding tube which we have left intact for these      emergencies. Taking away the very important DPNS therapy      causes the need for more nursing care. Also, her life quality      of life is ``down the tubes'' when mother is unable to eat      and drink comfortably.       Mom also needs continual assertive physical therapy to keep      her strength up but the guidelines, even before the medical      cap, require a decrease in her function to qualify for      treatment. So, periodically, as Mother weakens, therapists      have to start over. This seems backwards to me. I thought      that as a nation, we were making great strides in the care of      our elderly and disabled. In my opinion, the recent medicare      cap is a huge backslide. Does the left hand of the government      know what the right hand is doing? And look who's suffering?      Obviously those making the rules have not had personal      experiences in this area.       The paperwork for all medical personnel is already      overwhelming. Our professionals are spending more time with      paper than with patients! All this, I presume, to try and      thwart cheaters. I feel the cheaters are the minority and it      all comes down to punishing the patients.       You are smart people. Come up with a reasonable way to deal      with this situation without losing sight of what is truly      important--the patients.       Private pay is exorbitant--Have you checked? There is no      way normal families can take up where medicare leaves off.       Please, rethink this decision to cap medicare part B      benefits. It is, after all, this particular generation who      have supported the US Government through thick and thin.      Don't let them down, visit nursing home/ care facilities.      Speak with hard working, caring therapists and the red,      white, and blue Americans who need your help. It is in your      own best interests * * * you'll be there yourself one day.           Sincerely,     Carol Eller McCaffrey.                                  ____                                                 American Physical                                          Therapy Association,                                Alexandria, VA, February 22, 1999.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington, DC.       Chairman Grassley: On behalf of the more than 74,000      members of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA)      and the patients our members serve, I am writing to express      our strong support and appreciation for your leadership in      introducing the ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement      Act of 1999.''       As you know, section 4541(c) of the Balanced Budget Act of      1997 imposes annual caps of $1,500 per beneficiary on all      outpatient rehabilitation services except those furnished in      a hospital outpatient department. The new law has been      interpreted to establish two separate limits--$1,500 cap for      physical therapy and speech-language pathology services and a      separate $1,500 cap for occupational therapy services. These      limits are effective for services rendered on or after      January 1, 1999.       APTA maintains concern with the impact this limitation on      services will have on Medicare beneficiaries who require      physical therapy treatment. Senior citizens and disabled      citizens eligible for Medicare benefits suffering from a      range of conditions including stroke, hip fracture,      Parkinson's Disease, cerebral palsy and other serious      conditions that require extensive rehabilitation may not be      able to access the care they require to resume normal      activities of daily living due to the present limitation on      coverage. Enactment of your legislation provides the      Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services      the authority to establish exceptions to the present $1,500      cap for patients with conditions that would likely exceed      such a limitation on coverage. APTA applauds the inclusion of      this provision.       APTA maintains concern that the $1,500 cap is completely      arbitrary and bears no relation to the medical condition of      the patient nor the health outcomes of the rehabilitation      services. There exists absolutely no medical or empirical      justification for such a cap. The caps are by definition      completely insensitive to patients with chronic injuries and      illness or who have multiple episodes of care in a given      calendar year. Enactment of your legislation would provide      relief from the $1,500 annual cap for Medicare beneficiaries      who experience multiple episodes of care in a given calendar      year for services that are deemed medically necessary. APTA      applauds the inclusion of this provision.       APTA maintains concern that the $1,500 cap dramatically      reduces Medicare beneficiaries' choice of care giver. Under      the present statute, beneficiaries who have exceeded their      cap in need of additional rehabilitation services are      restricted from receiving care from facilities other than      outpatient hospital departments. This restriction is a      notable step backward in Congress' efforts to expand access      to care, especially in rural and urban underserved      communities. Enactment of your legislation would better      ensure access to a wide range of community settings in which      Medicare beneficiaries could receive care, to include      rehabilitation agencies, Comprehensive Outpatient      Rehabilitation Facilities, and physical therapy private      practices. APTA applauds the inclusion of this provision.       Lastly, APTA continues to object to the inclusion of      physical therapy and speech-language pathology under the same      $1,500 cap. Confusion has surrounded the interpretation of      how the $1,500 cap is to be applied. As the Medicare Policy      Advisory Committee (MedPAC) reported to Congress in its July      1998 report, 70 percent of outpatient therapy expenditures      under the program are for physical therapy services, while 21      percent are for occupational therapy, and 9 percent for      speech therapy. The combination of physical therapy and      speech therapy has no rational basis. Speech therapy is a      distinct and separate benefit provided under the Medicare      program and should not be included as a part of the physical      therapy benefit. While your legislation does not clarify this      issue, APTA is hopeful that Congress will address this issue      with common sense clarifications as it considers Medicare      revisions this year. APTA will continue to work with you to      achieve this end.       Physical therapists across Iowa and the nation applaud your      leadership on this important issue. Passage of the Medicare      Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999 can ensure      that patients in need of outpatient physical therapy services      receive appropriate care in the setting of their choice      without the fear of exceeding their coverage. APTA stands      ready to assist you in any way to ensure that swift enactment      of this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                              Nancy Garland, Esq.,     Director of Government Affairs.                                  ____                             American Health Care Association,                                Washington, DC, February 24, 1999.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the American Health      Care Association, long term care providers, and those for      whom we provide care, I'm writing you to commend you on your      leadership in introducing legislation designed to protect      America's most frail and elderly from the adverse effects of      arbitrary caps on certain medical services.       One of the provisions contained in the 1997 Balanced Budget      Act (BBA) has the potential to harm senior citizens who rely      on Medicare for their health care needs. Congress changed      Medicare by imposing arbitrary annual limits of $1500 for      outpatient rehabilitation services. This includes a $1500 cap      on occupational therapy and a $1500 cap on physical therapy      and speech-language-pathology combined. Arbitrary caps do not      reflect the real rehabilitation needs of Medicare      beneficiaries and target the sickest and most vulnerable.       Your efforts will protect senior citizens suffering from      common medical conditions such as stroke and hip fractures.      These seniors may not be able to obtain the rehabilitative      care they require to resume normal activities of daily living      because the $1500 limits are too low to pay for the services      which responsible medical practice deem necessary.       Once again, thank you for taking the lead to redress the      problem posed by these arbitrary caps. On behalf of the      American Health Care Association, we commend you and stand      eager to assist you in your efforts.           Sinceerely,                                                    Bruce Yarwood,     Legislative Counsel.                                  ____                                         The American Occupational                                    Therapy Association, Inc.,                                  Bethesda, MD, February 23, 1999.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of the 60,000 members of      the American Occupational Therapy Assn., I would like to      commend and thank you for your leadership in introducing the      Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999.       The financial limitation on outpatient rehabilitation,      including occupational therapy, imposed by the Balanced      Budget Act of 1997 was, in AOTA's view, a misguided attempt      to constrain Medicare costs which is having a harmful effect      on patient care. The payment limitation interposes government      between a patient and a health care provider; it restricts      patient choice, and could have the unintended consequence of      exacerbating patient conditions causing Medicare cost      increases.       Your bill will allow for patients such as those with      multiple injuries, illnesses or disabilities; those with more      than one incident of need in a year and, through the      Secretary's authority to establish criteria, those whose      diagnosis or condition requires extensive therapy to receive      the treatment which the Medicare coverage criteria guarantees      them.       AOTA has been very concerned that individuals with      condition such as severe strokes, spinal card injury,      traumatic brain injury, extensive fractures, severe burns, or      diseases such as Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis will be      restricted in their access to needed occupational therapy      before the rehabilitation process is completed. Your bill      will allow for these and other individuals to have access to      appropriate care.       Your efforts will move policy forward and establish some      necessary protections for Medicare beneficiaries. AOTA      appreciates your efforts to ameliorate the impacts of this      unwise policy.       We look forward to working with you as the bill moves      through the legislative process. Please contact me if I can      be of further assistance.           Sincerely,                                             Christina A. Metzler,     Director, Federal Affairs Department.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                      Rehabilitation Agencies,                                    Reston, VA, February 23, 1999.     Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: The National Association of      Rehabilitation Agencies (``NARA'') strongly endorses the      Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999 and      applauds your initiative in introducing this important      legislation. NARA represents over 225 Medicare-certified      rehabilitation agencies which provide physicial therapy,      speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy services      to hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries annually.       The $1500 financial limitation on outpatient rehabilitation      services, as established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,      constitutes an arbitrary limit on the amount of services      which a Medicare enrollee may receive. The caps bear no      relation to the patient's medical need for rehabilitation      services nor the beneficial health outcomes which would flow      from the provision of such services. The most pernicious      aspect of the limitations is that they will deprive Medicare      patients who are most in need of rehabilitation--e.g. stroke      victims and those suffering from traumatic brain injury--of      the very care they require.       You legislation is a workable and realistic solution to      many of the patient care and access problems caused by the      $1500 limitations. NARA's members are deeply appreciative of      the time and effort which you and your staff have expended in      developing the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement      Act of 1999. NARA pledges to work with you to ensure that      this critical proposal becomes law.           Sincerely,                                                 Larry Fronheiser,     President.                                  ____         Private Practice Section, American Physicial Therapy            Association,                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1999.     Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: The Private Practice Section of the      American Physical Therapy Association has carefully reviewed      your proposed legislation, the Medicare Rehabilitation      Benefit Improvement Act of 1999, and is pleased to express      its support for this legislation.       The membership of the Private Practice Section is comprised      of physical therapists in independent practice who, for many      years, have been subject to a financial limitation on the      amount which Medicare will pay for their services furnished      to any Medicare beneficiary. As a result, the Section's      members understand all too well the harmful effects which the      arbitrary $1500 caps will have on Medicare beneficiaries who      require outpatient rehabilitation services. Your proposal is      a sensible and practical approach to protecting those      patients.       Your legislation is entirely consistent with the Private      Practice Section's goals and objectives for ensuring that      Medicare beneficiaries have access to all necessary      rehabilitation services. Accordingly, we are pleased to      proffer our commitment to help secure its enactment.       That you for your leadership on this essential piece of      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                        Lisa Wade,     Chief Executive Officer.                                  ____                                      National Association for the                                    Support of Long Term Care,                                Alexandria, VA, February 24, 1999.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the National Association      for the Support of Long Term Care (NASL), we applaud your      leadership and your colleagues who have joined you in the      introduction of legislation entitled the ``Medicare      Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999.'' You have      developed a rational, good policy that will help      beneficiaries who would otherwise be limited in their      availability of rehabilitation services.       The National Association for the Support of Long Term Care      (NASL) is an organization that represents over 150 providers      offering services in the long term care setting. We work      daily with patients who need rehabilitation services and this      limitation is hurting seniors access to services. There are      seniors in America who are already reaching the cap and they      need additional services that are medically necessary. These      are seniors who have had strokes. These are seniors who have      Parkinson's disease. These are seniors who have had hip      replacements and an additional illness. Senator Grassley, we      want to thank you for helping these patients get services      that are medically necessary.       We are ready to help you share information about the      adverse effects of this cut in benefits that was enacted in      the BBA in 1997. We are certain that this was not the intent      of the law--and now that it is implemented, seniors will be      denied care. Your legislation will go a long way to ensure      that the most disadvantaged and ill seniors will get the care      that they need. The stroke patient that needs speech-language      pathology to learn how to swallow will get care. The      Parkinson's patient who is learning how to walk with an      exacerbating illness will get physical therapy in order to      improve.       Again, we applaud your leadership and strongly support this      legislation. Please feel free to call on us for support and      help.           Sincerely yours,     Peter Clendenin.                                  ____                                                     Easter Seals,                                     Office of Public Affairs,                                Washington, DC, February 25, 1999.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Easter Seals is very pleased to support      the introduction of the ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit      Improvement Act of 1999.'' This legislation begins to      eliminate damaging limitations on needed     therapy services for Medicare beneficiaries. Easter Seals is      committed to assisting you and your colleagues to improve and      enact this critical measure.       Easter Seals is dedicated to assisting children and adults      with disabilities to live with equality, dignity, and      independence. Each year, Easter Seals 106-affiliate network      serves more than one million people nationally. Thousands of      Medicare beneficiaries and their families rely on Easter      Seals for community-based physical therapy, occupational      therapy, and speech-language pathology services. Without such      services, these beneficiaries would experience diminished      health, function, and quality of life.       Current Medicare policy limiting payment for outpatient      medical rehabilitation services to $1,500 for occupational      therapy and $1,5000 for physical therapy and speech-language      pathology services combined is out-of-step with the real      medical needs of a significant share of Medicare      beneficiaries. It will cause beneficiaries with serious      medical needs resulting from illness, injury, and disability,      including stroke, traumatic brain injuries, total joint      replacement, and other serious conditions, to forfeit needed      care or seek such care in less cost-effective, often      inappropriate institutional settings.       For many Easter Seals Medicare clients the impact of      current policy is devastating. One client's situation, if      constrained by a $1,500 cap, illustrates this point.       Eighty-four-year old Richard H. lived independently with      his wife when, on February 27, 1997, he experienced a serious      stroke. Prior to the stroke he had high blood pressure, heart      disease, and diabetes. The stroke paralyzed his left side,      seriously impaired his vision, and left him very depressed.       Physical therapy helped him learn to move independently and      to walk safely again. Occupational therapy retrained him in      the tasks of daily living, including preparing food,      toileting, and home safety. Speech and swallowing therapy      eliminated his choking on food, which presented a high risk      of aspiration pneumonia. This therapy, combined with much      determination and effort by Richard and his wife, has enabled      him to resume living independently at home.       The doctors, therapists and family agree that without this      full course of medical rehabilitation, Richard would now be      helpless, severely depressed, and confined to a very      expensive nursing home for care. The current Medicare policy      limiting medical rehabilitation therapy services under the      $1,500 cap, with no exemptions, would have deprived Richard      of 62% of his needed rehabilitation treatment.       Easter Seals believes that the ``Medicare Rehabilitation      Benefit Improvement Act of 1999'' is a necessary, timely, and      thoughtful approach to correcting serious problems for      Medicare beneficiaries requiring comprehensive services.      Easter Seals will work with you and your Senate colleagues to      refine this legislation, as appropriate, and promote its      enactment into law.       Thank you very much for your commitment to assuring      Medicare beneficiaries the services that they need to live      healthy, productive lives.           Sincerely,                                                 Randall L. Rutta,                             Vice President, Government Relations.
