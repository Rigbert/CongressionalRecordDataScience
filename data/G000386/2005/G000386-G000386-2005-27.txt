 President, I rise to re-introduce the Fair Contracts for Growers Act of 2005. This bill would simply give farmers a choice of venues to resolve disputes associated with agricultural contracts. This legislation would not prohibit arbitration. Instead, it would ensure that the decision to arbitrate is truly voluntary and that the rights and remedies provided for by our judicial system are not waived under coercion.  I certainly recognize that arbitration has tremendous benefits. It can often be less costly than other dispute settlement means. It can also remove some of the workload from our Nation's overburdened court system. For these reasons, arbitration must be an option--but it should not be a coerced option.  Mandatory arbitration clauses are used in a growing number of agricultural contracts between individual farmers and processors. These provisions limit a farmer's ability to resolve a dispute with the company, even when a violation of Federal or State law is suspected. Rather than having the option to pursue a claim in court, disputes are required to go through an arbitration process that puts the farmer at a severe disadvantage. Such disputes often involve instances of discrimination, fraud, or negligent misrepresentation. The effect of these violations for the individual farmer can be bankruptcy and financial ruin, and mandatory arbitration clauses make it impossible for farmers to seek redress in court.  When a farmer chooses arbitration, the farmer is waving rights to access to the courts and the constitutional right to a jury trial. Certain standardized court rules are also waived, such as the right to discovery. This is important because the farmer must prove his case, the company has the relevant information, and the farmer can not prevail unless he can compel disclosure of relevant information.  Examples of farmers' concerns that have gone unaddressed due to limitations on dispute resolution options include; mis-weighed animals, bad feed cases, wrongful termination of contracts, diseased swine or birds provided by the company, fraud and misrepresentation to induce a grower to enter a contract, and retaliation by companies against farmers who join producer associations.  During consideration of the Farm Bill, the Senate passed, by a vote of 64-31, the Feingold-Grassley amendmentto give farmers a choice of venues to resolve disputes associated with agricultural contracts.  I have some letters supporting this legislation and ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Organization for Competitive                                                      Markets,                                   Lincoln, NE, November 15, 2005.     Re: Fair Contracts for Growers Act.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Senator Grassley:       1. The Organization for Competitive Markets would like to      express its support for your Fair Contracts for Growers Act.      Arbitration has a role in dispute resolution in the livestock      industry, and in other economic sectors. It should not be an      abuse tool. Your bill will remedy this.       2. The U.S. Constitution, Amendment 7 says this: ``. . .      the right of trial by jury shall be preserved . . .''. The      law says citizens can waive this right, but the law also says      waivers should be knowing and voluntary.       3. It is a fact integrators and packers have more      information and sophistication, and more power, when      contracting with producers. Producers rely on integrator/     packer representations when making business decisions      including contract signing or rejection. Mandatory      arbitration clauses are not explained or negotiated, but      merely included in boilerplate language.       4. Producers are unable to knowingly and voluntarily waive      their right to a court-resolved future dispute. This is true      because they cannot anticipate the type of possible disputes      which may arise. The American Medical Assn, American      Arbitration Assn, and American Bar Assn have agreed with this      principal in the context of consumer health care contracts.       5. Producers must be provided real, not illusory, choice.      Your bill leaves producers free to agree to arbitration once      a dispute arises, but prohibits this forced ``choice''      before. Thank you for your efforts for U.S. livestock and      poultry producers.           Respectfully,                                                       Keith Mudd,     President.                                  ____                                           Iowa Farmers Union,                                                         Ames, IA.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of Iowa      Farmers Union, Women, Food and Agriculture Network (WFAN) and      the Iowa Chapter of National Farmers Organization to express      our strong support for the Fair Contracts for Growers Act,      and to thank you for your leadership in introducing this      legislation.       Contract livestock and poultry producers are being forced      to sign mandatory arbitration clauses, as part of a take-it-     or-leave-it, non-negotiable contract with large, vertically      integrated processing firms. These producers forfeit their      basic constitutional right to a jury trial, and instead must      accept an alternative dispute resolution forum that severely      limits their rights and is often prohibitively expensive.      These clauses are signed before any dispute arises, leaving      farmers little if any ability to seek justice if they become      the victim of fraudulent or abusive trade practices.       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived      in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or      grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has      control over the information needed for growers to argue      their case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be      available to a grower's attorney through discovery. In an      arbitration proceeding, the company is not required to      provide access to this information, thus placing the farmer/     grower at an extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal      rights that are waived through arbitration are access to      mediation and appeal, as well as the right to an explanation      of the decision.       Many assume that arbitration is a less costly way of      resolving dispute than going to court, but for the producer,      the opposite is usually true. The high cost of arbitration is      often a significant barrier to most farmers. The up-front      filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the magnitude of      the dispute itself, with farmers being required to pay fees      in the thousands of dollars just to start the arbitration      process.       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute      resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by      two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant      party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon.      Independent family farmers all over the U.S. will benefit      from a law that stops the abuse of arbitration clauses in      livestock and poultry contracts.           Sincerely,                                                   Chris Petersen,     President.                                  ____                                     Center for Rural Affairs,                                                        Lyons, NE.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of the Center      for Rural Affairs to express our strong support for the Fair      Contacts for Growers Act, and to thank you for your      leadership in introducing this legislation.       The Fair Contracts for Growers Act is very timely. With the      rapid rise of vertically integrated methods of agricultural      production, farmers are increasingly producing agricultural      products under contract with large processors. Under these      contracts, it is common for farmers and growers to be forced      to sign mandatory arbitration clauses, as part of a take-it-     or-leave-it, non-negotiable contract with a large, vertically      integrated processing firm. In doing so, the farmer is forced      to give up their basic constitutional right to a jury trial,      and instead must accept an alternative dispute resolution      forum that severely limits their rights and is often      prohibitively expensive. These clauses are signed before any      dispute arises, leaving farmers little if any ability to seek      justice if they become the victim of fraudulent or abusive      trade practices.       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived      in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or      grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has      control of the information needed for a grower to argue their      case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be available      to a growers' attorney through discovery. In an arbitration      proceeding, the company is not required to provide access to      this information, thus placing the farmer/grower at an      extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal rights that are      waived through arbitration are access to mediation and      appeal, as well as the right to an explanation of the      decision.       In addition, it is often assumed that arbitration is a less      costly way of resolving dispute than going to court. Yet for      the farmer, the opposite is usually true. The high cost of      arbitration is often a significant barrier to most farmers.      The up-front filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the      magnitude of the dispute itself, with farmers being required      to pay fees in the thousands of dollars just to start the      arbitration process.       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute      resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by      two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant      party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon.       The Center for Rural Affairs believes this is important      because of the number of small and mid-size farms that enter      into contract livestock production. Small and mid-size farms      that don't have the capital to invest in starting their own      livestock operations often look to contract production as      mechanism for diversifying their farming operations as well      as their cash flow. However, when these farmers and ranchers      are not allowed equal legal protection, their entire farming      operations lay at risk.       Moreover, farmers who enter into contracts with meatpackers      and large, corporate livestock producers will never have the      power or negotiating position that those companies will enjoy      in virtually every contract dispute. Producers often lack the      financial and legal resources to challenge vertical      integrators when their rights are violated. A legal agreement      between smaller farm operations and integrators should,      therefore, provide at least as much legal protection for      producers as it does for the integrator.       Although the impetus behind this legislation emanates from      the poultry industry, the rights of farmers who raise hogs      and other livestock under contract are also threatened. And      the increased use of production contracts in these sectors      has made this issue that much more important to farmers in      the Midwest and Great Plains as well.       Thank you for your leadership in recognizing these      concerns, and your willingness to introduce commonsense      legislation to stop the abuse of arbitration clauses in the      livestock and poultry contracts.           Sincerely,                                                   Traci Bruckner,     Associate Director, Rural Policy Program.                                  ____                                           Sustainable Agriculture                                                    Coalition,                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2005.     Senator Chuck Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of the      Sustainable Agriculture Coalition in support of the Fair      Contract for Growers Act and to thank you for your leadership      in introducing this legislation.       The Fair Contracts for Growers Act is necessary to help      level the playing field for our farmers and ranchers who      enter into production contracts with packers and processors.      The rapid rise of vertically integrated production chains,      combined with the high degree of concentration of poultry      processors and meatpackers, leave farmers and ranchers in      many regions of the country with few choices, or only a      single choice, of buyers for their production. Increasingly,      farmers and ranchers are confronted with ``take-it-or-leave-     it,'' non-negotiable contracts, written by the company. These      contracts require that farmers and ranchers give up the basic      constitutional right of access to the courts and sign      mandatory arbitration clauses if they want access to a market      for their products. These clauses are signed before any      dispute arises, leaving the producers little, if     any, ability to seek justice if they become the victim of      fraudulent or abusive trade practices.       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute      resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by      two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant      party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon. Many basic      legal processes are not available to farmers and ranchers in      arbitration. In most agricultural production contract      disputes, the company has control of the information needed      for a grower to argue a case. In a civil court case, this      evidence would be available to the grower's attorney through      discovery. In an arbitration proceeding, however, the company      is not required to provide access to this information, thus      placing the grower at an extreme disadvantage. In addition,      in most arbitration proceedings, a decision is issued without      an opinion providing an explanation of the principles and      standards or even the facts considered in reaching the      decision. The arbitration proceeding is private, closed to      effective pubic safeguards, and the arbitration decisions are      often confidential and rarely subject to public oversight or      judicial review.       Moreover, there is a growing perception that the      arbitration system is biased towards the companies. This      private system is basically supported financially by the      companies which are involved repeatedly in arbitration cases.      The companies also know the history of previous arbitrations,      including which arbitrators repeatedly decide in the      companies' favor. This arbitration history is rarely      available to a farmer or rancher involved in a single      arbitration proceeding.       Arbitration is often assumed to be a less costly way of      resolving disputes than litigation. But this assumption must      be tested in light of the relative resources of the parties.      For most farmers and ranchers, arbitration is a significant      expense in relation to their income. One immediate      financial barrier is filing fees and case service fees,      which in arbitration are usually divided between the      parties. A few thousand dollars out of pocket is a      miniscule expense for a well-heeled company but can be an      insurmountable barrier for a farmer with a modest income,      especially when the farmer is conflict with the farmer's      chief source of income. This significant cost barrier,      when coupled with the disadvantages of the arbitration      process, can effectively deny farmers a remedy in contract      dispute cases with merit.       The Sustainable Agriculture Coalition represents family      farm, rural development, and conservation and environmental      organizations that share a commitment to federal policy      reform to promote sustainable agriculture and rural      development. Coalition member organizations include the      Agriculture and Land Based Training Association, American      Natural Heritage Foundation, C.A.S.A. del Llano (Communities      Assuring a Sustainable Agriculture), Center for Rural      Affairs, Dakota Rural Action, Delta Land and Community, Inc.,      Future Harvest-CASA (Chesapeake Alliance for Sustainable      Agriculture), Illinois Stewardship Alliance, Innovative      Farmers of Ohio, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy,      Iowa Environmental Council, Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation,      Kansas Rural Center, Kerr Center for Sustainable Agriculture,      Land Stewardship Project, Michael Fields Agricultural      Institute, Michigan Agricultural Stewardship Association,      Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service, The      Minnesota Project, National Catholic Rural Life Conference,      National Center for Appropriate Technology, Northern Plains      Sustainable Agriculture Society, Ohio Ecological Food and      Farm Association, Organic Farming Research Foundation, and      the Sierra Club Agriculture Committee. Our member      organizations included thousands of farmers and ranchers with      small and mid-size operations, a number of whom have entered      into agricultural production contracts or are considering      whether to sign these contracts. As individuals, these      farmers and ranchers do not have the financial power or      negotiating position that companies enjoy in virtually every      contract dispute. We agree with Senator Grassley that, in the      face of such unequal bargaining power, the Fair Contract for      Growers Act is a modest and appropriate step which allows      growers the choice of entering into arbitration or mediation      or choosing to exercise their basic legal right of access to      the courts.       Thank you for your leadership in recognizing these      concerns, and your willingness to introduce commonsense      legislation to stop the abuse of mandatory arbitration      clauses in livestock and poultry contracts.

Senator Charles Grassley,     Hart Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley. I am writing as president of the      National Family Farm Coalition to express our strong support      for the Fair Contracts for Growers Act, and to thank you for      your leadership in introducing this legislation. As you know,      the National Family Farm Coalition provides a voice for      grassroots groups on farm, food, trade and rural economic      issues to ensure fair prices for family farmers, safe and      healthy food, and vibrant, environmentally sound rural      communities here and around the world. Our organization is      committed to promoting food sovereignty, which is stymied by      current practices that give farmers unfair and unjust      difficulties when they wish to arbitrate a contract dispute.       Therefore, the Fair Contracts for Growers Act is very      timely. With the rapid rise of vertically integrated methods      of agricultural production, farmers are increasingly      producing agricultural products under contract with large      processors. Under these contracts, it is common for farmers      and growers to be forced to sign mandatory arbitration      clauses, as part of a take-it-or-leave-it, non-negotiable      contract with a large, vertically integrated processing firm.

Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the Campaign for      Contract Agriculture Reform, I would like to thank you for      your leadership in introducing the Fair Contracts for Growers      Act.       With the rapid rise of vertically integrated methods of      agricultural production, farmers are increasingly producing      agricultural products under contract with large processors.      In many cases, particularly in the livestock and poultry      sector, the farmer never actually owns the product they      produce, but instead makes large capital investments on their      own land to build the facilities necessary to raise animals      for an ``integrator.''       Under such contract arrangements, farmers and growers are      often given take-it-or-leave-it, non-negotiable contracts,      with language drafted by the integrator in a manner designed      to maximize the company's profits and shift risk to the      grower. In many cases, the farmer has little choice but to      sign the contract presented to them, or accept bankruptcy.      The legal term for such contracts is ``contract of      adhesion.'' As contracts of adhesion become more commonplace      in agriculture, the abuses that often characterize such      contracts are also becoming more commonplace and more      egregious.       One practice that has become common in livestock and      poultry production contracts is the use of mandatory      arbitration clauses, where growers are forced to sign away      their constitutional rights to jury trial upon signing a      contract with an integrator, and instead accept a dispute      resolution forum that denies their basic legal rights and is      too costly for most growers to pursue.       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived      in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or      grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has      control of the information needed for a grower to argue their      case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be available      to a grower's attorney through discovery. In an arbitration      proceeding, the company is not required to provide access to      this information, thus placing the farmer/grower at an      extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal rights that are      waived through arbitration are access to mediation and      appeal, as well as the right to an explanation of the      decision.       In addition, it is often assumed that arbitration is a less      costly way of resolving dispute than going to court. Yet for      the farmer,     the opposite is usually true. The high cost of arbitration is      often a significant barrier to most farmers. The up-front      filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the magnitude of      the dispute itself. For example, in one Mississippi case,      filing fees for a poultry grower to begin an arbitration      proceeding were $11,000. In contrast, filing fees for a civil      court case are $150 to $250. Lawyer fees in a civil case are      often paid on a contingent-fee basis.       In addition, the potential for mandatory arbitration      clauses to be used abusively by a dominant party in a      contract has also been recognized by Congress with regard to      other sectors of our economy. In 2002, legislation was      enacted with broad bipartisan support that prohibits the use      of pre-dispute, mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts      between car dealers and car manufacturers and distributors.      The Fair Contract for Growers Act is nearly identical in      structure to the ``car dealer'' arbitration bill passed by      Congress in 2002.       Thank you again for introducing the Fair Contracts for      Growers Act, to assure that arbitration in livestock and      poultry contracts is truly voluntary, after mutual agreement      of both parties after a dispute arises. If used, arbitration      should be a tool for honest dispute resolution, not a weapon      used to limit a farmer's right to seek justice for abusive      trade practices.       I look forward to working with you toward enactment of this      important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                   Steven D.
