President, I offer an amendment to improve the Nation's preparedness and response to natural disasters and terrorist attacks.  This amendment is based on legislation that I introduced last year, the Mass Evacuation Exercise Assistance Act of 2005, S. 2043, which would implement a recommendation in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's report ``Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared'' that Federal agencies work with State and local officials to develop evacuation plans.  That bill would address a gaping hole in our Nation's disaster preparedness by providing grants for evacuation exercises and the implementation of emergency response plans. It would establish a grant program to ensure thatcities across America have the resources they need to develop comprehensive evacuation plans; stage drills and exercises to practice and perfect evacuation procedures; and stockpile the materials needed to supply evacuation areas. In addition, the legislation would help cities prepare for future emergencies and evacuations to ensure that their citizens will be evacuated quickly and safely should a natural disaster or terrorist attack occur. Otherwise, like the victims of Hurricane Katrina, citizens can easily become trapped without food or water in a devastated area or along an escape route.  Based on that bill, S. 2043, my amendment today specifically includes evacuation exercises among the list of activities funded by homeland security grants. Evacuation planning and exercises are already permitted, but adding the words ``evacuation preparation and exercises'' to the bill would encourage state and local governments to request homeland security funds for that particular purpose. States and localities need to practice their evacuation plans in order to test and improve their systems before they must be executed in real emergencies.
