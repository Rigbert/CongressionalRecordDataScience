 President, I rise to introduce legislation that will restore authority to the Forest Service to retain marina permit revenue for local expenditure.  Within some National Forests, the Forest Service has partnered with local small business owners, allowing them to operate houseboat marinas. In exchange, the Forest Service collects occupancy fees from these marina operators. A portion of these fees had, until recently, been kept in the Forest for local recreation and safety enhancement projects. My legislation allows the Forest Service to once again use these fees in the Forest where they were generated, and where their impact will be most direct.  Several units of the National Forest system will benefit from this legislation, but the unit most affected is the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California. Under the 1996 Recreation Fee Demonstration Program, the Shasta-Trinity Forest developed a recreation enhancement program at Shasta and Trinity Lakes. Forest Service officials used a portion of the revenue from this program for projects like dock repair, improved handicapped access, safety markers for boaters, law enforcement, and campground construction. Over $4 million was invested in the Forest through this program.  However, the program was inadvertently repealed when the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act was passed. My legislation will correct this oversight by amending the Forest Service's Special Use Permit program, returning this recreation and safety project authority to the agency.  Recreation on Federal lands is important to quality of life in my state and throughout the nation. In many rural areas, it also provides a boost to the economy. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a simple bill correcting an oversight in the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act. Nonetheless, it has important implications both for recreation enhancement and for the local economies around the affected National Forests.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3188       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. RETENTION AND USE OF FOREST SERVICE MARINA PERMIT                    FEES FROM NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM UNITS DERIVED                    FROM THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.       The last paragraph under the heading ``forest service'' in      the Act of March 4, 1915 (16 U.S.C. 497), is amended--       (1) by striking ``The Secretary of Agriculture'' and      inserting the following:       ``(A) Permits for use and occupancy of national forest      system lands.--The Secretary of Agriculture'';       (2) by striking ``The authority'' and inserting the      following:       ``(B) Limitation on use of permits.--The authority''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following:       ``(C) Special rules regarding marina permits.--Amounts      collected in connection with the issuance of a special use      permit under this paragraph for a marina at a unit of the      National Forest System derived from the public domain shall      be deposited in an existing special account in the Treasury      established for the Secretary of Agriculture for recreation      management purposes. Amounts so deposited shall be available      to the Secretary of Agriculture, until expended and without      further appropriation, for repair, maintenance, and facility      enhancement related directly to visitor enjoyment, visitor      access, and health and safety, for interpretation, visitor      information, visitor service, visitor needs assessments, and      signs, for habitat restoration directly related to wildlife-     dependent recreation that is limited to hunting, fishing,      wildlife observation, or photography, for law enforcement      related to public use and recreation, and for direct      operating or capital costs associated with the issuance of      such special use permits, including any fee management      agreement or reservation service used in the issuance of such      permits. The Secretary may not use such amounts for      biological monitoring for listed or candidate species under      the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).      Not less than 80 percent of the permit fees collected at a      specific unit of the National Forest System shall be expended      for that unit, but the Secretary may transfer up to 20      percent of such fees to appropriations available to enhance      recreation opportunities at other units of the National      Forest System.''.                                 ______                                       By
