Speaker, my staff contacted the committee. They were told two copies were available in the anteroom. Beyond that, we know that the process is preloaded.  I have just reviewed the list of amendments that are being allowed. There is not one single amendment that would cut $1 from any program. There is not one single amendmentbeing allowed that would review the efficiency or the effectiveness of the procurement program.  This has been going on for years here on the floor of the House. Members can take the amendments up there and they will not be allowed to talk to them on the floor. The only amendments here on the floor are going to be amendments that enhance the spending under this bill.  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume once again to correct. I mean the gentleman from Oregon makes it sound like there were lots of amendments up there to decrease spending and none of them were allowed on the floor.  Only one amendment was filed, Mr. Speaker. Only one amendment. I think we need to show the whole story, show the whole picture here before we reflect upon our colleagues some kind of Committee on Rules that is theoretically disorderly and not fair. It is eminently fair.  This rule has had over 100 amendments. We are going to have lots of debate in the next few days. And, quite frankly, the gentleman needs to be a little more accurate, in my opinion, in regards to the action the Committee on Rules has taken.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
