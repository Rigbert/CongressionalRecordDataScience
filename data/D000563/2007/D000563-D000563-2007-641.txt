It is that the debate will commence at 2:15 on the Cornyn amendment, with the time equally divided for 30 minutes; at 2:45 the Cornyn amendment will be called for consideration--for a vote--with no second-degree amendments; that the vote standard for passage of the Cornyn amendment will be a majority vote; and that Senator McConnell will withdraw his pending amendment. I think that is the sum and substance of it.
