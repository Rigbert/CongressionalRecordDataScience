Mr. Chairman, again I think it is unfortunate that the gentlewoman from California cannot accept a fair trial language in place of the release of.  I think it will be very wrong, I would say to my colleagues, if all of us went on record saying that this lady, and she may be innocent, we do not know. I believe we have to be honest enough to say that the charges, and I have checked with the human rights groups, they are in doubt as to her innocence, and that is to leading groups.
