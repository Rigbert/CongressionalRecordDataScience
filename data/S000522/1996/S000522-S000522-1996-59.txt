Mr. Chairman, I take these 5 minutes to make an inquiry of the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Obey, the ranking member on the committee, to ask him a question, a very simple question.  In looking at the amendment that he offered, the substitute to the Istook amendment, the Obey substitute, which in essence guts the parental involvement and makes it essentially a sense of the Congress, in looking at the language that has been given to us, at the top of it it has, from Planned Parenthood, their ID number, and it is a faxed copy of the language, apparently, and this is what I hope the gentleman will clarify, right from Planned Parenthood.  In title V, section 503, the legislation reads: ``No part of any appropriations contained in this act shall be used to pay the salary or expenses of any grant or contract recipient or agent acting for such recipient related to any activity designed to influence legislation or appropriations pending before Congress.''  Mr. Chairman, this may be in error, but we have from the gentleman's staff a copy of the language of the bill, and it has, from Planned Parenthood, their ID number, which suggests to this Member, and I hope the gentleman will clarify this, that this language was written and then tendered and offered to this Congress, written by Planned Parenthood. Is that the case?
