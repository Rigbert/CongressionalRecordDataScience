President, I am proud to introduce a bill to increase funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for Fiscal Year 2000. I look forward to working with Appropriate Committee members on this and other important matters through the appropriations process.  The Commodity Supplemental Food Program does exactly what its name suggests--it provides supplemental foods to states who distribute them to low-income postpartum, pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children up to age six, as well as senior citizens.  People participating in CSFP receive healthy packages of food including items such as infant formula juice, rice, pasta, and canned fruits and vegetables.  The Commodity Supplemental Food Program currently operates in twenty states and last year, more than 370,000 people participated in it every month. There still remains a great need to expand this program, as there is a waiting list of states--including my state of Vermont--who want to participate, but are not able to because of lack of funding. The bill I am introducing would fix this problem, by increasing the funding so that more women, children and seniors in need could participate. I look forward to working with the Vermont Congressional delegation on this matter.  The Commodity Supplemental Food Program has proven itself to be vitally important to senior citizens, as 243,000 of the 370,000 people who participate every month are seniors. There continues to be a great need for our seniors in Vermont, and in the rest of the nation.  This has been true for sometime, and still is the case. I successfully fought efforts a few years ago to terminate the Meals on Wheels Program. Ending that program would have been a disaster for our seniors.  According to an evaluation of the Elderly Nutrition Program of the Older Americans Act, approximately 67% to 88% of the participants are at moderate to high nutritional risk. It is further estimated that 40% of older adults have inappropriate intakes of three or more nutrients in their diets. And the results of nutritional programs on the health of seniors are amazing--for instance, it was estimated in a report that for every $1 spent on Senior Nutrition Programs, more than $3 is saved in hospital costs.  This Congress, I have taken a number of steps to address the nutritional problems facing our seniors, and have met with some success. In response to a budget request that I submitted last year, the Administration increased their funding request for the Elderly Nutrition Program by $10 million to $150 million for Fiscal year 2000. I will continue to work to see that the full $150 million is included in the final budget.  This past April I also cosponsored the Medicare Medical Nutrition Therapy Act, which provides for Medicare coverage of medical nutrition therapy services of registered dietitians and nutrition professionals. Medicare coverage of medical nutrition therapy would save money by reducing hospital admissions, shortening hospital stays, and decreasing complications.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this measure into law through the normal appropriations process for fiscal year 2000.                                 ______                                       By
