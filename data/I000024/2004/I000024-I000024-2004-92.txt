President, I rise today to proudly introduce the Space Commercial Human Ascent Serving Expeditions Act also known as the Space CHASE Act.  Because Oklahoma has significant history in aviation, I believe it is well positioned to be a leading State in the up-and-coming commercial space industry.  Since 1910, beginning with Charles F. Willard who only flew a few hundred yards in a south Oklahoma City field, Oklahomans have been flying.  The following year, Clyde Cessna, an automobile dealer from Enid who later formed the Cessna Aircraft Company, flew his mono-wing airplane near Jet, OK.  Such early flights in Oklahoma continued and in 1929 perhaps one of the most notable aviation events occurred in Waynoka, OK, where Charles Lindbergh stopped on the first transcontinental passenger air and rail service.  By 1931, Wiley Post, from Maysville, OK, gained international recognition when he flew around the world in a little over 8 days. In July 1991, I had the honor of recreating Post's trip on its 60th anniversary.  Oklahoma's aviation history does not stop there. On November 2, 1929, 26 licensed women pilots founded what was known as the 99 Club, or the Ninety-Nines. It was called so at the suggestion of its first president, Amelia Earheart, because of the 117 licensed women pilots in America who were contacted about joining the club, only 99 actually joined. The South Central Section of the 99 Club comprising several States including Oklahoma, has through the years, issued several publications and in 1962, Mary Lester of the Oklahoma Chapter created a new version of the Club's publication, the Ninety-Nine News. Today, the 99 club is an international organization of licensed women pilots from 35 countries, with its international headquarters at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City.  In 1999, the Oklahoma State Legislature established the Oklahoma Space Industry Development Authority OSIDA to create a commercial spaceport that will ``expand and economically develop the space frontier with advanced spacecraft operating facilities.'' Furthermore, OSIDA's mission is to carry out this vision with ``. . . deliberate and forceful . . . planning and development of spaceport facilities, launch systems and projects, and to successfully promote and stimulate the creation of space commerce, education and space related industries in Oklahoma.''  In March of 2001, I appealed to NASA, on behalf of the Oklahoma Space Industry Development Authority, to receive nearly a quarter of a million dollars in grant money. Part of this grant is paid for the opening of the Oklahoma Spaceport. My efforts to build a space industry in Oklahoma are coming to fruition with that March 2002 launch of ``Dark Sky Station,'' from the Spaceport in Burns Flat. The rest of the money from the NASA grant went to nine other organizations around the State, dedicated to providing space-related education.  I applaud OSIDA for this aggressive economic plan and, as a result, know of 15 companies that have entered into Memoranda of Understanding with OSIDA: Armadillo Aerospace; Space Development; XCOR Aerospace; Zero Gravity; Pioneer Rocketplane; Vela Technology; Rocketplane, Ltd.; JP Aerospace; TGV Rockets; JP Skylaunch; Space Adventures; Jim Schouten Enterprises; Universal Spaceliners; Takeoff Technologies; and Space Assets.  Oklahoma is also home to business done by other such companies and entities as: Beyond-Earth Enterprises, which is helping to revitalize the passion of space travel by providing payload launch capabilities at affordable rates; the Global Space League, Inc., a 501(c)3 nonprofit institution which takes science experiments from students, kindergarten through university level, to remote places normally accessible only to professional scientists; and HighShips, which is in the business of developing innovative lighter-than-air flying vehicles.  Several communities in southwestern Oklahoma stand to either benefit from, take part in, or have synergies with commercial space development including: Burns Flat which boasts the third longest runway in North America, Sayre, Frederick, Elk City, Hobart and Altus Air Force Base. I look forward to working with these communities in the future, such as with Oklahoma House District 63 Representative Don Armes.  I encourage any and all companies and individuals who would like to become involved in the commercial space industry to come to southwestern Oklahoma. Oklahoma welcomes space industries with these features; Tax and Financial Incentives, Oklahoma Quality Job Program: Quarterly cash payments of 5% of new payroll for 10 years; Investment Tax Credit: Credit equal 1% of the investment in depreciable property for 5 years-doubles in this Enterprise zone; Sales/Use Tax Refund: Refunds tax paid on construction materials in new manufacturing facility; Property Tax Exemptions: 5-year abatement on 100 percent of property tax on new investment in manufacturing space; Sales/Use Tax Exemption: Available for machinery and equipment used in manufacturing, including property consumed; Accelerated Federal Property Depreciations: Provides approximately 40 percent shorter recovery period for depreciable property on Indian land.  Training Incentives: Vocational Technology School free to employees; customized assistance in employee screening; job training partnership program.  Financing: Oklahoma Finance Authority low cost loans; venture capital program facilitated by the agency; bonding by the agency; business financial assistance.  Site Specifics: existing available buildings: Hangars, office space, maintenance, warehouses; over 13,500 feet runway, ramp space; 3,000 acres of open space; utilities, infrastructure in place; rail spur, major Interstate Highway access; more than 340 days of clear skies; polar and ISS orbit launch windows available; no environmental issues; site geology supports any type of construction.  Please come to Oklahoma to advance commercial space exploration and avail yourself of Oklahoma's benefits.  Coming from Oklahoma's distinguished aviation heritage and innovative activity in the aerospace sector, as well as my experience as a commercially licensed pilot instructor, I rise today to introduce what I believe is a bill to benefit current and future aerospace companies in Oklahoma and throughout our entire Nation.  This legislation came to fruition after I facilitated many negotiations between the Federal Aviation Authority, the House Science Subcommitteeon Space and Aeronautics, the Senate Commerce Committee, aerospace companies and the Oklahoma Space Industrial Development Authority.  My language adds to H.R. 3752, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004, which updates the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, by accounting for a new class of sub-orbital launch vehicles that use hybrid technology--a combination of rocket and jet engines--to create a fair approach to future civilian suborbital flights.  In this legislation to advance the commercial space community, I have successfully covered hybrid aerospace vehicles.  By defining a sub-orbital vehicle as a rocket-propelled vehicle, ``in whole or in part, intended for flight on a sub-orbital trajectory, and whose thrust is greater than its lift for the majority of the rocket-powered portion of its ascent,'' aerospace companies will now face less regulation than with previous definitions for this type of vehicle.  Under my language, the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation will now have sole regulation authority for sub-orbital hybrid vehicles, and will now be appropriately considered and licensed as launch vehicles. By this classification, aerospace companies such as Rocketplane, which utilizes hybrid technology, will now avoid being forced to go through a lengthy two-step licensing process formerly required for both launch vehicles and commercial aircraft and will have the opportunity to be licensed to carry civilian passengers much more quickly.  In addition to the definition of sub-orbital flight, I am also proud of the indemnification and insurance provisions of this legislation which make it possible for small companies to enter into this business field, and am happy to create the new ``experimental permit'' framework.  I know that my colleagues, House Science Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee Chairman Rohrabacher and Committee Chairman Boehlert, and their aide, Timothy Hughes, have worked diligently to update the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 by introducing and passing H.R. 3752.  I particularly want to thank my fellow Oklahoman and House Science Committee member Frank Lucas for requesting my involvement in this legislation, along with requests from Oklahoma State Senator Gilmer Capps, Oklahoma State Representative Jack Bonny, Oklahoma Lieutenant Governor Mary Fallon, and the Oklahoma Space Industry Development Authority, Congressman Lucas' colloquy with Chairman Boehlert on the floor the House of Representatives on March 4, 2004, speaks of his interest in ensuring that this very commercial space legislation include hybrid vehicles that fly a bit like rockets and a bit like airplanes:       Mr. Boehlert. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may      consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for the      purposes of a colloquy.       Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the      gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert) and the gentleman from      Tennessee (Mr. Gordon) bringing this important bill to the      floor, because the emerging commercial human space flight      industry presents tremendous opportunities for my State of      Oklahoma and our Nation as a whole. I am particularly      appreciative of this bill's intent to ease the regulatory      burdens for entrepreneurs who are developing new suborbital      reusable launch vehicles.       Mr. Boehlert. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?       Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma. I yield to the gentleman from New      York.       Mr. Boehlert. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his      kind words. He is correct in stating that this legislation      seeks to put in place sufficient Federal regulation to      protect the general public while also promoting this      important new industry.       Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma. As you know, Mr. Chairman, some      suborbital reusable launch vehicles that will be used in      commercial human space flight activities may have some      attributes normally associated with airplanes as well as many      attributes of rockets. My hope is that such hybrid vehicles      would not have to be regulated under two separate regimes.      What are the chairman's views on this matter?       Mr. Boehlert. I thank the gentleman for that question.       This is a very important issue on which we have worked      extensively with industry and the executive branch in      developing this bill. As currently drafted, H.R. 3752      incorporates definitions promulgated by the Federal Aviation      Administration to distinguish between suborbital rockets,      which are under the jurisdiction of FAA's Associate      Administrator for Commercial Space Transport, and other      aerospace vehicles which are regulated by another part of the      FAA. That said, I would be happy to keep working with the      gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) and other interested      parties as the bill moves forward to revisit the important      issue of how best to regulate hybrid vehicles that are      engaged in commercial human space flight.       Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma. I thank the chairman and I look      forward to continuing to work with him and our colleagues in      the other body to see if we can create a single regime for      hybrid commercial space flight vehicles.  While I realize H.R. 3752 creates fairness in regulation for the newly emerging civilian space flight industry, I believe my language takes it a step further by ensuring all companies entering this field have a level licensing playing field including those using hybrid technologies.  These are exciting times for this field of human endeavor. We are currently in the middle of a competition for the ANSARI X PRIZE. This competition is a courageous effort to refocus society's attention on the last frontier--space. To win the $10 million ANSARI X PRIZE, the successful team will launch a craft carrying at least three people to an altitude of at least 100 km, 62.5 miles, return safely to Earth, then repeat it with the same craft within 2 weeks.  With pilot Mike Melvill, the Burt Rutan team made a flight on June 21, 2004, but control problems prevented the repeat flight within the 2 weeks.  This brilliant concept of the Ansari X Prize exemplifies the excellence that can be achieved through an incentivized approach rather than a governmental mandate or punitive approach. Incentivize and safely get government out of the way is the philosophy of my bill. Tempt not only the pocketbook but the vision of anyone who has the creativity and imagination to pursue it.                          ____________________
