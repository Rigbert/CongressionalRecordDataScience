President, shortly, I am hopeful we will be able to clear three amendments offered by the Senator from Alaska--three pending amendments. We have reached compromises due to a lot of hard work and good faith on both parts. We have asked the Senator from Alaska if he is available to come over to the floor now, and I am hopeful we will be able to resolve those three pending amendments this evening. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
