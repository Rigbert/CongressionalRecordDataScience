Speaker, Pursuant to House rule IX, clause 1, I rise to give notice of my intent to present a Question of Privilege to the House in the form and resolution as follows:  Mr. Speaker, the resolution reads as follows:       A resolution, in accordance with House Rule IX, clause 1,      expressing the sense of the House that its integrity has been      impugned because the antidumping provisions of the Trade and      Tariff Act of 1930, (Subtitle B of Title VII) have not been      expeditiously enforced;       Whereas the current financial crisis in Asia, Russia, and      other regions have involved massive depreciation in the      currencies of several key steel-producing and steel-consuming      countries, along with a collapse in the domestic demand for      steel in these countries;       Whereas the crises have generated and will continue to      generate surges in United States imports of steel, both from      the countries whose currencies have depreciated in the crisis      and from steel-producing countries that are no longer able to      export steel to the countries in economic crisis;       Whereas United States imports of finished steel mill      products from Asian steel-producing countries, the People's      Republic of     China, Japan, Korea, India, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, and      Malaysia, have increased by 79 percent in the first 5 months      of 1998 compared to the same period of 1997;       Whereas year-to-date imports of steel from Russia now      exceed the record import levels of 1997, and steel imports      from Russia and the Ukraine now approach 2,500,000 net tons;       Whereas foreign government trade restrictions and private      restraints of trade distort international trade and      investment patterns and result in burdens on United States      commerce, including absorption of a disproportionate share of      diverted steel trade;       Whereas the European Union, for example, despite also being      a major economy, in 1997 imported only one-tenth as much      finished steel products from Asian steel-producing countries      as the United States did and has restricted imports of steel      from the Commonwealth of Independent States, including      Russia;       Whereas the United States is simultaneously facing a      substantial increase in steel imports from countries within      the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Russia,      caused in part by the closure of Asian markets;       Whereas there is a well-recognized need for improvements in      the enforcement of the United States trade laws to provide an      effective responsibility to such situations:       Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives, that the House of      Representatives calls upon the President to:       (1) take all necessary measures to respond to the surge of      steel imports resulting from the financial crises in Asia,      Russia, and other regions, and for other purposes;       (2) pursue enhanced enforcement of United States trade laws      with respect to the surge of steel imports into the United      States, using all remedies available under those laws      including offsetting duties, quantitative restraints, and      other authorized remedial measures as appropriate;       (3) pursue with all tools at his disposal a more equitable      sharing of the burden of accepting imports of finished steel      products from Asia and the countries within the Commonwealth      of Independent States;       (4) establish a task force within the executive branch with      responsibility for closely monitoring United States imports      of steel; and       (5) report to the Congress by no later than January 5,      1999, with a comprehensive plan for responding to this import      surge, including ways of limiting its deleterious effects on      employment, prices, and investment in the United States steel      industry.
