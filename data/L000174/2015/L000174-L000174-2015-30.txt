President, today we will vote on the nomination of LaShann Hall to be a Federal district judge in the Eastern District of New York. She was nominated over a yearago, and her nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote more than 5 months ago. Ms. Hall is an outstanding African-American attorney who will fill a judicial emergency vacancy. There is no reason Senate Republicans should have delayed her confirmation for this long.  The Senate this week should also vote on the next nominee on the calendar, who was nominated on the same day over a year ago as Ms. Hall. Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo will be the first ever Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania on the third circuit. Judge Restrepo has strong bipartisan support from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and Senator Casey, and there is an urgent need to fill the emergency vacancy on the third circuit to which he has been nominated. I have heard no objection to his nomination, and Senator Toomey has said he not only strongly supports Judge Restrepo's confirmation, but he also recommended him to the President. I hope the majority leader will finally schedule his vote this week.  In the 11 months that the Senate has been under Republican control this year, the Senate has only voted to confirm nine judges. This obstruction has resulted in needless delays for hard-working Americans who seek justice in our Federal courts. Currently pending on the Senate floor are nominees who would fill judicial emergency vacancies in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Minnesota, New Jersey, Iowa, New York, and California. Senate Republicans have refused to alleviate the urgent needs in those States. It does not have to be this way. When Senate Democrats were in the majority during the last 2 years of the Bush Presidency, we had already confirmed 36 judges by this same time. We made sure that we fulfilled our constitutional duty to provide advice and consent to ensure that the American people had a fully functioning Federal judiciary.  Senate Republicans' obstruction has caused judicial vacancies to pile up across the country. Since Senate Republicans took over the majority at the beginning of the year, judicial vacancies have increased by more than 50 percent. The number of ``judicial emergency'' vacancies since Senate Republicans took the majority has risen by a stunning 158 percent. The American people deserve better.  We should follow well-established Senate precedent by confirming all consensus nominees before the end of the year. Each of the judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. And each has the backing of their home State Senators, including Republican Senators. In fact, the next nominee after Ms. Hall and Judge Restrepo is Travis McDonough who has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy on the Eastern District of Tennessee. Next week will mark the 1-year anniversary since Mr. McDonough was nominated, but it appears there is no relief in sight as his nomination continues to be held up by Senate Republicans, despite the strong support he has from his home State Senators, Senator Alexander and Senator Corker. I see no reason why he and the rest of the nominees pending should not be confirmed before we recess at the end of the year. As the New York Times put it in an editorial last Friday urging confirmation votes on all pending judicial nominees, ``With each day that passes without a vote on Judge Restrepo and other nominees, Republicans undermine the justice system, and the biggest victims are ordinary Americans who cannot count on fully functioning courts.'' I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Shortly we will begin voting on LaShann Hall to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York. She is currently a partner at the law firm of Morrison & Foerster, LLP, in New York, where she has practiced since 2010. She was previously in private practice at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP. She has the support of her two home State Senators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. She was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on June 4, 2015. I urge my fellow Senators to support her confirmation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Nov. 13, 2015]                    Confirm President Obama's Judges                        (By the Editorial Board)       On Nov. 12, 2014, President Obama nominated Luis Felipe      Restrepo to a judgeship on the federal Court of Appeals for      the Third Circuit. Judge Restrepo, who already sits on the      United States District Court in Philadelphia, seemed to      secure the support of both Pennsylvania senators--Bob Casey,      a Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Republican.       But that does not mean that Judge Restrepo, whom Mr. Toomey      called ``a very well-qualified candidate'' who would ``make a      superb addition'' to the appeals court, will actually get      through the confirmation roadblock led by Senate Republicans.      Mr. Toomey, despite his professed support, is responsible for      a big part of it, refusing for six months to sign off on the      nomination by exploiting a pointless tradition that allows      home-state senators to block a nomination with no explanation      needed. He claimed that he was waiting for a background      check, even though Judge Restrepo passed a check two years      ago for his current job. The Senate Judiciary Committee      approved Judge Restrepo for the appeals court seat in July.      There has been no explanation for the holdup since then.       As a Hispanic and a former public defender, Judge Restrepo      would bring a needed measure of ethnic and professional      diversity to the court. But he is just one of many judicial      nominees awaiting action. Thirteen have not received a      hearing by the Judiciary Committee, and 16 others, including      Judge Restrepo, have been approved by the committee, all      unanimously, but are still waiting for a full vote on the      Senate floor.       Since Republicans took over in January, the Senate has      confirmed only nine of President Obama's nominees, the      slowest pace in more than half a century. Meanwhile, the seat      Judge Restrepo would fill is one of 30 long-vacant federal      judgeships the court system deems ``judicial emergencies,''      meaning they have a backlog of hundreds of cases.       Republicans say that Mr. Obama has seen more of his      judicial nominees confirmed than President George W. Bush had      by this time in his tenure in 2007. But that is mainly      because Senate Democrats in 2013 stopped Republicans from      repeatedly using the filibuster to block qualified nominees.      After that, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 96 of Mr.      Obama's picks. The more relevant fact is there are 67      judicial vacancies today, far more than the number of      vacancies Mr. Bush faced in 2007.       The larger problem here, of course, is that Republicans are      blocking votes on highly qualified and noncontroversial      nominees to vent their anger with the president, who      infuriated them with his now-stalled immigration action,      among other things.       Judges are not the only casualties of this interbranch      crossfire. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, another      unquestionably qualified candidate, waited almost six months      before finally getting a vote.       Senate Democrats should make these inexcusable delays a      national issue. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, could start selecting      judges himself in states like Texas, Alabama, Wisconsin and      Indiana, where senators refuse to give him any names at all.       With each day that passes without a vote on Judge Restrepo      and other nominees, Republicans undermine the justice system,      and the biggest victims are ordinary Americans who cannot      count on fully functioning courts.                          ____________________
