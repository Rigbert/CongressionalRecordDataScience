Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2924) to provide authority to the Federal Power Marketing Administrations to reduce vandalism and destruction of property, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 2924     SECTION 1. PROPERTY PROTECTION PROGRAM FOR POWER MARKETING                    ADMINISTRATIONS.       (a) In General.--The Administrators of the Western Area      Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration,      and the Southeastern Power Administration may each carry out      programs to reduce vandalism, theft, and destruction of      property that is under their jurisdiction.       (b) Provision of Rewards.--In carrying out a program under      this section, each Administrator referred to in subsection      (a) is authorized to provide rewards (including cash rewards)      to individuals who provide information or evidence leading to      the arrest and prosecution of individuals causing damage to,      or loss of, Federal property under their jurisdiction.
