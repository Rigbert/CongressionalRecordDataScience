 This bill contains substantially the same language I had in an amendment I filed to the corporate reform bill that we passed into law a couple of months ago, but unfortunately my bankruptcy amendment was not considered. My legislation, the ``Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act'', would clarify that the bonuses and other excessive compensation of corporate directors and wrongdoers can be brought back into a bankruptcy estate when a company goes bankrupt. This legislation is equitable because corporate officers and those individuals that have engaged in wrongdoing and violated the securities and accounting laws should not be able to make outrageous amounts of money off of a company which has gone bankrupt, while the company's employees, shareholders and creditors are left carrying the burden of the bankruptcy. Furthermore, corporate officers and insiders shouldn't be allowed to get bonuses and loans when a company has done so poorly to go bankrupt. They don't deserve that kind of excessive compensation. The plain fact is that corporate officers and those who engage in illegal activity should not be allowed to benefit where their actions have contributed to the downfall of the company. I don't think that's fair, and my bill would ensure that there is some equity in terms of who gets left holding the bag when a company goes bankrupt.  Currently, the Bankruptcy Code permits a trustee to recover assets which a debtor has previously distributed to creditors within a certain time period prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition. This allows a trustee to increase a debtor's assets for the fair treatment and equitable distribution of assets among all creditors, as well as to help shore up a debtor's assets during a reorganization.  Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a trustee to recover assets from an insider made within a year of the filing of a bankruptcy petition. However, the Bankruptcy Code does not clearly establish that this section applies to bonuses and other extraordinary or excessive compensation of insiders, officers and directors. A cursory review of the case law by my staff and the Congressional Research Service indicates that the courts have not developed this issue, and that relevant case law is not dispositive on the matter of whether bonuses and excessive compensation are avoidable in bankruptcies of publically held companies.  In addition, section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a trustee to recover transfers of assets, made within one year, where there has been a fraudulent transaction or where a debtor has received less than what is reasonably equivalent in value. Here too, the Bankruptcy Code is not clear as to whether this section applies to the bonuses and other extraordinary or excessive compensation of officers, directors or other company employees who have violated securities laws or engaged in illegal accounting practices when their conduct, but not their compensation, has led to the company's bankruptcy. Similarly, the case law is not dispositive on this matter either.  I think everyone would agree that a trustee should be able to recover these kinds of assets when a company goes bankrupt. Corporate bigwigs and wrongdoers shouldn't be able to keep their bonuses, loans or other excessive compensation when a company goes under. Corporate mismanagement and irresponsibility should not be rewarded, and the bad guys need to be held accountable.  So I think that we need to clarify the Bankruptcy Code in order that bonuses, loans, and other extraordinary or excessive compensation that the company has given to the insiders and wrongdoers can be drawn back into the bankruptcy estate.  My legislation is simply and straightforward. The Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act would specifically provide in section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code that a trustee may recover bonuses, loans, nonqualified deferred compensation, and any other extraordinary or excessive compensation as determined by the court, made to an insider, officer or director and made within one year before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.  In addition, the Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act would specifically provide in section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code that a trustee may recover bonuses, loans, nonqualified deferred compensation, and any other extraordinary or excessive compensation, as determined by the court, paid to an officer, director or employee who has committed securities or accounting violations, within 4 years of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. My bill extends the present one year reach-back period for fraudulent transfers in the Bankruptcy Code to 4 years, I did that because a majority of states have adopted a 4 year time period or the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act which allows for a 4 year time frame. I believe that these changes to section 548 are fair because they are tied to excessiveness and wrongdoing. Simply said, illegal acts should not be rewarded with a big fat paycheck.  The point of this bill is that corporate officers and wrongdoers should not be able to keep bonuses, loans and other excessive compensation when the company goes under and others, employees, creditors and investors, are left holding an empty bag through no fault of their own. It's just not fair. So I hope that my colleagues will support the Corporate Accountability in Bankruptcy Act to make the Bankruptcy Code clear that corporate bigwigs and wrongdoers cannot unjustly enrich themselves and their excessive compensation and loans can and will be brought back into the bankruptcy estate.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2901       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
