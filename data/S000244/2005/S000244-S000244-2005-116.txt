Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  This amendment clarifies the inherent authority of State and local law enforcement officers to enforce the immigration law and provides reimbursement to those States and localities for their assistance. Most importantly, it provides a means for Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers to work together to apprehend, detain, and remove illegal aliens.  The fact is that at the present time there are only 2,000 special agents to locate and arrest the entire illegal alien population nationwide. The Norwood amendment would allow State and local officers who are willing to do so to be a force multiplier for those 2,000 agents.  It is a good amendment and should be adopted.
