 President, this amendment increases funding for USDA's Emergency Grants to Assistance Low-Income Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers program by $5 million. The increase in funding is provided to cover additional needs, including a possible increase in WIC caseload as a result of the devastating citrus freeze which impacted California last December.  I understand the amendment has been agreed to on both sides, and I urge its adoption.
