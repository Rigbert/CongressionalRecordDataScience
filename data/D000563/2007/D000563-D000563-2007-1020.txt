President, I will be very brief because I see Senator Specter is on the floor.  So what I am trying to do is make sure we only have one waiver per meeting, one person sitting on that advisory committee per meeting who might have a conflict of interest.  We go on to say that any person with a financial interest could provide information to an Advisory Committee but can't be participating in or voting on the final decision. I think that only makes sense.  The third thing we say is that the Food and Drug Administration has to actively promote more objective scientific experts without conflicts of interest.  I don't think this is a radical proposal. Don't we want peace of mind at the end of the day that the advisory committee has made a decision based on science and medicine and what is good for America as opposed to the bottom-line profit-and-loss statement of the pharmaceutical company?  There is a lot of discussion on this floor about the safety of drugs and the products that the FDA considers. I hope this amendment, which is critical to the integrity of the FDA, is approved by my colleagues on a bipartisan basis. I hope to offer this amendment tomorrow after we have gone through this rough procedural patch.                          ____________________
