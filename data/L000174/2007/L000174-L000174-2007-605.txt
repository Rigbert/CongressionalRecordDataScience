President, reserving the right to object, I have yielded already to Senator Specter on my hour. So far I have been dramatically changing and changing the schedule of my office to accommodate everybody. The Senator from Alaska is one of the oldest and dearest friends I have here. If he wants 3 minutes, I will not object to him following Senator Specter for 3 minutes. But then I will insist and will not yield on my hour after that because we created too many problems already in my schedule.
