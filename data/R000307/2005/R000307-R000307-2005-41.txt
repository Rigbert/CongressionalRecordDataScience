President I have joined with my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, and 19 other Senators to introduce a bill to restore normal beef trade with Japan.  Prior to the discovery of BSE or mad cow disease in the United States in December 2003, Japan was the largest export market for American beef in the world. But since that fateful day 2 years ago, U.S. beef producers have been locked out of the Japanese market.  To say the loss of this market has been detrimental to the viability of the American beef industry is an understatement. This is an issue that effects every part of the U.S. beef industry from the cowboys in western Kansas to the folks standing in line at the grocery store shopping for hamburger patties in New York City.  And perhaps this is felt no where as strongly than in places like Dodge City, KS Dodge City is a town that has built it's economy on the beef industry since the days of the wild west. It is a place where the number of cattle far outnumbers the number of people that live within the county lines. And it is the place that I call home.  The beef industry is a major economic driver for Dodge, but it's one of the largest industries in Kansas--representing over $5 billion in annual revenue.  We are a state with 6.65 million head of cattle, compared to a human population of 2.6 million. In 2003, cattle represented 62 percent of the Kansas cultural cash receipts and the processing industry alone employs over 18,700 Kansans. And to boot, we rank in the top three of virtually every major beef statistic.  But, trade with Japan has an impact that extends well beyond the borders of Kansas--it's an issue that affects all of farm country. The cattle industry comprises one of the largest sectors in American agriculture--with business in every state. Japan is the largest export market for food and agricultural products from the United States and beef is one of the largest and most lucrative exports to Japan.  In short, for ranchers across farm country, including those in Kansas, there are few issues more important than the viability of the beef industry--and specifically how we handle BSE.  This week marks the year anniversary of the mutual agreement the U.S. and Japan signed to resume normal beef trade. Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, has worked hard to implement substantive improvements in our ability to prevent, identify and respond to BSE. For instance, as a part of their enhanced animal surveillance effort, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, has tested over 450,000 head of cattle for BSE.  Despite this increased testing, Japan refuses to reopen its market and has instead relied upon imports of beef from countries with little or no testing for BSE.  The increased U.S. testing, in coordination with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration implementation of safeguards that ensure the safety of our food supply, have bolstered our claim to having the safest and most abundant food supply in the world.  Regrettably, the Japanese has failed to match these standards with prudent efforts to change their policy of keeping American beef out of Japan.  The Japanese Food Safety Commission, the body with the delegated responsibility to review the process by which Japan would reopen its market, and others within the government have been unresponsive to extensive diplomatic efforts made by U.S. officials during the last year.  The office of the U.S. Trade Representative and USDA have worked in concert with President Bush, othercabinet agencies and officials and U.S. Congress to restore regular beef trade.  Despite the efforts of even the highest office in our nation's government, Japan continues to keep American beef out of their country.  The Japanese Food Safety Commission and others within the government have repeatedly demanded excessive documentation and paperwork with little or no justification. None of these requests reflect the internationally accepted phytosanitary guidelines. Rather, they appear to be a dilatory tool to prevent any effort to resume the purchase of American beef.  There have been claims that American beef is unsafe. This is simply not true. The international science says our cattle under 30 months of age are safe and not at risk. Yet, we have agreed to not send meat from any animals under 20 months of age to Japan.  Furthermore, after 20 confirmed cases of BSE in Japan, the claim that U.S. beef is not as safe as Japanese beef is simply an insult to American producers. Still the market remains closed to the U.S.  In recent weeks, Japan has insisted upon an unwarranted and unjustified trade barrier by preventing the resumption of regular beef trade with the U.S. Japan has a complicated bureaucracy in place to deal with the issue of BSE. In 2003, the Japanese Parliament established the Food Safety Commission as a Cabinet Office tasked with ensuring food safety.  This week, the Japanese Food Safety Commission again failed to reach an agreement to remove the blockade to U.S. beef imports. And to insult to injury, four of the Commission's 12 members did not even show up to the meeting because of their alleged concern with the safety of U.S. beef.  I am troubled that our negotiations with Japan have deteriorated to this point. Japan has traditionally been a distinguished and important trading partner for the U.S. Furthermore, they have been a critical ally in the War on terrorism.  Despite, this long-standing relationship, I am here today to support legislation that requires the U.S. Department of Treasury to implement additional tariffs on goods grown, produced or manufactured in Japan unless the U.S. Trade Representative certifies that Japan has reopened its market to American beef by December 15, 2005.  I have long supported free trade. Our country has benefitted from trade agreements with Chile, Australia, Canada and Mexico, and now Central America. These trading relationships are a necessity to ensure the ability of American farmers, ranchers and businessmen alike to compete in the global marketplace.  But, these agreements hinge heavily upon the commitment of the participating countries to uphold the principles of free trade--and for agriculture trade that means abiding by the international science standards that set important standards for animal, plant and human safety.  Prior to the discovery of a case of native-born BSE in a cow that never entered the food supply, we enjoyed this kind of trading relationship with Japan. However, Japan has chosen to ignore internationally recognized science and has instead based their food safety on emotional, politically-driven arguments. And, this comes at a high price for the American beef industry.  Since December 2003, the U.S. beef industry has experienced roughly $6 billion in cumulative economic losses--in current annual economic trade terms, this is about $3.1 billion a year.  We've been patient, but with this kind of economic loss, the American beef industry cannot afford to wait any longer.  I will not stand idly by while politics and posturing drive our trade relationships.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to send a message in the strongest way possible, that free trade is a two-way street. More importantly, in the context of the pending negotiations in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization, I urge my colleagues to support this bill because it sends the message to American producers that we will stand up for American agriculture in our trade negotiations.                          ____________________
