Today I ask that the U.S. House of Representatives join me to honor and remember the life of Blake Edward Butler.  Blake Butler joined the U.S. Department of State in 2009 as a U.S. Foreign Service Officer. In 2018, he began his tour as the Human Resources and Financial Management Officer at U.S. Embassy Yerevan. From 2015 to 2018 he served as the Assistant General Services Officer at U.S. Embassy Buenos Aires where he led the team that provided logistical support to 14 different U.S. government agencies and close to 400 employees. Blake's other assignments included General Services Officer at U.S. Embassy Baghdad; Environmental, Science, Technology and Health Officer at U.S. Embassy Paris; and Vice Consul at U.S. Embassy Port-au-Prince. Prior to joining the Foreign Service, he worked as a civil service employee for the Department of State as a budget analyst and in the office responsible for the President's foreign travel. He was the recipient of multiple Department Superior Honor and Meritorious Honor Awards. In addition to his service with the Department of State, Blake valiantly served in the U.S. Army's Reserve from 2001 to 2011 and was deployed overseas on multiple occasions.  Blake was the loving husband of Sara Hurst Butler, who previously worked in my office, and the proud father of Everett Ian Butler. Blake received his BA from Baylor University and his MBA and Master's in Health Administration from Texas Woman's University.  As we look at the incredibly rich history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Blake, who chose a life of public service. I am grateful for Blake's service to our country and my thoughts, prayers and deepest condolences goes out Blake's wife, son, parents and brother. There are no words that can relieve their pain and what words I offer only begin to convey my deep respect and highest appreciation. I hope they know that the goodness Blake brought to this world will always be remembered.                          ____________________
