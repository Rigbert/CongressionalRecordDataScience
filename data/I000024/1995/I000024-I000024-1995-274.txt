Yet, as the Senator pointed out, future generations, if we do not do something today and stay on the track where we are today, are going to have to pay for everything we are doing today.  If it gets down to a discussion of compassion, then why would we not be in a position to say that, if you really want to be compassionate, let us bite the bullet today? Let us do it.  I think the CBO and others have come up with the figures projecting out where we would be in the next 10 to 20 years if we do not make a change. If we do not pass something like this immediately, it gets down to a very personal basis. I have two grandchildren, ages 20 months and 21 months. It works out, if we do not do something and we continue on this trend that we have right now, that during their lifetimes they are going to have to pay 75 percent of their lifetime income just to service the debt.  So I guess I would ask the Senator from Maine if this is not really the most compassionate route to take, to go ahead, bite the bullet now and be responsible now?
