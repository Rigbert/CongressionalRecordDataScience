 President, today I wish to honor the career of Dr. William ``Bill'' Craig, who retired on June 25, 2018, after 58 years of civilian service. Dr. Craig served as the director of the Software Engineering Directorate SED for 30 years at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL. Through his direction, SED experienced significant growth not only within its customer base but also by expanding its facilities. He has provided decades of service to improve the development and fielding of numerous Army systems, as well as the quality of life in his community and across the State of Alabama.  Mr. Bill Craig is a native of Senatobia, MS, and he received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Mississippi State University. His civil service career began in 1960 at Dr. Werhner von Braun's astronics laboratory. Ten years later, he moved to the Army Ballistic Missile Defense Agency. He later became a charter member to the Army Missile Command's Missile System Software Center in 1976.  Bill has earned many recognitions throughout his career, including an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. In 1985, he was awarded Supervisor of the Year by the North Alabama Chapter of Federally Employed Women. Bill was the first recipient of the Joseph C. Moquin Award given by the Huntsville Association of Technology Societies. Bill also received the Medaris Award from the Tennessee Valley National Defense Industrial Association, and he was inducted into the Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame, the Order of Saint Barbara, and the Ancient Order of Saint Barbara.  What is truly remarkable are Bill Craig's many contributions to the State of Alabama and the U.S. Army through his work at Redstone Arsenal. I am proud to take this time to recognize him for his service to the people of Alabama and the people of our country. Bill is a highly respected leader and visionary in the State, and I thank him for his commitment to Alabama.                          ____________________
