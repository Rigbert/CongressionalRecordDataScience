 President, I wish to speak about a U.S. airman lost in battle who has left behind a saddened but grateful country. Capt. David I. Lyon of Sandpoint, ID, was killed in action on December 27, 2013, in Kabul, Afghanistan, when his convoy was intentionally and deliberately attacked by the enemy with explosive devices. Captain Lyon's mission was an advisory one for the Afghan National Army Commandos. He was 28 years old.  For his service in uniform, Captain Lyon received several medals, awards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force Combat Action Medal, the Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, and the Air Force Training Ribbon.  As a cadet at the U.S. Air Force Academy, David was a star track and field athlete. As a team captain who is still ranked third all-time in academy history for indoor and outdoor shot put, his teammates gave David the nickname ``Leonidas''--after the ancient Greek warrior-king of Sparta--for his courage against fearful odds.  ``Oh captain, my captain, Leonidas, we salute you. You will never be forgot,'' says Scott Irving, who was David's assistant coach. David ``knew the risk he was taking and embraced it without hesitation or fear,'' Scott adds. ``That's another Leonidas trait, I would say.''  David's wife, Capt. Dana Lyon, is an officer in the U.S. Air Force and an Air Force Academy graduate, where she herself was a two-time NCAA champion in the javelin throw. Her family hails from Lexington, KY, and I had the honor of speaking with them and hearing firsthand about David's service and tragic sacrifice.  ``Dave was known as a tender warrior and a protector,'' says Rick Pounds, Dana's father and David's father-in-law. ``He was lighthearted and a gentle giant. Kind and compassionate to everyone he met, Dave's smile would light up a room. If my daughter would have given me the task of `go find me a husband anywhere,' he is who I would have picked.''  ``Dave loved the principles upon which our country was founded, and died in defense of them,'' Rick continued. ``More importantly, he was a faithful follower of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, in whom our liberty and freedom is derived.''  David attended the Air Force Academy, where he graduated in 2008. While there, he was a 3-year letter winner for the track and field team. He became a Mountain West Conference champion and was named to the National Strength and Conditioning Association All-American Team and received the Laura Piper Ironman Award. This award is named for a 1991 Air Force Academy graduate and former track and field star who was killed in action in Operation Desert Shield in Iraq. David's shot put throw of 57 feet, 11 inches earned him a place in the academy's record books.  ``That gives you a sense of his intensity and his drive and his determination,'' said Scott Irving. ``When he was team captain, he would get upset with other[s] . . . if they didn't give everything they could give--it bothered him if they didn't try to take their God-given talents to the highest level. That was David, day in and day out.''  After graduation from the academy, David excelled in his Air Force career. Lt. Col. James Lovewell, his former squadron commander, recalls how much David impressed him. ``The consistency of his character showed across many facets of his life,'' Lieutenant Colonel Lovewell says. ``He was very humble and tireless in serving others. He had a superb work ethic. He was a servant leader--he served people just as much as he led them.''  Assigned to the 21st Logistics Readiness Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, David was picked over more senior officers to become the group commander's right-hand man. He worked above and beyond what was asked of him.  ``I joked I was going to start calling him `Boomerang,' because he would come into work and I told him there's nothing more he could do, and invariably he would just come back,'' said Lieutenant Colonel Lovewell. ``He was sticking around to make sure I was taken care of.''  David and Dana were both serving their country in Afghanistan at the same time. David worked in logistics, Dana in acquisitions. ``He would always talk about how proud he was of her over there, taking care of the mission, as he was,'' Lieutenant Colonel Lovewell recalls.  Just before David's tragic death, the couple were able to have Christmas dinner together one final time.  ``Every day was always the best day of my life with him, so every day just got better,'' Dana said. ``The last 2 days were the best 2 days we've spent together.''  Because they were based in Colorado Springs, David and Dana maintained their ties to the Air Force Academy. They coached and mentored young athletes, sponsored cadets, and volunteered with the Air Force Wounded Warrior Program. They had members of the academy track and field team over for meals. David also enjoyed camping, hiking, lifting weights, and listening to country music with the windows down with his wife.  Dana's brother Eric Pounds is also an Air Force captain and admired his brother-in-law both as a dedicated airman and a beloved member of the family. ``They both loved the Air Force,'' Eric says of his sister and brother-in-law. ``They both wanted to fight, and they both wanted to protect their country. [David] did that at home, and he did that in the Air Force. He was a protector and a provider, and I'm just really proud of him.''  We are thinking of David Lyon's beloved ones today, including his wife Dana; his parents Bob and Jeannie Lyon; his brother Sean Lyon; his parents-in-law Rick and Nancy Pounds; his grandparents Ray and Imogene Davis; his step-grandmother Beth Davis; his brothers-in-law Eric Pounds and Darren Pounds; and many other beloved family members and friends.  It was my honor to speak with the family members of Captain Lyon, just as it is an honor for me to share his story with my colleagues in the Senate today. I know we as a nation send our condolences to this brave military family for the loss of such an incredible husband, son, friend, and dedicated airman. I want them to know the Senate has paused today in memoriam to Capt. David I. Lyon to pay tribute to his life of service and sacrifice half a world away. He will be remembered, and he will be missed by those who knew him and loved him.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
