 President, we have made substantial progress on the bill today. Tomorrow morning, when we return to the bill, we have several Senators prepared to offer amendments. I hope that we can debate and vote on those amendments with reasonable time agreements. There is a chance we can finish this bill tomorrow night, and the majority leader has indicated that if we wrap up the Transportation-Treasury bill tomorrow evening, we will not be voting on Friday. If we are able to do that, he will move on Friday to another bill, and we will not be having votes that day. Hopefully, that will be adequate incentive for all of us to finish our work on this particular bill no later than tomorrow night.                          ____________________[Page S11599]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
