President, thank you very much.  Mr. President, I take the floor today to speak on behalf of this extremely important bill. In doing so, I want to commend the chair, Senator Kassebaum, and also Senator Kennedy for what I think is exactly the kind of spirit of bipartisan effort that is needed to produce an important health bill.
