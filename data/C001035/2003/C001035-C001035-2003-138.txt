President, this bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate resolution would help ensure that any economic growth package includes $30 billion in desperately needed fiscal aid to the States. Half of the money would have to be used for the Medicaid Program which has been severely cut. Forty-nine States are facing budget shortfalls.  This approach would have no impact on the deficit. It would not change the caps in this resolution. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Rockefeller, Collins, Nelson, and Smith amendment.
