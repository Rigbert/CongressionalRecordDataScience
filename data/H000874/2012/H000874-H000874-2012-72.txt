We need you to act.  Who acted? The Democrats, in a bipartisan response to President Bush. Who walked away? Two-thirds of the Republican Party, the President's party. Two-thirds of them walked away. As a result, we failed the first time. We came back and added another 30 Democrats, 172, and the Republicans couldn't even get to 100 to support their own President to keep this country out of depression.  Ladies and gentlemen, 2 years ago as the previous election approached, Republicans unveiled a long list of pledges. Their Pledge to America reads, and I quote:       A plan to create jobs, end economic uncertainty, and make      America more competitive must be the first urgent domestic      priority of our government. So, first we offer a plan to get      people working again.  That's what they said. We are still waiting for that plan, and we have walked away.                              {time}  1320  Twenty-one months later, Republicans have not offered a comprehensive plan to create jobs and boost competitiveness. Nor have they allowed Democrats to bring major items of our Make It in America--expand manufacturing, create jobs, give good-paying jobs with good security to Americans that will then redound to the benefit of all agencies and job creators and small businesses that service those manufacturers.  When President Obama proposed his plan, the American Jobs Act--which economists say would have expanded by 1 million or 1.5 million jobs--Republicans blocked it outright, not brought to the floor, not given a vote. Instead of making jobs their priority, it seems to have been last on their to-do list, at a time when it remains the first concern for millions and millions of Americans and for our side of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, let me read another excerpt from the Republican pledge:       With common-sense exceptions for seniors, veterans, and our      troops, we will roll back government spending, putting us on      a path to balance the budget and pay down the debt.  However, over the last 21 months Republicans have torpedoed every serious attempt to reach agreement on deficit reduction. Why? No revenues from the very wealthy in America. Not because we don't like the very wealthy, not because we want to penalize the very wealthy, but because we need to keep our country on a financially secure path, and those of us on this floor can contribute a little more to that effort.  Pushed to the extreme by their Tea Party wing, House Republicans early on embraced an ``our way or no way'' that made compromise impossible, refusing to accept any solution that included revenues or that ended unnecessary tax breaks for the wealthiest in our country. That's why the middle class tax cut passed overwhelmingly in the United States--well, passed by a majority--in the United States Senate languishes here unconsidered, which would keep 98 percent of America from any concern about having their taxes increased on January 1. Why? To protect the 2 percent. How sad.  In pursuit of their extreme budget agenda, they pushed our country to the brink of default, leading to--for the first time ever in the history of our Nation--the most creditworthy nation on Earth being downgraded by the Standard & Poor's rating agency. To avert that default, Republicans insisted on creating the sequester that so many of them now lament. It was their creation. In fact, in their cap, cut, and balance bill, what is the default position they take? Sequester.  Meanwhile, led by Chairman Paul Ryan, Republicans passed two budgets that would end Medicare as we know it, end the guarantee, end the security that it gives to people who are seniors and going to be seniors; guts social programs that keep millions out of poverty; and doesn't balance over the next 30 years.  Susan Collins, Republican Member of the United States Senate--I showed you John McCain, Mr. Speaker--she says:       It is very frustrating to have worked on legislation that      really matters to our country, like the cybersecurity bill      and legislation to save the postal service, and just have      them gather dust.  In other words, she worked in the Senate across the aisle with Democratsand sent that bill here--both those bills--and we have not acted. We have walked away.  Mr. Speaker, we have made our point: Walking away has been the practice of this Congress. Not getting the work done has been the practice of this Congress. How lamentable it is for the American people. But as President Obama said: They have a choice. May they make it well.  I yield back the balance of my time.
