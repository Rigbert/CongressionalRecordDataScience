Speaker, I think the gentleman is correct, that what is present is the most important. But it is also important to understand, I tell my friend from Georgia, how we got to the present. Because the bill that I believe he initially voted for was $3.5 billion under the President's budget.  Now, hear me. Originally, when we passed the bill through this House, it was $3.5 billion on education under the President's request. So that, yes, we are here; but the reason we are here is a little bit of what the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) said. The President said he was not going to sign that kind of bill.  The gentleman is right. He has not vetoed it because my colleague has not sent it to him. He said, I am not going to sanction that kind of cut in education. So, yes, we do readily admit that we have a budget that is now presumably going to come out of the Labor-Health conference much better, but it is much better because the President of the United States said he was not going to sanction that House product.
