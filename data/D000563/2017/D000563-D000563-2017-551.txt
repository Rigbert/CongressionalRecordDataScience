President, today, Senate Democrats will be voting to protect three programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. These programs represent core commitments our Nation has made to seniors, low-income Americans, children, and those living with disabilities.  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid reflect who we are as Americans. At one time or another throughout our lives, most of us have or will count on these programs for health care or for financial stability.  During last year's Presidential debate, President-Elect Trump sought to distinguish himself from the field of Republican candidates by stating he was the first and only Republican candidate who would promise not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. Yet, in their first major action of the new Congress, Republicans have taken the first step to dramatically alter and decimate core programs that comprise our safety net. Congressional Republicans want to gut funding, limit benefits, constrict eligibility, and turn guaranteed earned benefits into a voucher and a ``good luck'' wish. Their approach would violate the pledge we have made to millions of Americans and truly disrupt lives. This is unacceptable. That is why I am cosponsoring Senator Sanders' amendment to prohibit the Senate from considering any legislation that would violate Donald Trump's promise of not cutting Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security.  I am committed to ensuring that we meet the promise we made to Americans. Sixty million Americans, including 2 million Illinoisans, depend on Social Security for their well-being, and we must make sure that this vital program is there for both current and future generations.  By 2034, without any reform, Social Security will be unable to fulfill its promise to its beneficiaries. If Congress does not act, beneficiaries would immediately see their benefits reduced by one-fifth.  It remains Congress's responsibility to look to the future and protect the long-term solvency of Social Security while ensuring benefits meet the needs of beneficiaries, especially the most vulnerable among us.  Waiting until tomorrow to do what we could do today--an approach that I have seen fail in Illinois--only makes the task more difficult and likely to cause disruption.  I was a member of the Simpson-Bowles Commission, where we tried to address our budget challenges and the long-term solvency of Social Security. I voted for the Commission's report because I believe we must face the difficult reality that doing nothing may harm the very people we are trying to protect--beneficiaries that rely on the promises we have made. I firmly believe that we, as Members of Congress, have a duty to have these debates and make difficult decisions, not just wait for the inevitable.  While I did not support everything in the final Commission's report, I believe the report included some commonsense options to improve the longterm solvency of Social Security: accelerating the alignment of payroll taxes to their intended level of 90 percent of wages and realigning benefits to reflect current poverty levels among seniors.  I believe there can and should be evenhanded, bipartisan agreement on a path forward. To do so, we need a collaborative and good-faith partnership to examine the universe of policy options.  Make no mistake--I oppose privatization of Social Security. And recent solvency changes have weighed heavily on beneficiaries. That is why conversations should be balanced and targeted. There must be a dual goal of ensuring the adequacy of benefits, especially for those who rely on Social Security the most, and the long-term solvency of this program.  I look forward to working across the aisle in the future to maintain and build upon our promise to Americans.                            Amendment No. 52
