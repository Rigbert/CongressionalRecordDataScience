 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until Monday, June 18; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 5515. I further ask that it be in order for Senator Sanders or his designee to raise a single Congressional Budget Act point of order that lay against amendment No. 2282 on the bill, as amended, and that a motion to waive then be considered to have been made and the Senate vote on the motion without intervening action or debate; finally, that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all postcloture time on H.R. 5515, as amended, expire at 5:30 p.m., Monday, and the cloture motion filed today ripen following disposition of H.R. 5515.
