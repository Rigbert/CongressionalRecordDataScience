 President, passing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement means more market access for our farmers and businesses and more protection for our workers. This agreement includes new commitments in critical areas such as customs, digital trade, services, environment, and labor that are crucial to bringing higher wages and more jobs to American workers.  Of course, enforcement is key to a strong and durable trade agreement that will deliver all of the benefits that I just listed. We need enforcement measures that work for all aspects of this agreement.  It is time to bring NAFTA into the 21st century, and that is what the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will do. The time for USMCA is now.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
