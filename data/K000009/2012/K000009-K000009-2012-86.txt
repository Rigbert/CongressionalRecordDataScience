 I listened with care to what you've been presenting today to give voice to the American people from coast to coast. And I want to thank you, in particular, for the work you've done on mortgage foreclosures, on holding Wall Street accountable, Congressman Ellison. No one has fought harder. Minnesota's been affected, your home city of Detroit, all across northern Ohio, Toledo to Sandusky to Lorain to Cleveland to Parma, all these communities struck so hard by Wall Street's malfeasance.  And I wanted to join you today as you keep a focus on who the wrongdoers really have been, and how we help the Republic heal; to thank the Obama administration for the efforts they've made to date on a major settlement that's being announced during the same timeframe as we speak here, where individual States and five of the major Wall Street banks who are responsible, who used widespread fraudulent paperwork that precipitated the foreclosure crisis, that this settlement will actually bring some measure of justice.  And we ought to claim a great deal of credit because the Progressive Caucus has been working so hard on this, and housing and the mortgage foreclosure crisis has been at the top of our agenda.  The settlement, the initial settlement will reportedly impose a $26 billion penalty against Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Allied Financial, and Citigroup that were at the heart of the schemes that led to the securitization and collateralized debt obligation risk-taking. The total amount could grow to $30 billion or $45 billion if additional banks join the settlement. Given the extent of the damage they've caused, it's a start, and frankly, a very important one.  We can't forget that millions of America's families lost their homes, and countless more are still dealing with foreclosure. And our cities have empty hulks of neighborhoods that are struggling as a result.  If you come to places that I represent, as you've mentioned, in northern Ohio you can see the thousands of vacant structures that these banks left to decay. They didn't even manage them well once they possessed them. In neighborhood after neighborhood, the damage these banks inflicted is incalculable as they achieved the largest transfer of equity and wealth from Main Street to Wall Street. They've made every community more poor.  This agreement is the largest joint Federal/State settlement ever obtained and the result of unprecedented coordination between the various corners of our government and the States. And it needs to be a major settlement.  One in five American families with a mortgage today--this is an astounding number--owe more than the house is actually worth by an average of over $50,000. The collective negative equity across the Nation is over $700 billion.  For years I've come to this floor urging Congress to do more, and one critical part of this agreement is that it does not provide blanket immunity to the banks for their misdeeds. While the ink is barely dry on this agreement, the press is reporting, and I quote, Officials will also be able to pursue any allegations of criminal wrongdoing.  And I know the congressman and I want to go down that road, and I wish to place in the Record an article from The New York Times this week that talks about how African American New Yorkers making more than $68,000 are nearly five times as likely to hold high interest mortgages as Caucasians of similar income.                [From the New York Times, Feb. 7, 2012]     That Comeback Trail for the Economy? Here, It's Littered With                               Foreclosures                          (By Michael Powell)       To walk 145th Street in South Jamaica, past red-brick homes      with metal awnings and chain-link fences, is to find a storm      of immense destructive power still raging.       Three years ago, when I wandered this block south of Linden      Boulevard in Queens, banks had foreclosed on eight homes. In      the years since, banks have filed notice against a half-dozen      more owners. Some of those homes sit abandoned, plywood      boards nailed across doors and windows, as if to guard      against further spread of this plague.       We are accustomed to hearing politicians talk of a halting      recovery from the recession. They detect heartbeats in the      job market and flickers of life in house sales. New     York and New Jersey, our governors proclaim, are on the      comeback trail.       Not here.       A dozen miles from Midtown Manhattan, the foreclosure belt      stretches across the heart of black homeownership in this      city, from Canarsie and East New York in Brooklyn, to      Springfield Gardens and St. Albans, Queens, where Fats      Waller, Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald once owned handsome      Tudor-style homes.       Black Americans came late to homeownership for reasons      deeply rooted in our tragic racial history. Black New Yorkers      making more than $68,000 are nearly five times as likely to      hold high-interest mortgages as whites of similar income, and      their default rates are much higher. Now a generation watches      as its housing wealth is vaporized.       Organizers with the Neighborhood Economic Development      Advocacy Project pored over 2011 mortgage default data. They      found that 345,000 city mortgages were in default or      delinquent last year. In corners of southeast Queens, banks      filed as many as 150 delinquency notes for every 1,000      housing units.       Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman says that statewide      the number of New Yorkers at risk of losing homes exceeds the      population of Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester combined.       In Jamaica, ``for sale'' signs sit two, three and four to a      block. Real estate agents resemble fishermen who've kept      lines in the water too long. Of late, matters have grown      worse. The federal government has stopped paying counselors      and lawyers for those at risk of foreclosure, and Gov. Andrew      M. Cuomo, who takes pride in his reinvention as a fiscal      conservative, has declined to foot the bill.       I stop Randy Ali, a Guyanese ironworker, as he tinkers with      his SUV on 145th Street. Which is his house? He nods at a      two-story brick home. ``I paid $360,000.'' He gives a      mournful nod. ``I just got a notice from the city that it's      valued at $215,000.''       He looks embarrassed. How could he foresee a housing      collapse this huge? ``You have a family, you want a place to      live.'' Pause. ``Do I walk away?''       Say this much: New Yorkers are better off than those who      live in the acres of foreclosed homes in the deserts around      Phoenix and Las Vegas. Our politicians are not always an      inspiring lot, but New York has a social democratic      tradition, and they wove a safety net.       Banks must submit to months of mediation before      foreclosing, and lawyers must attest that the bank can prove      ownership. Judges here show waning patience for the three-     card monte act of some banks.       Just a few weeks ago, the Appellate Division of State      Supreme Court took the unusual step of ruling that Bank of      America could not foreclose on an Orange County home of a New      York City police officer. The judges upheld a lower court      ruling that the bank's ``conduct was nothing short of      appalling.''       Still, the fevers rage on.       On Friday, I stepped off the elevator in State Supreme      Court in Queens. Shafts of sun poured across the marble      floor, as dozens of men and women sat in shadow, awaiting      mediation.       A computer list is taped to the wooden door frame. Every      foreclosure case has been adjourned 4, 5, 10 times. More      homeowners hold tight to their homes than a few years ago,      but the cost is weeks of missed work and legal bills piled      high.       Freeman N. Hawes Sr. walks into the mediation room. He's a      husky, cheerful black man, from Rosedale. The bank agent nods      pleasantly. She thinks the bank might grant him a mortgage      modification. But she can't get the bank on the phone just      now.       Perhaps next time?       The mediator sets a new date. Mr. Hawes walks to a bench      and, from a brown plastic bag, pulls dog-eared letters from      Nationstar Mortgage. Nationstar, the letters show, agreed      that he had made his payments and promised to modify his      mortgage in 2010, and again in July 2011: It broke both      promises.       He has lived in Rosedale, a black middle-class      neighborhood, for decades. He's edging toward 70 and holds      two jobs with no plans of retiring.       ``I'm not one to hold grudges,'' he says. ``The Lord says I      can live 125 years, so I'll keep paying the bank. But why      can't I get to the finale?''       That's a question that haunts thousands of homeowners.  Madam Speaker, a major settlement was just reached between the individual states and 5 of the major Wall Street banks whose widespread use of fraudulent paperwork fueled the foreclosure crisis.  This initial settlement will reportedly impose $26 billion in penalties against Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Ally Financial and Citigroup. The total amount could grow to $30 billion or $45 billion if additional banks join the settlement. Given the extent of the damage that they caused, it's a start, and an important one.  We cannot forget that millions of American families lost their homes, and countless more are still dealing with foreclosure. If you come to places I represent in Northern Ohio, you can see the thousands of vacant structures that these banks left to decay throughout individual neighborhoods. The damage these banks inflicted is incalculable.  This agreement is the largest joint federal-state settlement ever obtained, and it is the result of unprecedented coordination between various corners of the government. And, it needs to be. One in five American families with a mortgage owe more than the house is actually worth today, by an average of $50,000. The collective negative equity across the nation is $700 billion.  For years, I have come to this floor urging Congress to do more. One critical part of this agreement is that it does not provide blanket immunity to the banks for their misdeeds. While the ink is barely dry on this agreement, the press is reporting that ``Officials will also be able to pursue any allegations of criminal wrong doing.'' And, this is very important. According to the Justice Department, ``the agreement does not prevent any claims by any individual borrowers who wish to bring their own lawsuits.''  Yes this is an important step, but we must remember the scope of the damage and the magnitude of fraud that was committed. Much work still needs to be done.  During the past decade, we as a country failed to take white collar crime seriously, and we as a country are still dealing with the damage that was done to our housing market. Already back during the Bush Administration, the FBI testified before Congress that they were seeing an epidemic in white collar crime and that we did not have anywhere near enough agents to deal with it. Well, history has shown that we never provided the FBI and other investigators and prosecutors with the full resources they needed. During the much smaller Savings and Loans crisis of the 1980s, we set up a series of strike forces based in 27 cities, staffed with 1,000 FBI agents and forensic experts and dozens of Federal prosecutors. We did not do that this time around.  I have a bill that I have been asking for my colleagues to support, week in and week out. It is H.R. 3050, ``The Financial Crisis Criminal Investigation Act.'' This bill would authorize an additional 1,000 FBI agents, a sufficient number of forensic experts, and additional employees by the Attorney General to prosecute violations of the law in the financial markets.  Like today's announcement, we have seen some progress in getting more FBI agents, but more needs to be done. In last year's appropriation, Congress made a bipartisan decision to include funding for more than two hundred additional agents. It's good news, but we cannot be soft on this kind of crime. Families, neighborhoods, and whole communities were victims.  Earlier this week, the New York Times reported on what it described as a foreclosure belt that runs through the heart of African American homeownership in New York City. I want to include this article in the record, because it details a very important element of the foreclosure crisis. According to the Times, black New Yorkers making more than $68,000 are nearly five times as likely to hold high-interest mortgages as whites of similar income, and their default rates are much higher. Now a generation watches as its housing wealth is vaporized.''  In Cleveland, we see neighborhoods struggling to survive as well. In Cuyahoga County alone, there now are an estimated 30,000 vacant structures. We see shocking pictures of homes stripped of everything from the siding to the kitchen sink, even the floor boards. We see homes that were once worth $100,000 stripped of their entire value. We see whole communities that were victimized by the actions of Wall Street.  Just last month, the President announced during the State of the Union a new working group to look into mortgage fraud. It will coordinate efforts between the FBI, the Justice Department, and various states to go after those on Wall Street who have perpetuated fraud in the markets, using mortgage backed securities. Yet another good step, but we have a lot more work to do.  It is well past time for Wall Street to accept responsibility for its role in the housing crisis. Big Wall Street banks and the secondary markets made obscene profits during the 1990s up to the market crash in 2008. During that period, banks targeted communities, looking for individuals to take on mortgages the banks knew they could not afford. And then Wall Street went looking to make fast money on individual American dreams and local mortgage markets. Those responsible did not care what ultimately happened to families, communities, or whole cities. And when the market collapsed, the American taxpayer actually bailed them out. Today's settlement is big news, and it's well past time that Wall Street started to pay up. But, we cannot forget that this story is far from over, and our work is not over.  I think the civil rights aspect of what has gone on is extraordinarily important. I don't want to overstep my time boundaries here, Congressman Ellison. Do I have a couple of extra minutes in this period or not?
