Chair, while I certainly have some concerns aboutthe offset, I am able to support my recent classmate's and colleague's amendment. As the gentlewoman knows, this bill has a strong history of supporting underrepresented communities, including African American and Tribal communities.  This bill funded the construction of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture and continues to strongly support the operations of this very popular museum.  This bill maintains a strong bipartisan support for Tribal health, Tribal education, Tribal law enforcement, and numerous other priorities critical to Native Americans and Alaska Natives, and this bill supports underrepresented communities throughout the Historic Preservation Fund grants under the National Park Service.  Though we may have to turn the lights off at the Department of the Interior if we keep going on--he is a Navy SEAL; he will get by--I certainly urge the adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
