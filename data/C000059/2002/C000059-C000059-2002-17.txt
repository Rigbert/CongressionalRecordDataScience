Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well being of the city of Riverside, California, was unparalleled. Riverside was indeed fortunate to have such a dynamic and dedicated political and community leader who willingly and unselfishly gave of her time and talents to make her community a better place in which to live and work. The individual I am speaking of is Ethel Marie Silver, a close friend and mentor. She passed away Sunday, September 1, 2002 at the Riverside Community Hospital after complications from surgery at the age of 76.  Ethel was born in Hemet, California but lived most of her life in Riverside and graduated from Riverside Poly High School in 1944. She earned her registered nurse degree from Los Angeles County General Hospital School of Nursing where she met her husband, Dr. Harrison Silver. After graduation, she played a vital role in establishing the Riverside General Hospital Medical Auxiliary and later served as president. Ethel also regularly volunteered at the hospital blood bank.  Ethel's passion for her work as a nurse was matched by her passion for politics. Throughout her life, she had been involved in campaigns from the local level to the federal level. Ethel got her start in politics volunteering on asuccessful 1962 congressional campaign from Riverside. Over the years she became a master of political strategy and worked tirelessly helping candidates.  She was a member of several community organizations including the California Republican Central Committee and was a delegate and alternate to several Republican national conventions. Ethel received many awards throughout her lifetime and in 1997 she received the Presidents Achievement award from the Riverside County Federation of Republican Women.  She is survived by her husband, her son, Jeffrey, her daughter, Jennifer Barns, two grandchildren, her brother William Gruber, and two sisters, Lil Harvill and Florence Danson. My thoughts and prayers go out to them for their loss.  Mr. Speaker, looking back at Ethel's life, we see a woman dedicated to her family and community--;an American whose gifts to the Inland Empire and southern California led to the betterment of those who had the privilege to come in contact or work with her. Honoring Ethel's memory is the least we can do today for all that she gave over her lifetime.                          ____________________
