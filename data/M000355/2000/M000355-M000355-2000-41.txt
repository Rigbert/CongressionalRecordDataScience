 President, I rise today to honor the directors and staff of Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital in recognition of providing physical rehabilitation services for the past fifty years to the people of Kentucky.  Cardinal Hill Hospital treats more than 6,000 patients every year from virtually every county in the state. TheHospital, beginning as a convalescent home for children with polio, has now developed into a leading physical rehabilitation center for Lexington and its region. This anniversary not only reaches a significant milestone, but marks a time for recognition and celebration.  Dedicated to treating children and adults, some of Cardinal Hill's patients have been treated for catastrophic accidents or disabling diseases like multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, or cerebral palsy. Two of the more publicized patients would include Missy Jenkins, survivor of the Paducah Heath High School Shooting and Palmer Harston, of Lexington, 2000 National Easter Seals Child Representative, that have been given care and treatment by Cardinal Hill Hospital. Cardinal Hill has provided for patients who have dealt with all kinds of tragedies, whether small or large.  Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital continues to display an unswerving commitment to the people of Kentucky and possesses the respect and gratitude of many in the community. The significant work accomplished at this hospital promises a successful future for the citizens of this state as they can be ensured that disabilities will be continued to be treated at Cardinal Hill.  I am certain that the legacy of dedication that Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital has left will carry on. Congratulations to the directors and staff of Cardinal Hill on 50 years of service to Kentucky. Best wishes for many more years of commitment, and know that your efforts to better the lives of those in the region will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.                          ____________________
