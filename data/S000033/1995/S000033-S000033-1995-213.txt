 Let us not forget that in the November elections, 62 percent of the people did not vote, did not vote.  We can turn this around. We can win this fight. We can stop these devastating cuts and this transfer of wealth to the upper-income people. We can do it, but we cannot do it with Members of Congress alone. We are going to need the help of millions and millions of American citizens who are fighting hard to maintain their standard of living.  So if you do not think it is right that we give huge tax breaks to the rich and cut back on a zillion programs that affect the children and the old and working people and students, if you think that is wrong, we are going to need your help.  So let us stand up together and let us fight back. Let us get a little justice in America.  Ms. DeLAURO. Just one comment. I was struck today by a letter that I was shown by another Michigander, the gentlewoman from Michigan [Ms. Rivers] our colleague, and she showed me a letter that she received from a senior citizen in her district about the cuts, and it was a very poignant comment that this individual made.  Lynn showed it to me, and she said, ``Read this.'' And the woman said, ``Maybe I have lived too long.'' An indictment of our values and what this Nation and this country is all about when this woman writes and says, ``Maybe I have lived too long,'' because, ``you are cutting my Medicare, my Social Security,'' and we are providing tax breaks for the richest in this country. It was a sad commentary, and I think one that struck me very hard, and I think says a lot about what this debate is about.
