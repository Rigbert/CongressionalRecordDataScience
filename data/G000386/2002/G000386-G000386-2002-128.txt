 President, today I am introducing a resolution to designate a Medal of Honor Flag to further honor those individuals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to their country and to present that flag to each recipient of the Medal of Honor. This idea came from a constituent of mine, retired First Sergeant William Kendall of Jefferson, IA. Mr. Kendall had been thinking about another resident of Jefferson, Captain Darrell Lindsey, who was shot down while on a bombing mission over France during World War II. Captain Lindsey was able to keep his aircraft in the air long enough to allow the members of his crew to escape safely, but this action cost him his life. As a result of this selfless sacrifice, Captain Lindsey was awarded the Medal of Honor.  A Medal of Honor monument commemorating this heroic Iowan nowstands on the courthouse lawn in Jefferson, IA. It was partly this monument and the proud history of his fellow Iowan that inspired Bill Kendall to ponder the heroism of all recipients of the Medal of Honor. He then began to wonder why there was no official flag to honor recipients of the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is the Nation's highest award for bravery he felt that a flag would help to show respect for this award as well as all those who have earned it through their service to the United States of America. I agree.  The Medal of Honor is not given out lightly. To date, only 3,439 individuals have been awarded the Medal of Honor and there are only 143 living recipients of this award. Each of the armed services has very strict regulations for judging whether an individual is entitled to the Medal of Honor. The award is only given for acts of exceptional bravery or self-sacrifice above and beyond what is expected and must involve risk of life. The deed must be proved by incontestable evidence of at least two eyewitnesses.  I should also add that there is an Iowa connection going back to the creation of the Medal of Honor. In 1861, during the Civil War, Iowa Senator James Grimes introduced legislation in the Senate to create a Medal of Honor for the Navy. This first Medal of Honor was followed by similar awards for the other services. It is appropriate that another Iowan, Sergeant William Kendall, should create the first Medal of Honor flag.  It is indeed right and appropriate to honor those Americans to whom we owe so much. Bill Kendall's idea for a Medal of Honor flag is a good one and I am honored to do what I can to help see his vision realized. I am pleased that the House has already acted on a similar measure and I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in this important initiative.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 38       Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor      in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon      an individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United      States;       Whereas the Medal of Honor was established by Congress      during the Civil War to recognize soldiers who had      distinguished themselves by gallantry in action;       Whereas the Medal of Honor was conceived by Senator James      Grimes of the State of Iowa in 1861; and       Whereas the Medal of Honor is the Nation's highest military      honor, awarded for acts of personal bravery or self-sacrifice      above and beyond the call of duty: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
