 I am not a zoologist, so I don't know if crocodiles can cry, but I am very concerned about the argument the Senator from Pennsylvania made. He is actually standing here, in defense of senior citizens, by objecting to disclosing the list price that the pharmaceutical companies charge for these drugs. I didn't choose that price; they chose that price.
