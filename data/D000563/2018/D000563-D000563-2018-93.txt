That is what the Republican majority leader said over the weekend, that we are going to plow through this nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. It doesn't sound to me like a recipe for fairness, and it certainly doesn't sound like a recipe for getting to the truth. Plow through. That was what the Republican majority leader said the Republican majority would do.  When this all started, I was surprised when a spokesperson for President Trump--Kellyanne Conway, who is not noted for her moderation--made what I thought was a very moderate and thoughtful statement at the beginning of the consideration of Dr. Ford's charges. She said that we are neither going to ignore nor insult Dr. Ford. I thought that was a good standard. Unfortunately, since she has said that, neither the President nor many Republican leaders have lived up to it.  I really come to this as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who is trying to think about the gravity of the situation and what is fair. In this situation, we have Dr. Ford's coming forward. I have thought long and hard and have talked to many of my staffersand friends back home about her motivation. What in the world does she have to gain by putting herself and her family through this? What is at the end of it for her?  I can't see any positives other than the satisfaction that she is pursuing what she believes to be true. She is exposing herself to ridicule, harassment, and attack even by the President of the United States in his tweets. Her family is in danger, and they have had to move out of their home. Her computers have been hacked, and she has had to engage attorneys and get into lengthy negotiations with Republicans in the Senate just for a chance to come and tell her story. This woman had a family and a life and was well respected by her colleagues and the people in her community. It has been turned upside down.  Why? What is in this for Dr. Ford? What is she trying to achieve here?
