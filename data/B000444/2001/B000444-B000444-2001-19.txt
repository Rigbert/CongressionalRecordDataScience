 President, today I am introducing legislation, along with Senators Sessions, Cleland, Cochran, and Dayton that simply ensures that personnel serving in Korea get the same tax benefits as personnel serving in other forward deployed areas of the world such as Kuwait and the Balkans. I am hoping that this legislation can be added to the economic stimulus package, but if not, I want to make other Senators aware of the need to take this action for the brave men and women serving in Korea.  We cannot fix all of the quality of life problems in Korea overnight, but we can at least provide basic equity in the tax treatment of military personnel who serve there so that they get the same benefits those in Kuwait and the Balkans get.  Let me share with my colleagues some of the facts that led us to decide that this tax equity is needed and is needed now.  While we have representatives of every service in Korea, the bulk of our force is from the Army. Seventeen percent of the entire Army is stationed in, on orders to, or returning from the Republic of Korea at any given time. That's about 37,000 soldiers.  Unlike most Army postings, which tend to be for six months, ninety-six percent of those stationed in Korea are there for at least one year of unaccompanied duty. In some Army specialities, personnel are asked to serve for far more than one unaccompanied, year-long tour in Korea, which encourages experienced personnel to leave the Army.  Duty tours in Korea involve longer separations from family, under worse quality of life conditions than almost any other overseas Army post, in a military zone that is clearly hostile, for less pay. This is a serious moral issue. Let me give you an example, a typical E-5 will make $5,136 less, $2,292 in Federal taxes that must be paid and not getting the $2,844 separation ration if sent to Korea rather than the Balkans. Our men and women in the military do not serve to become rich, but people notice and morale suffers when one assignment means working in poor conditions for a year and taking a $5,000 pay-cut.  When I say the conditions are poor, I want people to know that I am not exaggerating. The quality of life in Korea is recognized as substantially lower than other overseas posts and far lower than within the United States. Consider that orders for Korea have the highest command declination rate and the highest ``no show'' rate in the Army.  Even worse, look at the housing situation. Only ten percent of the command sponsored service members serving in Korea can be housed, and that housing is generally substandard. Compare this to seventy-two percent of forces deployed to Japan and seventy-four percent of forces in Europe having housing available.  Let me explain what I mean by substandard housing in Korea. The same Quonset huts built in the 1950s as temporary structures are still being used in 2001 to house troops today. Those huts are being shared by 4 or more personnel, often at a level of Sergeant or higher, which is well below standard quarters for such rank.  I visited those Quonset huts when I traveled to Korea in August. I saw the sand bags they have to put out when it rains to prevent major flooding. I witnessed the cramped living quarters; even worse than my freshman college dorm room. I have heard that when winter comes, and Korean winters are famous for their severity, these buildings are much like living in an igloo.  Our troops make the best of this deplorable situation, but they deserve some relief. These are the men and women on whom we rely to deter North Korean aggression on a peninsula that is still technically in a state of war.  Because the tour of duty is unaccompanied for ninety-six percent of the service members there, most of the approximately 21,000 married military personnel in Korea are forced to maintain 2 households. The substandard accommodations available force significant out-of-pocket expenses for basic items like food for both households, phone access, transportation, and other items basic to other posts. The Command estimates that $3,000 to $5,000 per year are spent by deployed personnel on these ``hidden costs.'' Any family that has had to budget knows that this is a significant economic burden at a time when these families are already enduring a year of separation.  It is no wonder that the Army has trouble filling billets in Korea. If you combine the tax disparity and the ``hidden costs'', a mid-level E-5 will make $8,000 to $10,000 less if deployed to Korea versus the Balkans or Kuwait. This is unacceptable, and it is something that we can fix now. The command estimates that granting pay equity would cost approximately $85 million a year. That is surely the least we owe the fine men and women serving in Korea today.                                 ______                                       By
