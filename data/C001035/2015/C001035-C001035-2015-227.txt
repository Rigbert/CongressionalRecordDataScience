President, today Senator Nelson and I rise to discuss S. 266, the Retirement Security Act, legislation we filed earlier this week and first introduced last year. Our bill would encourage more small employers to offer retirement plans that would provide incentives for employees to save more for retirement and would ensure that low-income and middle-income taxpayers are able to claim tax benefits for retirement savings that are already authorized in law.  Our bill is the product of the work that Senator Nelson and I did together on the Special Committee on Aging. In the fall of 2013, the committee conducted a hearing on retirement security where we heard from witnesses that far too many American seniors have real reason to fear they will outlive their savings. According to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, there is an estimated $6.6 trillion gap between the savings that American households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement and what they actually have. The group that was surveyed were those Americans between ages 32 and 64.  Nationally, one in four retired Americans has no source of income beyond Social Security. In the State of Maine the number is one in three. While 4 in 10 rely on this vital program for 90 percent of their retirement income, Social Security provides an average benefit of just $1,294 per month--less than $16,000 per year.  It is hard to imagine stretching those dollars far enough to pay the bills. Certainly a comfortable retirement would be out of the question for most Americans.  A recent Gallup poll shows there is an increase in concern among the American people about their standard of living in retirement. This has gone up over time. Two decades ago 34 percent of Americans were concerned. Now 60 percent of Americans are worried about their standard of living in retirement.  Sadly, they are right to be concerned. Projections published in 2014 by the Employee Benefit Research Institute showed that nearly half of ``early boomers''--those between ages 56 and 62 when the study was conducted--are at risk of not having enough money to pay for basic costs in retirement, including health care costs not covered by insurance.  There are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing American seniors, including the demise of many defined-benefit pension plans in the private sector, the severity of the financial crisis we recently endured, rising health care costs, the greater and expanding need for long-term care, which is so expensive, but most of all the fact that Americans are living far longer than they did in the past. Many of us are also reaching retirement age with far more debt than retirees of previous generations.  Another contributing factor we found is that employees of small businesses are much less likely to participate in employer-based retirement plans. According to a July 2013 GAO study, more than half of the 42 million Americans who work for businesses with fewer than 100 employees lack access to a work-based plan to save for retirement. Cost and complexity are among the reasons that plans are not more widely offered by smaller employers.  These employers would very much like to offer plans, but oftentimes the cost and the complexity make the plans out of reach. Therefore, making it easier for smaller businesses to provide access to retirement plans for their workers would make a significant difference in the financial security of many retirees. That is why the bill that we reintroduced earlier this week focuses on reducing the cost and complexity of retirement plans, especially for small businesses, and on encouraging individuals to save more for retirement.  Let me now go into detail about the provisions of our bill.  First, our bill would allow small businesses to enter into multiple employer plans, MEPs, to offer retirement programs jointly to their employees. This allows small companies to share the administrative burden of a retirement plan, which helps lower costs. Current law discourages the use of MEPs because it requires a connection, or ``nexus,'' between unrelated businesses in order to join a MEP, such as membership in the same trade association. Our bill would waive the nexus requirement for businesses with fewer than 500 employees. So as not to discourage growth, our bill provides a long phase-out under which businesses are not automatically disqualified from a MEP when they hire their 500th employee.  Second, our bill makes joining a MEP a more attractive option for small businesses. Under current law, if one employer in a MEP fails to meet the minimum criteria necessary for retirement plans to obtain tax benefits, all employers and their employees could lose these tax benefits, which are substantial. For employees, they include delaying the taxation of income contributed to a plan until funds are withdrawn. For employers, plan disqualification could result in limited deductions and a higher tax burden. Our bill directs Treasury to issue regulations to address this uncertainty, and protect members of a MEP from the failure of one bad apple to meet its obligations.  Third, our bill reduces the cost of maintaining a retirement plan. Current law requires that participants in a retirement plan receive a variety of notices. Our bill would direct Treasury to simplify, clarify, and consolidate these required notices, to lessen costs.  Fourth, the Retirement Security Act encourages those still in the workforce to save more for retirement. Retirement plans are often designed to comply with existing safe harbors to prevent the IRS from challenging the tax benefits that flow to employees and employers. The existing safe harbor for so-called ``automatic enrollment'' plans effectively caps employee contributions at 10 percent of annual pay, with the employer contributing a ``matching'' amount of up to 6 percent. Our bill creates an additional safe harbor for these plans that would allow employees to receive an employer match on contributions of up to 10 percent of their pay.  I recognize that businesses that choose to adopt a plan with this new optional safe harbor may face additional costs due to the increased employer match. That is why our bill helps the smallest businesses--those with fewer than 100 employees--offset this cost by providing a new tax credit equal to the increased match.  Finally, our bill ensures that current measures to encourage savings are functioning as they were intended. One such measure is the so-called ``saver's credit,'' which reduces the tax burden on low- and middle-income individuals who contribute to retirement plans, including IRAs and 401(k) plans. Yet the credit cannot be claimed on a form 1040EZ, which is frequently used by these individuals. A 2013 Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies survey found that only 23 percent of people with household incomes of less than $50,000 per year, the group most likely to qualify, were aware of the saver's credit. To address this, our bill directs Treasury to make the credit available on Form 1040 EZ.  I do want to emphasize in closing that is there is nothing in our bill that would force a small business to offer a 401(k) plan. That may be impractical for some small employers. What we are trying to do is to provide incentives for them to do so, to reduce the cost, and to make it possible for them to join together with other employers to offer retirement plans. We are trying also to provide incentives for employees to save more for their retirement.  During my time on the Special Committee on Aging, I have heard countless stories of retirees whose savings did not go as far as they had anticipated. Adequate savings reduce poverty among our seniors in what should be their golden years. As the HELP Committee noted in a July 2012 report, poverty among the elderly also increases Medicare and Medicaid costs and strains our social safety net. Giving those not yet at retirement age more opportunities to save--and to save more--would help ease this additional burden on entitlement programs that are already projected to be unsustainable.  In light of the positive impacts this bill would have in strengthening retirement security for millions of Americans, I urge our colleagues to join Senator Nelson and me in supporting the Retirement Security Act of 2015. This bill has been endorsed by the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, the American Benefits Council, the American Council of Life Insurers, Fidelity Investments, Lincoln Financial Group, the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, the Plan Sponsor Council of America, the Principal Financial Group, the Society for Human Resource Management, TransAmerica, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these as well as other letters of support.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Maine State Chamber of Commerce,                                     Augusta, ME, January 8, 2015.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: First, I want to wish you a Happy New      Year. I would also like to thank you for your continued      service to the state of Maine, particularly the business      community. Your efforts in Washington are most appreciated!       I am writing to you today about your efforts to enable more      businesses to offer retirement plans to their employees. The      Maine State Chamber of Commerce fully supports your efforts      on this front. As you know, small businesses drive Maine's      economy--80% of businesses here in Maine employ fewer than 20      people--and their employees are like family to them.       I regularly hear from small businesses who want to offer      more retirement benefits to their employees, but are not in      the financial position to do so. Coming from a small business      state, you clearly understand this. Your proposed legislation      can. change this dynamic and make offering retirement plans a      more viable option for more small businesses--not only in      Maine, but across the country.       Again, thank you for your efforts on behalf of Maine's      business community. Please let me know if you have any      questions.           Sincerely,                                                  Dana F. Connors,                                                    President/CEO.                                       ____                                    American Benefits Council,                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Bill Nelson,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Nelson: On behalf of the      American Benefits Council, I am writing to applaud the      introduction of the Retirement Security Act of 2015. We stand      ready to assist you in working toward enactment of this      important piece of legislation.       The Council is a public policy organization representing      principally Fortune 500 companies and other organizations      that assist employers of all sizes in providing benefits to      employees. Collectively, the Council's members either sponsor      directly or provide services to retirement and health plans      that cover more than 100 million Americans.       The private retirement system is a great success and has      helped ensure the retirement security of millions of      Americans. But there is still more work to be done,      especially with respect to the coverage of small business      employees and with respect to benefit levels.       Your bill would take major steps forward in addressing both      of these issues. We believe the bill's reforms of the      multiple employer plans rules will expand opportunities for      small businesses to band together to maintain plans at a      lower cost. In particular, we applaud the provision that      would prevent an entire multiple employer plan from being      disqualified by reason of a violation of the qualification      rules by one or more participating employers. This      inappropriate result under current law can deter many small      employers from joining a multiple employer plan.       The Council is a strong supporter of automatic enrollment,      and believes that the Retirement Security Act of 2015 would      substantially increase the use of automatic enrollment      through the establishment of an alternative safe harbor with      key incentives to adopt it. Moreover, the alternative safe      harbor would set default contributions at higher levels that      are better designed to achieve retirement security.       We thank you for your leadership in this important area and      look forward to working toward enactment of this important      bill.           Sincerely,     Lynn D. Dudley,       Senior Vice President, Global Retirement and Compensation      Policy, American Benefits Council.                                  ____                            American Council of Life Insurers,                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Bill Nelson,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Nelson, The American      Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) would like to express our      appreciation for your leadership in the field of retirement      security, especially in your roles as Chairman and Ranking      Member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. We support      you for reintroducing the Retirement Security Act of 2015, a      bill that would greatly expand the ability of Americans to      better save for their retirement.       ACLI represents approximately 300 legal reserve life      insurer and fraternal benefit society member companies      operating in the United States and abroad. ACLI member      companies offer insurance contracts and other investment      products and services to qualified retirement plans,      including defined benefit pensions, 401(k) and 403(b)      arrangements, and to individuals through individual      retirement accounts (IRAs) or on a non-qualified basis. Our      members and their products help Americans accumulate      retirement savings and turn those savings into guaranteed      lifetime income.       ACLI supports proposals that will help expand coverage and      encourage small businesses to sponsor retirement savings      plans for their employees. The Retirement Security Act of      2015 would help facilitate the use of private multiple      employer plans, encourage greater use of auto-enrollment and      auto-escalation features, and allow employers to use a      ``stretch match'' to incent employees to save even more. The      bill would expand tax incentives for small businesses to      offer retirement plans, an important consideration for many      employers. Likewise, the bill would make it easier for more      individuals to access the Savers' Credit, helping low-income      workers maximize their savings. These valuable reforms will      help to expand a system already important to millions of      Americans.       Again, we appreciate your continued support of the current      retirement security system. ACLI and its member companies      look forward to working with you and your staffs to improve      retirement security for all Americans.           Sincerely,                                                  Dirk Kempthorne,     President and Chief Executive Officer.                                  ____                                         Fidelity Investments,                                     Boston, MA, January 20, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirksen Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Bill Nelson,     Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Nelson: On behalf of Fidelity      Investments, I would like to thank you for your efforts to      improve retirement security and enhance pension coverage      among small employers. The private employer retirement system      has been a great success, yet more can be done to improve      retirement security and expand access to workplace savings      plans.       Fidelity supports provisions in the Retirement Security Act      of 2013 that would establish a new safe harbor from the      401(k) nondiscrimination rules for plans that automatically      enroll employees at a minimum contribution level equal to 6      percent of pay. One of the key actions to boost retirement      security for workers is to save at the right rates in a      workplace savings plan. Automatic enrollment at a minimum of      6 percent of pay, along with annual automatic increases and      investing appropriately, puts workers on a better path toward      retirement security. Our data and analysis show that the      average participation rate among plans with automatic      enrollment is approximately 90 percent, regardless of the      default contribution rate and regardless of the salary level.      The 3 percent minimum contribution rate under the current      safe harbor is too low and woefully inadequate to put      employees on a path to reach their retirement savings goals.      Due to human inertia many employees who auto-enroll at 3      percent are unlikely to take any action to increase their      savings. Raising the minimum contribution level from 3      percent to 6 percent would go a long way toward increasing      savings rates and improving retirement security.       Furthermore, Fidelity supports provisions in the bill to      streamline and simplify regulations and reduce unnecessary      burdens that serve as an obstacle to retirement plan      coverage. Regulatory burdens are one of the biggest obstacles      to small employers that may otherwise want to offer a      retirement plan to their employees.       Fidelity applauds your leadership on retirement security      and appreciates your efforts to advance these reforms. We      hope to work with you as the bill moves through the      legislative process to further simplify the rules and      streamline duplicative or unnecessary regulations to help      achieve your goal of expanding pension coverage.           Regards,                                                Douglas B. Fisher,     Senior Vice President.                                  ____                                      Lincoln Financial Group,                                 Greensboro, NC, January 20, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Lincoln Financial Group,      I am writing to express our strong support for the Retirement      Security Act of 2015. We thank you for your leadership in      sponsoring this very important bill.       Congress has made great strides forward in enhancing      retirement security, but there are many challenges still      ahead. One of the key challenges is improving retirement plan      coverage among small businesses. The Act would help address      the small business issue by reforming the rules regarding      multiple employer plans, which help small businesses achieve      many of the economies of scale that large businesses have.      The Act would modify the rules to make multiple employer      plans more efficient and more workable for small businesses.       We also applaud the Act's new automatic enrollment safe      harbor and its important enhancement of access to the saver's      credit. These provisions will increase participation levels,      especially among low and middle-income individuals.       We strongly support your efforts and stand ready to assist      you in moving forward with this important piece of      legislation.           Sincerely,                                              Charles C. Cornelio,     President, Retirement Plan Services.                                  ____                                           National Association of                             Insurance and Financial Advisors,                                Falls Church, VA, January 7, 2015.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The National Association of Insurance      and Financial Advisors (NAIFA) applauds your efforts in      preserving and enhancing the voluntary employer-provided      retirement system and the tax incentives that support it.      These plans are helping millions of American families achieve      a secure retirement.       The employer-sponsored retirement plan system has      introduced tens of millions of American workers to retirement      saving. Employers voluntarily establish and promote these      plans to help their workers build assets for a secure      retirement.       NAIFA encourages support for the Retirement Security Act of      2015 introduced by Senator Susan M. Collins. The bill would      add a new more generous safe harbor for small business      retirement plans, establish a tax credit for employer matches      for plan sponsors using the new (optional) safe harbor, and      ease the rules allowing small employers to join multiple      employer pension plans.       Cost is often a factor in whether a business will offer a      plan for its employees to adequately save for retirement.      This bill lowers costs by waiving a requirement that there be      a nexus among businesses to join multiple employer plans,      thereby allowing more entities to share plan administrative      burdens.     The bill instructs Treasury to simplify, clarify and      consolidate notice requirements for retirement plans, and      instructs Treasury to provide taxpayers using a 1040EZ filing      the ability to report and receive a tax credit, if eligible.       We thank you for your leadership in helping employees plan      and prepare for a financially secure retirement.           Sincerely,                                              Juli Y. McNeely,                                                  LUTCF, CFP, CLU,     NAIFA President.                                  ____                                    Principal Financial Group,                                  Des Moines, IA, January 9, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Bill Nelson,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins and Nelson: On behalf of Principal      Financial Group, I want to thank you for your leadership in      seeking to improve and enhance the existing voluntary defined      contribution system through the Retirement Security Act of      2015. Employer sponsored 401(k) plans and other worksite      retirement plans have helped millions of workers save      trillions of dollars. These plans have proven to be resilient      even in challenging times but more is needed to expand access      to worksite retirement plans. Your proposal builds upon the      strength of the existing system, providing main street      businesses the necessary tools to address retirement savings      adequacy and coverage challenges.       Principal Financial Group is a leading provider of defined      contribution plans with more than 70 years' experience      working with small to medium-sized employers and their      employees. We currently provide retirement services to more      than 41,000 retirement plans and 4.5 million employee      participants.       Principal was particularly pleased with your inclusion of      the enhanced automatic contribution safe harbor. We must find      ways to encourage far greater numbers of plan sponsors to      adopt automatic enrollment and escalation features with      substantive employer match contributions. To do this, we feel      more flexibility is needed in the existing safe harbor      requirements and your proposal offers a good starting point      for gaining that additional flexibility.       Thank you for your leadership in this area. We look forward      to working with you as the process continues. Seeking      solutions to these important policy considerations to expand      savings rates in the current employer based retirement system      is vital to the economic wellbeing of millions of future      retirees.           Sincerely,                                               Gregory J. Burrows,     Senior Vice President.                                  ____                                                 Society for Human                                          Resource Management,                                  Alexandria, VA, January 9, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington,DC.     Hon. Bill Nelson,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington,DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Nelson: On behalf of more than      275,000 human resource professionals who belong to the      Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), I would like to      thank you for your leadership on the issue of retirement      security. The introduction of the Retirement Security Act of      2015, demonstrates your commitment to ensuring that all      Americans are given the ability to save for retirement.       Founded in 1948, SHRM is the world's largest membership      organization devoted to human resource management.      Representing more than 275,000 members in over 160 countries,      SHRM is the leading provider of resources to meet the      evolving needs of HR professionals, while advancing the      professional practice of human resource management. SHRM has      more than 575 affiliated chapters throughout the United      States.       As human resource professionals, it has been our members'      experience that a comprehensive and flexible benefits package      is an essential tool in recruiting and retaining talented      employees. Regardless of an employer's size, it is vitally      important that every employee be given the opportunity to      save and plan for retirement and to protect his or her      family's financial health. Steps the government can take to      facilitate and encourage voluntary employer-sponsored      retirement plans and individual savings plans are critical to      achieving this goal.       Removing barriers and disincentives, especially for small      businesses, is a tactic that can lead to greater      participation in employer-provided defined benefit retirement      plans. A variety of options including tax incentives,      increased contribution limits, catch-up contributions for      older workers and increased access for employees, are all      elements that have proven to increase participation and      contribution levels in retirement plans. SHRM believes that      the Retirement Security Act of 2015 would benefit both      employers and employees by expanding important tax credits to      small businesses as well as expanding auto-enrollment safe      harbor provisions. These elements are essential for small      businesses, who comprise an important segment of our      membership, to offer retirement plans that enable their      employees to save for retirement.

Sincerely,                                                Michael P. Aitken,     Vice President, Government Affairs.                                  ____                                                     Transamerica,                                           Government Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2015.                   Re Retirement Security Act of 2015     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins:  On behalf of Transamerica, I would      like to thank you for your leadership on retirement security      issues as most recently evidenced by your introduction today      of the Retirement Security Act of 2015.       Your bill addresses in a comprehensive manner problems      faced by small and large employers in providing their      employees the means to save for a secure retirement, as well      as by individuals in trying to achieve a secure retirement      through workplace savings. In particular, removing      impediments to the adoption of multiple employer plans,      expanding the auto enrollment safe harbor and making it      easier to claim the Saver's Credit are areas in which      Transamerica has been extremely active--from a policy,      participant education and market development standpoint. I      and others at Transamerica look forward to working with you      and your staff as you move the bill forward.       The Transamerica companies market life insurance,      annuities, pensions and supplemental health insurance, as      well as mutual funds and related investment products      throughout the U.S. and in selected countries worldwide.      Transamerica Retirement Solutions provides and services      workforce retirement savings plans in the small and mid-large      employer markets.

The Transamerica companies are ranked among the      top insurance groups in the U.S., based on admitted assets,      and employ approximately 11,000 people nationwide.       Please do not hesitate to contact either me if I can      provide any specific information regarding our retirement      plan business or market expertise to support your efforts.           Very truly yours,                                            Jeanne de Cervens,                                        Vice President & Director,     Federal Government Affairs.                                  ____                                              Chamber of Commerce,                                     United States of America,                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Vern Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins and Representative Buchanan: The U.S.      Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation      representing the interests of more than three million      businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as      state and local chambers and industry associations, and      dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending America's      free enterprise system, thanks you for introducing the      ``Retirement Security Act of 2015.'' Retirement security is a      critical issue, and our members support all efforts to      encourage voluntary participation in retirement savings      plans.       The Retirement Security Act of 2015 includes key provisions      that the Chamber has set forth as important reforms to the      retirement system including eliminating barriers to the use      of multiple employer plans; providing optional safe harbor      alternatives; and simplifying notice requirements. Overall,      the Chamber believes that the Retirement Security Act of 2015      would provide important reforms to encourage participation by      both plan sponsors and plan participants in the employer-     provided retirement system.       The Chamber looks forward to working with you on this bill      and urges Congress to take steps to further the enactment of      the bill.           Sincerely,                                              R. Bruce Josten,                                         Executive Vice President,     Government Affairs.                                  ____                              Plan Sponsor Council of America,                                 Washington, DC, January 20, 2015.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Bill Nelson,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Nelson, The Plan Sponsor Council      of America (PSCA) is pleased to endorse the Retirement      Security Act of 2015. The Act removes several impediments      that restrict the ability of small businesses to participate      in multiple employer plans, or MEPs. Expanded MEP access will      open another important avenue for small business owners to      provide critically important retirement plans for hardworking      employees.       The small business arena is the last frontier for improving      access to an employer-provided retirement plan. The      Retirement Security Act of 2015 will help conquer this      frontier, providing a uniform, federal response. This is an      especially timely endeavor as states consider enacting new      legislation relating to employer-based retirement plans that      could result in a problematic patchwork of disparate laws      impacting plan sponsors and employees.       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of American workers.           Sincerely,                                            Stephen McCaffrey,                                              Chairman, PSCA Legal                                        and Legislative Committee.
