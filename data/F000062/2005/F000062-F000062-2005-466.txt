 President, I rise today to congratulate El Camino Real High School of Woodland Hills, CA, on winning the prestigious U.S. Academic Decathlon for a second year in a row an astonishing achievement for all the students, teachers, and parents involved.  Each year, the U.S. Academic Decathlon brings together some of our Nation's brightest students for 2 days of competition on a broad range of subjects including mathematics, literature, economics, art, science, and music. I am very proud to report thatin the 24 years of this competition, schools representing California have finished first or second every year except for one.  El Camino's tremendous victory represents an incredible fourth title in the last 8 years. Only one other school in the Nation has been more successful. El Camino is the first school to win back-to-back championships since their fellow Californians, Palo Alto High School, achieved that distinction in 1982 and 1983.  This triumph is the result of much effort and sacrifice. These amazingly dedicated students have given up spring and summer vacations and spent up to 10 hours a day preparing. Their hard work and commitment have certainly paid great dividends.  El Camino finished first with 49,009 points out of a possible 60,000, beating their nearest opponent by 723, and were led by their top scorer--Laura Descher.  It is important to note that the Academic Decathlon is set up to award versatility and breadth of knowledge, requiring each student to prepare for all the various academic events. This means that each student has developed a diverse and robust degree of scholarship rather than just specializing in one given topic.  The nine students whose effort and determination have made our State so proud are Micah Roth, Benjamin Farahmand, Jihwan Kim, Lindsey Cohen, Laura Descher, Lindsay Gibbs, Sean Follmer, Brian Hwang, and Kevin Rosenberg.  A great deal of the credit must be given to the dedicated coaches--Christian Cerone and Lissa Gregorio. This whole experience has certainly been just as memorable for them as it has for their students.  Of course, no congratulations would be complete without mentioning the contributions of the parents and family members who have been there each step of the way to cheer these young people on and support them in their lofty goals.  Again, I congratulate El Camino Real High School on this great achievement and wish all the students involved continued success in whatever they decide to do. You have made your State, your parents, your school, and your Senator very proud.                          ____________________
