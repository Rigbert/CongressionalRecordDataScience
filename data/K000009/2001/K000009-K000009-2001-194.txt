Speaker, America needs a new declaration of economic independence: Freedom, justice, opportunity. These are the values that our parents, grandparents, and forebears lived and died for. These are the values that prompt young men and women to give themselves to military and public service. These are the values that reflect the highest ideals of our country and what America has historically offered to the world.  Thus, last week's debate on taxes, the first major economic debate of the 21st century and of the new Presidency, disappointed me greatly. The debate should have centered on what is the wisest economic course of action for the sustenance of our republic. But the debate basically boiled down to what every American can take for himself or herself. The President went around the country divisively and derisively saying, ``It's not the government's money; it's your money.'' Except for one thing: We, the American people, are the government. His rhetoric appealed to themost selfish instincts imaginable; and his proposals are proving he is headed towards government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich.  Contrast his base appeal with that of President John F. Kennedy who once summoned Americans to ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country, and what we together can do for the freedom of humankind.  Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues in the other body to choose a wiser economic course than the House and the President, a prudent course, a responsible course for our Nation's future. We should not imperil our Nation's economic growth through reckless tax cuts. America should first pay its bills.  The facts are that the interest payments alone on America's $5.5 trillion debt account for an ever-increasing percentage of the annual budget.  Look at this chart. This shows since 1975, interest payments on our national debt have grown every year. This is the year 2000 right here, highest ever, and projected this year, over $434 billion of interest payments alone on the debt. So what is all this talk about this magic surplus? And think about how these interest payments crowd out other important national investments we could be making, in Social Security and Medicare, where we must pay those bills, in defense and education, in veterans benefits, in transportation, in the environment and certainly in agriculture.  In the 1990s, due to unparalleled economic growth and strong budget discipline by Members of this House, we began to turn our ship of state around in the proper direction by finally beginning to get our bills paid. But I urge anyone to go to the U.S. Department of Treasury Web site and see for yourselves what America still owes. Here is the Web site number right up here, http://publicdebt.treas.gov.  Let me point out also that the percentage of foreign holders of the Federal debt has tripled since I was a freshman on the Banking Committee, going from 12 percent of what is being bought by others today to a resounding 41 percent. The largest investor in the U.S. Federal debt is now Japan, holding over $340 billion. Do you have any question in your mind why our products cannot gain fair access to Japan's markets when she is holding the purse strings?  Something has gone terribly, terribly wrong with our economic policies. In fact, interest on our debt now exceeds more than we pay in an annual year for the defense of this Nation. It is double what we spend annually on Medicaid and Medicare. And it dwarfs critical spending in other nondefense areas like education, transportation, veterans, agriculture, all put together into one.  I wanted to add to that our trade deficit. Every single year over the last 20 years, America's trade deficit with the world has deepened to historically all-time levels. Almost $500 billion more imports coming into this country on an annual basis than our exports going out. And you ask yourself who is now the largest holder of these private dollars related to goods trade with America? I can tell you it is the People's Republic of China, which is far from my definition of a republic, with over $80 billion of holdings in U.S. dollar reserves.  So what is wrong with the Bush plan? Tomorrow night I am going to continue on that, but let me first say that the President's tax and budget plan ought to lead to paying down our debt and ushering in a new era of economic independence for our country.                          ____________________
