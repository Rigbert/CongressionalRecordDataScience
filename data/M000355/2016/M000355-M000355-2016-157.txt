 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, November 29, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration of S. 2873 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask consent that the Alexander substitute amendment No. 5110 be agreed to, that there be up to 30 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form, and following the use or yielding back of that time, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate vote on the bill, as amended, with no intervening action or debate.
