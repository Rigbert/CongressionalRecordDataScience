Speaker, it is my pleasure to honor the activities of the Puerto Rican Parade and Cultural Organization of Northwest Indiana. On Sunday, July 16, 2000, I had the privilege of attending this year's kickoff of the organization's festivities, at the Puerto Rican Dia Del Camp Kickoff Picnic in East Chicago, Indiana. On Thursday, July 20, 2000, the organization will be hosting its 18th Annual Dignitary Banquet at Hijos de Borinquen in East Chicago, Indiana. The annual celebration for Northwest Indiana's Puerto Rican community will culminate on July 22, 2000, with the traditional festival at East Chicago's Block Stadium, and the community parade on July 23, 2000.  I especially would like to congratulate Ms. Betty Paine, President of the Puerto Rican Parade and Cultural Organization of Northwest Indiana, as well as all other members for their time-honored dedication to the preservation of their Puerto Rican heritage. Joining the celebration at the Dignitary Banquet will be Mayor Luis Oliver, of Lares, Puerto Rico, and Jose Luis Gonzalez, Director of the Tourism Board in Lares.  The history of Puerto Rico is one of great pride and honor. In 1493 Columbus found the island of Borinquen (the Amerindian name for Puerto Rico) to be inhabited by Taino Indians, a subgroup of the Arawak thought to have arrived on the island 1,000 years before from South America. The Taino Indians who greeted Columbus showed him gold nuggets in the river and told him to take all he wanted. The town founded near this river was named Puerto Rico, or ``rich port,'' with the island being named ``San Juan Bautista,'' for St. John the Baptist. It was not until later that the two names were switched.  The rich culture of the people of Puerto Rico evolved progressively over the centuries. Immigrants brought influences from Europe, Africa, Asia, and other Caribbean islands to Puerto Rico, and blended them to create a uniquesociety found nowhere else. Today, more than 2 million Puerto Ricans have migrated to the United States. The values and traditions that were brought with them have strengthened American society, and our country has been enriched with the infusion of Puerto Rican culture, folklore, hospitality, and way of life.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Puerto Rican Parade and Cultural Organization of Northwest Indiana for its commitment to remembering Puerto Rican heritage, as well as its commitment to improving the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District. May this year's cultural celebration be a joyous one.                          ____________________
