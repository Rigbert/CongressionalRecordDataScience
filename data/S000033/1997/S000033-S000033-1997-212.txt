 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Hanover High School in Hanover, NH, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. Gollub. Hello, Congressman Sanders. My name is Ian      Gollub and I am here today to represent the views of my      classmates from Hanover High School in Hanover, New      Hampshire.       Clear-cutting the forest in Vermont and elsewhere in our      nation is very important to our Vermont-New Hampshire      students. My classmates and I sincerely believe that clear-     cutting the forests and woodlands not only inhibits future      growth but dangerously jeopardizes other aspects of our      ecosystem.       The two main issues we have chosen to cover are the      environment and economics. First the environmental issue:       Not only are we destroying the forest's aesthetic beauty      but we are injuring the long-term health of the forest as      well. When we remove trees by clear-cutting, we tear up the      ground and compress the soil. The trees are gone, leaving      roots and subterranean soil organisms tightly compacted      underground to stave and die. Necessary fungi and nutrients      are killed by erosion of powerful sunlight falling on an open      area for the first time.       For the specific reason organisms, plants or animals are      killed then any diversity is lost or impoverished by chronic      reduction of regional populations said E.C. Pineau in the      magazine, Nature's Companion. Which brings me to my next      point.       Large populations of animals are being driven away by the      lack of shaded areas in which to live. With such drastic      changes in habitat to the local animal populations and the      deaths of many preexisting animals and plants we are      retarding the rate of ecological regeneration by many, many      years.       While some efforts have been made to regenerate the cut      forests we will never see the forests full again; just      scattered arrangements of various flora growth with no      relation to the region's ancestors. But the most typical      resolution for the forest is a giant open wasteland, a      wasteland which is comprised of dead roots and massive      eroded mud surfaces.       The conclusion of our argument confirms our assertion that      in no way and no how is clear-cutting beneficial to our      nation's flora and fauna life. I would now like to pass the      remainder of my time to my classmate and end short.       Ms. Schrocke. So long does the American dream become      endangered as the huge logging industry strives to take      control of our land. In Maine the large paper industries have      reduced the spruce and fir populations valuable for paper      production by 40 percent. Currently half of paper pulp is      hardwood as a result; hardwood, which is traditionally used      by the smaller local timber industries.       These large corporations undermine the values of such      industries as local sawmills, fishing and hunting, guides,      river rafting companies and perhaps more important to      Vermonters, maple syrup producers. These large companies ship      an astonishing 24 percent of timber cut overseas as whole      logs eliminating jobs for local mills. The name of the game      is money, and if selling the timber to the Japanese makes 40      percent more money, that becomes the priority. These      corporations yield the rewards while the human consequences      are borne by the working people.       If the clear-cutting continues millions of jobs will be      lost because people care more about short-term profits than      long-term preservation. Vermonters will be forced to pay      millions of dollars to plan and instigate reforestation. The      government of Alaska found out the hard way when confronted      with the need to pay $40 million to reforest the Tongas.       We must also look for further solutions when reforestation      plans fail because the nutrients once prevalent in the soil      have gone up in smoke and the wasted fields have been sold to      condominium developers as many have in Maine. Loggers will      become their own breed of endangered species if we do not do      something now to preserve our forests for both ecological and      economic purposes.       Our classmates at Hanover High School ask that a government      policy be instigated which would ban or greatly reduce the      practice of clear-cutting in favor of a selected cutting      policy. This policy would preserve our forests for future use      by reducing soil damage and improper pruning technique which      come hand-in-hand with clear-cutting. A law for the      continuation of the natural habitat which has stood for      centuries and provided for animal and logger both. Now is not      a time for talk, now is the time for action.       Mr. Gollub. When you decide that you are going to clear-cut      your own property and you decide you would like to therefore      ruin your land, the nearby land and surrounding areas,      ecosystems and the plants and animals that might only be      found in that area would be severely damaged.       Ms. Schrocke. One of the problems is that we are not      necessarily asking that private land be regulated so much as      the public land because unfortunately as the logging industry      and the timber industry cuts the trees on their land they are      continually asking our government to sell some of our      national forest which we consider to be national treasures.       Mr. Gollub. Well as you might know actually the bill in      Vermont was passed I think two days ago and actually I was      reading it on the way up, and what it is saying is that when      you want to clear-cut now you have within a certain number of      feet from other people's harvesting area, you have to have      that approved because if you just wanted to destroy your land      and your own ecosystem that is not possible because you are      influencing the surrounding area. Clear-cutting devastates      the soil in the area where trees are cut because of the way      the soil is compacted and the trees were removed from      nutrients and the other soil organisms are killed and left to      die; therefore, the area can be eroded by the sunlight and      the water passing through.       Ms. Schrocke. Saying people have the right to do whatever      they choose is an okay argument only willing to think in the      short term, but if you are willing to think in the long term      and you are looking at the long-term repercussions of this, I      would say it is more important to feed your family for a      lifetime than it is for just a couple of years. And as things      are going right now, we are not going to have any forests      left for loggers to cut down.                               ____________________
