Chairman, if this budget balances, it balances in an alternate reality, perhaps on Planet Reagan. But it does take a very dyspeptic view of investments because they prioritize tax cuts for billionaires over investments. They purport or pretend or actually will cut out all Federal investment in roads, bridges, highways, and transit. That is a $52 billion cut. That is a couple of million jobs, and a lot more crumbling bridges.  We have something called the Land Water Conservation Fund. It is funded by taxes collected from offshore oil drilling. It is suppose to buy conservation lands. They will not allow a single acre of land to be purchased by the Federal Government, but they will still collect the tax from the oil industry.  And what about the looming crisis in wildfires in the West? Well, they are closing their eyes and are pretending we are not going to have drastic wildfires across the West, and they put zero budget in there in anticipation of drastic wildfires.  This is the most unbelievably unrealistic, and I would have to go almost to the word, and I can't attribute it to people's motivations, but hypocritical budget I have ever seen.
