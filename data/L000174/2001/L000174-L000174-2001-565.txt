President, I will be very brief.  All Members of the Senate have, by nature, two residences--in our home States, of course, and wherever they reside during the time we are in session serving in the Senate.  I feel very fortunate to have my residence in Vermont, a beautiful State. It is out in the country on a dirt road with a gorgeous view. I also am fortunate that my residence here is in the Commonwealth of Virginia. In that regard, I believe I am represented, at least temporarily, by two friends from Virginia, the distinguished senior Senator, Mr. Warner, whom I have known for decades and with whom I have been close personal friends, and the current occupant of the Chair, the newest Senator from Virginia, a former Governor, Mr. Allen. In that regard, I wish a happy birthday to the current occupant of the Chair, Senator Allen, and wish him many more such birthdays. I realize that he is in a difficult position. Under the rule, he cannot respond to this. But I did want to do that and tell him how much my family and I enjoy our temporary residence in the beautiful Commonwealth of Virginia.  Mr. President, I am going to offer, at some appropriate point, two amendments. I understand that the distinguished chairman and others have adopted this basically no-amendment posture.
