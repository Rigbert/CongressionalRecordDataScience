I appreciate the co-sponsorship of the Senator from New Hampshire. The only way to produce enduring health reform is to work in a bipartisan manner. Unlike past efforts, through the Healthy Americans Act, there is bi-partisan agreement on the principal issues. Republicans have moved to support covering everyone and Democrats have moved to support private choices.
