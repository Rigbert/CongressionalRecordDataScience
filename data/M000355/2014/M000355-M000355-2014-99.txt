 President, I am saddened to report to my Senate colleagues the passing of a fellow Kentuckian, Mr. Charley Greene Dixon, Jr., who lost his battle with cancer on June 23 of this year. Charley was a consummate public servant who spent his life working to better his community. Knox County, and the entirety of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is poorer for his loss.  The overriding ambition in Charley's life was to help others. His wife Marcia Dixon said, ``He believed that if he could make one life better he was a success.'' This is a bar for success that Charley cleared time and time again.  Born in Barbourville on November 19, 1964, Charley lived in Kentucky his whole life, mostly in his hometown in Knox County. He attended Union College in Barbourville and earned his juris doctorate from Northern Kentucky's Salmon P. Chase College of Law.  Charley started his career working as the Barbourville city attorney, later becoming the Knox County school board and Barbourville city school board attorney.  His most recent position was of Knox County attorney, one that he had held since 2003. In that capacity he played a leading role in creating juvenile, family and adult drug courts in Knox County. Through these courts, Charley helped countless individuals reclaim their lives from the clutches of drug addiction.  Outside of his official duties, Charley continued to work tirelessly to better Knox County. He chaired the Knox County UNITE Coalition an organization that combated illicit drug use through education, law enforcement, and rehabilitation. As chairman he spearheaded events, such as ``Hooked on Fishing Not on Drugs,'' where kids and their families could enjoy themselves in a drug-free environment.  For his selfless work in the community, Charley was named the 2013 Man of the Year by the Knox County Chamber of Commerce a fitting award for a man who helped so many.  Charley is survived by his wife Marcia, his daughter Callie Ann, and his son Charleston Arthur. Knox County was undoubtedly bettered by his life's work, and he will be sorely missed by all who loved and knew him.  I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring the life of Charley Greene Dixon, Jr.  The Mountain Advocate recently published an article chronicling Dixon's life. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:              [From the Mountain Advocate, June 26, 2014]               ``Hometown Hero'' Loses Battle With Cancer                          (By Melissa Newman)       John Ray Gray sat quietly in the waiting area at the Knox      County Attorney's Office Monday morning. He wasn't there      because he needed help--at least not this time.       A confessed recovered drug addict, Gray, now 27, first met      former Knox County Attorney Charley Greene Dixon six years      ago in drug court.       Gray said without Dixon and the drug court program, he'd      ``probably be dead.''       ``He was good to me,'' Gray's voice quivered as he spoke.      ``He went beyond his job to help me.''       Gray came to ``check on'' staff members and offer tight      hugs, his tears contagious and shared among the group. His      story is only one of the many dozen that include some      selfless act or shattered belief that work should end at 5      p.m. Dixon, as most have said, was different.       Dixon, who helped hundreds, like Gray, win battles against      drugs, poverty, and domestic violence, lost his own battle to      colon cancer early Monday morning.       The former county attorney first learned he was ill while      on vacation in May 2013. Not long after, on June 30, he      resigned his position to then assistant county attorney      Gilbert Holland, to focus on getting better. The community he      had served so valiantly came together in prayer vigils around      the courthouse square, hoping for a miracle.       ``The loss will be felt by this community for a long      time,'' Holland said. ``Charley dedicated his life to      bettering the lives of the people of Knox County. His efforts      were never contained by the traditional role of his office.      He invented ways to reach out to the community.''       Along with Dixon's successful drug court program that has      graduated thousands, he was well-known for a long list of      community-minded projects--many of which he initiated.      Reaching youth was at the forefront of his vision for a      successful Knox County--Hooked on Fishing Not on Drugs,      Faith-Based Basketball Cheerleading, Anti-Drug Abuse Poster      Contest, a Car/Bike Show for Youth, and a Prevention Camp.       A new youth-related program will take place next fall one      of the last requests Dixon made of long-time friend and      colleague Claudia Greenwood, who worked with Dixon on grants      and public relations.       ``He's already told me that next year he would like for us      to do a pumpkin patch event and have a pumpkin decorating      contest and display the pumpkins in the banks,'' Greenwood      said. ``He was always so creative, coming up with things to      do with the kids and the community,'' Greenwood said. ``He      thought of that while he was sick and wanted to make sure he      told us about it.''       Finding time to grieve in a busy office hasn't been easy      for Dixon's staff. The phone calls keep coming--clients and      the public are priority as usual. Among the foot traffic,      phone calls, and full email boxes, ``it hits'' them that      Dixon's guidance is gone. And though the quiet moments are      few, that's when the staff members feel the waves of emotion      and loss wash over them.       ``Yesterday, when the media wanted statements, it hit me      hard,'' Greenwood said. ``My first thought was that I needed      to ask Charley what to say.''       Dixon, expected to do great things for his community,      succeeded in filling the large shoes of his grandfather John      Dixon who served as Knox County attorney for several decades.      When elected, the younger Dixon brought his grandfather's      legacy and one of his employees into office with him.       ``I've worked for Charley this October will be 19 years,''      Sherry Vaughn said. ``I worked for his grandfather five and a      half years before that until he passed away. I went to school      with Charley; he's been just like a brother to me.''       ``He loved kids,'' Vaughn said. ``He did everything he      could for the children in Knox County. His own children were      his whole world. Words can't describe how we feel about the      situation. He has struggled for a year and now he's a lot      better off. He's up there now looking down at us.''       Dixon's wife, Marcia, like her husband, is active in      community service. Often, the couple worked together and at      times involved the entire family--the children, Callie Ann      and Charleston Arthur, included. The late Dixon's wife knows      her community, their hometown, is better off for having had      her husband as a leader.       ``Charley was very dedicated not only to our family but to      our Knox County community as well,'' Marcia Dixon said. ``His      goal was to help others, and he believed that if he could      make one life better he was a success. I feel blessed to have      shared many joyful years with him and want everyone to be      able to say as an old Hebrew proverb says, ``Say not in      grief: He is no more,' but live in thankfulness that he      was.''       Knox County's Chamber of Commerce members named Dixon Knox      County's Man of the Year last fall and tagged him a      ``hometown hero.''       Dixon's introduction as Man of the Year heralded a long      list of community-minded projects that he participated in,      implemented, or, in some cases, created.       Dixon served as the chair of the Knox County UNITE      (Unlawful Narcotics Investigation, Treatment, and Education)      Coalition since May 2005. The former county attorney was also      instrumental in securing grant funding through the Foundation      for a Healthy Kentucky; a grant from PRIDE; a Coal Severance      Grant; a Fatherhood Grant and a EUDL Grant to fund programs      for young people that promoted prevention for underage      drinking.       Dixon made sure his office staff actively participated in      Back to School Expos, PRIDE Pick-Up, Relay for Life, the      Child Identification Program, the Knox County Reading      Celebration, the local August Arts Adventure, and the annual      Redbud festival.       Dixon was an active military advocate--photos of local      service men and women lined the hallways leading to his      office. He called it ``Faces of Freedom.''       Funeral services for Dixon are at Barbourville First      Baptist Church, Friday, June 27 at 2 p.m. Burial will follow      in the Barbourville Cemetery.       Visitation is at Barbourville First Baptist Church,      Thursday from 5 to 9 p.m. and Friday after 10 a.m. until the      funeral hour at 2 p.m. Hopper Funeral Home is in charge of      arrangements.       Dixon's family requests contributions be made to the Knox      County Chapter of the American Cancer Society in loving      memory of Charley Greene Dixon, Jr.                          ____________________
