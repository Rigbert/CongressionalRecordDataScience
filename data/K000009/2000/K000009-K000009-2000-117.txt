Chairman, I probably will not take the full 5 minutes. But I did want to commend our colleagues, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert) for bringing that chart to the floor that shows the discretionary cuts that have affected all programs, including elderly feeding programs, across this country.  As we look at the revenues that the Government of the United States is receiving now and the work of all of our committees, without question, every single American sacrificed in order to put the accounts of this Nation in order. These programs got hurt just as much as many other programs in our country. So these decisions to move us toward a surplus position have not been easy decisions.  We are now at the point where we can more openly look at ways to expand worthy programs. And this certainly is one that has gotten the attention of the subcommittee. And believe me, I give my word to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) and to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert), who have worked so diligently to bring this to the attention of the membership, that, but for the offset, I certainly would be one Member who would be working 150 percent of my energy in trying to help them find a way to expand these worthy programs for feeding our senior citizens.  I thank the gentlemen for their respective leadership on this.
