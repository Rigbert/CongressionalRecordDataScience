Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and to the underlying bill.  What we have just heard is that the amendments that will modify the Conyers manager's amendment are going to solve the problems and concerns that were raised last week. This is not the case, and the modification that this rule makes in order still makes this modification of the bankruptcy law smoke and mirrors. The devil is really in the details, and let me point out three instances where the details make this amendment a sham.  First of all, it gives a defaulting homeowner two bites at the apple. Far from making bankruptcy a last resort, it allows it to guarantee abuse of the system. If the homeowner obtains a mortgage modification that is compliant with the President's terms, he still can file for bankruptcy, but the lender is bound by the modifications under the President's program should it be enacted into law. So the borrower and the bankruptcy attorneys can shop around and can find out which is the better deal for the homeowner. That's something that we deny the lender the opportunity to do, and this is a guarantee of abuse of the system.  Secondly, this amendment encourages happy-go-lucky borrowers. Nothing happens to a borrower who rejects the terms under the President's mortgage modification plan. The bankruptcy court can theoretically refuse to confirm a borrower's cramdown plan, but under the terms of the amendment, that will likely happen only when the lender is offered a modification anyhow.  What about borrowers who are within 30 days of a foreclosure sale? They don't even have to contact their lenders under this amendment about voluntary modifications, so none of this amendment's modifications and accommodations apply. The new manager's amendment does nothing to change this exception that swallows the bill, and as a result, cagey borrowers and their attorneys can game the system by simply waiting until the borrowers are within 30 days of a foreclosure sale to file for bankruptcy.  Finally, this bill allows free money to be offered. The amendment provides an alternative to cram down a principal, but astoundingly, the alternative is free money. If a judge doesn't want to give a cramdown, he can just rewrite the mortgage as a no-interest loan over the full terms of a new 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. Lenders can kiss their principal goodbye because the amendment seeks to resuscitate the earlier agreement to let lenders claw back and cram down principal if the borrower sells the house after a cramdown.                              {time}  1045  But the clawback is a sham. Once the borrower emerges from bankruptcy, the lender gets nothing back from the crammed-down principal, and since the point of the bill is to help the borrowers stay in the house during bankruptcy, sales aren't going to occur until after bankruptcy--when the lenders' clawback is worthless.  The bankruptcy law since 1898 has prohibited bankruptcy judges from rewriting the terms of mortgages that are placed on principal residences. There is a reason for that, and the reason is simple: it allows the mortgage industry to attract more capital to lend out to qualified borrowers at reasonable rates. If the capital isn't there, and the capital is not attracted, then what you will see is the cost of mortgages go up, whether it's in interest rates, points, fees or whatever.  It seems to me that Congress did the right thing during the depression in not changing this law. We should not change the law today.
