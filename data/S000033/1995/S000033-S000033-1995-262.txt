  Mr. DeFazio,Dmaybe you want to share with the public, and I have some of the information here, what has recently taken place in Mexico that I have a feeling some people may have known before the NAFTA debate. What about Mr. Salinas' brother? Where is that gentleman sitting right now? Former President Salinas' brother is now in jail.  Mr. DeFAZIO. He is in jail, that is right.
