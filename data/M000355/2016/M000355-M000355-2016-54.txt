 President, it is fitting that we are talking about the bravery of our servicemembers on December 7. Today marks the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a date that FDR rightly predicted ``will live in infamy.'' It is a time when we reflect on the meaning of this day for our country and for ourmilitary, a time when we remember all those who sacrificed on our behalf, and a time when we recognize the men and women in uniform currently serving to keep our country safer.  Through the years, one of my greatest experiences has been the opportunity I have had to meet with distinguished Kentucky veterans as they visit Washington through the Honor Flight Program. I know many of our colleagues do the same thing when veterans from their States come to town.  Today I ask our colleagues to join me in remembering all those who served and sacrificed so much and in thanking our men and women in uniform who are stationed around the world this holiday season.                          ____________________
