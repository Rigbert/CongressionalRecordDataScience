Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I congratulate Ms. Susan Rehrer as she retires after 21 years of dedicated service to the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) of Northwest Indiana. A retirement celebration will be held for her on Tuesday, March 6, 2001 at the Center for the Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana.  As Executive Director of the VNA for the past 13 years, Susan has been directly responsible for the management and administration of the agency's programs and services. She has been instrumental in leading the VNA through many different changes, including industry upheaval, market influx, new innovative programming and financial viability. Through her diligence the VNA has not only survived through these difficult changes, but it has thrived in the midst of the industry's transition.  Susan's leadership helped to successfully develop the Critical Pathways program. This program is an individualized patient care plan which relies on precise, detail-oriented information. It has revolutionized the industry by allowing each patient to receive the care needed. Susan is extremely proud of the development of this program, and her hard work has helped to ensure its success.  During her years at the VNA, Susan has demonstrated a sincere love for the community in which she lives. In addition to improving the lives of others through her professional career, she has also volunteered her time to champion many causes aimed at bringing comfort to those in need of assistance. She has played an active role in the Healthy Start program, a community-based infant mortality reduction plan employed in many areas of Northwest Indiana and throughout the country. Susan is also involved in the Healthy East Chicago program, designed to mobilize individuals and resources to promote a healthy community.  For all of her conscientious efforts, both professionally and voluntarily, Susan has been recognized by her peers. She has earned numerous state and national awards for excellence in the health care industry. Her dedication to the VNA movement and home health care in Indiana has been extraordinary. She is a true believer in the industry's importance and its ability to improve the lives of those who otherwise would live in discomfort.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Ms. Susan Rehrer for her 21 years of service to the Visiting Nurse Association, and the last 13 years as the Executive Director. Susan has shown impeccable leadership abilities as well as an undying love for her community. The people of Northwest Indiana will surely miss her enthusiasm, but we thank her for her years of service and wish her happiness in her well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
