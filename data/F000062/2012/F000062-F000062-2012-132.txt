 Lieberman, Mr. Rubio, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. McCain, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Udall of Colorado) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 356       Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism, and His      Holiness the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the most revered      figure in Tibetan Buddhism;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      continues to enforce policies that infringe on fundamental      freedoms of Tibetans, including punitive security measures      against monasteries, mass arrests, and restrictions on      freedom to practice religion;       Whereas both the Dalai Lama and the Kalon Tripa, Dr.      Lobsang Sangay, the prime minister democratically elected by      the Tibetan exile community, have specifically stated that      they do not seek independence for Tibet from China;       Whereas, in his inaugural address on August 8, 2011, Kalon      Tripa Sangay stated that he will ``continue the Middle-Way      policy, which seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet within the      People's Republic of China'';       Whereas, according to the Department of State's 2011 Report      on Tibet Negotiations, since 2002, nine rounds of talks      between the Government of the People's Republic of China and      envoys of the Dalai Lama ``have not borne concrete results'';       Whereas, despite persistent efforts by the Dalai Lama and      his representatives, the Government of the People's Republic      of China and envoys of the Dalai Lama have not held any      formal dialogue since January 2010;       Whereas, since March 2011, at least 16 Tibetans have set      themselves on fire, and at least 12 have died;       Whereas the repressive policies of the Government of the      People's Republic of China have created an environment of      despair, hopelessness, and frustration among many Tibetans;       Whereas, on November 1, 2011, the United Nations Special      Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Heiner      Bielefeldt, expressed concern over ``restrictive measures''      implemented by the Government of the People's Republic of      China in Tibetan monasteries, stating that such measures      ``not only curtail the right to freedom of religion or      belief, but further exacerbate the existing tensions, and are      counterproductive'' and affirming that ``the right of members      of the monastic community, and the wider community to freely      practice their religion, should be fully respected and      guaranteed by the Chinese Government'';       Whereas, on January 24, 2012, Maria Otero, Under Secretary      for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights, and United      States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, issued a      statement expressing concern about ``reports of violence and      continuing heightened tensions in Tibetan areas of China,      including reports of security forces in Sichuan province      opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring      others'';       Whereas the Constitution of the People's Republic of China      guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens, but      the July-December 2010 International Religious Freedom Report      of the Department of State states that ``the [Chinese]      government's repression of religious freedom remained severe      in the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas'';       Whereas, on March 10, 2011, His Holiness the Dalai Lama      announced that he would relinquish his last remaining      governmental duties in the Central Tibetan Administration,      and would turn over political authority to the leadership      democratically elected by Tibetans in exile;       Whereas, on March 20, 2011, the Tibetan government in exile      conducted competitive democratic elections that were      monitored by international observers and deemed free, fair,      and consistent with international standards;       Whereas nearly 50,000 people in over 30 countries, more      than half of all the eligible Tibetan exiles voters,      participated in the March 20, 2011 elections;       Whereas Dr. Lobsang Sangay was elected Kalon Tripa, or      prime minister, of the Central Tibetan Administration after      receiving 55 percent of votes in the March 20, 2011, election      and was inaugurated on August 8, 2011;       Whereas Kalon Tripa Sangay was selected to study in the      United States under the Department of State's Tibetan      Scholarship Program, earning a doctorate in law from Harvard      University, and served as a Senior Fellow at the East Asian      Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School;       Whereas Kalon Tripa Sangay, while at Harvard University,      promoted dialogue among Tibetan exiles and Chinese students      and visiting Chinese scholars to enhance mutual understanding      and advance the prospects for reconciliation; and       Whereas it is the objective of the United States      Government, consistent across administrations of different      political parties and as articulated in the Tibetan Policy      Act of 2002 (subtitle B of title VI of Public Law 107-228; 22      U.S.C. 6901 note) to promote a substantive dialogue between      the Government of the People's Republic of China and the      Dalai Lama or his representatives in order to secure genuine      autonomy for the Tibetan people within China: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) mourns the death of Tibetans who have self-immolated      and deplores the repressive policies targeting Tibetans;       (2) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of      China to suspend implementation of religious control      regulations, reassess religious and security policies      implemented since 2008 in Tibet, and resume a dialogue with      Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including the Dalai Lama or his      representatives, to resolve underlying grievances;       (3) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of      China to release all persons that have been arbitrarily      detained; to cease the intimidation, harassment and detention      of peaceful protestors; and to allow unrestricted access to      journalists, foreign diplomats, and international      organizations to Tibet;       (4) calls on the Secretary of State to seek from the      Government of the People's Republic of China a full      accounting of the forcible     removal of monks from Kirti Monastery, including an      explanation of the pretext or conditions under which monks      were removed and their current whereabouts;       (5) commends His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his decision      to devolve his political power in favor of a democratic      system;       (6) congratulates Tibetans living in exile for holding, on      March 20, 2011, a competitive, multi-candidate election that      was free, fair, and met international electoral standards;       (7) reaffirms the unwavering friendship between the people      of the United States and the people of Tibet; and       (8) both--       (A) calls on the Department of State to fully implement the      Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (subtitle B of title VI of Public      Law 107-228; 22 U.S.C. 6901 note), including the stipulation      that the Secretary of State seek ``to establish an office in      Lhasa, Tibet, to monitor political, economic, and cultural      developments in Tibet'', and also to provide consular      protection and citizen services in emergencies; and       (B) urges that the agreement to permit China to open      further diplomatic missions in the United States should be      contingent upon the establishment of a United States      Government consulate in Lhasa, Tibet.
