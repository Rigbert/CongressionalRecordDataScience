Back home in Illinois, we have just gone through a bruising budget battle at the State level. As a result of that battle, they have increased tuition at colleges and universities, meaning that families, particularly working families that already are trying to save so their kids can go to college, are facing even higher indebtedness for their children going to college, greater cost in tuitions and fees. And if I understand the Senator from Massachusetts, on the Federal side of the equation where we help students with Pell grants, for example, the Bush administration is proposing cuts in terms of the Pell grants.  What I would like to ask the Senator from Massachusetts is, isn't this coming at the families in both directions: On the one hand, the States raising the tuitions and costs; on the other hand, the amount of money available through the Bush budget for families across America is being reduced? This seems as if it will create really an incredible hardship on a lot of these families. Is that the point the Senator is addressing?
