President, you have heard me speak many times about the importance of agriculture to my home State. It is a critical industry in Kansas and forms the backbone of our economy. Within the field of agriculture are many dedicated and talented leaders who serve and have served Kansans with distinction. I have had the privilege to know and work with many of them over the years, but there is one in particular I would like to highlight today. Edie Dahlsten currently serves as the vice president of the Kansas Farm Bureau. For nearly a decade, Edie has served in this role with distinction and this November she will retire at the end of her term.  The Farm Bureau is truly a grassroots organization that begins with a single farmer, who joins together with his neighbors to form an organization that represents their way of life. Edie and Larry Dahlsten have been engaged in every aspect of that organization, beginning with their service on the McPherson County Farm Bureau Board near their home in central Kansas.
