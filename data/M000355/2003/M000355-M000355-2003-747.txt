 President, on June 19, 1945, Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon, Burma, to Ma Khin Kyi and Aung San.  Some speculate that she was destined to be a defender of freedom in Burma, as her father was the commander of the Burma Independence Army. Tragedy struck the family exactly 1 month after Suu Kyi's second birthday when General Aung San was assassinated. The family's loss was mourned by the entire nation.  As Burma's military leaders were to find out decades later, Suu Kyi has freedom and justice coursing through her veins. She has been a tireless advocate for the rights and welfare of the Burmese people and has sacrificed--along with other Burmese democrats--much in struggle for democracy in Burma.  Suu Kyi is a symbol of courage and determination for the world's oppressed. She is a shining example that principles are stronger than repression. Suu Kyi and other democrats have yet to surrender to the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, despite relentless attempts by the junta to bend and break their will.  How is Suu Kyi celebrating her 58th birthday? Most likely, she is not. I suspect she is alone and in Insein prison.  In the wake of a violent ambush by the junta on her convoy on May 30, Suu Kyi was arrested by the SPDC. Although U.N. Special Envoy Razali briefly saw her 2 weeks ago--and conveyed to an anxious world that she was not physically injured in the attack--we haven't seen or heard from her since.  The International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, requested a meeting with Suu Kyi, but the thugs in Rangoon refused. Unbelievable, outrageous--but not surprising considering the regime's track record.  It should not be lost on anyone that the denial of an ICRC visit means Suu Kyi is being treated worse than a prisoner of war.  The best gift the free world can give Suu Kyi on her birthday is a full court press on the junta. Sanctions, import bans, and statements condemning the SPDC's outrageous actions will help buoy the spirits of the Burmese people and confirm that the international community is on their side.  The best gift the administration can give Suu Kyi is an import ban and the downgrading of diplomatic relations with the SPDC. The White House should not wait for the House to act on its legislation but should implement a ban on imports immediately.  Finally, the best gift I can give Suu Kyi is a commitment to continue to stand with her and the people of Burma for as long as it takes for freedom's triumph. She and her compatriots continue to be in my thoughts and prayers.                          ____________________
