President, what we are doing here is not giving our stamp of approval on ethanol. We are not mandating. The vast majority of Members here feel more strongly about this than I do.  I know the Senator from California would not deliberately mislead you. What she is saying is just flat wrong.  I keep hearing it over and over again: If a safe harbor provision is enacted into law, No. 1, citizens will not be able to take refiners to court under our court system; and, No. 2, any possible ethanol contamination that happens in the future wouldn't get cleaned up.  It just isn't true. Even with the enactment of the safe harbor provisions, if a plaintiff makes his case--that is a very significant part of this--there are just a few court theories that could be used in environmental cases: Trespass, not affected by safe harbor; nuisance, not affected by safe harbor; negligence, not affected by safe harbor; breach of implied warrant, not affected by safe harbor; breach of express warranty, not affected by safe harbor.  As far as cleanups are concerned, if there were a spill, here are some examples of environmental laws that are on the books right now that would take care of the problem and are not affected by safe harbor: No. 1, Resource Conservation Recovery; No. 2, Clean Water Act; No. 3, Oil Pollution Act; No. 4, Superfund; and it goes on and on.  Neither of these assertions is true. They would be able to have their day in court, and at the same time we have adequate laws in the court system and environmental laws to accommodate any cleanup that would take place.
