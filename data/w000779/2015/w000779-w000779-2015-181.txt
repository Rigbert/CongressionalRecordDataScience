I have no intent to object at this point. I just want to say this, to me, seems like a very balanced package. We have three amendments on each side raising important issues. Chairman Hatch has indicated, and I support him on this, that we are ready to go again first thing in the morning. I think that is what it is going to take to ensure that all sides feel that they have a chance to have their major concerns aired, have their amendments actually voted on.  I withdraw my reservation and I commend Chairman Hatch for working with us cooperatively so we can have this balanced package go forward. With that, I withdraw my reservation.
