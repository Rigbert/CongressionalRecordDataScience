DORGAN. Let me say this again. Is the Senator aware that Yugoslavia produced Yugos and they are shipped to the United States and some terrorist could put a nuclear device in it and ship it to New York City and terrorize New York and this country? Would that require a sophisticated ICBM for delivery? Of course not. Would it accomplish the same result? Of course it would.  My point is, if you start taking a look at threats to this country, do not just look at the potential for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile. In fact, the Secretary of Defense and others are saying there is no realistic prospect within the next decade of that happening, No. 1. And No. 2, given all of the evaluations he and the folks in the intelligence community have made, he thinks what the Senator is proposing is not in this country's defense interests.  So that is the way I would answer the question of the Senator. I understand the case both Senators have made. I think they made it very well. It is just I do not agree with them. I think this is a case where you say, if you have unlimited funds that you can take from the taxpayer, you say, ``Just keep giving us your money, because we have got plenty of opportunity and we have lots of needs.'' If you have unlimited funds, then build everything. That is fine. The problem is we do not have unlimited funds. We are forced--literally forced--to start choosing among wrenching, awful, agonizing priorities. I think when the Senator proposes this, what he is saying is, we do not intend to choose, at least not in defense; we intend to build it all.
