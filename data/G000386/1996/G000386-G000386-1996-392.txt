 President, cattle producers in my State of Iowa and across the country are facing substantial economic hardship. Record-high grain and feed costs, low hay reserves, drought conditions, and an oversupply of beef are compounding the problem of a 10-year-low cattle market. I am pleased the administration has taken to heart our proposals to assist the sagging cattle market. Allowing haying and grazing on CRP acres is necessary to alleviate the high feed costs and a large beef purchase by the U.S. Government should help turn the tide.  Speaking of helping to turn the tide, a farm broadcasting duo in central Iowa has embarked on a campaign to promote beef consumption in the State of Iowa. Gary Wergin and Mark Pearson of WHO-Radio in Des Moines, IA are calling on their Heartland listeners to take a pledge. As one who proudly and easily accepted their challenge to eat just one more serving of beef a week, I submit ``The Mark and Gary Beef Pledge'' into the Congressional Record. By working together, Iowans can make a difference.  The material follows:                     The Mark and Gary Beef Pledge       I, Chuck Grassley, am a proud consumer of beef be it      broiled, roasted or grilled. I respect the efforts of all      those, from the farm to the supermarket, who make American      beef the safest in the world. At this time of low prices, I      can help in the most delightful way . . . by consuming more      beef. I therefore pledge to boost my beef consumption by one      serving per week, while staying within dietary guidelines.     Chuck Grassley.                          ____________________
