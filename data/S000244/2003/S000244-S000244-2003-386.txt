Chairman, on the other side of the aisle some Members have come up and stated that we ought to bust this bill apart and strip out all of the non-AMBER Alert-related issues. That would be a big mistake. It would be a huge mistake because most of these provisions are designed to prevent kidnappings and molestations from happening in the first place.  I support AMBER Alert. It is important once a kidnapping takes place that the police and the public and the news media know about that kidnapping so that an alert public can hopefully spot the abducted child and return the child to his or her parents.                              {time}  1130  But even more important in my opinion is to prevent the kidnappings and the molestations in the first place because if that ever happens, those people's lives are scorched for life.  In H.R. 1104 there are a number of provisions. I do not think they are controversial, but let me enumerate them. It provides the judge with the discretion to extend the supervision of a released child sex offender up to a maximum of life, eliminates the statute of limitations for child abductions and sex crimes, denies pretrial release for child rapists and child abductors, requires a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for twice-convicted child sex offenders, reauthorizes and doubles the annual grant to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to $20 million a year through fiscal 2005, mandates a minimum 20-year prison sentence for the kidnapping of a person under the age of 18 by a nonfamily member, authorizes COPS funding for a sex offender apprehension program, adds four new wiretap predicates that relate to sexual exploitation crimes against children.  We give these predicates so that the police will have the same authority to seek court wiretap authority when someone is using the Internet to try to entice children that the police presently have in cases of organized crime, international terrorism, or drug trafficking.  The bill facilitates the prevention of international parental kidnapping by adding an attempt to liability to the statute defining that offense, and it punishes persons who travel to foreign countries to engage in illegal sexual relations with minors and criminalizes the actions of sex tourism operators.  These are provisions that the opponents of this bill want to strip out. They are important provisions. They ought to be the law of the land, and we ought to pass H.R. 1104 intact today to make them the law of the land.
