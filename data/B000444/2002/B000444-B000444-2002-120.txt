 President, last week I had the privilege of attending a dinner honoring six extraordinary Delawareans, three couples who have generously extended the success, spirit and strength of their own lives to the immeasurable benefit of our State. They were honored for, what I thought was a wonderful phrase, their ``transformational leadership'' by the Delaware Region of the National Conference for Community and Justice, the NCCJ.  Lillian and Jack Burris have volunteered for and contributed to more public service organizations than many of us could name. Last year, they were honored as a couple with the United Way's Alexis de Tocqueville Society Award.  Among other endeavors, Lillian is a charter member of the Milford Housing Corporation, a trustee of Wesley College and a member of the board of the Kent and Sussex Counties Mancus Foundation, which serves disabled citizens. Perhaps most impressively, she was Delaware's Mother of the Year in 1992.  Jack has been chairman of the State Integrity Commission for over a decade; he is a 35-year board member at Milford Memorial Hospital, a former trustee of the University of Delaware, and in 1994, was inducted into the Delaware Business Leaders Hall of Fame. He can still out-work colleagues half his age.  Julie and Charlie Cawley have become remarkable leaders, both in the business community and personally, in supporting charitable and educational organizations through their Cawley Family Foundation and the MBNA Foundation, which coordinates the considerable volunteer efforts of the more than 10,000 MBNA employees in Delaware.  Julie, a former special education teacher, is a leader in some of the most effective nonprofit organizations and educational efforts in our State, including the Ministry of Caring, Catholic Charities, Meals on Wheels, the Centreville School and Bayard House, a residential program for pregnant teenagers and young women.  Charlie serves on the board executive committees of the University of Delaware and the Grand Opera House in Wilmington. His other board memberships, past and present, are too numerous to name I'm afraid I might leave out something important but I know he takes particular pride in his service on the board of the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League. And Charlie not only serves, he truly leads, inspiring others to get involved.  Joan and Stacey Mobley are one of those impressive doctor-lawyer couples, but despite all those advanced degrees, they have made good certainly as community leaders. They currently co-chair the capital campaign of the Delaware Art Museum, which is undertaking a major renovation and expansion.  Joan Mobley, M.D., serves on the board of the University of Delaware, is an advocate for the Open College Door Program at Delaware State University, and serves on the board of overseers for the Delaware College of Art and Design. Joan also sits on the Board of Professional Responsibility of the Delaware Supreme Court, and chairs the nominating committee of our YWCA.  Stacey Mobley, lawyer, chaired one of the most successful statewide charitable fund-raising campaigns in Delaware history, at a time when it wasn't easy, raising $27 million for the United Way. He, too, has served on numerous boards through the years, including his leadership here in Washington on behalf of the National Building Museum and the Arena Stage. Last year, Stacey was appointed by our Governor to chair the Delaware Strategic Economic Council again, taking the job when the challenge is considerable.  Six extraordinary people, and perhaps the most extraordinary thing about them is that for every public effort, every board membership, every charitable contribution that I could name and document, each of them has undertaken many more private acts of generosity and ``transformational leadership.'' It is my very great privilege to know all of them personally, and to be able to honor them as friends, as well as community leaders.  I would like to put into the Record the comments made by Stacey Mobley, accepting the NCCJ award on behalf of all six honorees, and I ask that his remarks be printed in the Record.  The remarks follows:                       Remarks by Stacy J. Mobley       On behalf of Joan and myself, let me say that we are      humbled to be honored by the NCCJ tonight--and to be honored      along with Lillian and Jack Burris and Julie and Charlie      Cawley. Considering their extraordinary contributions to      Delaware over the years, it's truly overpowering to be      included with them.       The Cawleys and the Burrises have asked me--in the interest      of time--to deliver remarks for all six of us. So let me      begin by saying we all extend our thanks not only to the      NCCJ--which has so generously honored us--but to our family      and our friends who have bolstered us through the years,      often served with us, answered our pleas for contributions or      support, or just agreed to share their ideas at a focus      group. As Dr. King once said: ``Our destinies are tied      together. None of us can make it alone.'' We're all part of      an extended family--a community of friends--that nurtures      each other's dreams and shares each other's happiness. So the      six of us would like to take a moment to thank all of you who      have been such wonderfully supportive family, and great      companions through our lives.       At the first meeting with Muriel Gilman and Barbie Riegel      to discuss this award, they explained that the NCCJ was      honoring us for what it calls ``transformational leadership''      in bettering our communities. That seems a most appropriate      theme to focus on, considering the work of the NCCJ, itself.      For 75 years, the NCCJ has encouraged ``transformational      leadership'' across this nation as the organization has      helped fight bias, bigotry and racism, while promoting      understanding and respect among all peoples. The work has      never been easy--and I might suggest that it has never been      more important a task than it is today.       Sadly, understanding and respect among all peoples seem to      be dwindling values in our world. Despite the advanced      telecommunications devices we invent, and despite the      Internet, which puts the wisdom of the greatest minds at our      fingertips, we still seem incapable of learning from the      past. As we look with empathy and helplessness at the      conflicts that tear apart peoples around the world, we wonder      why these twin values of understanding and respect for each      other's differences are so elusive. People of differing      religions, races and ethnicity's have caused each other      tremendous pain over centuries of recorded time because fear      and hatred have too often been instilled from infancy. And      regrettably, nobody seems above it. It has been true of      Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddists, Serbs,      Croats . . . and the list goes on. In the places where there      is no understanding of each other, there is no mutual      respect. And as surely as night follows day, distrust and      hatred seem to follow.       Conversely, in the places where there is an effort to      understand and respect each other's differences, people can      live and work side-by-side, gaining strength from their      diversity.       As our world struggles with seemingly insoluble problems--     in the Middle East, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, India,      Africa, and a dozen other global hot spots--we find ourselves      praying for an outbreak of peace. We all share such a      spectacularly beautiful little island in this massive solar      system, you wonder--as Rodney King asked: ``Why can't we all      just get along?''       And while those of us in the comparatively little outpost      called Wilmington, Delaware, are not in the position to solve      the world's problems, we give thanks in our own community for      an organization such as NCCJ which has--as its reason for      existence--the goal of bringing people together. NCCJ helps      build ``communities of justice'' through an array of programs      that reach our young people, extend into the workplace, and      cross lines of faith. And events, such as this one, tonight,      remind us all how important it is for each of us to      strengthen our communities by ``giving back'' in some      meaningful way. Some of us ``give back'' with our time and      talents, enlivening Boards and Task Forces with our creative      energies. Some of us ``give back'' by writing generous checks      to support capital campaigns to expand our communities.      Others of us have chosen to build a business, to pursue      public service, or to mentor at-risk kids.       But through our individual actions, we're all saying that      we understand the interpersonal bonds implied in the word      ``community''--and the commitment in the word ``friendship.''      This room is filled with a community of people who are      remarkably different from each other--in gender, race,      national origin, sexual orientation, age, and religion. Yet      we treasure our community so deeply that we have made a      commitment to work together to make Delaware the kind of      peaceful place in which we'd be proud to raise our children      and our grandchildren. . . . A place that teaches not hatred      or intolerance, but understanding, and respect among all      peoples. Our community is not perfect, and our nation is not      perfect. But there's virtue in the ongoing commitment to make      it so--and the NCCJ is at the heart of that effort.       Speaking for the Cawleys, the Burrises and the Mobleys, I      extend a very sincere thank     you for honoring us tonight. And we, in turn, salute and      thank NCCJ for your tireless efforts at fostering a just and      inclusive society, and for enriching the community we all      cherish. Thank you.                          ____________________
