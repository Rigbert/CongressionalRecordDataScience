Mr. Chairman, this amendment approves established National Marine Fisheries Service policy regarding the process for approving community development plans in small Alaska communities. The amendment does not in any way change the manner in which these fishery resources are distributed to, or the total amount of fish allocated to, eligible communities. This is a good amendment. It is asked for and the agency itself suggested that we do offer it, and I urge adoption of the amendment.
