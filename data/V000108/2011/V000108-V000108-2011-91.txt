I would just add two brief comments in support of the amendment and of the chairman's remarks.  The administration's attempts to shut this activity down, I believe, are without scientific merit, and are contrary to existing law and congressional direction.  I believe that the Federal Government has a responsibility to demonstrate its capability to meet its contractual obligation under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act by addressing the spent fuel and other high-level nuclear waste at permanently shutdown reactors.  So, again, I will join in support of the amendment.
