President, on November 13, 2001, President Bush issued a military order authorizing the use of military commissions to prosecute individuals who may be engaged in activities related to the subject of our campaign against terrorism.  The initial public reaction to the White House action was one of surprise and skepticism: Surprise that the order was issued without any advance notice, and skepticism as to whether the decision is based on sound legal or policy grounds. Many commentators also raised legitimate concerns that the Administration's use of military tribunals could potentially undermine our long-held foreign policy of criticizing other nations' reliance on such tribunals.  My reaction, which, I believe, was echoed by many of my colleagues in Congress, was one of disappointment, in addition to the surprise and skepticism. I was disappointed that Congress was excluded from deliberating a policy as important as this one before the White House announced the order.  I have said repeatedly since September 11 that I fully support the President in his efforts to combat terrorism both here and abroad. In response to September 11, Congress worked hand in hand with the administration on a host of items in a truly cooperative and bipartisan manner, from the passage of a joint resolution authorizing the President to use all necessary force, to the passage of the sweeping anti-terrorism bill.  Yet on the drafting of this military order, Congress was left completely in the dark. The Constitution provides executive powers to the President, not exclusive powers. Our Nation remains strong only if the co-equal branches of government work together.  Any proceeding that takes place under President Bush's order will have to withstand the test of legal scrutiny for years to come. But more importantly, it will also have to pass the scrutiny of our citizens at home and of our friends and enemies abroad who are watching to see how the greatest democracy in history carries out justice.  At the Judiciary Committee hearing held in early December, Senator Specter and I both questioned the administration's witness to ascertain the precise constitutional authority upon which the administration was relying in creating this tribunal. We did not receive a satisfactory answer.  We also wanted to know the precise scope and reach of the order in terms of who will be brought before such a tribunal, what procedural and evidentiary standards are to be applied, and what due process safeguards, including appeals, will be in place. We did not receive many details here either.  Instead, the administration asked us to wait for the regulations implementing the order that the Defense Department was preparing.  It has been over 3 months since the President's order was issued, and we have not seen the Defense Department regulations. So I believe it is appropriate for Congress to act now to provide the constitutional authority and guidance on procedures before the first military commission is empaneled under the President's order.  I am introducing the ``Military Commission Procedures Act of 2002'' with Senator Specter. I believe this bill will provide the executive branch with the legal authority to prosecute potential terrorists captured in the current military campaign abroad.  Our bill is designed to ensure that military commissions are used in the most narrow and necessary circumstances while protecting the basic rights of defendants. The bill limits the jurisdiction of military commissions to try defendants only for violations of the law of war, and not any domestic laws.  The defendants would be entitled to representation by counsel in the same manner as military service members under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The prosecution would need to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the death penalty could not be imposed without a unanimous vote as to guilt and to the sentence.  Furthermore, in order to keep the proceedings as open as possible, our bill provides for classified information procedures where the defendant would receive a summary of such evidence while the commission considers the actual evidence in camera and ex parte. The bill also authorizes convicted defendants to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari.  In short, Senator Specter and I believe this bill includes the details that the President's military order of November 13 should have included. More importantly, the bill provides the full force of the congressional and constitutional support behind the President's continuing efforts to wage a war against terrorism.  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
