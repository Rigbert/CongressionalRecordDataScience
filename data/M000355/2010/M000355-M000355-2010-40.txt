 President, I rise today to recognize the employees and friends of WYMT-TV as they celebrate 25 years as a news station in Hazard, KY. WYMT is much more than a media outlet; rather, it is a success story. In 1985, when talk of starting WYMT first sparked, many people were opposed to the idea, as it was thought that the station would not be prosperous or competitive. However, thanks to a few who saw what this news station could bring to eastern Kentucky, WYMT was born.  My good friend Neil Middleton is currently the news director at WYMT and has been there for most of its existence. From a time where two-way radios were used in lieu of cell phones, and 75 pound cameras were used for filming, to the age of the Internet and acquiring footage on cell phones, Neil has seen many drastic changes.  The dawn of the Internet allowed WYMT to connect more personally with its viewers, as well as unify eastern Kentucky, which has been the station's mission from the first day on the air. The birth and existence of WYMT have given the people of Prestonsburg, Harlan, Pineville and other cities in the eastern Kentucky region knowledge of how their neighbors in surrounding towns are doing. WYMT has also strived to balance the positive and negative news stories that it covers in the region, which has added to their success over the years.  I would like to personally thank WYMT for the hard work they have put in over the years in covering current events in our Commonwealth in an honest and unbiased manner. The effort they have put forth to unify the entire region of eastern Kentucky is appreciated by many. I ask my colleagues to rise and join me in congratulating them on this 25-year anniversary.                          ____________________
