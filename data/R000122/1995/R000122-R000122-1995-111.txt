Chairman, first let me say it is my intention to discuss briefly this amendment, because it is important, and then ask unanimous consent to withdraw it.  This amendment focuses on the issue of judicial review in title II of this legislation. It is an important issue because I think we are all concerned about having an economical judicial review process.
