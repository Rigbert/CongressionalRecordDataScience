President, today, I am pleased to introduce the Reserve Officers Association Modernization Act of 2009. I want to thank Senators Chambliss and Pryor for joining me to introduce this legislation. As the cochairs of the United States Senate Reserve Caucus, Senators Chambliss and Pryor have worked hard for the brave men and women of the United States Reserves.  Over the past decade, our country has relied on the National Guard and Reserves more than at any other time in recent history. The Guard and Reserves provide an invaluable contribution to our Nation's military, our national security, and disaster relief efforts. In recent years the National Guard and Reserves have demonstrated their position as a keystone to our military operations, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and stepped forward repeatedly to answer the call-to-duty at a tempo not seen in decades. At the same time, the support from the Guard and Reserves for homeland duties has been at an all time high. The Guard and Reserves have provided crucial support to our Governors and States during natural disasters such as the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, they have assumed additional roles in homeland security as our country has adopted new policies following the attacks of September 11, 2001. This new era for the Guard and Reserves prompted Congress and the Department of Defense to review many existing and but outdated policies.  The 95-member U.S. Senate National Guard Caucus, which I cochair along with Senator Bond, plays an integral role in the review and implementation of new policies. I have worked closely with groups like the Reserve Officers Association, ROA, to ensure that the National Guard and Reserves have access to more affordable health care, a greater influence in the military, adequate training facilities and supplies, and shorter troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Since its founding in 1922, the ROA has worked on behalf of the National Guard and Reserves and their families. For over 85 years, ROA has remained committed to its original mission, to ``support and promote the development and execution of a military policy for the United States that will provide adequate National security.'' The Reserve Officers Association represents the Reserve Components officers for the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, the Air and Army National Guard, Public Health Service, and the officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  This legislation would update the Reserve Officers Association's Federal Charter to reflect two recent changes in the organization. First, it would add the position of ``president elect'' to its constitution and bylaws. Second, it would expand the ROA from only three national executive committee members to include three representatives from each of the seven branches of the uniformed services. The Reserve Officers Association's charter has not been modified since 1998 and this legislation would update it to correctly reflect the current operation of the organization and enable ROA to continue its good work.  The Reserve Officers Association has provided a voice to the men and women that serve our country in the National Guard and Reserves. I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to show their support for the brave members of the National Guard and Reserves by enacting this legislation swiftly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1599       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
