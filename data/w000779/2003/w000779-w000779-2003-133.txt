I had a couple of questions, having listened to the statement.  First, my sense is that many physicians in our country--I am seeing this across Oregon and rural Oregon--are having a real problem out there paying their malpractice premiums. We are seeing physicians leave the profession. This has resulted in patients not having the access to care they deserve.  My understanding is that the distinguished Senator from Illinois agreeswith that and that the Senator has already discussed that a bit this afternoon; is that correct?
