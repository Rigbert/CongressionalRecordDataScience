 Speaker, I would like to say a few words about disturbing trends in contemporary health care, and to discuss H.R. 3222, The Hippocratic Oath and Patient Protection Act of 1996, which I introduced to halt those trends and protect strong doctor-patient relationships.  Mr. Speaker, more and more doctors and patients are enrolled with managed care and HMO's. The Wall Street Journal reports on the financial success of HMO's by stating it has left them ``so awash in cash they don't know what to do with it all.''  U.S. Healthcare, for example, is a major, corporate HMO with 2.4 million members. It makes $1 million a day in profits. Is CEO, Leonard Abramson, walked away from his company's recent merger with Aetna with a personal profit of nearly $1 billion.  Clearly, there is a built-in conflict between a for-profit HMO and the needs of a patient. The less money spent on providing care for the patient, the more money the company makes. It's that simple.  Obviously, Mr. Speaker, we must all work to control health care costs. However, we must also ensure that health care decisions are made by doctors using medical rationale with their patients' interests at heart, not insurance administrators using financial spreadsheets with their own economic interests at heart. And most importantly, we must preserve the fundamental core of successful health care--the strong doctor-patient relationship.  Unfortunately, with the growth of managed care and the power of large insurance companies, serious problems are developing which, in my view, threaten the doctor-patient relationship.  Many HMO's use what are essentially ``free-for-denying-service'' systems, which pay doctors for denying care and penalize them for providing it. Doctors under some plans lose up to 50 cents of compensation for every dollar they order spent on emergency care. And according to a Mathematica Policy Research study, 60 percent of managed care plans in this country currently place their providers at some financial risk for the cost of patient care. This places doctors in very difficult situations, as they are asked to base their decisions on criteria that is contrary to what they were taught and swore to uphold.  You would have to be patently insane to sign on with an HMO you know is going to pay your doctor not to treat you. So some insurance companies are taking steps to make sure you don't know what they are doing. They keep their incentive plans secret from their customers, and in many cases keep both patients and doctors in the dark about the formulas used to approve or deny coverage. Therefore, doctors and consumers signing on do not know what they are getting themselves into, and insurers are free to make arbitrary decisions without outside scrutiny.  Further, many HMO contracts contain blatant gag rules that tell doctors what they can and cannot say to their patients. Last year, for example, Kaiser Permanente of Ohio told its doctors not to discuss any possible treatments with patients before checking with the company's consultants.  These outrageous clauses strike at the heart of informed consent and health care ethics--someone considering an operation should have all the relevant information to make their decision, and doctors must be able to provide that information.  These problems are serious enough that Massachusetts has already passed a law banning gag rules, while New York and several other State legislatures are considering bills to deal with these issues. Before recess, I introduced legislation that will take three steps to preserve strong doctor-patient relationships. My bill has already been endorsed by Consumers Union, the American Nurses Association, the Vermont Psychological Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Medical Association, and the Gray Panthers.  First, my legislation will ban outright incentives to deny appropriate care, and ensure safeguards are installed so doctors are not placed at substantial financial risk for patient care.  Second, my bill prohibits gag rules and other interference in doctors' communications regarding patient care. It is the only legislation that safeguards doctors' communications with their colleagues and the public as well as their patients.  Third, to ensure neither doctors nor patients are kept in the dark about what their insurer is doing, my legislation provides for open, honest discussion of practices key to patient careby requiring disclosure of utilization review procedures, financial incentives for providers, and all services and benefits offered under the health plan.  That disclosure may be half the battle, because I think no insurance executive will be willing to stand up and defend these outrageous practices once they are out in the open.                          ____________________
