 President, I expect that most of the Members on our side will be voting for this. We had been willing to accept it without a vote. But having said that, I hope once we accept it on this bill, it means that we will not have to have a vote later this evening on a motion to recommit on the 9/11 Commission because once we vote on this and it is part of this package, it will mean, hopefully, we will not have to deal with it on the next bill that we will be considering tonight, the 9/11 Commission. So with that I will be voting aye. I urge adoption.
