President, for some Members of Congress, 2 years in office is too long. For some Members of Congress, 20 years in office is not long enough. Who should make that decision? The Constitution in its wisdom says the voters of America make that decision. Let's stand by that Constitution and its language and defeat this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.
