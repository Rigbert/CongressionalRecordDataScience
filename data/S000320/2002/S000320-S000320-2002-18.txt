 It is equally worth noting that recent tests of BAT and its P\3\I variant have proven to be effective against targets that were employing countermeasures. I applaud the Army's efforts to expand the delivery platform for BAT P\3\I beyond the ATACMS missile to include examining the applicability of putting the BAT on rockets and unmanned air vehicles, such as Predator and Hunter UAVs. I encourage the Army and its colleague services to continue this kind of innovative thinking to take full advantage of the flexibility that this all weather, precision guided weapons can provide.
