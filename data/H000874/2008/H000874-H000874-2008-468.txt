From 1915 to 1923, officials of the Ottoman Empire carried out a systematic campaign of massacres and forced deportations of Armenians from their homeland. All told, 1.5 million innocent men, women and children were murdered in this genocide, and 500,000 became refugees and displaced persons.  And sadly, we see this pattern--of genocide--repeating itself today. It is no coincidence that on this very day of commemoration, the news from Darfur grows only worse. While the world's worst humanitarian and human rights crisis continues to unfold, the regime in Khartoum continues to stymie the implementation of a peacekeeping force, and the peace process has ground to a halt. From the U.N. come frightening new figures--300,000 dead and the vast majority of the region's population, 4.27 million out of 6 million, now ``seriously affected'' by the conflict.  Clearly, patterns repeat themselves. Which is all the more reason why, in commemorating the 20th century's first genocide, one cannot help but feel compelled to redouble our efforts to resolve the 21st century's first genocide--that of Darfur.  The Genocide Convention speaks not only of addressing genocide after it has happened--but also of preventing genocide. This day of commemoration should remind us all that we have a responsibility not only to honor the victims of genocide and their families, not only a responsibility to the past, but to the future. In the face of continuing genocide, we have a responsibility for action--not apathy.  In a July 24, 1915 cable, American Consul Leslie Davis said of the genocide of Armenians, ``I do not believe there has ever been a massacre in the history of the world so general and thorough as that which is now being perpetrated in this region or that a more fiendish, diabolical scheme has ever been conceived by the mind of man.'' Today, those words strike us not only as tragic--but as outdated. The troubled 20th century showed us, again and again and again, that the mind of man is more than capable of such diabolical schemes.  Today, burdened by the memory of those crimes, we remember and rededicate. Today we return to the origin of genocide, and we honor the dead. Let us find in their memory not only grief, but new resolution--to speedily end today's atrocities, to prevent those of tomorrow, and to punish all those who would attempt or carry out evil on such a scale.                          ____________________
