Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4019) to amend title 4 of the United States Code to clarify the treatment of self-employment for purposes of the limitation on State taxation of retirement income, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows                               H.R. 4019       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF TREATMENT OF SELF-EMPLOYMENT FOR                    PURPOSES OF THE LIMITATION ON STATE TAXATION OF                    RETIREMENT INCOME.       (a) In General.--Section 114(b)(1)(I) of title 4, United      States Code, is amended--       (1) by inserting ``(or any plan, program, or arrangement      that is in writing, that provides for retirement payments in      recognition of prior service to be made to a retired partner,      and that is in effect immediately before retirement begins)''      after ``section 3121(v)(2)(C) of such Code'',       (2) by inserting ``which may include income described in      subparagraphs (A) through (H)'' after ``(not less frequently      than annually'',       (3) by adding at the end the following:     ``The fact that payments may be adjusted from time to time      pursuant to such plan, program, or arrangement to limit total      disbursements under a predetermined formula, or to provide      cost of living or similar adjustments, will not cause the      periodic payments provided under such plan, program, or      arrangement to fail the `substantially equal periodic      payments' test.'', and       (4) by adding at the end the following:       ``(4) For purposes of this section, the term `retired      partner' is an individual who is described as a partner in      section 7701(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and      who is retired under such individual's partnership      agreement.''.
