 President, I join my colleague from Missouri in telling the family of Mel Carnahan how deeply sorry we all are.  It must be a terribly difficult time for the citizens of his State, for his family, and for everyone who knew him. I hope we can carry on his tradition, one about which he talked so much in the last four decades, of making sure all of our children get a good education and the people of this great country have the opportunities about which he cared so deeply.  I thank the Senator from Missouri.                          ____________________
