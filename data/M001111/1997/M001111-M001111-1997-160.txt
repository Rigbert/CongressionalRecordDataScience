 President, I am pleased today to join with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, in introducing the Victims of Abuse Insurance Protection Act. I believe that every Senator in this Chamber should join in support of this important legislation.  The Victims of Abuse Insurance Protection Act will prohibit discrimination by insurance companies against victims of domestic violence. This prohibition will apply to all lines of insurance including health, life, and homeowners.  We are all proud of our efforts to increase our commitment to ending domestic violence. The Federal Government has dramatically increased resources to fighting this devastating public health threat. We have worked to strengthen enforcement of domestic violence laws and ensure that victims have access to the resources and assistance necessary to end the cycle of violence. However, the first step for most victims is reporting the violence and removing themselves from the violent situation. But, if a victim of domestic violence knows that by reporting and seeking help they have now accepted the fact that they will face discriminatory practices in when they try to secure any form of insurance, fewer victims will come forward. This is a chilling consequence that we cannot allow.  Make no mistake about it, this is a real threat. I have been approached by an insurance agent in Washington State who told me that she cannot sell life insurance to victims of domestic violence. I also know of women who are unable to afford adequate homeowners insurance because of past domestic violence. This is an outrage and runs counter to all that is fair and decent. This is a classic example of blaming the victim.  As a strong advocate of ending domestic violence, I cannot sit by and watch insurance companies deny victims insurance or impose such drastic cost barriers that few could overcome. I am appalled by this type of discrimination and extremely concerned about the impact it has on our efforts to combat domestic violence.                                 ______                                       By
