 President, I rise today to reintroduce the ``West Coast Ocean Protection Act.''  This bill would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to permanently block new leases for offshore oil or gas in federal waters off the coast of California, Oregon or Washington.  I'm pleased to be joined today by Senators Harris, Wyden, Merkley, Cantwell, Murray, Menendez, Booker, Sanders, Whitehouse, Markey, Gillibrand, Peters in sponsoring this bill, which has been introduced in every Congress since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010.  11 people were killed and 17 others injured when the Deepwater Horizon well blew out. Oil and gas spewed into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days.  Oil slicks covered the Gulf. Tar balls and toxic sludge covered beaches and wetlands. More than one-third of Federal waters in the Gulf were closed to fishing.  The impacts of the Deepwater Horizon disaster continue to affect birds and marine life, and marine biologists are still learning about the long-term effects, demonstrating the risks of offshore oil and gas extraction. Californians know all too well the dangers posed by offshore drilling. Before Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez, there was the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara.  A well blowout on an offshore rig spilled more than 3 million gallons of crude oil according to some estimates--the worst spill in U.S. history at the time.  The spill closed local beaches--which were covered by a thick layer of oil--and thousands of marine mammals and birds were killed. Tourists were turned away and commercial fishing operations were halted, hurting the local economy.  After the Santa Barbara spill, California had enough. The State blocked all new offshore drilling in state waters--which extend three miles from the shore--and in 1994 enacted a permanent offshore drilling ban.  Through local ordinances, congressional opposition, and presidential moratoria, all new drilling in federal waters off California has been blocked since 1984. Today, opposition to offshore drilling is higher than ever. Recent polling has found that nearly 70 percent of Californians oppose new drilling off our coast.  Yet, on January 8, 2018, the Trump administration proposed to allow drilling in nearly all Federal waters, including in all three regions off the California coast. The leases are proposed to begin in 2020 and would lead to the first new drilling operations in these areas in more than 35 years. Sixty-eight cities and counties representing a majority of California's population have voiced their strong opposition to President Trump's misguided plan.  In an addition, California's Governor, Senate, Assembly, Attorney General, Coastal Commission, Fish and Game Commission, and State Lands Commission have shared their opposition to the administration's drilling plan. Fortunately, the Administration has already suggested that its plans for offshore drilling have been delayed as they determine how to respond to legal setbacks. The plans are flawed, and should be withdrawn altogether.  Those of us on the Pacific Coast do not want any further offshore oil and gas development.  It is long past time to respect the substantial local opposition by passing the ``West Coast Ocean Protection Act'' to permanently ban offshore drilling and protect our coast for generations to come. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
