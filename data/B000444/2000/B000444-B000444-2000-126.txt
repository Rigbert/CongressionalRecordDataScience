 President, I rise today to comment on an opinion piece in the June 20 edition of the Washington Post written by Mr. Milan Panic, former Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, and an American citizen.  In this article, Mr. Panic argues for getting Russian President Putin to agree to offer Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic asylum, in a deal approved by the international community.  This is an appalling idea whose time, thank heavens, has not come. At least it would appear so, since it has been widely reported that at their recent summit meeting Putin told President Clinton that Miami seemed to be as good a place for Milosevic as Moscow.  President Putin may not be turning out to be a model democrat, but no one has accused him of being dumb. He obviously feels that having Milosevic enlivening the Moscow scene would not exactly burnish his own credentials.  All kidding aside, the idea of blithely pronouncing all of our efforts in the former Yugoslavia over the last decade a hopeless failure and then letting the architect of the carnage skip off with his family to exile is both morally reprehensible and politically catastrophic.  The international community has labored long and hard to set up the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague, and then to get it up and running.  Over the past year the number of individuals indicted for alleged war crimes in custody has risen dramatically. Why should we totally undercut the Hague Tribunal, just when it is hitting its stride?  Why should we undercut the new, reformist government in Croatia, which has reversed the obstructionist course of the late strongman Tudjman and has begun cooperating with the Hague? If Milosevic is given a suspension of prosecution, then why shouldn't all the Croats in custody get the same deal?  In arguing against undercutting the Hague Tribunal, I do not wish to imply that it has been a complete success. What is missing from the jail cells in the Hague, of course, are the really big fish--the chief villains of the massive slaughter in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.  I am, of course, talking about Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, and, above all, the boss of all bosses Slobodan Milosevic. That's the point! To make this promising international effort work we need to do precisely the opposite from granting amnesty to public enemy number-one. We need to add him to the growing list of indicted suspects in detention.  The Panic op-ed argues that we won't be able to capture Milosevic. In the short run, we probably won't. But asthe vice tightens on Milosevic's cronies and makes it clear to them that they will have absolutely no future in a Milosevic-run state, I think it may occur to them to serve Slobo up on a platter to the Hague.  We have all learned not to make rash predictions about when Milosevic will fall from power, and I won't fail into that trap today. But the signs of increasing discontent are everywhere--from the new student-run, grassroots resistance movement called Otpor to the rash of gangland style assassinations and assassination attempts among Milosevic's retinue and allies.  So while I can't say when Milosevic will fall, fall he will. And it will be much better, both for Serbia and for the international community, if he falls as a result of pressure from his own people, rather than from some sordid deal cooked up abroad.  In a larger sense, why should we nip a promising international judicial effort in the bud in a misguided attempt to relieve the Serbs, in the worst possible way, of a problem that they spawned and that they have the primary responsibility to rectify?  Somehow the curse of Milosevic is to be lifted from the Serbian people by a foreign deus ex machina, in this case the good Russian tsar. And then, in return for having graciously allowed their dictator to depart, the Serbian people would receive and end to sanctions from the international community.  Give me a break. Even if we could persuade Putin to go against his self-interest--a total impossibility, of course--such a deal would only fuel the Serbs' oft-noted passion for blaming others for misfortunes that they themselves have created. Why else would the foreigners have gotten rid of Milosevic if they hadn't somehow been responsible for him in the first place?  And what are we to make of the article's nice plan that part of the deal would be free and fair elections in Serbia under international supervision? I can just imagine what the other war criminals in the Yugoslav and Serbian governments would think of that idea!  The most likely result of an arranged Milosevic departure would be another set of gangsters, not democrats elected by universal suffrage. The Panic op-ed is entitled ``Exit Milosevic.'' It might just as well be entitled ``Enter Seselj''--that is, Vojislav Seselj, the fascist Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia. Mr. Panic's naivete gives us a pretty good clue as to why Milosevic so easily outmaneuvered him in 1993.  Morality, Serbian politics, and the Hague Tribunal aside, granting asylum to Milosevic would be a political disaster for the United States and for NATO.  Last year President Clinton had a difficult time in rounding up support within NATO's nineteen members for Operation Allied Force, and then sustaining that support until Milosevic's troops and paramilitaries were forced out of Kosovo. But he skillfully managed to do it, and alliance unity was preserved.  Then we got our European allies and others to assume 85 percent of the burden of KFOR in Kosovo and also to fund the vast majority of the cost of the Stability Pact for South East Europe.  Now, after pardoning Milosevic, I suppose we could turn to our European allies and say, ``incidentally, friends, we really didn't need to fight that pesky, little air war after all. We could have just bought off old Slobo last year and sent him packing. But please don't ignore fulfilling the commitments you made to the Defense Capabilities Initiative at the Washington NATO Summit. We really do need an alliance with teeth, so you still have to spend a lot to upgrade your forces. Don't worry, though. The Milosevic buyout was just a one-time event. Nothing like that will happen again. NATO is really not in the amnesty business. It's just that the Serbs needed us to take the monkey off their back, and we're sure that Slobo's successors will now choose to cooperate with us.''  Pardon my sarcasm, Mr. President, but this amnesty idea is just too politically naive to believe.  The Panic article also reveals an impatience as American as apple pie. We all want a quick fix. But, my friends, there are few quick fixes in life that have any permanence, and trying to set the Balkans right by way of shortcuts certainly isn't one of them.  To have any chance of creating a modicum of stability in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere in the region, solutions must be largely home-grown, if under the security umbrella provided by NATO.  So, let's consign the Panic op-ed to sophomore political science seminars and think-tank luncheons--but not to serious consideration by our Government.  Let's get on with the vital, if prosaic, business of rebuilding Bosnia and Kosovo and supporting the opposition in Serbia through a variety of programs, which are in place, ongoing, and which, in time, I believe, will succeed.                          ____________________
