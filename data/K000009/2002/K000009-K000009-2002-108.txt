Speaker, today we celebrate Gladys J. Herron, who passed from this life on December 5, 2001, at the age of 87 years. Gladys was an activist, teacher, mentor, and friend, a businesswoman and a woman of God. Her life is a story of richness born of struggle and of quiet triumph over oppressive odds.  Born in Florida, Gladys came to Toledo with her family in 1924. She attended Toledo schools and its university, and married a firefighter, Capt. Robert D. Herron, from whom she was widowed.  Gladys' fortitude first became publicly apparent when, in response to the discrimination prevalent at the time, she founded the first beauty school for young black women. The Herron Beauty School was the first black school of cosmetology in the Toledo area, and it eventually yielded twenty independent beauty salons. Hundreds of women owe their businesses and careers to this persevering, dignified woman. In 1955, she became the president of the Ohio Association of Beauticians, and she also served as president of the Toledo Beauticians and the Toledo Business Women's Club. She accomplished this at a time when racial equality and women-owned enterprises were only horizons on the American landscape.  She mothered our community in every way. Continuing in community activism, Mrs. Herron was involved in more than a dozen organizations including 1970s-era social programs CETA, SASI, EOPA and PIC, Toledo Affirmative Action, the Urban League, NAACP, the Head Start Policy Council, the Cordelia Martin Health Center Board, the Lucas County Welfare Advisory Board (which she chaired for fifteen years), the Concerned Women for Better Government (of which she was a charter member), the Perry Burroughs Democratic Club and the Lucas County Democratic Party. A religious woman, Mrs. Herron also served her church, Third Baptist Church, singing in the Sanctuary Choir and serving as a member of the Board of Trustees, the Advisory Council, and the 20th Century Literary Club.  Not content to rest on the laurels of her earlier years or settle down into retirement, Gladys in her later years was a founding leader in the senior citizen movement, involved in both the AARP and the Area Office on Aging of Northwest Ohio. It was Mrs. Herron's tireless effort and expert leadership which led to the establishment of the J. Frank Troy Senior Center. She was the center's first director, and together with two other Toledo women who established centers in other parts of the city, made up the core of senior rights in our region. I appointed her as our district's delegate to the decennial White House Conference on Aging held in 1995, where she represented her fellow seniors most ably and admirably.  Gladys Herron leaves an imprimatur on our community and in our hearts. Her passing writes the preface to a new chapter in American life that will be felt through generations and will be better for all because of her vigilance, faith, and vision.                          ____________________
