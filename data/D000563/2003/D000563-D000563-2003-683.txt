President, we live in a nation that pays people more to watch its pets than it pays to watch its parents in nursing homes. We live in a nation where we pay more to parking lot attendants than to those who attend our children in daycare centers. These underpaid caregivers of America have no health insurance.  This amendment provides resources to States to provide health insurance to caregivers, such as child care workers, personal attendants for the disabled, nursing home aides, and home health aides.  This amendment will give us a choice between helping a limited group of wealthy people or helping those who care for our children, our grandchildren, our parents, and our grandparents.  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.
