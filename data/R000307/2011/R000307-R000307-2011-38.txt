President, I rise today to address a health care concern that impacts all of us--access to health care.  When you or your loved one is sick--the most important thing on earth isto fight for the very best medical care possible. And when the diagnosis is cancer--a disease far too many of our friends and family have faced--it becomes all the more important and all the more time sensitive.  Unfortunately, in some cases, access to care--as well as the life-saving drugs needed to treat a variety of forms of this disease--are being negatively impacted by the current reimbursement structure for Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals. In layman's terms, it's one more hurdle that doctors have to fight for their patients.  That is why I am introducing today legislation that would end the hurdle. My bill would exclude customary prompt pay discounts from the manufacturer's average sales price for purposes of Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals.  In Hillsboro, Kansas we have already seen cancer clinics begin to close as a direct result of the current reimbursement structure which limits patient access to care that they desperately need. Currently the prompt pay discounts artificially reduce Medicare Part B drug reimbursement rates for community oncology clinics, jeopardizing the viability of these providers. The closing of the clinic in Hillsboro can be directly attributed to this reimbursement structure. Additionally, prompt pay discounts also reduce the payment rates of private payers that use Average Sales Price. My legislation is a step forward in addressing problems with Medicare reimbursement for cancer drugs.  Primary Healthcare Distributors, PHDs, act as a middle man between providers and drug and product manufacturers. Most healthcare providers must receive daily deliveries of products from many different manufacturers. PHDs streamline the system and provide efficiencies by aggregating the ordering and shipping logistics. Some 80 percent of prescription medicines in the U.S. are stored, managed and delivered by PHDs. These PHDs receive prompt pay discounts from drug manufacturers in recognition of the efficiencies they provide.  However, these efficiencies are threatened by the Medicare Modernization Act's, MMA's, inappropriate inclusion of these prompt pay discounts in the calculation of the Average Sales Price for Medicare Part B drugs, those administered in a doctor's office. The inclusion of these discounts ultimately reduces reimbursements to providers, who are not the actual beneficiaries of the discounts. It provides a perverse incentive for manufacturers to go around the PHD to offer prompt pay discounts directly to the providers, thereby eliminating the efficiencies of the current system and potentially creating another burden for providers.  Congress has recognized the importance of excluding prompt pay discounts from providers' payment formulas in the Medicaid program. This bill would extend that exclusion to Medicare Part B.  I believe that the policy is right; that is why today I, along with Senator Stabenow, am introducing legislation to amend Part B of Title XVII of the Social Security Act to exclude customary prompt pay discounts from manufacturers to wholesalers from the average sales price for drugs and biologicals under Medicare.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 733       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXCLUDING CUSTOMARY PROMPT PAY DISCOUNTS FROM                    MANUFACTURERS TO WHOLESALERS FROM THE AVERAGE                    SALES PRICE FOR MEDICARE PAYMENTS FOR DRUGS AND                    BIOLOGICALS.       (a) In General.--Section 1847A(c)(3) of the Social Security      Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3a(c)(3)) is amended--       (1) in the first sentence, by inserting ``(other than      customary prompt pay discounts extended to wholesalers)''      after ``prompt pay discounts''; and       (2) in the second sentence, by inserting ``(other than      customary prompt pay discounts extended to wholesalers)''      after ``other price concessions''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to drugs and biologicals that are furnished on or      after January 1, 2012.                          ____________________
