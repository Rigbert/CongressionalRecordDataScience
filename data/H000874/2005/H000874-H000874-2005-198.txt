Speaker, reclaiming my time, I think he made the case that they would listen and make a determination. We are hopeful that they will make a determination that if they are going to change the bill by the manager's amendment they will allow the full House to consider whether that change is appropriate. But I thank the gentleman for his information.  Secondly, Mr. Speaker, if I can, we appreciate very much the action on Halloween, on that Monday, October 31. I think that was appropriate. As the gentleman knows, the following week, November 8 is election day for a lot of people: New York City, the State of California, obviously very large jurisdictions; Virginia, a major election going on there. All of us are watching that election go on. New Jersey gubernatorial, as is Virginia and Ohio. So a very large number of people in America will be confronting elections and, therefore, a large number of our Members.  Has the majority considered the possibility of making sure that we do not have votes until later on in the day, Tuesday, so that we can free up our Members in those jurisdictions, A, to vote and, B, to participate to the extent that they feel it necessary to do so?  I yield to the gentleman.
