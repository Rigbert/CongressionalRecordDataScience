President, we have seen a fair amount of snow here in the last few days. I have sometimes taken the floor of the Senate and been critical of things closing down for 2 or 3 inches of snow, and have said we do not do it that way in Vermont. But I must admit, this would be a significant snowstorm even in Vermont. It would be a welcome one, because of our ski industry, and we would cope, but this would be a lot of snow in any other place.  I do know the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, had his office open during this time as did I. He is on the floor and, I might ask, Mr. President, my good friend and colleague from Vermont, would he agree with me that this is finally a Washington snowstorm that comes up to the standards of what we expect back home in Vermont?
