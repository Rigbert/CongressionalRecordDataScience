 EDWARDS. You would have absolutely no opportunity and no opportunity to have the decision reversed. I might add, there is a double whammy in this amendment. The double whammy is that the only thing that can be appealed is the determination of what is medically necessary, and what is medically necessary, under the language of their bill is--and I am reading now from the bill--``when medically necessary and appropriate under the terms and conditions of the plan,'' which is what the HMO and the health insurance company's contract says.  People are getting whammied twice: No. 1, you cannot appeal but one thing, which is: Is it medically necessary? No. 2, that determination is based on what the health insurance company or the HMO wrote into the plan.
