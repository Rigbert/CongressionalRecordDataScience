 President, I rise today to support the amendment that has been offered by my colleague from Washington State, Ms. Cantwell, that will help protect our consumers from this electricity market manipulation.  I begin by thanking Senator Cantwell for her tremendous work on the energy commitment and her long-time work on trying to make sure consumers in my home State of Washington finally receive the attention and the help they need from us at the Federal level because of the gouging that has gone on in this market manipulation. We have seen the dramatic impacts that she has so eloquently talked about.  I thank her for speaking out on behalf of our Pacific Northwest consumers who are hurting. We have had the first, second, or the third highest unemployment rate for almost 2\1/2\ years, much of that precipitated by the fact of the energy spike costs that have hit the west coast, causing many of our cold storage companies, the aluminum industry, to shut down.
