 President, I thank my friend from South Carolina for yielding.  We have had this same colloquy before. The Senator from South Carolina raised this the last time we had this discussion, and the Senator from South Carolina, I am sure, recalls my reply. My reply was, ``If I had to do it over again, I would have voted differently.'' In fact, upon reflection, my view is that I am sure the Senator from South Carolina, in his history here, has never cast a vote that he regretted, but I have not been so fortunate as to never having regretted a vote I cast here. The Senator from South Carolina and I had this exchange the last time we had this debate, and he, I am sure, recalls that I said that I thought I had made a mistake in voting that way on the flag-burning amendment, and should such an amendment come before Members again, I would not so vote again.
