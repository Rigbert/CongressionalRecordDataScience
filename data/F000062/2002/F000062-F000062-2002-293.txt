  On Friday, I offered an amendment to the sugar program, which really is a minor amendment, with one exception. It seems anything that has anything to do with the sugar program is frozen and can't be changed. As I noted 6 years ago when I came here, the sugar program works to the great detriment of America's domestic sugar refineries.  The largest of those domestic sugar refineries happens to be in California. It is C Sugar. C got most of its sugar from Hawaii, and they used to have ads as I grew up: C pure cane sugar from Hawaii. It is a plant that can employ about 1,300 people. It can refine about 800,000 pounds of sugar. It is a union plant. It is the only source of employment, the major source of employment, in a small town in the East Bay known as Crockett. You drive over the Carquinez Bridge and you see this big old plant, and that is from where this wonderful sugar comes.  The problem has been, year after year, C cannot buy enough sugar to refine. Why? Because the allotments in the sugar program were more than two decades ago. They do not adequately reflect who is buying and who is selling sugar at the time.  The amendment I have offered would simply reallocate the unfilled portion of a country's quota when that country does not fulfill its quota. That is all it does. This is less than 3 percent of the sugar. About 3 percent of the sugar on the world market that is provided for in the allocation quota does not get allocated. So on a first-come-first-served basis, a company that wanted to buy sugar would be able to because the unused allocation of one country would go to another country that is exporting sugar, and on a first-come-first-served basis the refineries of our country would have an opportunity to buy their sugar.  This amendment is supported by C Sugar; Colonial Sugar Gramercy, LA; Savannah Foods in Port Wentworth, GA; and Imperial Sugar in Sugar Land, TX.  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record in support of the amendment, one from the Coalition for Sugar Reform and the other from Citizens Against Government Waste.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Coalition for Sugar Reform,                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2002.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Coalition for Sugar Reform,      I urge you to vote for an amendment that Sen. Dianne      Feinstein will offer to ensure that when the United States      announces an import quota for sugar, we actually import all      that quota.       Each year, a few countries fail to fully utilize, or fill,      their quotas to sell sugar to the United States. Generally,      these amounts go unused: Because of the highly restrictive      import policy that the United States maintains for sugar,      other sugar-producing countries have no opportunity to      satisfy the unmet market need represented by the unfilled      quota. The Feinstein amendment will require that by June 1      each year, any unused quota be reallocated among qualified      supplying countries on a first-come, first-served basis.       This amendment does not increase import quotas. It merely      says that when we announce an import quota, we will allow the      full amount of that quota to be imported.       This amendment honors our multilateral trade commitments by      allowing the full import quota to enter the United States. By      setting an example of more efficient and transparent TRQ      administration, the amendment advances explicit trade policy      goals of the United States. Please support and vote for the      Feinstein amendment.           Sincerely,                                               Lawrence T. Graham,     Steering Committee Coordinator.                                  ____                                              Council for Citizens                                     Against Government Waste,                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the more than one      million members and supporters of the Council for Citizens      Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I am writing to inform you      of our support for your amendment to S. 1731, the Farm Bill,      which would ensure that when the United States announces an      import quota for sugar, all of that quota will actually be      imported.       When countries fail to fully utilize their quotas to sell      sugar to the United States, those quotas usually end up being      unused. Other sugar-producing countries have no opportunity      to satisfy the unmet market need represented by the unfilled      quota, as a result of the highly restricted import policy      that the United States maintains for sugar.       It is our understanding that your amendment will require      that by June 1 of each year, any unused quota be reallocated      among qualified supplying countries on a first-come first-     served basis. While we also understand that your amendment      does not increase import quotas, it will at least ensure that      the full amount of the quota be imported.       Athough CCAGW would still prefer the complete elimination      of the archaic sugar program, we believe your amendment will      at least provide for modest improvement of one of its glaring      deficiencies. Thus, CCAGW will consider a vote on your      amendment in the 2002 Congressional Ratings.           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Schatz,                                                        President.
