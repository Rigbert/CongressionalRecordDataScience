We are now safely into 2018, and we should be talking about what we can accomplish for the American people in the new year. We simply face a long list of unfinished business from 2017--last year--and, unfortunately, we have a very short window in which to get it done.  We are 4 months into fiscal year 2018, and we still don't have a budget deal. I am vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We should have had this done long before now. Our agencies are operating under last year's funding levels. They have little flexibility to handle the problems they face today.  We still haven't reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program, what we call CHIP, so that puts the healthcare of 9 million children at risk. These are American children.  Nearly 800,000 Dreamers live under uncertainty and fear of deportation, living in the country they have known most of their lives. I don't know how anybody, Republican or Democrat, could call this acceptable.  Now, I know the Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, and they control the White House. They are in charge. They have to show responsibility and show leadership on these issues, but instead of addressing these issues, last year the Republican leadership spent time rolling back sensible regulations designed to protect the American consumer, designed to protect our environment, and designed to protect people from harassment in the workplace. They rolled those all back, and then they passed a massive tax cut for big corporations and the wealthiest of Americans.  We Democrats have been calling for bipartisan budget talks since June--7 months ago. We have passed three continuing resolutions since September of last year to give us more time to strike a deal on the budget and Dreamers and CHIP and disaster funding. These are just to name a few, but they are enormously important to the people who are experiencing the disasters or who have children who need healthcare or who are Dreamers. Yet, on the 102nd day of the fiscal year, there are only 9 days until the next fiscal cliff, and we don't have a budget deal.  President Trump said months ago that the country could use a good government shutdown. I don't agree withhim, but I am beginning to think that is exactly what his party is angling for--a manufactured crisis to distract from the fact that they are not doing their job.  The Washington Post seemed to confirm this last December, when it reported the President privately told people that a government shutdown would be good for him politically. In all of my years in the Senate--I have been here under Republican and Democratic Presidents alike--I have never heard such damaging rhetoric come from the President of the United States.  Nobody wants a government shutdown--nobody. It is devastating to people not only throughout the government but to people throughout the whole country. However, that seems to be what they are vying for.  For months, I have been calling for a bipartisan budget deal that is based on parity--equal increases for defense and nondefense programs--that would provide relief from sequestration. I agree with the Republicans and Democrats who say military readiness has suffered under sequestration but so has our Nation's economy, so has our educational system, so has our infrastructure, and so has our care for our veterans.  If we want to combat the problems caused by sequestration, we have to raise the caps on both sides of the ledger. Fixing one side of the equation will not address the needs of our Nation and, even worse, will actually shortchange our military.  If we don't invest in our economy, if we don't invest in the education of our youth, the military will not have expert, qualified soldiers, the men and women on whom they rely. If we don't invest in our diplomacy, our Nation and the world become less safe. If we don't improve our cyber security defenses and our physical infrastructure, we become soft targets for those who would do us harm, both in this country and outside this country. If we don't care for our veterans, we are not going to have young men and women who are willing to serve.  This week, the majority leader came to the floor making the case for increased defense spending. He asked us to listen to our nonpartisan military leaders about what they think is needed to keep this country safe. I couldn't agree more.  To that end, I have two letters signed by a combined 560 retired admirals, generals, and other former military members. I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record following my remarks.  I have no idea what these admirals', generals', and others' political parties are, but they make the case that we have to increase our investment in domestic priorities--including education and childcare, as well as diplomacy--if we are going to keep our country safe and support our military. Secretary of Defense Mattis said even more bluntly: If we do not fully fund the State Department, we should be prepared to buy more ammunition for our military.  The wisdom of our military leaders notwithstanding, Republicans appear to be dug in. They claim equal increases for both defense and nondefense programs would add too much to our deficit and burden our children. It is one over the other. It is hard to have somebody say that with a straight face in the wake of the President signing a tax bill to add $1.5 trillion to our Nation's debt and to benefit primarily large corporations and the wealthiest Americans. You can't make the argument that we can't afford to take care of our domestic needs. It is simply not credible.  Budget negotiations are not the only place where Republicans haven't engaged in a productive way. President Trump's decision to end the DACA Program has put nearly 800,000 Dreamers in this country in an untenable position. The decision was as cruel as it was senseless. It may make a tweet that people look at, but if you are one of those Dreamers and you are on your way to school and are expecting a scholarship to college and you don't know if you are going to be in this country tomorrow, that is not a tweet.  The President should have worked with Congress. He should have found a permanent legislative solution while keeping DACA protections in place. I believe he terminated the program under false pretenses, yielding to xenophobic voices in his administration, and last night a Federal judge issued an order that said just that: Terminating DACA was not required under the law--far from it. But a court order that only temporarily halts the administration from dismantling DACA provides little comfort to Dreamers. They live each and every day uncertain of the future and with fear of deportation.  Now, I have heard Members of the Senate trying to decide at what time we are going to finish voting for the week. Their big fear is this: Are we going to make our flight home?  Dreamers have to worry if their flight is going to be out of this country and back to a country they don't even know. They worry if they will have to leave the country they know and love.  Dreamers are Americans in every way, except on paper. They were brought here as children, through no fault of their own. They are law-abiding members of our community. They attend school. They serve as doctors and teachers. They defend our homeland as brave men and women in uniform.  This is a crisis of the President's own making. Now, Congress needs to pick up the pieces. I hope, after the meeting yesterday, we will be allowed to pick up the pieces. We have spent months trying to find a path forward, but you can't find one if the administration keeps moving the goalposts.  We need to address the fate of the Dreamers now. You can take a poll in this country. The American people want us to. Also, look at the broad bipartisan support on display yesterday at the White House. Republicans and Democrats want to fix the mess that the President created. A solution should be within our grasp.  The White House has made unreasonable demands, such as $18 billion of American tax dollars to build a wall on the southern border, in exchange for Dreamers. The $18 billion wall is last century's solution. It does nothing for this century.  If they really believe Mexico is going to pay for it, I have a solution. Open a bank account and, as Mexico sends us money, then use it to build a wall. Don't ask the American taxpayers, who are strapped at home, to pay for something the President says the Mexicans will pay for. Open an account, find out if they are telling the truth, let the money come into the account, and then build it.  But, worse, don't use the Dreamers as negotiable commodities. They are not commodities. They are human beings. They are people who deserve to have their dreams. Let's pass a bill--we could do it this week--protecting Dreamers now. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. This is their government.  We have a week and a half before the next continuing resolution expires. We have a lot to do. Let's get serious. Let's get to work. I am willing to work here every day, every night, right through the weekend. Let's get it done. We are not doing it for us. We are doing it for all the American people. Let's do it for all the American people--not for special interests, not for one party. Let's do it for all the American people. It could be done, if we want to.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Mission: Readiness,                                 Council for a Strong America,                                                     May 30, 2017.       Members of Congress: As retired admirals and generals, we      know from our experience that no matter how much we spend to      build our military and procure the latest and greatest      technology, we will never be a secure nation if we do not      have qualified and skilled men and women to fill the ranks of      our Armed Forces. Therefore, investing in education for our      youngest children, which is the foundation of our future      national security, is essential. Accordingly, we urge      Congress to prioritize investments in early childhood      programs, including funding for Head Start, the Child Care      and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), and Preschool      Development Grants in FY18 Labor, Health and Human Services,      Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.       Mission: Readiness is the national security organization of      retired top military leaders that recognize the strength of      our military depends on our people. The stunning fact is that      today, 71 percent of young adults ages 17 to 24 cannot      qualify for military service because they are too poorly      educated, medically or physically unfit, or have a      disqualifying record of crime or drug abuse. if these issues      are not addressed, the Nation risks a shortage of qualified      recruits--one that will leave the country vulnerable for      years to come.       Mounting research shows that the early years of life have      an incredible impact on educational attainment, behaviors and      health. High-quality early interventions can help vulnerable      children succeed in school, stay on the right side of the law      and achieve a healthy weight in the long-term. These outcomes      open the doors for many career paths, including military      service.       Long-term studies of early education programs show      impressive differences in children's educational outcomes. A      recent analysis of Head Start outcomes, comparing siblings      who did versus did not attend the program, found participants      showing increased probability of graduating from high school,      attending college, and receiving a postsecondary credential.      High-quality state preschool programs have also demonstrated      lasting effects on students' elementary-school performance.      New Jersey's preschool program, for example, found that      children in the program were three-quarters of a year ahead      in math and two-thirds of a year ahead in literacy in the      fourth and fifth grades.       While Congress faces tough spending choices ahead to secure      and protect our Nation, we know that the backbone of our      military is, and will always be, our women and men in      uniform. As a matter of national security, in order to grow      the pool of eligible recruits, Congress must prioritize      investments in early childhood programs, including funding      for Head Start, the Child Care and Development Block Grant      (CCDBG), and Preschool Development Grants.       Signed by a combined 424 retired admirals, generals, and      other former military members.                                  ____                                                February 27, 2017.     Hon. Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     House of Representatives.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader,     House of Representatives.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Chuck Schumer,     Minority Leader,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader      McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: As you and your      colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018,      we write as retired three and four star flag and general      officers from all branches of the armed services to share our      strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy      and development alongside defense are critical to keeping      America safe.       We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises      our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from      confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle      East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and      stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater      instability. There are 65 million displaced people today, the      most since World War II, with consequences including refugee      flows that are threatening America's strategic allies in      Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Europe.       The State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge      Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are      critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put      our men and women in uniform in harm's way. As Secretary      James Mattis said while Commander of U.S. Central Command,      ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need      to buy more ammunition.'' The military will lead the fight      against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong      civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of      extremism--lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and      hopelessness.       We recognize that America's strategic investments in      diplomacy and development--like all of U.S. investments--must      be effective and accountable. Significant reforms have been      undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in      recent legislation in Congress with strong bipartisan      support--on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls,      trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking, water, food      security, and transparency and accountability.       We urge you to ensure that resources for the International      Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and      opportunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.       cc: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.       cc: Secretary of Defense James Mattis.       cc: National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster.
