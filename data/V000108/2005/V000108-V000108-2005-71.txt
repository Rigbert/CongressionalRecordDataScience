Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Asian-American Medical Association will be hosting the 29th Annual Asian-American Charity Ball on Saturday, November 5, 2005, at the Avalon Manor in Hobart, Indiana. Each year, the Asian-American Medical Association honors prominent, extraordinary citizens for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their tremendous efforts, these individuals are honored at the banquet and awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award.  The Asian American Medical Association is a great asset to Northwest Indiana. This organization has dedicated itself to providing quality service to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District and has demonstrated exemplary service in its cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's annual charity gala, the Asian-American Medical Association will present Mr. Gus Olympidis with the Crystal Globe award. Gus is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Family Express Corporation based in Valparaiso, Indiana. He currently serves as a Director and a member of the Executive Committee of Centier Bank. He is also a Director of the Valparaiso Community Development Corporation, Director of the Northwest Indiana Forum, and Director of Valparaiso University's College of Business Administration Advisory Council. He also serves on the Porter County Foundation Board.  Amongst Gus's many positive accomplishments throughout his civic and convenience store industry engagements, he has also taken on the role of President of the Valparaiso Parks and Recreation Foundation, Chairman of the Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce, and was a member of the Valparaiso University Town and Gown committee and a Board member on the Regional Development Authority Committee. I am honored to commend Gus for his commitment and dedication to the well being of those who seek his knowledge and leadership. His efforts and hard work are worthy of the highest recognition.  Although Gus's career consumes much of his time, Gus has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family. He and his wife, Beth, have three children and two grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Asian American Medical Society and Gus Olympidis for their outstanding contributions to the community. Their commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the world is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2266]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]         TRIBUTE TO THE 29TH ANNUAL ASIAN-AMERICAN CHARITY BALL                                 ______                                                         HON.
