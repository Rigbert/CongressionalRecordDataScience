Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 245) expressing the sense of Congress that the United States Supreme Court should speedily find the use of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools to be consistent with the Constitution of the United States.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 245       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) judicial rulings by the United States Court of Appeals      for the 4th and 9th circuits have split on the issue of      whether the Constitution allows the recitation of the Pledge      of Allegiance in schools;       (2) the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for      the 4th circuit correctly finds the Constitution does allow      such a recitation; and       (3) the United States Supreme Court should at the earliest      opportunity resolve this conflict among the circuits in a      manner which recognizes the importance and Constitutional      propriety of the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by      school children.
