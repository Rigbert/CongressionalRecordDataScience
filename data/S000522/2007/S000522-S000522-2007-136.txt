Madam Speaker, with so many important and often vexing challenges competing for our attention throughout the world, it seems that the tendency in Congress is to focus our attention on a crisis only after it has evolved into an unmitigated disaster. Fortunately, that was not the case last week, when the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health held a hearing on prospects for peace in Guinea.  This hearing presented us with an opportunity to discuss not only our strategic, humanitarian, human rights, and economic interests in Guinea--particularly as speculation about President Lansana Conte's political future and the potential for even greater conflict mounts--but also to consider how the United States Government has positioned itself to respond to threats and mitigate crises before they have spun out of control.  The stakes are high. Western Africa historically has been beset by political instability and violence, where conflict in one country spills across borders and threatens the region as a whole. This has led to massive displacements, refugee flows, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, and the perpetration of some of the most heinous human rights atrocities known to man. If we fail to capitalize on the opportunity to address transformative, stabilization and reconstruction needs in support of a democratic transition in Guinea today, I fear that we may be headed for a much wider regional crisis down the road.  Experts have been warning for years that the ``ground was quaking'' in Guinea. Widespread dissatisfaction with the autocratic rule of an aged and ailing Conte, coupled with economic decline, high inflation, political cronyism and corruption, has led to periodic episodes of unrest in Conakry. However, the union-led strikes of December 2006 through February 2007 took on a new dimension. For the first time since the country obtained independence in 1958, Guineans across the nation have taken to the streets en mass, demanding change and refusing to accept half measures.  Through solidarity, the unions, opposition parties and civil society gained strength, and in the end, they succeeded in exacting critical concessions from the government. But while this symbolizes a significant victory, the hardest part is yet to come.  While the naming of the new consensus prime minister, Lansana Kouyate on February 27th is a significant step forward, the office of the Prime Minster is not constitutionally protected and Conte has a record of breaking agreements. In addition, substantial resources are urgently needed for economic and social programs that will address the root causes of social unrest and shore-up popular support for the Prime Minster. History has shown that Conte is unlikely to share power in a meaningful way, and the longer he keeps his hand on the tiller in his authoritarian style, the more likely a renewed and destructive political crisis will emerge.  That said, it is widely speculated that--one way or another--Conte will not finish his term in office. His health is extremely poor and his power appears to be waning. Even the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States, which typically shy away from criticizing one of their own in public, have condemned Conte's violent response to protests and have suggested that this may be the appropriate time for him to step down. Experts are no longer talking about IF Conte will leave office, but WHEN and under what conditions he will leave.  Still, Conte has not designated a successor and, in fact, has sidelined a number of individuals who appeared poised to succeed him. The President of the National Assembly, who would be the successor to the President under the terms of the Constitution, is widely unpopular. It has been widely suggested that a military takeover may be the only option for a ``soft landing'' should Conte die in office or retire to his farm.  However, I would strongly contend that a military takeover in Guinea, no matter how ``temporary'' it is intended to be, should NOT be considered an appealing option. The military is divided along generational and ethnic lines. Neither Guineans nor the international community should assume that the military is a cohesive group capable or willing to deliver a smooth transition to a democratic, civilian-led government.  While the responsibility for fostering an environment of peace and security in Guinea rests with Guineans, the United States is in a unique position to help facilitate a non-violent, democratic resolution to this crisis. Guineans remember the fact that it was the United States who came to their aid when Guinea was attacked by the Revolutionary United Front rebels from Sierra Leone, with the support of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. We also have invested heavily in peace in Liberia, and have credibility in the region. Guinea is a predominantly Muslim country which is favorably disposed to the United States. The time to help is now . . . before the crisis spirals out of control.                          ____________________
