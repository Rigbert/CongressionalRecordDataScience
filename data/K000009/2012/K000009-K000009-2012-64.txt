 Let me just state for the record that the average return on investment for one corporate fraud agent was approximately $54 million over the last 3 years in fines and restitution that they get back for our taxpayers because of their work. What a tremendous return on investment that is for every taxpayer dollar, recovering those funds from combating financial and mortgage fraud makes total common sense.  Finally, I oppose the provision in the bill that repeals existing prohibitions on reductions in force at NASA. There was an agreement we reached as a Congress on how to do that. This bill does not conform to that restructuring proposal.  For these reasons, I oppose the bill in its current form and, again, commend Chairman Wolf and Ranking Member Fattah for bringing us to this point.
