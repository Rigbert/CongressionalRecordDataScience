Speaker, this evening we would like to address two subjects having to do with the health of the economy of the United States, and the financial stability of our Government. And they go to the proposed or pending interest rate increase before the Federal Reserve Board, and the announcements today made by the administration regarding the Mexican bailout which apparently now will be done by administrative order.  I would like first to start, since it has not happened yet, perhaps we can prevent a disaster, start with the proposed interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.  Six times in the last year, a record, the Federal Reserve Board has seen inflation somewhere over the horizon and raised interest rates.                              {time}  2040  Those six increases have hit hard at anybody in America who has to borrow money, families who want to borrow money to buy a house, individuals who want to borrow money to buy a car, people who want to start or continue with a small business, homebuilders and others. They have been hit time and time again by the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, this latest pending increase estimated to be one-half of a percent.  Now, just think about it, this is a group that will meet in secret. The Federal Reserve meets in secret. They are accountable to no one. Calls were recently placed down there by my staff regarding the Mexican peso bailout, and we were told there was no business of the Congressman what involvement the Federal Reserve might have with our tax dollars and reserve money that underlies our bank accounts. They will meet in secret, and they will consider a policy change that is likely to raise this year's deficit by $2.5 billion.  It is likely, according to the homebuilders, to drive a medium-priced home beyond the reach of 1 million families in America. That is after they have already driven up prices of mortgages by more than $200 a month on a $100,000 home in the last year. This single increase will drive up the mortgage on a $100,000 house by about $1,600.  Now, here we are squabbling over these proposals to reduce taxes by a pizza a week for every American family, and the Federal Reserve in secret with no accountability to the U.S. Congress or the elected representatives of the people is going to unilaterally impose a policy that will increase the deficit by $2.5 billion, will increase the price of a home for a modest family, a $100,000 home, by $1,600 per year with no public scrutiny, no hearings, and no accountability. It is absolutely outrageous.  Furthermore, they have adopted a policy now, they think that any rate of unemployment less than 6 percent is inflationary. God forbid that wages should go up a little bit in this country. They have not gone up for your average family in the last 20 years, and the Federal Reserve has a concerted policy to make sure that does not happen. They consider a wage increase for working Americans to be inflationary.  Yet we had a wire story today that said we had the least pressure on employment costs since those statistics have been kept. Yet again, the Federal Reserve is going to preemptively raise interest rates with a concerted policy to put tens of thousands more Americans out of work. Remember, it used to be 4 percent was considered full employment in this country. Now they say 6-percent unemployment is full employment. That is 3\1/2\ million Americans who are going to be deprived of their jobs by the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve sees inflation that does not exist.  Furthermore, Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, appointed by the last Republican President, has said that we overstate inflation in this country. He testified just last week before the Banking Committee and said, ``Well, you know, the CPI overstates inflation by 1 to 1\1/2\ percent.'' That means, according to Alan Greenspan's own numbers, inflation is at more than a 30-year low in this country. Yet they are going to go back to the well one more time. They are going to raise interest rates again. They are going to raise the price of houses again, refrigerators, anything you buy on time will be increased.  Why? Not because there is a real threat of   inflation, but because it is being demanded by Wall Street.  Now, it is an interesting question who makes monetary policy in this country, who controls the currency of the United States. And are we running this Nation for a few select bankers on Wall Street, or are we running this Nation for the American taxpayers? That brings up the Mexico bailout.  The gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur] found a very interesting quote in the Wall Street Journal, and I thought you might want to present that.
