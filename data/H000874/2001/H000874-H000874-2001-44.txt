Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I first want to rise and join the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Istook), the chairman of this subcommittee, in expressing our deep sorrow at the death of Thomas Murray, a long-time employee of the Customs Service, killed in the line of duty, killed while trying to defend this country from the importation and introduction into our borders of materials which are either illegal or dangerous.  Every day Customs agents, INS agents, DEA agents, FBI, Secret Service, ATF, IRS and Federal employees who are not perceived to be in law enforcement or tax enforcement are themselves, because of the very fact that they work for the Federal Government, at risk, and it is important that we remember them and that we appreciate them. We thank them for the contribution they make to making America free and great.  This bill does that in part by assuring that they will receive a comparability adjustment, which does not get them to comparability but an adjustment which will move them further towards their private sector counterparts. I thank the chairman for his support of that effort.  Mr. Speaker, this conference report provides a total discretionary funding level of nearly $17.1 billion in discretionary dollars; that is, dollars over which we make a decision. That includes 969 million above last year's level and 388 million above the President's suggestion.  I want to mention a few important items. To some degree this will be repetitive, but I think it is important for both sides to mention these issues.  For Treasury law enforcement, which as the chairman pointed out makes up nearly 40 percent of all Federal law enforcement, we have provided 4.8 billion, 400 million above the President's request. Very frankly, that number will go up in supplementals to provide for better security and a better ability to meet the threat that now confronts this great Nation.  Important additions in this bill to the President's law enforcement request include the following: 170 million to modernize the Customs Service import processing system, for a total of 300 million in fiscal year 2002; 33 million for the Customs Service to purchase nonintrusive inspection technology.  We had the opportunity of talking to Secretary O'Neill last night about that issue, critically important to our Nation and to our commerce. Safety and commerce come together on that particular issue.  Twenty-five million for additional Customs inspectors on the northern border. Forty-five million above the President's request for the Secret Service to complete its work for its balancing initiative. Critically important if we are going to have Secret Service agents work for hours that do not tax their effectiveness and efficiency.  We include 10.6 million for new facilities at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glencoe, Georgia, and Artesia, New Mexico, critically important as we confront the beefing up of our law enforcement capability in this country and on our borders.  The funding level also includes 226.4 million for the HIDTAs, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Program. 20.3 million above last year's level. Mr. Speaker, I have been a long time enthusiastic and strong supporter of the HIDTA program. The HIDTA program has significant dollars in it, now almost a quarter of a billion dollars, but it is a most important contribution, and a contribution which will become even more important in these days and the days ahead is the coordination it provides between Federal, State and local law enforcement and public safety agencies.                              {time}  1100  Tom Ridge, the new director of our homeland security effort, spoke to the Democratic Caucus this morning and talked about the necessity for coordination. HIDTA is a perfect example of that kind of coordination.  Mr. Speaker, I continue to be concerned with the level of support the Treasury law enforcement agencies receive from this administration, and I might say, from previous administrations. The emergency supplemental request sent to Congress underfunds the Customs Service. The Customs Service is on the front line protecting our borders. As we have just seen, Mr. Murray was on the front lines. He lost his life. If we are to enhance homeland defense capabilities, the Customs Service will require more support from the administration and from Congress.  This funding agreement includes $2 million in addition to our law enforcement accounts for a program called First Accounts. This is on top of the $10 million enacted last year and will give to Treasury $12 million to provide a very important service for Americans who are unbanked: They have no checking account, they have no credit cards, they have no ATM card obviously, because they have no checking account.  The gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek) has championed this program, which is intended to establish affordable, electronic banking accounts for low-income families, and increase the availability of ATM machines in low-income neighborhoods as well. It will also serve to educate low-income Americans about the benefits of having a bank account and managing their finances. It will protect them hopefully against being ripped off every payday by those who want to charge them exorbitant rates for cashing checks or making short-term carry-over loans.  For the IRS, Mr. Speaker, $9.4 billion is provided. $548.2 million above fiscal 2001. This includes an additional $320 million to continue modernizing its business systems. It is appropriate that we mention the work of Charles Rossotti, the Commissioner of the IRS, who has done an extraordinary job as a manager, bringing the IRS into a position of carrying out the Internal Revenue Service Reform Act and making sure that we get the most efficient operation of our tax collection enterprise as is possible.  The conference agreement, Mr. Speaker, also provides $280.6 million for court house construction. That is essential in my opinion and, in fact, could be more. We are obviously still within fiscal constraints, but it does move further than was originally proposed. The amount provided surpasses the amount requested by the President by almost $64 million.  Also included in the budget of the General Services Administration is $19 million for the Food and Drug Administration consolidation. This will save large sums of money and provide for much more efficient administration of the Food and Drug Administration. That could not be more timely in light of the threat that we have to our food supply in the context of terrorism.  This is an ongoing, multiyear project that will replace abysmal facilities that are scattered across the metropolitan area, and provide FDA employees with state-of-the-art technology to do their jobs even better; and they do an excellent job now of protecting Americans and protecting our food supply and our drug integrity.  For Federal employees, the bill, as I said, includes several important provisions. I want to highlight just a few. First, as the chairman has pointed out, it includes the 4.6 percent pay raise, which will not get them to where they need to be, but will move them further along the road of becoming comparable with their private-sector counterparts. In addition, it makes permanent a provision that allows Federal agencies to improve the affordability of child care for lower-income Federal workers, which is a critical need. And it continues a provision that allows Federal employees to receive contraceptive coverage, as the chairman has pointed out.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the issue of election reform. I believe most Members of Congress are committed to addressing the issues facing our election system. Although dramatic examples of those shortcomings in our election system were found in Florida, we soon found that the same problems which existed in Florida existed in many other States throughout this Nation, very frankly including my own in Maryland.  As the ranking member on the Committee on House Administration, I am continuing to work with the chairman, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), on broad-based legislation to address these issues. That legislation, which hopefully we will pass out of the Committee on House Administration in thenext few weeks, will require significant resources; and I plan to address this need with the committee at the appropriate time. The reforms that will be effected ultimately will be under the jurisdiction of this committee, and I have discussed this with the chairman. He and I have both discussed it with Chairman Young; and this matter, although not addressed in this bill, will have to be addressed in the near future.  Mr. Speaker, as I wrap up my remarks, I want to join the chairman in congratulating the staff of this committee. First of all, I want to mention an extraordinary staffer, Michelle Mrdeza. Miss Mrdeza is the Chief Clerk of our committee. ``Clerk'' is a word that implies to some a job of ministerial importance as opposed to policy importance. Now, Miss Mrdeza would be the first to say that she does not enter into policy, it is we Members who do so, but frankly, the advice and council she gives to both sides of the aisle is invaluable as we consider this bill. She has institutional knowledge that is helpful to each and every member of the committee, and we thank her for her leadership of the staff and for her critical assistance as we mark up this bill.  I also want to mention Jeff Ashford, who does an outstanding job; Kurt Dodd, Tammy Hughes, both of whom are of great assistance to Members on both sides of the aisle. I also want to mention John Albaugh, who works for the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Istook), as does Scott Nance, who works for us personally, but who is very much involved in the committee's consideration of this legislation.  Also, of course, I want to mention Rob Nabors. Rob Nabors is our committee staffer on the minority side and he does an extraordinary job. He is new, but not new to the budget process. He comes from OMB and is extraordinarily knowledgeable and has been a valuable asset to not only our side of the aisle but, I think, to the committee as a whole.  Lastly, I want to join the chairman in thanking Chris Stanley for his contributions to the committee.  We get some outstanding talent from the various Federal agencies. We get the talent and their personnel get the experience of how this process works. We think both sides are advantaged by that exchange program. So I want to thank all the members of the staff.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. We ought to pass it and we ought to pass it overwhelmingly.  I thank the chairman for working with us in a bipartisan fashion. We have not always agreed, but we have worked in a bipartisan, open fashion, so that all sides knew what the issues were and they could be addressed in an open, democratic way, and I thank him for that.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
