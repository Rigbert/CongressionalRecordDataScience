 President, I rise to address the Senate on the issue brought to the fore last night by the nomination of John Roberts to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Judge Roberts, as we are all beginning to learn, has an impressive record. He has keen intellect, sterling integrity, and a judicious temperament. Most importantly, Judge Roberts will faithfully interpret the Constitution, not legislate from the bench. He has earned the respect of his colleagues, and I am confident he will make a fine addition to the U.S. Supreme Court.  He was raised in middle America in Indiana, a neighboring State to my own State of Kentucky. Judge Roberts is a son of the Midwest who went on to argue a remarkable 39 cases before the Supreme Court, more than virtually any other member of the Supreme Court bar. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard and then graduated with high honors from Harvard Law School where he served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. If that were not enough, he then went on to clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, actually during the Chief Justice's period as Associate Justice, and served in various positions in the Justice Department. Now he serves with distinction on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, often referred to as the second highest court in the land, and, of course, the Senate unanimously confirmed him to that position in 2003.
