President, I rise today to offer an amendment that will create a reserve fund for the improvement of veterans' education benefits under the Montgomery GI bill. I am delighted to be joined by my friend and colleague, Senator Johnson, in this effort.  This amendment will set aside funding for S. 131, the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act, which Senator Johnson and I introduced earlier this year. Our legislation would provide a much-needed increase in the basic monthly benefit under the GI bill, a benefit that over the past 15 years has failed to keep pace with the ever-increasing cost of higher education.  Our legislation is very simple. It establishes a benchmark by which the basic Montgomery GI bill benefit will be calculated, allowing the benefit to increase as the cost of higher education increases. Endorsed by the Partnership for Veterans Education, a broad coalition including over 40 veterans service organizations and education associations, our legislation provides a new model for today's GI bill that is logical, fair, and worthy of a nation that values both higher education and our veterans.  While the Montgomery GI bill has served our country well since its passage in 1985, the value of the educational benefit assistance it provides has greatly eroded over time due to inflation and the escalating cost of higher education. Military recruiters indicate that the program's benefits no longer serve as a strong incentive to join the military; nor do they serve as a retention tool valuable enough to persuade men and women to stay in the military and defer the full or part-time pursuit of their higher education until a later date. Perhaps most important, the program is losing its value as a means to help our men and women in uniform readjust to civilian life after military service.
