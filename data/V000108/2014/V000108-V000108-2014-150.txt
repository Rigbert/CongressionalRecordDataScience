Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I recognize the Asian American Medical Association, which will host its 38th Annual Gala on Saturday, November 15, 2014, at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. Each year, the Asian American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award at the annual banquet.   The Asian American Medical Association has always been a great asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have generously devoted themselves to providing superior medical services to the residents of Northwest Indiana and have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, academic and charitable endeavors.   At this year's Annual Gala, the Asian American Medical Association will present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Beth Wrobel. Mrs. Wrobel is to be commended for her exceptional contributions to her field and her community.   In 1979, Beth graduated from Valparaiso University where she majored in Mechanical Engineering. Mrs. Wrobel's engineering career includes twenty years of service with NiSource, Inc. Subsequently, in 2007, she also earned her Healthcare Executive Certificate from the University of California, Los Angeles, Anderson School of Business.   Beth has been the chief executive officer of HealthLinc, Incorporated since 2002. She has since advanced the organization from a free medical clinic serving only adults to a Federally Qualified Health Center that provides medical services to over 4,000 uninsured or underinsured patients, through all life cycles, from prenatal to seniors. HealthLinc provides comprehensive, quality and affordable care that includes medical, dental, optometry and behavioral health services at six locations and one mobile van in Northern Indiana.   In 2013, Beth was honored by Northwest Indiana Business Quarterly as top not-for-profit chief executive officer in Northern Indiana due to her success improving and expanding HealthLinc from a one-location, small organization, known as Hilltop Community Health Center, with a budget of less than $350,000 in 2001, to the multi-location organization that is known today, with a budget of $20 million and a staff of more than 200 employees. Beth has also earned distinction as Porter County Community Foundation's 2012 Outstanding Executive and was honored by Porter County United Way as an Outstanding Agency Professional in 2014.   Among her many accomplishments, Beth is a member of the Indiana Primary Healthcare Association Board and has previously held the position of president. She also serves as an adviser to many medical groups, including Indiana University Northwest Medical School, and has presented at many conferences, both at the national and state level.   Additionally, Beth selflessly gives of her time through her involvement in various organizations and civic activities, such as the Porter County Reading Foundation Board and the City of Valparaiso Human Relations Council. She also serves as president-elect of the Valparaiso Rotary Club and is an active member of Immanuel Lutheran Church.   Beth's compassion and dedication to her field and her commitment to charitable endeavors exemplifies the self-driven person that she is and is exceeded only by her devotion to her wonderful family. Beth and her husband, Joe, have three amazing sons.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the members of the Asian American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Beth Wrobel, for their outstanding contributions to their community and beyond. Their unwavering commitment and dedication to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the United States is truly inspirational.                          ____________________
