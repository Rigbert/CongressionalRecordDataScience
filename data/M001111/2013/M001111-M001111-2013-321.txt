 President, the Senate budget already includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for tax relief. This amendment would make that relief for low- and middle-income Americans explicit, but it would do it in a way that preserves the health care benefits in the Affordable Health Care Act.  Unfortunately, the amendment that follows this one will gut the ACA and leave millions of Americans back in a position where they have to worry about a preexisting condition or a health illness that could bankrupt their household. We have to make suretaxes do not hit low-and middle-income families, but we should do it in a responsible way that doesn't take away health care for millions of Americans.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
