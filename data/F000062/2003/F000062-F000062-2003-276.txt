 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to amend the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act to give the State of California and the local communities of Sonoma, Napa, and Marin counties the opportunity for input and review of the tribe's plan for a major casino in the Bay Area.  I am offering this legislation because the Boards of Supervisors of the local communities impacted by this planned casino have asked me to amend the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act. The Boards of Supervisors of Sonoma, Marin, and Napa counties have each unanimously passed resolutions seeking a change in Federal law to restore the Secretary of Interior's discretion in approving land into trust and allowing the State and local government to have a voice in the process.  Prior to today's introduction I have met with the Presidents of the Sonoma and Marin Boards of Supervisors, the Graton tribe, and Senators Campbell and Inouye the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Indian Affairs Committee.  This week I had a very spirited and frank conversation with Graton Tribal Chairman Greg Sarris and representatives from the casino investors. During the meeting Chairman Sarris committed to work with the local Boards of Supervisors and he committed to look at alternative sites for the casino. Chairman Sarris also said the Tribe and the casino investors would conduct an environmental review based on the criteria laid out in the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, before a site is selected. These are positive signs and I have told both the Boards of Supervisors and the Tribe that I would like to see them continue to work together.  This legislation guarantees that the local and State officials have a voice in the process. Without this change to the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act they do not have that voice.  In 2000, Congress passed the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act to restore Federal recognition to the 355 members of the Federated Indians of the Graton Rancheria.  The Graton Tribe's original Rancheria was in the northern Sonoma County town of Graton on land purchased by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, in 1920 for the ``village home'' of otherwise homeless Miwok and Pomo Indians. The Rancheria was terminated in 1958 when the BIA approved a plan to distribute the assets to resident Indians and remove the Rancheria from Federal trust.  The original version of the Graton restoration bill, H.R. 946, sponsored by Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey in the 106th Congress, passed the House of Representatives with a gaming restriction, to which the Tribe agreed.  In testimony before the House Resources Committee in May 2000, and in other public comments, Graton Chairman Greg Sarris stated that the Tribe had no intention of conducting gaming.  In fact, before the House Resources Committee, Chairman Sarris stated, ``Many may think our motives for restoration have been influenced by the opportunity gaming affords some other recognized tribes. Because our local political constituency, both democratic and republican has opposed any sort of development for environmental reasons, we agreed with these local political forces to not develop a gaming complex. So, as proof, we voted as a tribe to include a non-gaming clause in our bill, stipulating that we will not be a gaming tribe.''  Furthermore, in an article in the Marin Independent Journal on September 21, 2000, Chairman Sarris said, ``All we want is to be formally recognized as Indians and have the same rights that other Indians do for education and health care. We are not interested in gambling.'' I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of this article in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Marin Independent Journal, Sept. 21, 2000]                 Gambling Dispute Threatens Miwok Bill                        (By Gannet News Service)       Washington.--Legislation to formally re-establish the      identity and standing of Marin's band of Coast Miwok Indians      appears all but dead in the face of a House-Senate dispute      over how tight guarantees must be that the tribe will never      allow casino gambling.       ``This is insane, this is frustrating, and I just can't see      why we can't find a way out of this,'' said Greg Sarris, the      tribe's chief who is an English professor at UCLA.       Rep. Lynn Woolsey, the Petaluma Democrat who authored the      original bill, said she shares the frustration but sees      little hope other than the fact that ``down the road there      will be other Congresses.''       The problem is that the bill to restore the all-but-     vanquished tribe, approved by the full House in June,      included specific language that waived in perpetuity any      right to establish gaming on the tribe's remaining one-acre      ancestral plot in the Sonoma County town of Graton.       Woolsey sought that waiver in agreement with the tiny      tribe. In hearings last spring and summer, she and Sarris      said the tribe was happy to agree to the waiver. They were      not interested in gaming, and their acreage was too small      even if they were interested. Additionally, the fine print in      a state-passed referendum in California to divide gaming      resources among tribes prevents them from operating any kind      of casino.       Adding a federal gaming ban on top of an existing state ban      was an easy and harmless layer of extra insurance to reassure      the community that the tribe would not be bringing high-     stakes bingo to Marin.       ``All we want is to be formally recognized as Indians and      have the same rights that other Indians do for education and      health care,'' said Sarris, one of some 300 descendants of      the tribe that the government declared extinct in the 1950s.      ``We are not interested in gambling.''       But when the bill reached the Senate as an identical      version of the bill sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-     Calif., numerous Indian advocates and the government's Bureau      of Indian Affairs objected. The surrender of sovereignty by      the Miwoks, however well-intentioned, would set a precedent      that could be used against other tribes in other states--in      effect a means to pressure tribes on the sensitive issue of      gambling.       ``It's not that we don't have sympathy with what the Miwoks      want to do, or in this case don't want to do. It's a question      of eroding the hard-won sovereignty that is the legal basis      for the gambling that has been an important resource of many      tribes,'' said John Sanchez, an expert on Indian sovereignty      at Pennsylvania State University and a member of the      Apache tribe.       Boxer's spokesman, David Sandretti, said his bill was still      hopeful, but the key lawmaker on the issue is Sen. Daniel      Inouye of Hawaii, vice chairman of the Indian Affairs      Committee and long a powerful voice on behalf of American      Indians and native Hawaiians. Without his support, the bill      wouldn't survive in the Senate, Sandretti said.       Inouye made it clear this week that the bill is dead unless      Woolsey agreed to drop the gambling ban in her legislation.       ``If you set that precedent, that creates a lot of      problems,'' Inouye said. ``I would prefer to see a measure      without the waiver, and if I do I'd be likely to support      it.''       Inouye added that it's a meaningless, symbolic waiver to      begin with, because the tribe is already prevented from      opening a casino by state law. ``I just don't think this is      something that the federal government should be involved      in,'' he said.       Woolsey said she has no intention of agreeing to anything      that doesn't include the anti-gaming clause as written.       ``I got it out of the House, and now it's in the Senate,      and I guess that's just where it is,'' Woolsey said. ``I've      heard some proposals for compromise, but I haven't seen      anything that would offer the level of protection against      gaming that the community and the 6th Congressional District      would be prepared to accept.''       Gene Buvelot of Novato, vice chairman of the Federated      Indians of Graton Rancheria, said his group is disappointed      in Woolsey, because members believe she should allow the bill      to go forward without the clause.       ``We're disappointed, deeply disappointed with Woolsey      because she seems to be the one who's dropped the ball on      this, not Barbara Boxer,'' he said. ``It's a shame that it's      getting this far and that Woolsey is letting it bog down like      this.''       Coast Miwok tribal elder Joanne Campbell, a former Marin      resident now living in Daly City, said she often visited her      great aunt at the Miwok's Graton Rancheria in Sonoma County.       ``I'm really steamed, I'm just so upset that this bill      maybe will not pass,'' Campbell said. ``I think it's a just      bill and it's about time we got some recognition because we      have all these other issues to deal with, Health issues,      education issues, and we need this recognition to move      forward.''       The bill would make the tribe eligible for a wide range of      U.S. and California health, education and housing grants and      assistance from various federal agencies, give the tribe the      right to establish a reservation and exempt the tribe from      some local, state, or federal taxes and local zoning      ordinances on reservation land.       If the bill is not passed by Oct. 5, when the Senate      recesses, a new restoration bill would have to wait until the      next Congress.       Camobell described Woolsey's refusal to drop the redundant      anti-gaming clause from the Senate version as ``unrelenting''      and ``unreasonable.''
