I hope we will finish soon so that we don't have to spend a great deal more time. We have had a large number of amendments that are basically Banking Committee amendments, and other committees, not the Judiciary Committee. We should come back to realizing that this is a Judiciary bill. Every one of us says we are against those who are stealing life savings and money set aside for kids' colleges and stealing people's homes. We all say we would love to put them in jail. We will not do it until we get the bill through.  I yield the floor.
