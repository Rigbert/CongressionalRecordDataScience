Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself strongly with the remarks of all the previous speakers, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi). And I want to thank the gentlewoman for her leadership in drafting this legislation. I am very proud to be a cosponsor of it.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H. Res. 178, which many of us want to see passed unanimously today. Ten years ago, Mr. Speaker, the ground at Tiananmen Square was hallowed by the blood of thousands of peaceful democracy advocates. Those Chinese patriots were slaughtered by a Communist regime that remains defiantly unapologetic for its actions and that continues to deny the very truth of what happened.  I was gravely disappointed last year when the President of the United States and our country, which more than any other in the world ought to bear the standard of freedom and democracy and do so very, very diligently, met at that very site with the dictators who continued to lie about the murders committed less than a decade ago. In December of 1996, Mr. Speaker, General Chi Haotian, the Defense Minister of the People's Republic of China and the operational commander of the forces that attacked the pro-democracy demonstrators, we call him the ``Butcher of Beijing,'' was invited to the United States by the Clinton administration.  During his visit he was given full military honors, a 19-gun salute, visits to several military bases and a tour of Sandia Nuclear Laboratory. And I would just say parenthetically, the Cox report suggests that that visit probably was not needed. He even had a personal meeting, Mr. Speaker, with the President of the United States at the White House.  He also stated in what he called a responsible and serious manner, and I quote this, ``Not a single person losthis life in Tiananmen Square.'' He claimed that on June 4th, 1989, the People's Liberation Army did nothing more violent than pushing. General Chi Haotian said the only thing they did in Tiananmen Square was push people that he called hooligans. General Chi's remarkable ``big lie'' statement about Tiananmen Square helped the American people and the world to understand what he and his government are really like.  Mr. Speaker, my Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights of the Committee on International Relations has had more than a dozen hearings on China and its repressive human rights regime, and during one of those, when we heard those outrageous remarks, we very quickly put together a hearing with people who were there on the ground--students--and we also had a man that was a journalist from the People's Daily, who was actually arrested for his honest reporting as to what had occurred, a Time magazine correspondent, and, like I said, some of the students. But we also invited General Chi.  The gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) and I, then the ranking member, wanted to give the Chinese an opportunity to give an account for Tiananmen Square. The General was mouthing off to audiences here in the United States that nobody died. We offered that he come without delay before the people's body and give an account, because we happened to have evidence that would prove contrary. General Chi didn't make it. He didn't show up.  We offered it to a representative of his government and we also invited Ambassador Lee for a roundtable discussion, and at the very last minute, he opted out. C-SPAN, everybody was there to cover it and there was another empty chair because they do not want to be held accountable for the atrocities.  Perhaps General Chi, perhaps the ambassador, perhaps any representative of the government could tell us that there are no persecuted Christians in China. Perhaps they could tell us there is no ethnic and religious persecution in Tibet or Xinjiang. Perhaps they could tell us there is no forced abortions or forced sterilization, no dying rooms for unwanted children, usually baby girls and usually handicapped children.  They also perhaps could tell us there is no political suppression or dissent and no torture. Of course, we would know that is a lie, but it is about time we held them to account.  At one of our hearings recently, Mr. Speaker, Amnesty International issued a report card and on every one of the items they came to the conclusion that there was a total failure by the dictatorship. For example, release of all Tiananmen Square prisoners and other prisoners of conscience. Amnesty's response, total failure. Not one Tiananmen Square prisoner has been released since President Clinton's visit. Review all counterrevolutionary prison terms, about 2,000 of them; total failure. Not one counterrevolutionary prison sentence has been reviewed.  There has been no indication by Chinese authorities that they will undertake a systematic review of such cases; according to Amnesty. Allow religious freedom; continued strong repression, says Amnesty.                              {time}  1215  There has been no indication of improvement since the President's visit. On the gross violation of coercive family planning and the harvesting of organs, again, Amnesty International reports no progress whatsoever. Those are crimes against humanity.  The information concerning the practice of coercive population control is ``unequivocal''. And the Chinese authorities have announced no steps to stop it.  Review of the system and reeducation through labor; total failure says Amnesty. Chinese authorities have made no changes in the system, nor have they announced any plans to do so.  End police and prison brutality. Amnesty reports total failure in these two areas as well. Chinese authorities continue to use torture and beatings.  Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, General Chi did not respond to our invitation. Nor has the ambassador. And we reissue it again to them. Come and speak before the House, through our subcommittee or any other forum, because we think that there is much to be held accountable for.  What really happened on Tiananmen Square? I think Ms. Pelosi put it so well. There were people there on the ground who reported. Let us not forget the very images we saw. It was captured on videotape. And yet, they still lie right through their teeth.  Nicholas Kristoff of the New York Times, who was in the Square on that night, reports, and this is his reporting, ``The troops began shooting. Some people fell to the ground wounded or dead. Each time the soldiers fired again and more people fell to the ground.''  When he went to the Xiehe Hospital, the nearest to the Square, ``It was a bloody mess with hundreds of injured lying on the floors. I saw bullet holes in the ambulances.''  Jan Wong of The Toronto Globe and Mail, looking down from a balcony in Beijing, ``watched in horror as the army shot directly into the crowds. People fell with gaping wounds.''  Later she reported, ``The soldiers strafed ambulances and shot medical workers trying to rescue the wounded.'' ``In all,'' she reported, ``I recorded eight long murderous volleys. Dozens died before my eyes.''  General Chi said this was just pushing. What an outrageous big lie, reminiscent of what the Nazis did during their terrible reign of terror.  This is what Tiananmen Square means to the people of China, Mr. Speaker, and to the world. We should mark the tenth anniversary of that tragedy by remembering those who lost their lives in Tiananmen Square and by publicly committing ourselves to the cause for which they died, freedom for the people of China.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
