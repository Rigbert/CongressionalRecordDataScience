President, I wish to applaud the University of Central Oklahoma and the University of Oklahoma for being recognized by the Military Times as among the 100 best colleges for our Nation's veterans. With over 2,400 students who are veterans between them, UCO and OU provide outstanding support and academic experiences for our Nation's heroes after they have returned from their service to our Nation in uniform.  Founded in 1890 as one of Oklahoma's first institutions of higher learning, the University of Central Oklahoma is ranked 40th on this list and cultivates creativity and innovation from its 17,000 students, of which more than 700 are veterans. Students have the opportunity to earn diplomas from the more than 100 major areas of study offered at UCO. In 2010, UCO established the Veteran's Hero office to address the unique needs of our veterans and their families as they transition from the battlefield to the classroom. Continuously recognized as among the best universities in the Nation, UCO puts the extra effort into taking care of our veterans and has earned distinction in this area for 3 consecutive years in similar rankings by Victory Media, a nationwide veterans' employment recruiting service.  Also founded in 1890, the University of Oklahoma ranks 85th on this list and has nearly 30,000 students, of whom more than 1,700 are veterans who are earning degrees from the more than 150 majors offered on three campuses. Through the Veterans Support Alliance, faculty and staff volunteers at the University of Oklahoma have provided a positive and supportive learning environment for veterans. OU's efforts have helped student veterans and servicemembers achieve academic excellence and personal success. As a pacesetter for public higher education, OU is also ranked by the Princeton Review as among the top 10 public universities in the nation in terms of academic excellence and cost for students.  On behalf of the great State of Oklahoma, I commend UCO and OU for making the ``Best for Vets: Colleges 2015'' list and salute their steadfast efforts to provide quality education for those who have defended our freedoms at home and abroad.                          ____________________
