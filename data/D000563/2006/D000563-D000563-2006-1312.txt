KYL. Let me finish the discussion so the Senator will not have to interrupt and ask questions, please.  Third, there are the situations where you have visa waiver countries where, because of the terms of the visa waiver, there has been a prewaiver of a right to contest removal, so there is no formal proceeding. There are about 900 removed under that provision per year. So this is not just visa overstayers. There are millions of visa overstayers, obviously. And finally the category of expedited removal, which is section 235, where an alien is detained until deportation. We don't have data on how many were deported but are still in the United States.  These are categories of people where it is not simply violating it--it is not coming into the United States illegally that triggers a visa overstayer. In fact, I am not sure we wrote this broadly enough because a visa overstayer such as Mohamed Atta--somebody from a country that does not have a visa waiver, from a country such as Saudi Arabia--would not be caught. So here is Mohamed Atta who overstays his visa, flies an airplane into the World Trade Center, and he would not, even under the amendment we have provided here, be precluded from participating in the program.  What I am saying is I don't think we drafted this quite broadly enough, but it makes the point that merely overstaying the visa does not catch you up in this particular bill. So it is wrong to say all we have to do is overstay a visa and this amendment would catch you up. That is simply not the case. The number probably caught up in this would be in the neighborhood of 300,000.
