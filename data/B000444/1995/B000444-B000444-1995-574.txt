 The reason he is uninformed on the issue, Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty, the administration is not opposed.  I will submit the letter for the Record. I ask unanimous consent it be put in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      U.S. Information Agency,                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1995.     Hon. Joseph Biden,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Joe: It is my understanding that the Senate may take      up an amendment that would rescind major funding for the      operations of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. We appreciate      your past and continuing support for RFE/RL and hope you will      join the Administration and me in opposing this amendment.       As you know, we are currently in the process of shutting      down RFE/RL in Munich and moving the newly configured      operation to Prague. We have managed to get major components      of the operation off the government budget and all of those      involved in this effort have proceeded in good faith on the      basis of reductions agreed to last year. The budget is being      drastically reduced.       The operation will be overhauled under the leadership of      Kevin Klose, President of RFE/RL, and a new Board of      Directors, chaired by David Burke, former Vice President of      ABC News. We have, however, let go more than a thousand long-     time employees in Germany and must meet major obligations      (legal obligations) there for German Government mandated      separation costs, pension and health costs, etc. A cut in      this year's budget of the one-time expense set aside for this      purpose will break faith with those who have moved ahead with      creativity and no little courage to help reinvent this old      institution and make it serve a new purpose in a new time. It      will also create a monumental management disaster in Munich      and Prague, which will cause operations to come to an abrupt      halt and create obligations and penalties for the U.S.      Government beyond the savings sought by the amendment's      sponsors.       I stand ready to met you in the Senate Lounge at any time      to talk with you about this, as does Mort Halperin, who can      express President Clinton's and the National Security      Council's strong opposition to the proposed amendment.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                    Joseph Duffey,                                                         Director.
