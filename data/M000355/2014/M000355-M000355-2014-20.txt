 President, I would also like to say a quick word about Chris Doby, the Senate financial clerk, who will be leaving us soon after more than three decades of service.  Chris came to the Senate in 1983 after graduating from Radford University. He was a junior auditor back in those days. Today he has a broad range of duties. He has weathered a lot of storms. He is also one of the most popular guys in the Senate because he is responsible for making sure everybody gets paid. But Senators' staffs are not the only ones who have nice things to say about Chris. His colleagues praise his sincerity, his steady hand, his confidence, and his friendliness.  Chris is the consummate family man. He has three daughters: Colleen, Caroline, and Courtney; a grandson he adores; and a wife of 31 years, Cathy. I know he is looking forward to spending more time with all of them. He is probably looking forward to the end of his daily commute too. It is a 2-hour trek from the District to his home in Virginia. That is 2 hours each way, every day. I understand that Cathy has a to-do list for Chris that is a mile long, so we know he will have a lot on his plate when he leaves here. But we thank him for his long and dedicated service in the Senate.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
