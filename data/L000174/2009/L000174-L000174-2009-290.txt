The 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the Vermont National Guard--the only Army brigade in the Army with a ``Mountain'' fighting designation, comprised of upwards of 1,800 proud citizen-soldiers from Vermont--will begin a yearlong deployment to Afghanistan next year. They will help train the Afghan National Army, which is critical to our success there. We want all our deployed forces--from Vermont, Hawaii, and every State, and every armed service--to have the best protection from roadside bomb attacks. That need is reflected in the urgent request from Central Command, in the so-called Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement.
