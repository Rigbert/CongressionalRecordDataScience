 When you use the term ``Cadillac,'' the implications are that maybe we will get some of those guys at Goldman Sachs who have this off-the-wall outlandish benefit package.  The reality is, the CWA--Communications Workers of America--has done a bit of work on this. What theirestimate is, as health care costs continue to rise--and we are seeing 6 percent, 7 percent, 8 percent increases every year--obviously, the way the language of this legislation is written, it will impact more and more health care plans. By the year 2019, it will burden one out of three health care plans in this country. Does that sound like a Cadillac plan, one out of three plans? And eventually, as health care costs continue to rise, it will impact virtually every plan in this country.  The bottom line we are talking about is, yes, we need to raise money. How do you do it? Do you do it by socking it to the middle-class and working families? And as the Senator from Ohio has indicated, many of these workers have given up wage increases in order to maintain a strong health care benefit. Are those the people we are going to tax or do you tax the top two one-hundredths of 1 percent, many of whom have received generous tax breaks in recent years?
