Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Maryland for her comments. I hope that she can rally 19 of her Republican colleagues. That is all we need to reopen this Government, and I hope that we can vote on that before there is any suggestion that this Congress leave for another 3 weeks.  Another Republican, the gentleman from Virginia, said earlier Congress is about to set out on another paid vacation, another 3 weeks away from Washington, while this Government is shut down. If it happens, and I sincerely hope it does not, I hope that my colleagues, particularly my Republican colleagues, who have endorsed this strategy, the Gingrich strategy of Government shutdown, will go home and listen to what the people on the street have to say about what we are doing.  This morning I stood at the Jefferson Park CTA stop in the city of Chicago for about an hour and a half, and as a thousand people came by, I took my poll, and I can tell you people across this country are damn disgusted with what is happening here in Washington. They cannot countenance how we can allow 280,000 Federal workers to be furloughed and three-quarters of a million workers to have their pay in jeopardy.  You see, they listened to the Gingrich rhetoric about personal responsibility, personal responsibility, and yet they see the same leaders who are sending Federal workers home unpaid and underpaid, taking their full congressional paychecks every single day. They hear these pious pronouncements about personal responsibility while Members of Congress with full pay go home for a Christmas vacation content in the knowledge they will be able to make next month's mortgage payment while hundreds of thousands of Federal workers do not have that certainty and have a bleak Christmas and holidays as a result of it.  The gentlewoman from Maryland referred to the National Institutes of Health. My brother, who is a retired Federal employee, swims every morning with some doctors from the National Institutes of Health. They were hopping mad this week because Members of Congress are still referring hardship cases to the National Institutes of Health while they fail to fund that agency adequately. In other words, we want them to continue performing their services, and yet will not make their paychecks whole. We will not treat them as an agency of great importance, which they are.   Personal responsibility, Mr. Gingrich? It is not even close. It is arrogance.  And we also heard this talk about a family-friendly Congress. That is a hoot. That is a real hoot for Members here.                              {time}  1830  You see Members dropping out in droves because of this schedule and the madness that we have gone through for the past year.  But forget us for a moment. Think about the innocent families that are being disadvantaged by this shutdown. Think about those families and the impact that they feel. A young woman calls me, a college student, had a chance to go on a mission for a church to Haiti over Christmas. That was going to be her gift to poor people, and she could not get a passport. Another family called, having tried to sell a home in their family estate for month after month, had to cancel the closing because the Veterans' Administration cannot process papers because of the Gingrich shutdown.  Now the Gingrich folks say this is a matter of personal responsibility. It is a matter of principles. Let me tell you, it is not a matter of principle if it is somebody else's paycheck on the line. It is a matter of principle to put your own paycheck on the line.  The reason I became so angry and objected a minute ago to the District of Columbia appropriation is because the bill that should have been brought to the floor would include a bill from the Senate that has my bill in it, ``no budget, no pay.'' A bill that says when the budget shuts down, we stop issuing congressional paychecks.  You know what would happen if Members of Congress did not get their paychecks? This crisis would be over in a heartbeat. Over in a heartbeat. You would start counting the case for these paid vacations and recesses and realize you are not going to get paid. I have given up my congressional salary during the shutdown. It is painful for me and my family.  I guarantee you if every Member of Congress did it, if Speaker Gingrich did it, if Mr. DeLay, who considers him some constitutional officer of some kind, or Mr. Armey did it, they would think twice about another recess while this Government is shut down. They would think twice about congressional junkets and trips. They would think about doing the business of this country.  Why in the world are we taking it out on all of these innocent people, hundreds of thousands of people? If you have a problem, show your statement of principle, show your character, put your own paycheck on the line. Do not take it out on the innocent people across this country.  Let me close by saying this: We are seeing the face of modern Republicanism, the face of Gingrich Republicanism, and it is a mean face. It is a face that looks for innocent victims. Is it any wonder that the Democrats and President Clinton have second thoughts about the Gingrich budget plan? We see what they will do with the Government shutdown. Imagine what they will do if they get to write this budget for the next 7 years.                          ____________________
