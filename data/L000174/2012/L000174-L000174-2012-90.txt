President, so much of the news we hear today is riddled in tragedy, but every so often a story of joy and hope transcends the negativity and warms our hearts. I would like to share such a story and salute a constituent of mine, fifteen-year-old Adam Merchant of Barre, VT.  Adam is in remission after battling Burkitt lymphoma, a cancer that attacks the lymphatic system. Through the kindness of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Adam received his wish: to see his favorite team play, the defending Super Bowl champions New York Giants. Not only did he see his Giants defeat the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night, but Adam also delivered an impromptu, pregame motivating speech to the Giants, which many of the team's players cited as an inspiration to their 38-to-10 victory over the mighty Packers. Adam described the night as a ``dream,'' but it is the rest of us who should be moved by Adam's bravery and persistence battling lymphoma. The Make-A-Wish Foundation brightens so many young lives, and I thank them and the New York Giants for helping make Adam's dream come true.  I ask unanimous consent that Christian Red's article in the November 27, 2012, edition of the New York Daily News, ``Young Adam Merchant, teenager fight cancer, gives NY Giants inspired pep talk before rout of Green Bay Packers,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the New York Daily News, Nov. 27, 2012]Young Adam Merchant, Teenager Fighting Cancer, Gives NY Giants Inspired                Pep Talk Before Rout of Green Bay Packers                           (By Christian Red)       Adam Merchant says he was ``a little bit'' fatigued Monday      afternoon, which was understandable given the dizzying      schedule the 15-year-old native of tiny Barre, Vt., has kept      since Thursday, the best four-day stretch of his young life.       ``I'm feeling pretty good,'' Merchant told the Daily News      on Monday.       Merchant flew down to the New York area on Thursday, gave      an unrehearsed rallying speech to Giants players Friday and      then watched Big Blue's romp over Green Bay Sunday night. He      also had the luxury of roaming the home team's sideline after      the first quarter, and then got a choice seat next to Justin      Tuck after the game. Not a bad way to spend a few days in the      Big Apple.       ``That's the happiest I've seen him in a long time, Heather      Merchant said of her son. ``Actually, that is the happiest      I've ever seen him.''       The unique experience came together through the Make-A-Wish      Foundation. Adam Merchant was diagnosed with Stage 3 Burkitt      lymphoma, a cancer that attacks the lymphatic system, in      March. Although Adam's cancer is in remission after      chemotherapy, he had to have his gall bladder removed during      the course of his treatment.       While he was hospitalized, his mother began researching      Make-A-Wish, calling the Vermont chapter, which in turn      worked with the New York/New Jersey chapters to put together      Adam's dream scenario.       Soon a ``wish granter'' visited the Merchants with a      special announcement. Originally, the Merchants were supposed      to come to the Nov. 4 game against the Steelers, but their      travel plans were postponed in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.       Instead of watching a deflating loss to Pittsburgh, the      Merchants got to take in a pummeling of the powerhouse      Packers. ``They're definitely no slouch team,'' Adam said of      Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay.       Heather Merchant, a supervisor at Stowe ski resort, says      her son has always been a Giants fan, despite living in      Patriot country. Adam and his father, Adam Sr., a licensed      nurse's aide, have stood their ground in enemy territory,      surrounded by Tom Brady fans. Those two Super Bowl victories      over Brady and Co. don't hurt.       ``He's a walking encyclopedia, especially about football,''      Heather Merchant, who has two other children, says of Adam.       Despite his penchant for stats and football history,      nothing could have prepared Adam for his big moment Friday,      when he was called into the Giants' huddle after practice and      had to make an impromptu speech.       He spoke barely above a whisper.       ``I thought about it a little bit before I spoke,'' Adam      said. ``It came to me that the only thing that needed to be      said was what I said--I told them, `Go out and play, show      them why we're world champs.' ''       ``He was getting really emotional,'' said Heather Merchant,      who added that her son is back in school and ``getting back      on track'' after his treatment.       Every player, from Eli Manning to Tuck to Adam's favorite,      Jason Pierre-Paul, spoke about how the speech inspired them      to get the victory. Adam, for one, thinks the team has turned      the corner and has another Super Bowl run in the making.       ``Oh, definitely. We've come through so much adversity in      the past that I think we can do anything,'' said Adam      Merchant, who might as well have been speaking for himself as      well as the Giants.       When the 38-10 win was in the books, Adam sat next to Tuck      for the celebration, even though he was sporting a No. 90      Pierre-Paul jersey. Tuck didn't mind, Adam said, and even      gave him a No. 91 jersey to add to his wardrobe.       ``I have a newfound love for Justin Tuck,'' Adam said.      ``The locker room was awesome. Make-A-Wish didn't just create      a wish--it was a dream.''                          ____________________
