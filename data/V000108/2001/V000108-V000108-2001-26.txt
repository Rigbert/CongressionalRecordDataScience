Speaker, my thoughts and prayers go out to those who have lost loved ones and family members in this evil and barbaric act. We as a Nation cannot tolerate these kinds of attacks on American citizens.  Today we must first pledge our unwavering support for those involved in the search and rescue missions underway in Washington, D.C. and New York City. Law enforcement officers, firefighters, doctors, nurses, rescue workers have committed thousands of selfless acts to help those injured.  Secondly, we must persevere in the fight against the enemies of freedom and democracy, as we have in the past. It took the United States over 4 years to win the Second World War, and more than 40 years to win the Cold War. All Americans must now display the same patience and strong resolve in the war against terrorism. We have a moral obligation to seek out these craven individuals, wherever they may hide, to destroy them and their organizations so they may no longer kill, maim or injure innocent people in the future.  America and its people are good and just. Our democracy is strong, and the good we do will prevail in the end. We live in a free and civilized society. Our resolve tonight and tomorrow and forever must be to permanently establish these values across the globe.
