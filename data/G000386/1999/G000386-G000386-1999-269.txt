 President, it is with a feeling of disappointment that I come to the floor today. What's bothering me is a disturbing report I am releasing today on the Office of the Inspector General, or IG, at the Department of Defense, DOD.  This is about a report prepared by the Majority Staff of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, of which I am the Chairman.  I have always had such great respect for the DOD IG. I have always thought that we could rely on that office to be fair and independent and thorough, and above all, honest.  In the past, I always felt like I could trust the DOD IG's judgment.  This report, Mr. President is disturbing.  The evidence in this report questions the credibility of the IG's investigative process. And it raises questions about the judgment of the Acting IG, Mr. Donald Mancuso.  It is a report on the Oversight Investigation of allegations of misconduct at the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, or DCIS. DCIS is the criminal investigations arm of the DOD IG.  The allegations examined by the Staff involve possible misconduct by DCIS agents between 1993 and 1996.  The current Acting DOD IG, Mr. Mancuso, is associated with the allegations. Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS from 1988 until 1997, when he became the Deputy DOD IG.  I also understand that Mr. Mancuso is a potential candidate for nomination to be the next DOD IG.  In June 1999, the Staff was approached by a former DCIS agent, Mr. William G. Steakley.  Mr. Steakley raised numerous allegations regarding prohibited employment practices at DCIS, but these were far too extensive and complex to be examined by my small Subcommittee staff.  However, one of Mr. Steakley's allegations caught our attention. This was the allegation that DCIS officials had ``made false statements'' in adverse reports on his conduct.  Mr. Steakley alleged that an agent assigned to the DCIS internal affairs unit, Mr. Mathew A. Walinski, had a history of falsifying investigative reports to damage the reputations of fellow agents.  Mr. Steakley further alleged that senior DCIS management, including Mr. Mancuso, was fully aware of the allegations about this agent's unethical practices, yet failed to take appropriate corrective action.  And Mr. Steakley claimed he had proof to back up the allegations.  The staff conducted a careful examination of these allegations and concluded that some have merit.  To evaluate the allegations, the staff reviewed numerous documents to include the extensive files at the Office of Special Counsel, OSC, DOD personnel files, and DCIS investigative reports. The staff also conducted a number of formal interviews.  A careful review of all pertinent material makes one point crystal clear:  The evidence shows that Mr. Walinski fabricated his reported interview of the Air Force payroll technician, Ms. Nancy Gianino, on May 21, 1993. This reported interview was conducted in connection with the investigation of possible tax evasion charges against Mr. Steakley.  In addition, OSC files contain numerous references to a second internal affairs case handled by Mr. Walinski, in which he apparently fabricated another report.  When the staff asked the DOD IG for this case file--known as the Johanson stolen gun case, they discovered that Mr. Walinski had apparently fabricated the reported interview of Agent Jon Clark on March 2, 1994 and possibly others. This file contains sworn statements by the agents involved that Walinski's reported interview with Clark never took place.  These two cases--when taken together--show that Mr. Walinski has a history of falsifying reports.  And more importantly, the record shows that rank and file complaints about Mr. Walinski's unethical investigative practices went directly to top DCIS management, including Mr. Mancuso.  The record also shows DCIS management knew about the Walinski problem but failed to take appropriate corrective action.  Yet despite rank and file complaints, Mr. Walinski's false reports were used by DCIS management to discredit and punish Agents Johanson and Steakley.  In January 1999, Mr. Walinski was allowed to transfer to another federal law enforcement agency--the Treasury IG--with no record of punishment or accountability. In his new assignment, Mr. Walinski is still responsible for investigating employee misconduct.  In fact, the record shows that at least 3 weeks after DCIS management was informed that Mr. Walinski had fabricated the Clark interview, he was given a generous cash bonus award.  Moreover, Mr. Walinski was assigned to conduct an inspection of the field office where rank and file complaints about his false reports had originated.  While investigating Mr. Steakley's allegations, the staff discovered that the DCIS internal affairs unit--to which Mr. Walinski was assigned--was directed by Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth.  Mr. Hollingsworth was convicted of a felony in U.S. District Court in March 1996. He was apprehended and confessed to filing a fraudulent passport application after a fellow agent recognized his photo in a law enforcement bulletin.  The government authorities, who investigated Mr. Hollingsworth's criminal conduct, believe that he committed about 12 overt acts of fraud. These overt acts of fraud were committed while Mr. Hollingsworth was Director of the DCIS internal affairs unit--Mr. Walinski's office.  Mr. President, can you imagine that? The head of the internal affairs unit of DOD's criminal investigative division was committing passport fraud. That's certainly a confidence builder in that organization, isn't it?  These authorities further believe Mr. Hollingsworth's actions were especially disturbing since passport fraud is usually committed in furtherance of a more serious crime, but the underlying crime was never discovered.  Although Mr. Mancuso and Mr. Hollingsworth were considered friends by associates, Mr. Mancuso failed to recuse himself from administrative actions affecting Mr. Hollingsworth.  Mr. Mancuso even aided in Hollingsworth's defense during criminal trial proceedings--even though Mr. Hollingsworth was considered uncooperative.  What's more, Mr. Mancuso endorsed an outstanding performance rating for Mr. Hollingsworth three weeks after he confessed to felonious activity to U.S. State Department special agents.  Mr. Mancuso even wrote a letter on official DOD IG stationary to the sentencing judge, Judge Ellis, on the convicted felon's behalf.  In this letter, he asked the judge to consider extenuating circumstances. He told the judge that Mr. Hollingsworth had taken a half day's leave to file the fraudulent passport application. Evidently, Mr. Mancuso thought that taking leave to commit a crime was sonehow exculpatory.  This is what Mr. Mancuso said in his letter to Judge Ellis, and I quote: ``Mr. Hollingsworth could have come and gone as he pleased,'' but he ``took leave to commit a felony.''  Mr. Mancuso concluded with this telling remark: ``To this day, there is no evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth has ever done anything improper relating to his duties and responsibilities as a DCIS agent and manager.''  Coming from a law enforcement officer like Mr. Mancuso, these words defy understanding. The last time I checked, part of doing your job as a law enforcement officer is not committing crimes.  Mr. Hollingsworth confessed to and was convicted of felonious activity while employed by DCIS as a criminal investigator.  As State Department agents put it, these crimes were committed in the furtherance of a more serious crime that was never discovered.  Unfortunately, Mr. Mancuso seems to have been completely blind to the problem.  As a result of a series of decisions--personally approved by Mr. Mancuso, Mr. Hollingsworth was allowed to remain in an employed status at DCIS for 6 months after his felony conviction. He was then allowed to retire with a full federal law enforcement annuity exactly on his 50th birthday in September 1996.  Had Mr. Mancuso exercised good judgement and other available legal options, Mr. Hollingsworth could have been removed from DCIS immediately after conviction--in March 1996. Under these circumstances, he would have been forced to wait 12 years--until the year 2008--to begin receiving a non-law enforcement annuity commencing at age 62. Had Mr. Mancuso exercised this option, he would have saved the taxpayers at least $750,000.00, which is the amount of money Mr. Hollingsworth will collect thanks to the generous treatment he received from his friend and colleague, Mr. Mancuso.  Think of the signal this sends to rank and file law enforcement officers who look to their managers for leadership and fair treatment.  The office of the DOD IG demands the highest standards of integrity, judgment, and conduct.  Does Mr. Mancuso meet those standards?  Given Mr. Mancuso's poor judgment and his irresponsible handling of the three cases examined in the staff report, I believe it is reasonable to question:  (1) Whether Mr. Mancuso should now be nominated and confirmed as the DOD IG;  (2) Whether Mr. Mancuso should be allowed to remain in the post he now occupies--Acting DOD IG;  And given the evidence that Mr. Walinski falsified several investigative reports, it is reasonable to question whether he should be assigned to a position at the Treasury Department in which he is responsible for conducting criminal and administrative inquiries.  Mr. President, today I am forwarding the Majority Staff report to the appropriate committees, the Secretaries of Defense and Treasury and other officials.  These officials must evaluate Mr. Mancuso's fitness to serve as the DOD IG as well as Mr. Walinski's continued assignment as a criminal investigator.  I hope they will take the time to review this report before making a final decision on these matters.  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to have printed two documents in the Record: (1) A letter of comment from Mr. Mancuso; and (2) the Majority Staff report. I know it's a lengthy report, and the GPO says it will cost $2,282.00 to print. But leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that a person of the highest integrity occupies the key watch dog post of DOD IG is well worth that cost, in my view.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Majority Staff Report to the Chairman on the Oversight Investigation--   The Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Department of Defense(U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the       Courts, October 1999, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Chairman)                           Executive Summary       The Majority Staff for the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on      Administrative Oversight and the Courts has conducted an      inquiry into the personnel practices and conduct of certain      agents within the Defense Criminal Investigative Service      (DCIS). The DCIS is an agency in the Office of the Department      of Defense (DOD) Inspector General (IG). The former Director      of DCIS--a sworn federal law enforcement officer--is now      Acting DOD IG, Mr. Donald Mancuso. Mr. Mancuso was Director      of DCIS from 1988-1997. Mr. Mancuso is currently a potential      candidate for nomination to be the next DOD IG.       This staff report contrasts DCIS personnel management      practices that condoned and encouraged maltreatment of rank      and file agents, including the use of falsified investigative      reports, while protecting and rewarding a fellow manager who      was a convicted felon. Management's favorable treatment of      the convicted felon, Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth, will result      in his receiving substantial sums of money in federal law      enforcement retirement annuities between 1996 and the year      2008. If DCIS management had exercised good judgment and      other more reasonable options, Mr. Hollingsworth would not      have been allowed to retire on his 50th birthday and receive      the $750,000.000 in benefits. He would have had to wait 12      years to retire. In another matter, a criminal investigator,      who falsified reports. Mr. Mathew A. Walinski, also received      a cash bonus award after this misconduct was brought to the      attention of senior DCIS management.       The staff report cites three separate personnel cases      brought to the Subcommittee's attention involving DCIS. Each      of these cases involves questionable personnel practices that      were either condoned or ignored by DCIS management between      1993 and 1996.       The Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts      has primary jurisdiction and oversight authority for      administrative practices and procedures throughout the      Federal Government. As part of the process of conducting its      oversight responsibilities, the Subcommittee has been      examining administrative procedures followed by various      inspectors general. This report reflects the Subcommittee      Majority Staff's review of questionable administrative      decisions and misconduct within the criminal investigative      branch in the DOD IG's office--DCIS, while Mr. Mancuso was      the director of the organization.                               background       In June of 1999, the Subcommittee Majority Staff was      approached by a former agent of DCIS, Mr. Gary Steakley. Mr.      Steakley alleged that a DCIS internal affairs Special Agent,      Mr. Walinski, had a history of falsifying official reports to      damage the reputations of fellow agents. Mr. Steakley also      alleged that senior officials at DCIS were fully aware of      this agent's questionable practices, yet failed to take      appropriate corrective action.       It should be noted that an investigator in the Office of      Special Counsel (OSC), Mr. William Shea, also looked into Mr.      Steakley's allegations of DCIS misconduct. OSC concluded that      Mr. Steakley was not a victim of prohibited personnel      practices. While the staff examined the conduct of DCIS      supervisors in regard to several specific decisions, it did      not attempt to examine the numerous other allegations raised      by Mr. Steakley.       While investigating Mr. Steakley's allegations, the staff      learned that Mr. Walinski was supervised by Mr.      Hollingsworth--the director of internal affairs. Mr.      Hollingsworth was convicted of a felony in April 1996.      Nonetheless, management allowed him to retire with full      federal law enforcement retirement benefits six months after      his felony conviction. Federal law enforcement agencies      commonly remove an employee on criminal misconduct alone, or      at a minimum, immediately after a felony conviction. Had      management availed itself of other appropriate legal removal      options, Mr. Hollingsworth would not have been allowed to      retire on his 50th birthday, which gave him entitlement to      benefits amounting to more than three quarters of a million      dollars.       The staff reviewed numerous documents to include the above-     referenced OCS investigation, DOD personnel files, DOD      investigative reports, a Subcommittee-requested review by the      Office of Personnel Management (OPM), State Department      Diplomatic Security investigative reports, and public court      papers registered in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern      District of Virginia. The Subcommittee Majority Staff also      conducted the following formal interviews:     Former DOD personnel:       Mr. Matthew Walinski, DCIS Special Agent Internal Affairs       Mr. Larry Hollingsworth, DCIS Director of Internal Affairs       Mr. William Dupree, Deputy Director of DCIS       Ms. Eleanor Hill, Former DOD Inspector General     Current DOD personnel:       Mr. Donald Mancuso, Former Director of DCIS and Current      Acting IG for DOD       Ms. Jane Charters, DCIS Investigative Support       Ms. Donna Seracino, Director of Personnel for DCIS       Ms. Linda Martz, Employee Relations Specialist       Mr. Paul Tedesco, DCIS liaison agent in Hollingsworth      criminal case       Mr. John Keenan, Current Director of DCIS, formerly Dir.,      DCIS Operations       Mr. Thomas Bonner, Current Agent in Charge Dallas Office,      DCIS, Assist. Dir DCIS Internal Affairs       Ms. Nancy Gianino, Air Force Payroll Specialist       Lt. Col. Greg McClelland, DOD IG Administrative      Investigator     State Department Personnel:       Special Agent Robert Starnes and Special Agent Sean O'Brien     Office of Special Counsel:       Investigator William Shea       Current and former DCIS Special Agents were also      interviewed on a confidential basis. They requested      confidentiality out of fear of reprisal. This report will      show fears of such reprisal are plausible based on the facts      developed by the Subcommittee.                    summary of significant findings     The case of convicted felon Mr. Hollingsworth       Mr. Hollingsworth was the Director of internal affairs for      DCIS from April 1991 to September 1996. This unit routinely      conducted investigations regarding the integrity and      conductor of agents in DCIS. As stated above, in at least two      cases, DCIS management had knowledge of false witness      statements by an internal affairs agent, Mr. Walinski.       Former Director of DCIS, Mr. Donald Mancuso, assisted Mr.      Hollingsworth in remaining in an employed status--as Director      of internal affairs--for six months after his felony      conviction in U.S. District Court. Law enforcement      authorities, who investigated Mr. Hollingsworth's criminal      activities, believe that he committed at least 12 acts of      overt fraud while head of the DCIS internal affairs unit.       Mr. Mancuso, a sworn federal law enforcement officer, aided      in the defense of this particular subordinate at his criminal      trial. At no time did Mr. Mancuso offer to recuse himself      from administrative or personnel actions     in regards to Mr. Hollingsworth--even though they were      considered ``close personal friends.''       Mr. Mancuso endorsed an outstanding performance evaluation      of Mr. Hollingsworth three weeks after he confessed to      felonious activity to the U.S. State Department special      agents.       Using official DOD IG stationery, with DOD IG emblem, Mr.      Mancuso wrote to the sentencing judge on the convicted      felon's behalf, even though the State Department      investigators opined Mr. Hollingsworth was an uncooperative      defendant. Mr. Mancuso signed the letter in his official      capacity as an Assistant Inspector General.       Former DOD Inspector General Eleanor Hill stated that Mr.      Mancuso did not advise her of pertinent facts in the case.      Ms. Hill had directed Mr. Mancuso to remove Mr. Hollingsworth      from his position ``as soon as legally possible.''       Mr. Mancuso directly assisted Mr. Hollingsworth in      obtaining over three quarters of a million dollars in full      federal law enforcement retirement benefits six months after      a felony conviction. OPM retirement experts, legal counsel at      DOD's Washington Headquarters Service, and Inspector General      regulations all state that Mr. Mancuso had options to remove      this employee immediately after conviction. In fact, the law,      DOD regulations, and an OPM opinion all suggest that Mr.      Hollingsworth could have been removed based on the criminal      conduct alone, and not on criminal court procedures.       The retirement benefits given to Mr. Hollingsworth were      extremely generous, since federal law enforcement officials      may retire at ago 50 instead of age 62, and computation of      their general schedule grade has law enforcement availability      pay of up to 25% added in on top of regular pay. This      resulted in a convicted felon being able to obtain      approximately $750,000.00 in additional annuity payments      (excluding cost-of-living allowances) as compared to what he      would have received had he been terminated immediately after      conviction and allowed only non-law enforcement civil service      retirement benefits commencing at age 62 in the year 2008.     Falsification of Witness Statements by Agent Walinski in          Steakley Case       There were numerous claims of misconduct made by Mr.      Steakley in regard to the conduct of the DCIS office of      internal affairs. Several of Mr. Steakley's allegations were      substantiated.       There is credible evidence that at least one agent assigned      to DCIS internal affairs, Agent Walinski, falsified a witness      statement in support of a tax evasion charge against Mr.      Steakley, and was reprimanded and reassigned for a similar      problem in another internal affairs case. Agent Walinski even      acknowledged that the tax evasion charge was ``unresolved''      and that his inconclusive findings were not made apparent in      his report to the DCIS Administrative Review Board (ARB).       The false tax evasion charge in which Mr. Steakley was      eventually exonerated was instigated by DCIS management, to      include Mr. Mancuso, in an area in which DCIS had no      authority or jurisdiction. The States of California and      Virginia repeatedly informed DCIS that the agency could not      obtain Mr. Steakley's tax records without a court order or      authorization from the taxpayer involved. DCIS had neither.       In an interview with the Subcommittee staff, Lt. Col. Greg      McClelland, an independent DOD IG investigator assigned to      review allegations by Mr. Steakley, characterized the conduct      of Agent Walinski in this case as ``egregious.'' The      Subcommittee staff has substantiated evidence that Agent      Walinski made false statements to Lt. Col. McClelland in      sworn testimony in 1997.       Mr. Steakley's attorney, Mr. Luciano A. Cerasi of the      Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA),      notified DCIS management that Agent Walinski's witness      interview of an Air Force payroll technician was falsified.      DCIS management ignored Mr. Cerasi's allegations despite the      fact that it had received another FLEOA letter alleging that      Agent Walinski had falsified witness statement in a separate      internal affairs investigation.     Falsification of Witness Statements by Agent Walinski in          Johanson Case       Prior to the adjudication of the Steakley case, Agent      Walinski had falsified witness statements against another      DCIS agent.       DCIS Agent Stephen Johanson had his undercover weapon      stolen from his residence near Los Angeles, California while      he was participating in the execution of a search warrant in      another California city. In the investigation that followed      the theft of Johanson's weapon. Agent Walinski falsified more      witness statements. His false reports resulted in a      recommendation that Agent Johanson be suspended without pay      for 8 calendar days for failing to secure and return an      issued weapon. DCIS supervisors and rank and file agents      protested to management at DCIS headquarters in Washington      that Agent Walinski's interviews were either inaccurate or      never took place.       FLEOA attorney Cerasi wrote a second letter to top DCIS      management supporting rank and file agents' complaints about      Agent Walinski's reports in the Johanson case. Mr. Cerasi      alleged that Agent Walinski has falsified his interview of      Agent Jon Clark.       DCIS officials claim that Agent Walinski was reprimanded      for ``failing to show due diligence and accuracy'' in      reporting witness interviews in the Johanson case. Agent      Walinski reported an interview of DCIS Agent Clark that never      took place. Despite these allegations, personnel records      indicate that Agent Walinski received a cash award--at least      18 days after rank and file agents had formally complained to      senior management at DCIS headquarters that Agent Walinski      falsified reports. The staff could find no evidence that DCIS      management ever attempted to determine if the allegations      about Mr. Walinski's reports had merit. In fact, immediately      following the first Johanson investigation and while the re-     investigation was in progress, Mr. Walinski was assigned a      leadership role in the inspection of the field office where      the complaints about his reports had originated. This could      be viewed as a retaliatory measure to silence the agents who      had ``blown the whistle'' on Agent Walinski.       DCIS now records all witness interviews for accuracy. Some      DCIS Agents refer to this new practice as ``the Walinski      rule.''.                             report format       This report has been divided into three separate DCIS      personnel cases as follows:           --The Case of Mr. Hollingsworth           --The Case of Mr. Steakley           --The Case of Mr. Johanson       In addition, the report includes written comments from the      Acting DOD IG, Mr. Mancuso, along with an extensive list of      the source documents used in preparing the report.       On September 27, 1999, Mr. Mancuso requested that he be      given the opportunity to review this report prior to its      release and to provide written comments. In response, the      Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, assured      Mr. Mancuso that his written response would be attached to      the staff report. Consistent with the Chairman's commitment,      Mr. Mancuso's written response, dated October 1, 1999, is      included at the end of the report.       The attachments listed at the end of each section of the      report are far too voluminous to reproduce in the printed      report. A complete set of the attachments will be maintained      in the Subcommittee files and available on Judiciary      Committee's web site along with other Committee documents.                              conclusions       The three personnel cases, which the staff reviewed,      demonstrate disparate treatment given to DCIS employees by      senior management.       Mr. Hollingsworth, a high ranking DCIS official, was      convicted of a felony but protected by Mr. Mancuso and      allowed to retire 6 months later--on his 50th birthday--with      a full law enforcement annuity. Mr. Walinski falsified      reports to such a degree that several witness statements      appearing in his investigative reports never took place. He      even claimed in sworn testimony in 1997 that a DOD employee,      whom he had interviewed and reported absent from her office      due to ``extended illness,'' had ovarian cancer, despite the      fact there was no evidence that this person suffered from      such a disease. Mr. Walinski received a cash bonus award      weeks after allegations about his falsified reports reached      senior DCIS management. DCIS management never attempted to      determine whether those allegations had merit, and Mr.      Walinski was allowed to transfer to another law enforcement      agency--Treasury IG--with no record of accountability.       Two other DCIS employees were the subject of disciplinary      action by DCIS management for significantly less serious      offenses, and in one case, based on no evidence. Mr.      Steakley, repeatedly and unjustly accused of numerous      misconduct charges, is now retired with a damaged reputation      among the federal law enforcement community that was      undeserved. Similarly, Mr. Johanson was undeservedly punished      for having a gun stolen from his residence during a burglary.      This gun was issued to him by his own agency. The initial      punishment proposed for Mr. Johanson was based on false      witness interviews and a distorted interpretation of      disciplinary guidelines.       The Office of the DOD Inspector General is a position that      requires a very high standard of integrity, with equal      treatment for all departmental employees. When information is      developed on the criminal misconduct of a senior employee      such as Mr. Hollingsworth, that employee should be removed      ``as soon as legally possible'' to ensure that the morale of      all employees is maintained. When allegations are made of      misconduct such as against Mr. Walinski, the IG's office      should ensure that allegations are professionally and      thoroughly investigated, and all discrepancies are resolved.      When allegations are made against employees such as Mr.      Steakley and Mr. Johanson, charges should be investigated,      witnesses should be accurately interviewed, and bias should      not interfere with the integrity or facts in the      investigation.       If DCIS--under Mr. Mancuso's management--could not      investigate its own employees honestly and fairly, then how      could the much larger Office of the DOD IG--if managed by Mr.      Mancuso--be expected by the American people to investigate      honestly and fairly misconduct and fraud within the entire      Department of Defense?       Given Mr. Mancuso's poor judgment and his irresponsible      handling of the three cases examined in this report, it is      reasonable to question: 1) Whether Mr. Mancuso should now be      nominated and confirmed as the DOD     IG--an office that demands the highest standards of      integrity, judgment, and conduct; and 2) Whether Mr. Mancuso      should be allowed to remain in the post of Acting DOD IG. In      addition, given the evidence that Mr. Walinski falsified      several witness interviews, it is reasonable to question      whether Mr. Walinski should be assigned to a position in      which he is responsible for conducting criminal or      administrative inquiries.                            recommendations       1. The Majority Staff recommends that Members consider a      change in legislation regarding federal law enforcement      officers convicted of felonies. Consideration should be given      to whether federal law enforcement officers should be      immediately dismissed after their conviction of a felony.       Under current law, agencies have considerable discretionary      authority in determining how to handle such cases. In the      Hollingsworth case, a series of personnel actions approved by      DOD Acting Inspector General Mancuso raise serious questions      about his integrity and judgment. The proposed change in      legislation could eliminate any discretionary authority on      the part of individual law enforcement agencies in dismissing      employees convicted of felonies.       2. The Majority Staff recommends that the Chairman forward      this report to appropriate committees, the Secretaries of      Defense and the Treasury and other officials who must      evaluate Mr. Mancuso's fitness as a potential candidate to be      DOD IG, as well as Mr. Walinski's continued assignment as a      GS-1811 criminal investigator.                     THE CASE OF MR. HOLLINGSWORTH       Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth, former GS-15 Director of      internal affairs, DCIS, was convicted of a felony charge in      1996 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of      Virginia. Mr. Hollingsworth was never terminated by DCIS and      allowed to retire on his 50th birthday--six months after a      felony conviction. He is currently receiving full federal law      enforcement retirement benefits totaling approximately      $750,000.00 he would not otherwise have received had      management exercised other more reasonable options.     Background on felonious activity by Mr. Hollingsworth       According to State Department law enforcement agents, Mr.      Hollingsworth's criminal activity in this case commenced on      or about September, 1992, when he reviewed the local      obituaries in Florida and obtained the name of Charles W.      Drew, who was born in 1944 and died in 1948. Mr.      Hollingsworth, with a Top Secret security clearance,      requested from the State of Florida a copy of the death      certificate, representing himself as the deceased's half-     brother. Mr. Hollingsworth leased a mailbox in Springfield,      Virginia under the alias of Charles and Maureen Drew and      Harold Turner.       Mr. Hollingsworth then obtained a birth certificate for      Charles Drew from the State of Georgia and had it sent to the      mailbox in Springfield, Virginia. Mr. Hollingsworth then      leased another mailbox under the alias of Charles and Mary      Drew in Arlington, Virginia. Mr. Holingsworth submitted an      application and received a social security card under the      alias Charles Drew Jr. by posing as the applicant's father.      Mr. Hollingsworth, accompanied by his spouse, applied for and      received a Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles      identification card in the name of Charles Drew. Using the      DMV identification card in the name of Charles Drew, Mr.      Hollingsworth applied for a U.S. Passport. It should be noted      that his wife, Mrs. Jaureen Hollingsworth, a DOD IG employee      at the time, was never implicated or charged in this      felonious activity. She was not a suspect in the      investigation by the U.S. State Department. Mr. Hollingsworth      stated to State Department law enforcement agents that he      procured approximately eight to ten false identify documents,      to include an international drivers license and a priest ID,      by means of mail order.       In April of 1995, U.S. State Department law enforcement      officials placed a photo of Mr. Hollingsworth in law      enforcement bulletins as an unidentified suspect in passport      fraud. the local Philadelphia office of DCIS notified DCIS      headquarters in Washington D.C. that a photo of Mr.      Hollingsworth was found in a bulletin. Officials at DCIS in      Washington D.C. notified Mr. Mancuso who is turn immediately      notified Inspector General Eleanor Hill. Mr. Mancuso was then      ordered by DOD IG Eleanor Hill to notify the State Department      Office of Inspector General.       [See Attachment #1--Sentencing memorandum date stamped 06/     04/96]       [See Attachment #2--State Department Investigative      Timeline]     Statements made by State Department law enforcement agent       On July 16, 1999, the Subcommittee Majority Staff      interviewed Sean O'Brien, Special Agent with the State      Department Diplomatic Security Service. Agent O'Brien was one      of the agents assigned to the Hollingsworth case. Agent      O'Brien stated that there were at least 12 overt acts of      fraud perpetrated by Mr. Hollingsworth over the course of      several years. Agent O'Brien felt that the actions of Mr.      Hollingsworth were disturbing in light of the fact that      passport fraud is usually committed in furtherance of a more      serious crime, and a credible motive had never been      established.       Mr. O'Brien added that family members of the deceased boy,      Charles Drew, whose identify was used by Mr. Hollingsworth,      were very upset and prepared to testify at trial. Agent      O'Brien also opined that various motions to dismiss the case      were delaying tactics used by Mr. Hollingsworth until he      reached his 50th birthday--when he could retire with law      enforcement benefits.       The State Department Supervisor of the Hollingsworth case,      Special Agent Robert Starnes, stated that DCIS management      initially refused to let him examine the contents of Mr.      Hollingsworth's government computer under the pretense that      Mr. Hollingsworth may have had personal and/or classified      material on a government computer. Despite possessing a Top      Secret security clearance, Agent Starnes had to raise the      possibility of a search warrant with DCIS management before      they acquiesced and allowed a consent search of the computer.       DCIS management assigned DCIS Agent Paul Tedesco as the      point of contact in this case for the State Department.      Relevant information regarding Mr. Hollingsworth's criminal      conduct was provided by State Department investigators      directly to DCIS Agent Tedesco during all criminal      proceedings. Agent Tedesco also provided certified court      documents to then Director of Operations and current Director      of DCIS John Keenan. These court documents described the      criminal conduct of Mr. Hollingsworth. Agent Tedesco stated      that DCIS management was kept fully informed of the criminal      conduct of Mr. Hollingsworth from the time of his confession      through sentencing.       In the experienced opinion of State Department Case Agent      Sean O'Brien, State Department Special Agent Case Supervisor      Starnes and DCIS Case Liaison Agent Paul Tedesco, this      fraudulent activity was most probably in furtherance of      another crime that was never discovered or proven.

[See Attachment #5--U.S. District Court Criminal Docket]       08/12/96: Larry J. Hollingsworth is notified by DOD DCIS of      a ``Proposed Removal'' and given thirty days to respond. [See      Attachment #6--DOD OIG notice of Proposed Removal dated 08/     12/96]       09/19/96: Larry J. Hollingsworth retires on his 50th      birthday citing a reason of ``pursuing other interests''.      [See Attachment #7--DOD Notice of Personnel Action form 50-B      dated 09/19/94]       09/20/96: Larry J. Hollingsworth's attorney notifies then      DOD Assistant Inspector General Mancuso that he waives his      right to appeal the removal. [See Attachment #8--Letter from      Hollingsworth's attorney to Mr. Mancuso dated 09/20/96]     DOD General Counsel claims conditional plea prevented removal          of Mr. Hollingsworth       On September 14, 1999, Mr. Mancuso and the Deputy General      Counsel (Inspector General), Mr. Kevin Flanagan, stated to      the Subcommittee that the reason Mr. Hollingsworth was never      removed and allowed to retire, was that his guilty plea was      ``conditional'' and that he could withdraw his plea at any      time at his own initiative.       The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 11(A)(2)      states; ``with the approval of the court and the consent of      the government, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of      guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right, on      appeal from the judgment, a review of the adverse      determination of any specified pretrial motion. A defendant      who prevails on appeal shall be allowed to withdraw the      plea.''       The plea agreement in this case acknowledges a conditional      plea by Mr. Hollingsworth reserving ``his right to appeal the      Court's adverse March 8, 1996 ruling denying defendant's      motion to suppress his statement to State Department      Agents''. The plea agreement also states; ``the defendant      knowingly waives his right to appeal any sentence.''       Therefore, Mr. Hollingsworth never had unilateral authority      to withdraw his plea at anytime, as Mr. Mancuso and DOD      General Counsel argued. Their reason for not terminating Mr.      Hollingsworth after conviction appears to be invalid.       [See Attachment #20--Rules of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(1)]       [See Attachment #21 Plea Agreement dated 03/15/96 page 3]       Mr. Hollingsworth was never removed by DOD and as stated in      the chronology, remains a convicted felon despite the      numerous motions to dismiss. Federal Law, DOD IG regulations,      legal counsel at the DOD Washington Headquarters Services      (WHS) and OPM General Counsel stated that Mr. Hollingsworth      could have been removed based on his criminal misconduct      alone. The misconduct must be proved with a ``preponderance      of the evidence'' and not ``beyond a     reasonable doubt.'' Preponderance of the evidence is a much      lower threshold than a criminal court procedure wherein      criminal conduct must be proved ``beyond a reasonable      doubt.''     Federal law states Mr. Hollingsworth could be dismissed          within 7 days       5 U.S.C. 7513, (b), regarding removals of federal employees      states:       1. At least 30 days advance written notice, unless there is      reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a      crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed,      stating the specific reasons for the proposed action.       2. A reasonable time, but not less than seven days, to      answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and      other documentary evidence in support of the answer. [See      Attachment #9--5 United States Code 7513]       The DOD Time Line cites this law as reason for a 60 day      delay in issuing a 30 day ``proposed removal.'' Mr.      Hollingsworth had already served a considerable amount of      time in jail before the proposed removal was issued.     DOD Inspector General Regulations state Mr. Hollingsworth          could have been terminated after Indictment.       IGDR 1400.4, Displinary and Adverse Action dated December      30, 1994, page 7, states an immediate removal can be      initiated ``when the agency has reasonable cause to believe      that an employee has committed a crime for which a sentence      of imprisonment may be imposed. Reasonable cause to believe      is not established by the mere fact either of an arrest or an      ongoing agency investigation of possible criminal misconduct.      A criminal indictment will usually constitute reasonable      cause.''       [See Attachment #10--IGDR--dated 12/30/94, Page 7]     DOD WHS Legal Counsel advises Mr. Hollingsworth may be          terminated after his guilty plea       On March 14, 1996, Gilda Goldsmith, legal counsel at the      DOD WHS, advised that ``the indefinite suspension, which      suspends Mr. Hollingsworth from duty until final disposition      of criminal charges and any administrative proceedings, does      not bar the agency from terminating him based on his guilty      plea . . . the agency could remove Mr. Hollingworth for both      the guilty plea and underlying conduct, but would have to      prove the conduct by a preponderance of the evidence if the      conviction is reversed.''       [See Attachment #11--DOD WHS Legal Counsel memo dated 03/     14/96]     OPM General Counsel cites other options available to DCIS          management       The Subcommittee Majority Staff requested the assistance of      OPM in determining whether Mr. Hollingsworth, a convicted      felon, was entitled to a federal law enforcement retirement      six months after conviction and two months after serving his      senence of jail on weekends. He received retirement credit      and remained in an employed status as Director of Internal      Affairs durng the six months in question to include two      months of jail time on weekends.       On July 20, 1999, DOD Personnel Director Donna Seracino      stated that Mr. Hollingsworth could not be immediately      removed after his guilty plea and felony conviction because      ``he had rights to due process under OPM guidelines''.       On September 13, 1999, OPM General Counsel Suzanne Seiden      stated in her legal opinion: ``Instead of seeking to remove      him because of the criminal conviction, it is possible that      DCIS appropriately could have charged him with, among other      things, an action under 5 U.S.C., 7513, on grounds of general      criminal misconduct or failure to maintain his security      clearance. Further, DCIS might have chosen to expedite his      removal following Mr. Hollingsworth's guilty plea''.       [See Attachment #12--OPM General Counsel opinion dated 09/     13/99]     Outstanding evaluation for Mr. Hollingsworth endorsed by          Director of DCIS Mancuso       On August 18, 1999, approximately three weeks after Mr.      Hollingsworth's home was searched and he confessed to at      least three years of felonious activity (07/27/95), Mr.      Mancuso signed and approved an ``outstanding'' performance      evaluation for Mr. Hollingsworth. Mr. Hollingsworth replied      on the evaluation form; ``I appreciate your comments on my      appraisal, especially in light of my recent actions.''       [See Attachment #13--Employee Performance rating signed by      Mr. Mancuso 08/18/95]     Mr. Mancuso places Mr. Hollingsworth on Paid Leave       On November 22, 1995, Mr. Mancuso decided to hold      indefinite suspension of Mr. Hollingsworth in abeyance and      advised ``Mr. Hollingsworth he would be carried on sick leave      for any period of time that was supported by acceptable      medical documentation, carried on annual leave as long as he      had an annual leave balance and requested such leave, and      that the indefinite suspension would become effective when      his annual leave was exhausted and he no longer met the      requirements for sick leave.''       [See Attachment #4--Time line provided by DOD 7/27/95-9/20/     96]     Mr. Mancuso advises Mr. Hollingsworth to meet with a          physician       On November 22, 1995, ``Mr. Mancuso advises Mr.      Hollingsworth to schedule an appointment with the Independent      Medical Evaluation (IME) physician. The agency would approve      sick leave through November 30, 1995, and any request for      additional sick leave would be held in abeyance pending      receipt and review of the additional medical documentation.''       [See Attachment #4--Time line provided by DOD 7/27/95-9/20/     96]     Assistant United States Attorney opposes use of physician as          Defense Witness       On March 8, 1996, Assistant United States Attorney Thomas      G. Connolly for the Eastern District of Virginia stated in      his legal brief to the U.S. District Court in regards to the      testimony of the IME physician for the defense:       ``This testimony is not relevant to a determination of any      issue to be tried in this case. It is a patent attempt at      jury nulifcation by presenting evidence in the hope of making      the defendant sympathetic to the jury. It is a backdoor      attempt to raise issues of mental condition prohibited by      law; and it is prejudicial, confusing, and misleading. This      court should exclude any proposed psychiatric testimony from      evidence at trial.''       [See Attachment #14--Government's motion to exclude      psychiatric testimony page 2]     Mr. Seldon, Attorney for Mr. Hollingsworth, contacts DOD          Employee Relations concerning retirement       On February 7, 1996, the defense attorney for Mr.      Hollingsworth contacts DOD Employee Relations Specialist      Linda Martz. She states the attorney said ``he wanted to      ensure that his client was technically on the agency rolls. I      said yes. Mr. Seldon said the U.S. Attorney wanted his client      to plead guilty to one felony count. He said he understood      that if the criminal matter ended and Mr. Hollingsworth was      convicted, removal was probable. He asked if that was      correct. I said most likely. He said his client's hope was to      stay on the agency rolls until September 1996 at which time      he would retire. I said he could retire now, but not under      law enforcement. Mr. Seldon said he understood that, but      there would be a substantial reduction.''       [See Attachment #15--Memorandum for the record of Linda      Martz dated 02/07/96]     Defendant Hollingsworth makes motion to dismiss case       On March 12, 1996, Mr. Hollingsworth's defense attorney      made a motion in U.S. District Court to dismiss the charges,      citing Mr. Mancuso's request for medical information. He said      Mr. Mancuso had ``directed him to provide sufficient medical      information which will be reviewed by the medical consultant      for the Office of Inspector General, to assist him in making      a decision on the proposed suspension.''       [See Attachment #16--Motion to dismiss indictment page 3      section 7]     Assistant United States Attorney comments on sick leave          status and use of a physician       On March 12, 1996, Assistant United States Attorney Thomas      G. Connolly for the Eastern District of Virginia stated in      his legal brief to U.S. District Court:       ``The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment is not      only untimely, it is frivolous . . . The government (in the      form of the United States Attorneys Office) was not party to      any negotiations concerning the defendants sick leave. In      fact, the first time we head about this was on March 7, 1996,      when defense counsel faxed us a letter detailing Dr.      Holland's findings.''       ``The United States Attorneys Office had no opportunity,      whatsoever to be heard in the negotiations between Mr.      Hollingsworth's lawyers and the Department of Defense      concerning whether Mr. Hollingsworth should be granted sick      leave because he was allegedly suffering from depression a      year-and-a-half after he had committed the crimes and 4      months after he had been caught.''       [See Attachment #17--Opposition to Defendant's Motion to      Dismiss page 3]     Attorney for Mr. Hollingsworth contacts DOD Employee          Relations one day after motion to dismiss and complements          Mr. Mancuso for assistance.       On March 13, 1996, Linda Martz, DOD Employee Relations      Specialists took a call from Mr. Seldon, attorney for Mr.      Hollingsworth. She stated; ``Mr. Seldon wanted to know what      Larry's sick and annual leave balances were. . . . I went on      to explain that when he was indicted the situation took on      another look. He said he understood and believed Mr. Mancuso      did what he could be help Mr. Hollingsworth''.       [See Attachment #18--Linda Martz memo dated 03/13/96]     Mr. Mancuso acknowledges Mr. Hollingsworth's criminal conduct          was perpetrated in furtherance of another unknown crime       On September 14, 1999, during a Subcommittee Majority Staff      interview regarding the criminal misconduct of Mr.      Hollingsworth, Mr. Mancuso stated he now believes that      logically, the criminal misconduct of Mr. Hollingsworth      appeared to be in furtherance of another crime.     Mr. Mancuso writes letter to sentencing judge on behalf of          Mr. Hollingsworth       Mr. Mancuso wrote a letter dated April 29, 1996, to      sentencing Judge Ellis on official DOD Assistant Inspector      General stationary. Mr. Mancuso wrote this letter ``on behalf      of Mr. Hollingsworth . . . one of the few individuals in whom      I placed complete confidence and trust.'' In writing the      letter, Mr. Mancuso asked the judge to consider extenuating      circumstances. For example, he told     the judge that Mr. Hollingsworth took a half day's leave to      file the fraudulent passport application. Mr. Mancuso said he      was not surprised by this action. He said: ``Mr.      Hollingsworth could have come and gone as he pleased,'' but      he ``took leave to commit a felony.'' Mr. Mancuso went on to      say: ``To this day, there is no evidence that Mr.      Hollingsworth has ever done anything improper relating to his      duties and responsibilities as a DCIS agent and manager.''       In concluding the letter, Mr. Mancuso added: ``I do ask,      however, that you consider all these things as well as his      stated remorse and acceptance of responsibility for his      actions . . . it is our intention to consider removal action      against him after the conclusion of the criminal charges. In      this regard, I would ask that you consider the severity of      these administrative actions as you pronounce sentencing.''       The letter was signed; ``Sincerely, Donald Mancuso,      Director, Defense Criminal Investigative Service''.       [See Attachment #19--Letter from Mr. Mancuso to Judge Ellis      dated 04/29/96]     Mr. Mancuso comments on letter to Judge Ellis       In a Majority Staff interview on September 14, 1999, Mr.      Mancuso claimed that the stationary used in the letter to      Judge Ellis was ``personal, bought with my own money'' and      not official DOD Inspector General stationary. It was pointed      out to Mr. Mancuso that the letterhead had a government seal      which contained the words; ``Inspector General--Department of      Defense.'' In addition, Mr. Mancuso signed the letter in his      official capacity as an Assistant Inspector General. The      letter was made a part of the sentencing report by Judge      Ellis.       [See Attachment #19--Letter from Mr. Mancuso to Judge Ellis      dated 04/29/96]       [See Attachment #1--Sentencing memorandum date stamped 06/     04/96]     Assistant United States Attorney comments on lack of remorse          by Mr. Hollingsworth       On March 12, 1996, Assistant United States Attorney Thomas      G. Connolly for the Eastern District of Virginia stated in      his legal brief to U.S. District Court:       ``The defendant's appreciation of the wrongfulness of his      conduct in April of 1994 has never been determined in any      hearing at which the United States Attorneys Office (or any      other government agency, including the Department of Defense)      was a party.''       [See Attachment #17--Opposition to Defendant's Motion to      Dismiss page 3]     Assistant United States Attorney comments on Mr.          Hollingsworth's mental state       ``Mr. Hollingsworth's condition, whatever it is, is not      found in DSM IV, the 886-page tome that lists every      psychosis, neurosis, syndrome, and personality disorder known      to man.''       [See Attachment #14--Government's motion to exclude      psychiatric testimony page 5]     Mr. Dupree, former Deputy Director of DCIS, stated Mr.          Hollingsworth was considered a cooperative defendant by          DCIS management       On August 24, 1999, Mr. Dupree, a former Deputy Director of      DCIS, and under the direct supervision of Mr. Mancuso, was      interviewed by the Majority Staff. Mr. Dupree reviewed      proposals to remove DCIS employees for misconduct based on      internal investigations. He characterized Mr. Hollingsworth      as a ``cooperative defendant''. Mr. Dupree stated that it      would have been easier to remove Mr. Hollingsworth if he had      misused a government vehicle.     9/13/96--Mr. Hollingsworth requests extension on proposal          removal       On August 23, 1996, Mr. Hollingsworth asks Mr. Mancuso for      an extension of his proposed removal pending an oral reply to      be made on 09/13/96.       [See Attachment #4 Time line provided by DOD 7/27/95-9/20/     96]     Mr. Mancuso grants requested extension and schedules oral          response for 09/23/96, four days after Mr.          Hollingsworth's 50th Birthday       On August 26, 1996, Mr. Mancuso grants the extension      request and schedules the oral reply for September 23, 1996,      the first available date because Mr. Mancuso claimed that he      would ``be on travel much of September and will not be      available to hear Mr. Hollingsworth's oral response'' until      that date.       A review of Mr. Mancuso's travel vouchers suggests that the      projected travel conflicts--outlined in his August 26, 1996      memo--never materialized and that he would have been      available to hear the case at any point during the month of      September--with several minor exceptions. During an interview      on September 14, 1999, Mr. Mancuso was asked if he was aware      of Mr. Hollingsworth's birthday when he signed the August 26,      1996 memo. Initially, he denied having that knowledge, but      with coaching from Deputy DOD General Counsel Flanagan, he      admitted that he did, in fact, know that Mr. Hollingsworth's      50th birthday was in September 1996.       [See Attachment #4 Time line provided by DOD 7/27/95-9/20/     96]     Convicted Felon Mr. Hollingsworth retires with full federal          law enforcement retirement benefits totaling over          $750,000.00       On September 19, 1996, Mr. Hollingsworth retired on his      50th birthday and first date of eligibility for federal law      enforcement retirement, citing his desire ``to pursue other      interests.'' Mr. Hollingsworth currently receives full      federal law enforcement retirement benefits.       [See Attachment #7 notice of personnel action]       According to OPM, if Mr. Hollingsworth had been removed      immediately after his felony conviction, he would have been      entitled to an annuity commencing at age 62. Since Mr.      Hollingsworth was not removed by DOD after his conviction and      was allowed to retire six months after his conviction at age      50, Mr. Hollingsworth immediately began receiving a federal      law enforcement yearly annuity of over $60,000. Not including      cost of living adjustments, these annuities will total over      750,000.00 for 1996-2008--annuities he would not have      received had DCIS management exercised other more reasonable      options.       On September 20, 1996, Mr. Hollingsworth's attorney      ``waives his right to any further proceedings in connection      with the proposed removal due to his retirement.''       [See Attachment #8--Letter from Hollingsworth Attorney      dated 09/20/96]     Mr. Mancuso characterizes State Department Investigators as          ``Horse's Asses''       On September 14, 1999 the Majority Staff interviewed Mr.      Mancuso to review his role in Mr. Hollingsworth's retirement.       Mr. Mancuso claimed that State Department investigators did      not brief DCIS on the details of the criminal case against      Mr. Hollingsworth until after sentencing. The State      Department's failure to share this information in a timely      manner was another reason for delay in removal action against      Mr. Hollingsworth. Mr. Mancuso characterized State Department      investigators in this case as ``Horses' Asses.''     DCIS Agent Tedesco keeps DCIS management informed and          complements performance of State Department investigators          in the Hollingsworth case       As stated previously, DCIS Agent Tedesco provided all      relevant certified court documents to DCIS Director of      Operations John Keennan throughout the judicial proceedings      against Mr. Hollingsworth. These documents were passed to      senior DCIS management as they became available. These      documents fully described the criminal conduct for which Mr.      Hollingsworth was being prosecuted. Agent Tedesco described      his relationship with State Department investigators as      ``excellent,'' resulting in a timely, accurate, and      professional flow of information between the two law      enforcement agencies. Agent Tedesco refutes any assertion      that DCIS management was not informed during any part of the      judicial process.     DOD Inspector General Eleanor Hill orders Mr. Hollingsworth          to be removed ``as soon as legally possible''       Eleanor Hill was the DOD Inspector General during the      Hollingsworth criminal procedures. On September 21, 1999,      Eleanor Hill stated to the Subcommittee Majority Staff that      shortly after Mr. Hollingsworth confessed, she had ordered IG      personnel, including Mr. Mancuso, ``to remove Hollingsworth      as soon as legally possible.''     DOD Inspector General Eleanor Hill was unaware of several          decisions by Mr. Mancuso regarding Mr. Hollingsworth       Ms. Hill stated she was unaware that DCIS management      initially refused to allow State Department investigators a      consent search of Mr. Hollingsworth's government computer.       Ms. Hill stated she was unaware that Mr. Mancuso endorsed      an outstanding evaluation of Mr. Hollingsworth after his      confession to criminal conduct.       Ms. Hill stated she was unaware that Mr. Mancuso wrote a      letter as an Assistant Inspector General on official      stationary to the sentencing judge on Mr. Hollingsworth's      behalf.

Plea Agreement dated 03/15/96         walinski: criminal investigator, dcis internal affairs       Mr. Matthew A. Walinski worked at the Defense Criminal      Investigative Service (DCIS) as a criminal investigator (GS-     1811) from August 1987 through 1998. Since January 1999, he      has been employed as a criminal investigator (special agent)      in the Office of     the Inspector General at the Department of the Treasury. His      assigned duties at the Treasury Department include      investigating employee misconduct and fraud. Although      Walinski was promoted to the grade of GS-14 at DCIS in August      1991, he accepted a reduction in grade to GS-13 at the      Treasury Department. He told the Subcommittee on September 8,      1999 that he left DCIS because he was informed by the DCIS      Director Keenan that his goal of becoming a manager was      unattainable.     DCIS Internal Affairs       In June 1999, the Subcommittee received a complaint from a      former DCIS agent that Walinski had falsified official      reports of investigation while employed at DCIS. The      complaints about the falsification of reports by Walinski      relate to investigations he conducted while assigned to DCIS'      Program Review and Analysis Directorate. This office is known      informally as ``internal affairs.'' Walinski was assigned to      internal affairs from August 1991 until July 1994.       Throughout Walinski's tour of duty in the office of      internal affairs, the unit was headed by Mr. Larry J.      Hollingsworth. As Director of internal affairs, Hollingsworth      held a key position in DCIS's organizational structure--along      with the Director (Mancuso), Deputy Director (Dupree), and      the Director of Operations (Keenan). Though important      internal affairs was a small office. It normally consisted of      three investigators (Hollingsworth, Bonnar, and Walinski).      However, the office could be augmented--as needed--with      special agents from the field.       Hollingsworth directed the DCIS office of internal affairs      from April 1991 until his retirement in September 1996,      according to a document provided by the IG's office. That      Hollingsworth was technically listed as the director of      internal affairs until his retirement in September 1996      defies understanding, since Hollingsworth was convicted of a      felony (18 USC 1001) in March 1996 and sentenced to 30 days      in jail on the weekends in June 1996.       The authorities, who conducted the investigation (Bureau of      Diplomatic Security) of Hollingsworth's criminal activities,      believe Hollingsworth committed about 12 overt acts of fraud      between October 1992 and April 1994. The 12 alleged overt      acts of fraud committed by Hollingsworth were perpetrated      while he was the director of DCIS' office of internal      affairs. Hollingsworth's criminal conduct while director of      internal affairs must inevitably raise questions about the      overall integrity of the work performed by this office while      Hollingsworth was director.       Mr. Thomas J. Bonnar was the Assistant Director of Program      Review. Bonnar was Mr. Walinski's immediate supervisor.       While Hollingsworth was in charge of the day-to-day      operations of the office of internal review, the DCIS      Director, Mr. Donald Mancuso, exercised overall management      control of all internal investigations. As DCIS Director,      Mancuso was the person chiefly responsible for the conduct of      internal inquiries. His position description (DDES0466)      states under ``Major Duties,'' paragraph (1): Mancuso      ``provides staffing and direction for the conduct of internal      investigations, as needed.'' Once allegations were received      about potential misconduct by DCIS agents, Mancuso and the      Deputy DCIS Director, Mr. William Dupree, would usually      decide if an inquiry would be conducted, and what its scope      would be. As a rule, those decisions were reached in      consultation with Hollingsworth.       Mancuso and Dupree would normally receive periodic      briefings or status reports on each internal investigation      still in progress. If a problem arose during an inquiry,      Mancuso and Dupree would know about it. When Walinski      completed his report of investigation, it would usually be      forwarded up the chain of command by Hollingsworth to an      Administrative Review Board (ARB). The ARB then made      recommendations. Either Mancuso or Dupree would review those      recommendations and make the final decision on what--if any--     disciplinary action was needed.       While assigned to DCIS' office of internal review, Walinski      was tasked to complete about 30 ``administrative inquiries''      concerning allegations of misconduct by DCIS agents. The      complaints about the falsification of his reports pertain to      two ``administrative inquiries'' conducted by Walinski in      1993 and 1994 as follows: (1) the tax fraud case involving      Special Agent (SA) William G. Steakley--Administrative      Inquiry 91; and (2) Stolen gun case involving Special Agent      (SA) Stephen J. Johanson--Administrative Inquiry 108.       The purpose of this portion of our review was to assess the      validity of the allegations against Walinski and to search      for the answers to three questions: (1) Did Walinski falsify      his reports on the Steakley and Johanson cases? (2) If      Walinski falsified reports, did senior management at DCIS      know about it? And (3) If DCIS management knew about it, did      management take appropriate corrective action?       To answer the three questions, the Majority Staff examined      all pertinent General Counsel, IG, and U.S. Office of Special      Counsel (OSC) files, including reports of investigations and      E-mails. The staff also conducted a number of separate      interviews.     The Case of Mr. Steakley       On May 11, 1993, Walinski opened the tax evasion case      against Steakley. This was Administrative Inquiry 91. It was      opened ``based on information that SA Steakley made      misleading statements to the DCIS payroll support activity      regarding his actual place of residence in an apparent effort      to circumvent his state income tax obligations.''       [See Attachment 1--page 1 of Report of Investigation (ROI)]       The foundation for Walinski's ROI on the Steakley tax fraud      case was his interview with a payroll specialist at Bolling      AFB, Washington, D.C.--Mrs. Nancy Gianino. At the time,      Gianino was responsible for handling all DCIS payroll      matters. Walinski's official witness interview report, dated      June 1, 1993, states that Gianino was interviewed at Bolling      AFB on May 21, 1993 ``concerning her knowledge of the payroll      deductions of SA Steakley.''     Gianino Interview       Since the Gianino interview is such a crucial piece of      evidence in evaluating the accuracy of Walinski's reports, it      is quoted here in its entirety:       ``Mrs. Gianino said that sometime in late November 1991 she      received a letter from SA Steakley which instructed her to      discontinue payroll withholding on SA Steakley's salary by      the Commonwealth of Virginia. After receiving the letter,      which is appended as attachment 1, she contacted SA Steakley      via telephone and he informed her that he was being      transferred and had, in conjunction with his transfer,      established residency in the State of Tennessee. At the time      she thought it was strange that an employee who lived and      worked in Virginia could move his residency to another state,      but because SA Steakley told her he was being transferred in      December 1991 she was not concerned. On December 11, 1991,      Mrs. Gianino changed SA Steakley's state tax code from      Virginia to Tennessee. Mrs. Gianino stated that very shortly      after her discussions with SA Steakley she became very ill      and was off work for an extended period of time. Because of      her illness she was unable to follow-up concerning SA      Steakley and his move as would be her normal practice.      Normally, Mrs. Gianino makes sure that state income taxes are      withheld from the state where the individual's duty      assignment is located, especially a state as strict as      California.       In the Spring of 1993, after her return from the extended      illness, Mrs. Gianino started to reconcile the payroll      records for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.      During this reconciliation she reviewed and compared the      permanent duty station location for each employee from their      Notification of Personnel Action Standard Form 50; the state      code of each employee utilized by the Air Force for      deductions for state income taxes; and the current mailing      address for each employee. She then discovered that SA      Steakley was permanently assigned to California, had a state      tax code for Tennessee, and a mailing address in Virginia.      Mrs. Gianino stated that she brought this discrepancy to the      attention of DCIS management as the Air Force considers this      situation to be unacceptable under applicable payroll      guidelines.       Mrs. Gianino said that in retrospect she felt that both SA      Steakley's letter and the subsequent telephone call were      vague and very misleading.''       [See Amendment 1, Witness Interview/Gianino]     DCIS Contacts State Tax Authorities       Based on the information provided by Gianino, DCIS      officials, including Walinski and Hollingsworth, contacted      the departments of taxation in the states of California and      Virginia to determine whether Steakley had unpaid income tax      liabilities in either state. In addition, they contacted the      State of Tennessee to determine whether Steakley was a      resident of that state.       DCIS made repeated attempts to obtain information on      Steakley's tax obligations in California and Virginia.      Letters were sent to the tax authorities in both states on      July 27, 1993, July 30, 1993 and December 2, 1993. The      letters were followed up by telephone calls.     Access To Tax Records Blocked       In a memo dated December 23, 1993, Walinski reported that      he was unable to obtain any information from Virginia on      Steakley's tax liabilities. Walinski reported:       On December 22, 1993, an official in Virginia's Department      of Taxation informed DCIS: The Commonwealth of Virginia will      not acknowledge or provide documentation to generic tax      liability issues unless the writer of the correspondence is      the Commonwealth of Virginia taxpayer . . . . . Per      Commonwealth of Virginia Statute the information in question      could not be released to DCIS because DCIS was not the      taxpayer in question.''       [See Amendment 1, Contact Report with Department of      Taxation, Commonwealth of Virginia]       In an E-mail message to his supervisor, Bonnar, on July 8,      1994, Walinski reported that identical restrictions applied      to access on individual tax liability data in California.      Walinski reported:       On May 5, 1994, California tax authorities informed DCIS:      By law, California can not release any information concerning      an individual taxpayer without a court order or a release      from the individual in question.''       [See Attachment 1, Contact Report with California Franchise      Tax Board]     DCIS Continues to Pursue Tax Data       Even though DCIS was prohibited by state law from obtaining      information on Steakley's state tax liabilities, DCIS      Director Mancuso and Hollingsworth pressed     Walinski to find a way to obtain that information.       During an interview on August 24, 1999, Hollingsworth      reacted strongly to the suggestion that DCIS lacks authority      to obtain information on Steakley's unpaid state tax      liabilities. He insisted that DCIS had all the authority it      needed to get the job done. He said: ``I could have done that      investigation.'' Both Mancuso and Hollingsworth were formerly      employed criminal investigators at the Internal Revenue      Service.       Mancuso's E-mail to Hollingsworth on July 7, 1994      demonstrates something more than a passing interest in the      Steakley tax evasion case. Mancuso's message conveys a sense      of urgency on the need to obtain Steakley's state tax data.      It also seems to suggest that DOD legal counsel may have      advised DCIS not to pursue tax fraud charges against      Steakley. Mancuso made this request:       ``Please copy me on all transmittals between our office and      the states of California and Virginia relative to Mr.      Steakley's taxes. It has been a ridiculous amount of time      since you told me that we were waiting to hear back from      them. At the time of our last discussion I directed you to      document your contacts so that I could refer to them if some      quick action did not ensue. I've spoken to OGC [Office of the      General Counsel] and I think I can get their support despite      Perkul [Deputy General Counsel, Washington Headquarters      Services] and crew.''       ``I'd also like to start making phone calls to the two      states and finding out what they're doing with our      information.''       [See Attachment 1, E-mail from Mancuso to Bonnar and      Hollingsworth]       When asked by an independent DOD investigator, Mr. Greg      McClelland, why DCIS would pursue tax charges against      Steakley when prohibited by state law from obtaining that      information, Mancuso replied: ``We'll pursue anything that      goes to the integrity of the agent.''       [See Attachment 2, Greg McClelland interview, March 13,      1997, p. 35]       Mancuso's reply to McClelland's question in March 1997      suggests that he may have known that DCIS lacked authority to      gain access to Steakley state tax records. During an      interview on September 14, 1999, Mancuso provided a      completely different answer to essentially the same question.      He was asked why DCIS would pursue charges against Steakley      in an area--individual state tax obligations--where it had no      authority or jurisdiction to operate. He claimed ignorance.      He replied: ``I did not know that DCIS was not authorized      access to individual state income tax data.''     Walinski Complains about Pressure on Tax Data       One day after Mancuso's E-mail to Hollingsworth--July 8,      1994, Walinski complained about the pressure from Mancuso to      his supervisor, Bonnar. In this E-mail, Walinski stated:       ``I do not understand what he [Mancuso] wants us to do. . .      . Without a release from Steakley, which both he and his      attorney(s) stated will not be provided or a court order of      some kind there is nothing else that I can do. I am sorry!''       [See Attachment 1, Walinski E-Mail to Bonnar]     Steakley's Tax Attorney Responds       DCIS attempted to interview SA Steakley's tax accountant/     lawyer, Mr. John T. Ambrose, but Steakley refused to waive      attorney-client privilege, and Mr. Ambrose refused to be      interviewed. However, after further discussion, Steakley's      tax attorney provided DCIS with a letter addressing various      tax issues bearing on the potential charges against his      client. The letter was dated February 22, 1994 and hand      delivered to Dupree. Mr. Ambrose stated:       ``For tax year 1992, based on a determination that Mr.      Steakley was a resident of Tennessee, I prepared three (3)      state income tax returns for the Steakleys, one resident      state income tax return for Virginia and two (2) nonresident      state income tax returns for Virginia and California. In      determining how to complete those returns, I reviewed the tax      instructions published by the respective state tax agencies      and consulted with personnel at those agencies.''       [See Attachment 3]     Tennessee Residency       A DCIS records check in Tennessee did show that SA Steakley      owned two homes in the state; was registered to vote there      and, in fact, voted in the November 1992 general elections;      and applied for and received a state driver's license. Mr.      Walinski's report of investigation contains the general      guidelines in Tennessee tax law that are used as the standard      for determining whether a person can claim they are a      resident of the state. According to the information contained      in Walinski's report, Steakley appears to meet most of the      state residency requirements.     No Proof of Tax Fraud       At the conclusion of Walinski's investigation, DCIS had no      credible evidence or proof that Steakley had unpaid tax      liabilities in either California or Virginia.       In our interview on September 8, 1999, Walinski      acknowledged that his report of investigation on the tax      evasion case against Steakley was inconclusive and      unsubstantiated.       Walinski characterized the tax fraud case against Steakley      as ``an unresolved case.'' The investigation had serious      shortcomings: ``We couldn't nail him,'' Walinski said.      Walinski's inconclusive findings are not apparent in his      report. In fact, the report suggests DCIS had an airtight      case against Steakley. Walinski also claims Mancuso and      Dupree were aware of the flaw. Despite these known      deficiencies, Walinski said that he was ``not surprised''      to learn that the ARB Board had subsequently recommended      that Steakley ``be removed from his position at DCIS'' for      failing to meet his state tax obligations--a      recommendation based on Walinski's incomplete report.      ``That's just the way DCIS did things,'' he said.       In our interview on September 14, 1999, Mancuso      contradicted Walinski's assertion that management knew the      tax case against Steakley was weak. Mancuso insisted that he      was not aware of the lack of credible evidence to support tax      evasion charges that were eventually brought against      Steakley. He said: ``I didn't know about that.''     Decisions on Tax Investigation Questioned       The staff does not understand why Mancuso and Dupree      decided to pursue the tax evasion charges given the      prohibitions in place that effectively blocked access to      Steakley's state tax records. If DCIS believed that this      matter needed further investigation, it should have referred      the matter to an external organization that had the authority      and jurisdiction to examine those records and determine if      Steakley had unpaid tax liabilities. In the absence of that      information, the tax evasion charge would be unjustified.     ARB Board Recommends Removal       The DCIS ARB met on February 7, 1994 to consider the      Steakley tax evasion case.       In a memo dated March 7, 1994, the ARB recommended that SA      Steakley ``be removed from his position with DCIS for      violating Executive Order 12674.'' The Board concluded that      ``SA Steakley has a tax liability to the State of California      and he took overt steps to avoid paying this tax from      December 1991 through February 1993.'' The Board's report was      signed by James J. Hagen, Special Agent in Charge.       [See Attachment 4, page 2]     Tax Fraud Charges       On August 4, 1994, after reviewing the ARB's      recommendations, DCIS management issued Steakley a ``Notice      of Proposed Suspension.'' The notice was signed by Mr. John      F. Keenan, Director of Investigative Operations. Mr. Keenan      was also previously employed by the Internal Revenue Service      as a special agent. He is the Director of DCIS today.       Mr. Keenan rejected the ARB's recommendation to remove      Steakley. Instead, he proposed that SA Steakley be      ``suspended without pay for fourteen (14) calendar days.''      The proposed suspension was based on: (1) SA Steakley's      failure to pay income taxes in the states of California and      Virginia; and (2) SA Steakley's failure to comply with      Executive Order 12730 [Section 101, paragraph (1)] that      requires employees to pay federal, state, and local taxes--     ``that are imposed by law.''       [See Attachment 5, page 1]       In presenting their case against Steakley, both Mr. Keenan      and the ARB relied heavily on Walinski's reported interview      of Gianino. Key portions of that interview were incorporated      in both memos. For example, after reviewing the      communications between Steakley and Gianino in 1991 about      payroll deductions--as summarized in Walinski's report,      Keenan's memo cites her alleged reconciliation of DCIS      payroll records as the event that triggered the whole      investigation:       ``In the spring of 1993, during a reconciliation of payroll      records for DCIS, it was discovered that you were permanently      assigned to California, had a state tax code for Tennessee,      and a mailing address in Virginia. This discrepancy was      brought to the attention of DCIS management as the Air Force      considers this situation to be unacceptable under applicable      payroll guidelines.       [See Attachment 5, page 2]     Adjudication--Charges Dropped       On October 25, 1994, Mancuso's deputy, Dupree, informed      Steakley that the tax fraud charges against him would be      dropped.       In a memo addressed to Steakley, Mr. Dupree attempted to      provide an explanation for his decision to drop the charges:       ``I have considered the written response submitted by your      representative, Mr. Luciano Cerasi, as well as the oral      response presented by you and Mr. Cerasi on October 20, 1994.      Based on the information you provided concerning the filing      date of October 15 for the state of California, I have      decided that the charges are not substantiated. Therefore, it      is my decision to overturn the proposal to suspend you for 14      days.''       [See Attachment 6]       Dupree's explanation seems to suggest that the charges were      dropped because the California's state tax filing deadline      had not yet arrived. His explanation is difficult to      comprehend. Senior DCIS officials had consistently claimed      that Steakley's misconduct was ``an integrity issue.'' For      example, in his memo dated August 4, 1994, Keenan told      Steakley:       ``I find you have violated the trust placed in you as a      employee of the OIG [Office of the Inspector General].''       [See Attachment 5, page 3]       It very difficult to reconcile Dupree's explanation for      dropping the charges with the questions raised about      Steakley's integrity--particularly since Dupree's memo was      signed ten days after the California filing deadline had      passed.     FLEOA's Allegations Against Walinski       During the adjudication process on tax fraud charges,      Steakley was represented by an attorney with the Federal Law      Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), Mr. Luciano A.      Cerasi.       As Steakley's defense counsel, Cerasi directed a 10-page      letter to Dupree in response to the proposed notice of      suspension issued to Steakley in August 1994. Cerasi's letter      was hand-delivered to Dupree on September 15, 1994. Cerasi      argued that ``the proposed adverse action against SA Steakley      must be rescinded due to a lack of preponderant evidence to      support the charges.''       In offering a spirited defense of his client, Cerasi, who      represents rank and file agents, also raised explosive      allegations about the accuracy of the investigative report      underlying the tax evasion charges. He alleged that      Walinski's report contained ``false, misleading, and      fabricated investigative material.''       Cerasi alleged that Walinski had ``fabricated the interview      in another [Johanson] case.'' He alleged that Walinski      ``completely fabricated the results of his interview with      Mrs. Nancy Gianino.'' He referred to Walinski as      ``management's pit bull.'' He said Walinski was ``willing to      fabricate investigative information to destroy the career of      a subject of an investigation.'' Cerasi urged Dupree to re-     open the case and re-investigate the entire matter.       [See Attachment 7, pages 2 and 3]       Cerasi's allegations about Walinski's report on the      Steakley case in September 1994 followed allegations and      complaints, which surfaced two months earlier, about      Walinski's report on the Johanson stolen gun case. The      Johanson case is discussed in the next section of this      report.     Steakley's Request for Re-Investigation       On October 20, 1994, both Cerasi and Steakley were given an      opportunity to present an oral response to the tax evasion      charges. During the oral rebuttal session in Dupree's office,      Steakley followed up on Cerasi's written request for a      ``reinvestigation of this whole Walinski file.'' Steakley      requested ``an internal investigation of SA Walinski's      actions.'' Steakley stated once again ``he had proof that SA      Walinski had fabricated the results of the administrative      inquiry involving his state income taxes.''       [See Attachments 8, page 1]     Steakley's ``Proof''       The ``proof'' referred to by Steakley was a taped telephone      conversation he had with Gianino on September 8, 1994 about      Walinski's reported interview of her on May 21, 1993. This      tape was subsequently provided to and transcribed by the DOD      IG, and a copy of the transcription is located in the files      of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC).       The Majority Staff reviewed the tape transcription in the      OSC files.       Gianino's statements on this tape appear to indicate that      Walinski fabricated the entire Gianino interview. Steakley      read her Walinski's report of interview. She said that every      statement in Walinski's report, which was attributed to her,      was ``not true.'' She never had an extended illness, and her      leave records would prove it. She said Walinski made several      visits to her office to examine Steakley's file. She gave him      the file, and he took notes from the file. [Walinski probably      made these visits in March or April 1993 when checking      Steakley's time and attendance records during the      investigation of Steakley's accident with a government      vehicle in Administrative Inquiry 86]. At the conclusion of      the tape, Gianino said: ``Walinski came over here with his      badge and puts false accusations in his report. How am I ever      going to trust anybody coming over here [from that office]      again.''       [See Attachment 2, Telephone Conversation between William      G. Steakley and Nancy Gianino, September 8, 1994--Tape      Transcription, page 78]     DCIS Rejects Request for Re-Investigation       Except for what appears to be an exchange of perfunctory      phone calls in 1995, requests for an independent review of      Walinski's report were largely ignored--and finally      dismissed--by senior DCIS management. Another three years      would pass before Steakley's allegations about Walinski would      be subjected to an independent review.     IG Request for Independent Review       The independent review was triggered by a series of letters      from Steakley to Ms. Eleanor Hill, DOD IG, and to Senator      Fred Thompson. These letters were dated February 9, 1996 and      March 12, 1996. In these letters, Steakley renewed his      allegations that ``Walinski and Hollingsworth had ``prepared      fabricated reports.'' They had ``falsely accused him of tax      fraud,'' he alleged. These letters also put a new twist on      the allegations. Steakley now alleged that ``Walinski stated      directly that the entire matter was directed by Mancuso and      Dupree.''       [See Attachment 9, Steakley letters to Hill and Sen.      Thompson multiple pages]     DOD IG Refers Case to PCIE       Since Steakley's allegations were ``long-standing in nature      and involve a number of individuals in various parts of the      IG organization,'' Hill concluded that her office was not      capable of conducting ``an objective internal investigation      of the allegations.'' She said it simply was ``not      feasible.'' Consequently, on May 23, 1996, she referred the      entire matter to the President's Council on Integrity and      Efficiency (PCIE) for further review.       [See Attachment 10, Hill's letters to PCIE and Senator      Thompson, May 23, 1996, page 1]     PCIE Response       On October 16, 1996--five months after Hill's request was      made, the PCIE returned the case to the DOD IG ``for      appropriate handling,'' because Steakley's complaints      concerned IG employees--not the IG herself. [Attachment 10,      PCIE letter to Hill, page 2] Following another request from      the DOD IG on February 20, 1997, the Integrity Committee of      the PCIE agreed to review Steakley's allegations. In her      final request, Hill again expressed frustration over her      inability to conduct an independent review: ``Our attempts to      conduct an impartial internal inquiry have been hampered by      the increasing number of senior managers who have recused      themselves as a result of the growing allegations, including      the Director [Mancuso] of the office which would be      investigating this matter internally.''       [See Attachment 10, PCIE letter to Hill, October 16, 1996]     Case Referred to OSC       On June 3, 1997, the case was finally referred to OSC for      investigation.       [See Attachment 10, Hill memo to PCIE, February 20, 1997;      OSC letter to DOD IG, June 3, 1997; IC letter to PCIE,      January 8, 1999, page 2]     OSC Report and Conclusions       On July 21, 1998, the OSC completed a report on Steakley's      allegations about senior DCIS officials. The OSC report      focused primarily on prohibited employment practices and not      whether Walinski had falsified official reports on      investigation.       Despite a mountain of evidence pointing to a number of      unresolved issues, the OSC notified DOD in December 1998 that      Steakley's allegations ``were without merit,'' and the case      was closed in January 1999.       [See Attahcment 10, IC letter to PCIE, January 8, 1999.      page 2.]     McClelland's Investigation       On March 27, 1996--two months before Hill initially      referred the matter to the PCIE, she attempted to launch an      investigation of Steakley's allegations. This investigation      continued while Hill worked with PCIE/OSC to assume      responsibility for the investigation.       The job was assigned to the IG's Office of Departmental      Inquiries--an organization that is separate from DCIS--and      more independent, though both offices report to the same      boss--the DOD IG. Mr. Dennis Cullen was initially assigned as      the case action officer on April 2, 1996, but Mr. Greg      McClelland was placed in charge of the internal inquiry on      December 12, 1996.       Between January and June 1997, McClelland conducted a very      extensive set of interviews. The staff has examined the      transcripts of McClelland's interviews and believes that      McClelland conducted a very thorough and credible      investigation. He gathered all pertinent information needed      to prepare an independent report on Steakley's allegations.      While McClelland actually began drafting a report, it was      never finalized. Once the OSC agreed to assume jurisdiction      over the case on June 3, 1997, McClelland was directed to      terminate his effort and transfer all materials to the OSC.      Even though McClelland's report was never finalized, his      files contain important information bearing on the      allegations against Walinski--information that was completely      ignored by OSC.     McClelland's Investigative Plan       The guidance given to McClelland was clear. He was to      investigate all the allegations raised by Steakley, including      ``alleged false statements'' by a DCIS investigator. On the      tax fraud inquiry, he intended to address this issue: ``Did      DCIS fabricate an ethics violation [suspected tax fraud]      against Mr. Steakley?'' He planned to ``review applicable      regulations'' to determine whether ``officials acted within      the scope of their authority.'' His investigative plan called      for questioning Gianino first. If warranted--based on      information obtained from Gianino, he would then interview      other DCIS officials as follows: Walinski, Hollingsworth,      Dupree, and Mancuso.       [See Attachment 11, page 3]     Gianino       On January 28, 1997, McClelland interviewed the key      witness--Gianino--regarding the contents of Walinski's      reported interview of her on May 21, 1993. In this interview,      Gianino disputes and contradicts virtually every point raised      in Walinski's report.       Walinski's report declares that the interview took place at      Gianino's Bolling AFB office on May 21, 1993. Gianino, by      comparison, testified that she had just one telephone      conversation with Walinski; that he called her; but she was      unable to remember when the call took place.       McClelland questioned Gianino about each individual part of      Walinski's report of interview. McClelland read her each      sentence in Walinski's report. In each case, he asked      Gianino: ``Is that accurate?'' And in each case, Gianino      replied: ``I did not call him.'' Or ``that's not a true      statement.'' Or ``that's not true.'' Or ``I did not do      that.'' On the question of sick leave between 1991 and 1993,      Gianino testified: ``I had maybe a couple of hours of sick      leave. But I was not out for a long extended period of time      due to illness.''       [See Attachment 2, Gianino interview, 1/28/97, pages 4-12]                        Gianino's Leave Records       The staff examined Gianino's leave records for 1991 through      1993.       In his report of investigation, Walinski states: ``Very      shortly after her discussions with Steakley [in late 1991],      she [Gianino] became very ill and was off work for an      extended period of time. Because of her illness she was      unable to follow-up concerning Steakley. . . . In the Spring      of 1993, after her return from the extended illness, Mrs.      Gianino. . . .''       Walinski's assertions about Gianino's absence from her      Bolling AFB office due to an extended illness are      inconsistent with her official leave records.       Those records show: (1) Gianino used 54.5 hours of sick      leave in 1992; and (2) she used .5 hours in the first half of      1993 and a total of 15 hours of sick leave for the balance of      the year.       [See Attachment 12]     Walinski       McClelland then interviewed Walinski--first on February 14,      1997--and then again on June 6, 1997. After questioning      Walinski at length about other parts of his report of      investigation on the Steakley tax fraud case, McClelland      confronts him with the conflict between his report and      Gianino's sworn testimony:       ``Okay. Well, Mr. Walinski, we have a problem. And the      problem is that Ms. Gianino controverts almost everything you      say about her in here [Walinski's report], under oath, on      tape.''       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, page 62]       Walinski replies: ``Okay, Well,--In here somewhere we will      find the information that she provided to me, and it will be      in her handwriting.''       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, page 62]       Walinski never produced any documentation from Gianino that      had a bearing on the contents or accuracy of his May 21, 1993      report of interview.       Then McClelland moved to the key question about sick leave.      Walinski's report contains a number of references to how      Gianino ``became very ill and was off work for an extended      period of time.'' McClelland asked this question:       ``Okay. Ms. Gianino states that she was not out sick from      December 1991 to spring 1993, and the records substantiate      that.''       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, page 65]       McClelland asked Walinski to explain the discrepancy      between his report and Gianino's official leave records. Here      is Walinski's response:       ``Well,--well, the remembrance that I have is, folks, is      that she was out sick, and I remember everybody at      headquarters telling me that . . . I think she had cancer      really bad, ovarian cancer, and she would come into work and      work a couple of hours, and then she would go home.       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, pages 14      and 65]       Under intense probing, Walinski admitted that the Gianino      interview may not have taken place on May 21, 1993--as stated      in his official report. He told McClelland: ``I interviewed      her [Gianino], like, two or three times.'' McClelland      responded to this revelation with another question: ``Why      isn't that reflected in the ROI [report of investigation]?''      Walinski's response helps to shed light on his investigative      methods. He told McClelland that his reports do not      necessarily reflect the way he conducted the investigation:       ``Well, because one day I went over there and she told me      this information. Another day I went over there and I      interviewed her and I was interviewing her about another,      you, something else.''       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 2/14/97, pages 63-     65]       During the second interview on June 6, 1997, McClelland      attempted to determine if there was any concrete linkage      between Walinski's handwritten notes of the Gianino interview      and the final version of the interview that accompanied his      report of investigation. McClelland determined that there was      essentially no linkage. Not one important fact contained in      the final report could be traced back to Walinski's      handwritten notes. And Walinski agreed with McClelland's      assessment. The Majority Staff examined those notes and      agreed with McClelland's assessment. Walinski's notes are      undated and cannot be considered proof that the interview      took place. McClelland asked Walinski about the disconnect.      Walinski replied:       ``I don't write down verbatim what people tell me, so I      remember she just said she was out . . . I just write down      highlights in my notes . . . Just enough that jogs my memory      so I can remember what people said.''       [See Attachment 2, Walinski interview, 6/6/97, pages 28,      37, 69]     Staff Interviews Gianino       Gianino was interviewed on June 30, 1999 regarding her      knowledge of Walinski's May 21, 1993 witness interview      report.       At the beginning of the interview, the Majority Staff gave      her an opportunity to examine Walinski's report. She had      never seen it. She re-confirmed all the facts previously      developed by McClelland. Point-by-point, she characterized      Walinski's report as completely false. She stated that she      was never interviewed by Walinski but may have spoken to him      briefly on the telephone. She noted that he was even mistaken      about her GS grade. Walinski reported that she was a ``GS-12      Payroll Specialist'' at the top of the witness interview      form. In fact, Gianino was a GS-7 Payroll technician on the      date of the interview. When asked why she thought Walinski      fabricated his report of interview, she offered this opinion:       ``DCIS was out to get Steakley. They wanted to destroy      him''       On August 20, 1999, the staff conducted a follow-up      interview with Gianino. At that time, she was shown portions      of Walinski's sworn testimony to McClelland on February 14,      1997 where he attempted to explain the discrepancy between      his report and her leave records. In this testimony, Walinski      fabricated a new reason for his May 1993 report about her      extended absences from the office. He suggested that ``she      had cancer really bad, ovarian cancer.'' Gianino was shocked      that Walinski had made such a statement under oath. She said:      ``that statement is not true. I have never had ovarian      cancer.''     Staff Interviews Walinski       On September 8, 1999, the Majority Staff questioned      Walinski about the accuracy of his May 21, 1993 interview of      Gianino. During the meeting, he attempted to offer evidence      that his reported interview of Gianino did, in fact, take      place.       This is the explanation offered by Walinski:       Since Steakley had refused to cooperate with the      investigation and provide his state income tax returns, DCIS      could not prove that Steakley had failed to meet his state      tax obligations. This shortcoming was painfully evident when      the ARB Board met to review the Steakley case. Walinski's      report did not answer the key question: What were Steakley's      total unpaid tax liabilities? Exactly how much did he owe      Virginia and California?       The ARB wanted that question answered. So Walinski was      called into the ARB Board meeting and directed to get the      missing information. Walinski claims he contacted Gianino on      the telephone and then went over to her office at Bolling      AFB. At this meeting, she provided the earnings data that he      needed to calculate Steakley's unpaid state taxes for the      Board. He said there were detailed notes containing the tax      calculations. He further stated that some of those notes were      in Gianino's handwriting, and they prove that the Gianino      interview actually took place as he reported.       [See Attachment 14]       Walinski offered essentially the same explanation to      McClelland in testimony on February 14, 1997, and June 6,      1997.       Walinski's explanation does not stand up to scrutiny for      three reasons:       First, Walinski's handwritten notes that he purportedly      took during his interview of Gianino on May 21, 1993 do not      contain tax calculations or references to them.       Second, The final version of Walinski's report of interview      with Gianino on May 21, 1993 contains no reference to income      tax calculations.       Third, since the ARB Board did not meet on the Steakley tax      evasion case until February 17, 1994--nine months after the      reported Gianino interview, and since Walinski claims the tax      calculations were prepared in response to a question that      arose during the Board meeting, the notes on tax      calculations--if they ever existed--could not constitute      proof that the Gianino interview took place as reported by      Walinski.     McClelland's Evaluation of Walinski       McClelland was interviewed on August 4, 1999 to elicit his      impressions on the irreconcilable differences between the      testimony of Walinski and Gianino. This is what McClelland      stated:       ``While he was unable to document willful intent on the      part of Walinski, he characterized Walinski's conduct and      reporting in the Steakley tax fraud case as egregious.      Walinski was a sloppy investigator. His report contained      widespread discrepancies and inaccuracies.''     Response by Management       This portion of the reports addresses the question of how      DCIS management responded to allegations that Walinski had      fabricated his official report on the Steakley investigation:       Did DCIS management make an honest attempt to review the      allegations about Walinski's report?       The Majority Staff was unable to find any evidence to      suggest that DCIS management attempted to evaluate complaints      that Walinski had falsified his report on the Steakley tax      fraud case.       Examples of how DCIS management responded to the      allegations are cited below.                                 Bonnar       In a memo dated November 15, 1994, Bonnar--Walinski's      immediate supervisor--reported that he had received a      telephone call from Steakley the previous day--November 14,      1994. Bonnar reported that Steakley asked if Dupree had      launched an investigation into Mr. Walinski's actions.      Steakley had requested the investigation during his meeting      with Dupree on October 20, 1994. Bonnar told Steakley:      ``there are no pending internal administrative inquiries      involving your case.''       In the memo, Bonnar also reported on Steakley's overall      impressions of DCIS' commitment to reviewing Walinski's      actions:       ``It was clear to him [Steakley] that Mr. Dupree had      decided not to act on his request for an investigation.       [See Attachment 8, page 2]                             Hollingsworth       According to the OSC report, Dupree asked Hollingsworth to      be certain that Walinski's     report was consistent with the facts, and Hollingsworth      assured him that there was no truth to Steakley's      allegations:       ``Dupree asked Hollingsworth to look into the [Walinski]      matter and recalled that he was assured by Hollingsworth that      the documents were in support of the information . . . and      found the allegation was not correct.''       [See Attachment 15, pages 15 and 22]       OSC's assessment does not seem to square with the facts.       First, there is no evidence to suggest that Hollingsworth      investigated the accuracy of Walinski's report. Quite to the      contrary, a memo signed by Hollingsworth on November 23, 1994      suggests that he had no plan to do it--unless Steakley      provided more specific information Hollingsworth stated:       ``Based on a review of the allegations made by SA Steakley,      no action will be taken until he provides written      documentation.''       [See Attachment 16]       Use of the words ``written documentation'' seems important,      since Steakley had taped a conversation with Gianino on      September 8, 1994 suggesting that Walinski had falsified the      interview. Testimony by Dupree, which is cited in the next      section of this report, indicates that management knew about      the tape but refused to consider it as a useful piece of      evidence.       Secondly, it seems like Hollingsworth thought he knew the      answer to the key question surrounding the accuracy of      Walinski's report--Gianino's leave status. In his November      23, 1994 memo, Hollingsworth indicated that he had already      made up his mind on this core issue:       ``The one issue that can be readily resolved is the issue      of Mrs. Nancy Gianino's leave status. Contrary to SA      Steakley's allegations, her lengthy leave was well known at      DCIS since she handles the payroll at Bolling AFB for DCIS.''       [See Attachment 16]       An independent interview of Gianino and review of her leave      records would have quickly resolved all the issues      surrounding Walinski's report of investigation. However,      Hollingsworth failed to pursue this line of inquiry.                                 Dupree       On March 13, 1997, McClelland interviewed Mancuso's Deputy,      Mr. William Dupree, about his knowledge of and reactions to      allegations that Walinski had falsified his report on the      Steakley tax evasion case.       Initially, Dupree flatly denied having any knowledge about      Walinski's fabricated reports. For example, McClelland asked:      ``Were you aware of factual inaccuracies in the [Walinski]      ROI [report of investigation]?'' Dupree's answer: ``No.''      McClelland's follow-up question: ``You weren't?'' Dupree:      ``No.''       [See Attachment 2, Dupree interview 3/13/97, page 37]       Fortunately, McClelland pressed Dupree about the issue and      succeeded in making Dupree admit he was aware of the problem.      From his response, it seems very clear that he never had any      intention of examining the accuracy of Walinski's reports.                                Question       McClelland asked him if he remembered if the subject of      ``false information in Walinski's ROI [report of      investigation] came up at a meeting in his office [Meeting      with Steakley and Cerasi in October 20, 1994].''       [See Attachment 2, Dupree interview, 3/13 97, page 38]       This was Dupree's response:                                Response       ``Oh, Gary [Steakley] was making all kinds of statements      about things. Yeah. The falseness, you know, allegedly there      are false statements. But you know, he didn't provide any      facts or information.''       [See Attachment 2, Page 38]                                Question       McClelland then began questioning Dupree about his response      to allegations that Walinski had falsified the Gianino      interview. McClelland asked this question: ``Did you take any      action to look into that?''                                Response       ``Other than to assure Larry [Hollingsworth], `Let's make      sure that what we're doing is something we can support and      back it up and everything. But Gary didn't offer anything. He      said he had a tape [interview with Gianino on September 8,      1994]. And I'm saying, Gary, you know, I need more than      that.''       [See Attachment 2, Page 39]                                Question       McClelland turned to the crucial follow-up question: ``Did      anybody call Gianino and find out, find out what she had      actually said?''                                Response       Dupree's response is very revealing. It suggests he never      had any intention of checking out the questions about the      inaccuracy of Walinski's report. He said:       ``I have no reason to question the statement that she      provided to Walinski, an agent, no different than the      statement I provide to you.''                                Question       McClelland responded with this question: ``Well, you have      an allegation from Gary [Steakley]?''                                Response       ``Allegation. With what? He is the person that's being      investigated. I had reason to believe Gary [Steakley] was      making a speculative allegation without any evidence other      than he doesn't like Matt Walinski.''                             Final Exchange       McClelland closed this segment of the interview with      another question:       ``If you were to find out that there were inaccuracies in      the ROI [report of investigation] with regard to--.''       However, before McClelland could complete the sentence,      Depuree jumped in with this assertion: ``I would do the      similar thing we previously did.'' So McClelland asked: And      what's that? Dupree's response: ``Investigate it.''       [See attachment 2, page 41]       The Majority Staff's puzzled by Dupree's response to the      last question. He had allegations--from FLEOA and Steakley--     about inaccuracies in Walinski's investigation report. Why      did he fail to investigate them?       Hollingsworth provided a partial answer to this question      during an interview on August 24, 1999. Hollingsworth      asserted:       ``DCIS gave absolutely no credence to Steakley's      allegations.''                                Mancuso       McClelland also interviewed DCIS Director Mancuso on March      13, 1997.       Mancuso's responses to McClelland's questions clearly      indicate that he was aware of the allegations about      Walinski's report.       This is Mancuso's response to McClelland's question about      his knowledge of inaccuracies in Walinski's report of      investigation and the Gianino interview:       ``I know that there was a question that Gary [Steakley] had      as to where Matt [Walinski] had gotten the information. I      remember something on that  * * * * But it was--what I heard      of complaints, I heard from Gary. I'm not aware from Bill      [Dupree] or from anyone else that there was anything      inaccurate in Matt's report.''       [See Attachment 2, Mancuso interview, 3/13/97, page 27]       McClelland then asked Mancuso: ``What did you hear from      Gary [Steakley] on that [inaccuracies in Walinski's report]?       In replying to this question, Mancuso indicates that      Steakley's allegations about Walinski's report were coming      into his office and being relayed to him through secondary      sources:       ``I would walk down the hall and somebody would say      Steakley called me up last night, and he was saying that Matt      Walinski had not attributed remarks properly in some way and      that kind of thing.''       [See Attachment 2, Mancuso interview, 3/13/97, page 26]       McClelland follow up by asking: Did he [Steakley] tell you      anything about a woman over at payroll called Nancy Gianino?      Mancuso's reply suggests that he was not only familiar with      Gianino's name, but more importantly, he heard about her from      sources other than Steakley. It also suggests that Mancuso      had knowledge of the core problem with Walinski's report.      This is Mancuso's reply: ``I've heard that from other people.      I did not hear it from Gary.'' Mancuso's response to that      question prompted McClelland to suggest that Mancuso had      ``some idea of the allegations that Steakley was making with      regard to Gianino?'' Mancuso admitted that he did but again      claimed that it was coming from Steakley.       [See Attachment 2, Mancuso interview, 3/13/97, pages 26-27]       Mancuso's response to these questions is consistent with      the assessment presented by the OSC in its report of July 21,      1998 on the Steakley case, OSC concluded:       ``Mancuso was aware of the conflict between the Walinski      interview of Gianino and Steakley's version of the interview.      However, Mancuso was not aware of any manufactured      information relating to Steakley.''       [See Attachment 15, page 22]     Mancuso Ignored Walinski Problem       To summarize, Mancuso admits that he knew about Steakley's      allegation that Walinski had fabricated the Gianino      interview, but no one in DCIS, including Dupree, had ever      suggested to him that there was any truth to those      allegations. Clearly, management did not give the allegations      much credibility. As Hollingworth put it: ``DCIS gave      absolutely no credence to Steakley's allegations.''       It seems very clear from Mancuso's testimony that he never      considered the need to investigate the allegations. The      apparent lack of curiosity on the part of the most senior      criminal investigator at the DOD IG is astonishing. As a      result, the allegations about Walinski were never examined,      and no corrective action was taken.                        the case of mr. Johanson       Walinski initiated this inquiry--Administrative Inquiry      108--on February 23, 1994 after DCIS headquarters, including      Bonnar, Hollingsworth, and Nancuso, were officially notified      that a DCIS-issued weapon was stolen from the home of Special      Agent Stephen Johanson, who was assigned to the Van Nuys      Resident Agency office in California.     Stolen Gun       DCIS had issued Johanson two weapons: (1) a 9mm Sig Sauer      that he normally carried; and (2) a smaller Smith and Wesson      revolver for undercover work.       Sometime between February 14 and February 16, 1994, while      Johanson was participating in the execution of a search      warrant in San Diego, his home in Palmdale was burglarized.      The burglars stole a number of items valued at about      $10,000.00, including jewelry and the loaded Smith and Wesson      revolver. The stolen revolver was issued to Johanson because      of his involvement in an     undercover operation the previous year. Since an earthquake      had severely damaged the Van Nuys Resident Agency office and      made it insecure--and no Class-5 safe was available there,      Johanson kept this weapon stored on the top shelf of his      bedroom closet under a pile of clothing. When he returned      from San Diego on February 16th and discovered the burglary,      he immediately notified the local police authorities and DCIS      management of the break-in and loss of the service weapon.     Walinski's Report       Walinski reported that he conducted the following      interviews of DCIS officials assigned to the Los Angeles      Field Office: (1) Richard Smith, Special Agent in Charge      (SAC)--March 4, 1994; (2) Robert Young, Assistant Special      Agent in Charge (ASAC)--March 2, 1994; (3); Jon Clark, Group      Manager--March 2, 1994; (4) Michael R. Shiohama (RAC)--March      2, 1994; (5) Michael D. Litterelle, Firearms Coordinator--     March 3, 1994; and (6) Stephen J. Johanson, Special Agent--     March 3, 1994. While all the interviews were conducted during      a 3-day period, March 2-4, it took Walinski more than five      weeks to sign, date, and finalize these interviews. They are      actually dated April 12-13, 1994.       Based on these interviews, Walinski reached four important      conclusions. These conclusions are contained in his report of      investigation: First, Johanson's supervisors--RAC, SAC, and      ASAC--never authorized Johanson to have the undercover weapon      issued to him. Second, has supervisors did not know that      Johanson had the undercover weapon until it was reported as      stolen. Third, Johanson informed the Group Manager (Clark) on      February 10, 1994 that he had the undercover weapon, and the      Group Manager ``immediately'' instructed him to turn it in at      the next firearms range training session scheduled for March      7, 1994. And fourth, neither Johanson nor the Firearms      Coordinator could remember who authorized Johanson to have      the undercover weapon.       [See Attachment 1, Report of Investigation, Synopsis]       Walinski completed this inquiry on April 15, 1994. On that      date, Hollingsworth forwarded Walinski's report of      investigation and appended interviews to Dupree ``for      whatever action you deem appropriate.''       [See Attachment 1, letter of transmittal]     ARB Recommendation       The Administrative Review Board (ARB) met on April 21, 1993      to consider Walinski's report on the Johanson case.       After reviewing Walinski's report, the ARB reached these      conclusions: (1) Johanson stored a government-issued weapon      at his residence while on ``extended leave or non-duty status      for 5 or more consecutive days'' in violation of Section      3807.4 of the DCIS Special Agent's Manual; and (2) Johanson      was not authorized to posses two issued weapons. The ARB also      concluded that Johanson failed to return the weapon at the      conclusion of the undercover operation and failed to sign the      proper forms when the weapon was issued to him.       The ARB recommended that Johanson be suspended for 10 days      without pay. The ARB's report, dated May 9, 1994, was      forwarded to the SAC, Los Angeles Field Office, Richard R.      Smith, for consideration.       [See Attachment 2, page 1]     Charges       On June 24, 1994, Smith issued a Notice of Proposed      Suspension to Johanson. Smith recommended that Johanson be      suspended without pay for 8 calendar days: for failing ``to      sign for, properly secure, and return a weapon issued to you      for an undercover assignment.''       Smith's memo to Johanson recited many facts taken directly      from Walinski's report of investigation and accompanying      interviews. These same facts were subsequently disputed--and      formally challenged--by many of the agents involved.       Smith's decision to discipline Johanson seemed to hinge on      one piece of disputed information developed by Walinski. This      was a meeting that allegedly occurred in the Van Nuys      Resident Agency office on February 10, 1994. At this meeting,      Walinski claimed that Group Manager Jon Clark informed      Johanson that he would not be assigned to an ongoing      undercover operation known as ``Skyworthy.'' According to      Walinski, Johanson then informed Clark that he still had an      undercover weapon. At this point, Walinski states, Clark told      Johanson to bring the weapon to the next firearms      qualification session to be held on March 7, 1994. This      particular assertion appears in Walinski's interviews of      Young, Clark and Johanson as well as in his report of      investigation. The February 10, 1994 meeting is the      centerpiece of Smith's Notice of Proposed Suspension. Smith      used this piece of information as the basis for charging      Johanson with failing to return a weapon issued to him for      undercover work. This is what Smith said about the alleged      February 10, 1994 meeting attended by Clark:       ``On February 10, 1994, you [Johanson] were informed by      Group Manager Clark that you would not be part of the      undercover operation relocated from 50PX [Phoenix]. When you      told Group Manager Clark that you still had a second weapon      in your possession he instructed you to bring it to the next      50LA range qualification on March 7, 1994. Before you could      return the weapon, your home was burglarized and the gun was      stolen.''       [See Attachment 3, page 1]     Rank and File Challenge Walinski's Report       The first formal complaint about Walinski's report on the      stolen gun case was initiated on the day Johanson received      Smith's Notice of Proposed Suspension--July 6, 1994--and saw      the erroneous information about the February 10th meeting.       The first complaint was embodied in a sworn statement      signed jointly by Supervisory Special Agent Jon Clark and Mr.      Thomas J. Bonnar--Walinski's immediate supervisor at DCIS      Headquarters in Washington. While this statement was signed      on July 19, 1994, it concerned a telephone conversation      between Johanson and Clark on July 6, 1994. The joint Clark/     Bonnar statement clearly suggests that Walinski falsified      information in this report of investigation on the stolen gun      case.       Portions of the joint statement are summarized below.       After receiving Smith's Notice of Proposed Suspension on      July 6, 1994, Johanson called Jon Clark on the telephone to      express alarm and confusion over a statement in Smith's memo      that was attributed to Clark. Johanson read the following      statement to Clark:       ``That he [Johanson] was instructed by Group Manager Jon      Clark on February 10, 1994, that he was not going to be      participating in the undercover operation at LAFO [Los      Angeles Field Office] and that he should return the      undercover weapon he had at the next firearms      qualification.''       [See Attachment 4, page 1]       Johanson informed Clark that he had no recollection of      receiving this instruction from Clark and asked Clark if he      could recall giving it. This is how Clark responded to the      news:       ``I was astonished and confounded by this statement. I      asked him to re-read the statement. I said I have no idea how      or why that statement was in the letter. I said I had no      recollection of providing him those instructions nor had I      any recollection of saying that to anyone. Moreover, I was      not aware of the fact that he had an undercover weapon.''       [See Attachment 4, page 1]       Clark told Johanson that he would check his calendar for      the date of February 10, 1994 to verify whether he was at the      meeting in the Van Nuys Resident Agency office as reported by      Walinski. In checking his calendar, he discovered that he was      not in the Van Nuys office that day. Instead, he spent that      entire day at the El Segundo Resident Agency office on other      business with both Young and Smith [Smith and Young later      confirm the fact. Smith and Young were the SAC and ASAC in      the Los Angeles Field Office].       Following the phone conversation with Johanson, Clark      contacted Smith and Young in the Los Angeles Field Office to      inquire about the origins of the assertions in Smith's letter      to Johanson. Smith advised Clark that the information on the      February 10, 1994 meeting was extracted for Walinski's      ``internal'' report of investigation (ROI). At that point,      Clark assured Smith that ``he had not provided a statement on      this investigation.'' Clark asked Smith to double-check the      ROI ``to be sure that was no mistake.'' Smith re-checked the      ROI and ``advised me that there was a DCIS Form 1, Report of      Interview of me.''       Clark denied again that he was ever interviewed by      Walinski. This is what he said to Smith:       ``I was perplexed. I advised SAC Smith that I had no      recollection of this report being taken and asked that I be      permitted to read it to refresh my recollection. He said no.      . . . I informed SAC Smith that these were facts that I not      only did not say--but information I did not know. . . . I      could not corroborate the statement attributed to me in SAC      Smith's letter to Johanson. . . . I cannot believe I made      those statements since I had no specific knowledge of those      facts. The statements appear to be factually inaccurate, and      therefore would not have been stated by me.''       [See Attachment 4, page 1-2]       About a week later--on July 5, 1994--Mr. Michael D.      Litterelle [Firearms Coordinator] informed Clark that he had      a copy of Walinski's ROI, and Litterelle actually gave Clark      a copy of Walinski's form 1 Witness Interview of Clark. After      reading it, Clark stated:       ``I read the interview and found it contained statements      that were attributed to me that I knew were untrue. . . . I      never made this statement.''       [See Attachment 4, page 3]       The exact distribution of the joint Bonner-Clark statement      is unknown. However, since it was ``solicited'' by Bonner,      the Assistant Director of internal affairs, it would not be      unreasonable to assume that Hollingsworth--the director--and      other DCIS managers knew about it and actually saw it.     Supervisor Challenges Walinski's Report       Several weeks after the Bonnar/Clark complaint, another      formal complaint about Walinski's report was submitted to      Hollingsworth's office. This one was signed on August 4, 1994      by ASAC Young in the Los Angeles Field Office. It contained a      detailed, line-by-line commentary on inaccuracies in      Walinski's interview of Young along with highly critical      comments on Walinski's interviews of Clark and Shiohama on      the same date [March 2, 1994].       Young stated that he was ``somewhat shocked'' after reading      Walinski's report. He stated that Walinski's report contained      statement that were misleading, ``wrong''     and ``inaccurate.'' He said that Walinski attributed      statements to him that he never made.       After alluding to the ``significant discrepancies'' in      Walinski's interview of Clark, Young reports that Shiohama      had advised him that ``there were subject areas in the report      or statements that he had not discussed with SA Walinski.      Shiohama stated that the last paragraph of his interview was      totally inaccurate.'' However, both Young and Shiohama      insisted that portions of their interviews appeared to      accurately reflect what they had said to Walinski.     Appeal to Management About Walinski's Reports       In asking Hollingsworth to examine the discrepancies in      Walinski's report, Young makes an appeal to senior management      on behalf of rank and file agents:       ``I am not trying to cause you or Matt [Walinski] problems.      But in this situation I am caught in the middle. I have      agents that are in the process of being disciplined and based      on what I know now the recommended disciplinary actions may      be based on incomplete and inaccurate information. The agents      throughout the Field Office know this and are now finding      fault with management for not taking some type of action to      have this situation re-evaluated.''       [See Attachment 5, Note from Young to Hollingsworth]       Young's report was officially moved up the chain of      command--to the top. Young forwarded it to Bonnar who, in      turn, submitted it to Hollingsworth, and Dupree--Mr.      Mancuso's Deputy. However, during an interview on September      14, 1999, Mancuso denied having knowledge of the allegation      that the Clark interview was fabricated until recently or      August 1999.     FLEOA Letter       Young's formal complaint to Hollingsworth about Walinski's      inaccurate reports was followed almost immediately by a      formal complaint from another source.       During the adjudication phase of the stolen gun case,      Johnson was represented by an attorney with the Federal Law      Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), Luciano A. Cerasi--     the same lawyer who represented Steakley in the tax evasion      case.       In a letter to Dupree, dated August 8, 1994, regarding the      Johanson case, Cerasi raised the possibility that Walinski      had falsified his report of investigation. Cerasi's letter      contains this explosive allegation:       ``It is questionable whether SA Walinski even interviewed      SA Clark.''       Cerasi also raised questions about why five weeks elapsed      between the dates on which Walinski conducted the disputed      interviews and the final dates on the interview reports.      Cerasi suggested that this delay violated DCIS policy      requiring that witness reports be completed and finalized      within 3 working days of the investigative activity. Cerasi      characterized Walinski's report as a ``shabby investigative      effort'' that would only serve to demonstrate to other agents      that in DCIS ``justice is unattainable.''       [See Attachment 6, pages 3-4]     Attempted DCIS Coverup Possible       Initially, DCIS management may have tried to put a lid on      the groundswell of adverse information on Walinski's reports      that began to surface in mid-1994. First, there were      complaints from rank and file agents--Clark, Young, and      Shiohama--in July and August 1994. Those were followed      immediately by the FLEOA letter. A month later--in September      1994--FLEOA filed a second complaint with management. This      one concerned allegations that Walinski had fabricated the      Gianino interview.       The sworn statement signed jointly by Bonnar and Clark      alludes to a possible attempt by DCIS management to keep a      lid on all the complaints about Walinski's reports:       ``On July 8, 1994, ASAC Young advised me that HQ [DCIS      Headquarters] had decided that they would wait and not raise      the issue regarding my discrepant interview unless it was      raised by SA Johanson. I [Clark] expressed concern that this      may be released to agents and that they may conclude that I      fabricated this story and it would therefore discredit me. I      was informed that the information was controlled in its      release.''       [See Attachment 4, pages 2-3]       On August 9, 1999, the staff contacted the DOD IG with this      question: ``Who at DCIS made this decision?'' The following      answer was provided on September 30, 1999: ``We have not been      able to determine who, if anyone, made this alleged      decision.''     Re-Investigation       As a result of all the complaints. DCIS management      eventually made a decision to launch a re-investigation of      the Johanson stolen gun case. The re-investigation was      conducted by SA Timothy L. Shroeder from August 10, 1994      until October 5, 1994.       Unfortunately, the re-investigation was conducted in a      complete vacuum--as if the entire matter had never been      investigated by Walinski.       It is easy to understand why DCIS needed to go back to      square one and re-examine all the facts bearing on the stolen      weapon. The second investigation had to be impartial and      independent after Walinski was accused of falsifying      information contained in the original investigation. At the      same time, DCIS management had a responsibility and an      obligation to determine whether Walinski had falsified his      report--as alleged by rank and file agents. Unfortunately,      there was no attempt to reconcile the facts contained in      Walinski's report of investigation with the facts developed      in the re-investigation. In fact, the agent in charge of the      re-investigation--Shroeder--received specific instructions to      steer clear of the disputed interviews. Hollingsworth gave      him these instructions: The ``new investigation should be      conducted without reviewing the results of the previous      interviews.''       [See Attachment 7]       Clearly, Shroeder needed to avoid the pitfalls created in      first investigation, but management should have assigned      another agent to examine the allegations made about      Walinski's report. If Walinski bungled his investigation and      the case had to be re-investigated, then DCIS management      should have determined exactly where and how Walinski's      investigation deviated from accepted standards. All the      complaints from rank and file agents and the FLEOA attorney      required nothing less than that.     New Charges       Based on the re-investigation, Smith recommended that      Johanson be suspended without pay for 10 calendar days.      Smith's second Notice of Proposed Suspension was dated      November 23, 1994. Smith charged Johanson with violating two      sections of the Special Agents' Manual: (1) Failing to      exercise ``utmost caution'' in storing a firearm at his      residence; and (2) Storing a weapon at his residence while      away from his assigned office for an extended time.       [See attachment 8, pages 1-2]       In the final notice on suspension, dated February 9, 1995,      Durpee suspended Johanson for 3 calendar days, beginning on      February 15, 1995.       [See attachment 9]     Need for Investigation Questioned       It's difficult to understand why DCIS would suspend an      agent for losing a gun that was stolen from his home during a      burglary. The staff checked with other federal law      enforcement authorities to determine how similar cases have      been handled in the past. Under normal circumstances, they      suggested that a routine administrative inquiry would be      conducted. Once it was determined that the firearm was stolen      during a burglary and the theft was duly reported to the      proper authorities, the entire matter would be dropped.     Walinsky ``Disciplined'' for Bungled Investigation       On July 20, 1999 and again on August 4, 1999, Ms. Jane      Charters was interviewed regarding her knowledge of personnel      actions taken against Walinski in the wake of the bungled      Johanson investigation.       Ms. Charters is currently the Director of the Investigative      Support Branch at DCIS--the same position she occupied in      1994 during the Johanson and Steakley investigations. She      exercises personnel responsibilities in DCIS.       During the first interview of July 20, 1994, Charters      stated that as a result of mistakes in stolen gun case      investigations, DCIS ``lost confidence'' in Walinski and      transferred him out of internal affairs and into her office.      In the new position, Walinski was no longer conducting      internal investigations. Instead, he was to be responsible      for DCIS training, physical fitness and security. Charters      also reported that Walinski was issued a letter of reprimand      that was placed in his file--a fact that was confirmed by      Bonnar during an interview on July 12, 1999.     Walinski's Personnel File       On two occasions in July--July 7th and again on July 23,      1999, the Majority Staff examined Walinski personnel file to      determine if the disciplinary actions taken against him for      his mistakes in Johanson investigation--as described by      Charters and others--were accurately reflected in performance      ratings and other personnel actions in his file.       The Majority Staff found no evidence that Walinski was ever      disciplined for the failed Johanson gun case. Quite to the      contrary, the available evidence suggests Walinski was      actually rewarded for what happened.       Here is what the Majority Staff found in his file:                  Employee Performance Rating--1993/94       For the rating period August 26, 1993 to March 31, 1994,      Walinski received an ``outstanding'' rating.       The outstanding rating applied to the period of time when      Walinski conducted two investigations--Steakley and      Johanson--where the accuracy of his reports were later      questioned. In fact, the rating period included the date--     March 2, 1994--on Walinski claims he conducted interviews      with Young, Clark, and Shiohama. Those reports of interview      were later characterized as false, misleading and inaccurate      by the agents involved and the FLEOA attorney. The Gianino      interview occurred on May 21, 1993--just prior to the      beginning of the rating period, but considerable      investigative activity on the Steakley case occurred during      his rating period.       The rating officials offered this comment: ``Walinski      continues to excel in every aspect of his job. He is a very      valued employee of DCIS.'' The outstanding rating was      approved by Bonnar and the Director of internal affairs,      Hollingsworth, on April 15, 1994--the exact same day that      Hollingsworth forwarded Walinski's completed report of      investigation on the Johanson case to Dupree.       [See attachment 10]               Incentive Award Nomination--Recommendation       On April 25, 1994, Hollingsworth recommended that Walinski      receive a performance award of $1,200.00 to accompany the     ``outstanding'' rating he received for the period August 1993      to March 1994--the same period when he conducted witness      interviews in the Johanson case that were later characterized      as false, inaccurate and misleading.       [See attachment 11]                       Previous Cash Award--1993       The form used to recommend the $1,200.00 performance award      also noted that Walinski had not received any other      performance awards in the preceding 52 weeks. His personnel      file indicates otherwise. He received a ``Special Act or      Service Award'' of $2,000.00 on May 2, 1993--several weeks      before his fabricated interview with Gianino on May 21, 1993.       [See Attachments 11 & 12]                    Special Performance Rating--1994       This a special rating given to Walinski immediately before      his sudden transfer out of internal affairs and into the      Investigative Support Directorate. It was the last rating he      received for his work in internal affairs and covered a      ``shortened rating period'' of April 1, 1994 through July 2,      1994. This rating period includes the date on which Walinski      finalized the report of investigation on the Johanson case--     April 15, 1994. The closing date for this reporting period--     July 2, 1994--came one day before his move to Charters'      office and just four days before the first known written      complaint about Walinski's false and inaccurate reports      reached DCIS Headquarters in Washington.       Bonnar and Hollingsworth gave him a ``fully successful''      rating, but for unexplained reasons, took over three months      to approve it. It was finally signed on October 12, 1994.      Walinski's other ratings were approved quickly--within two      weeks of the end of the rating period.       [See Attachment 12].       DCIS says the delay was due to ``an administrative      oversight.''       Walinski stated August 2, 1999 that this is the rating      where ``he took a hit'' for his mistakes in the Johanson      case. The language in the performance rating documents seemed      to support Walinski's assessment:       ``Unfortunately, during this rating period he failed to      show due diligence and accuracy in reporting the results of      some interviews with regard to one administrative inquiry.      This one shortfall in SA Walinski's performance is not      typical of the otherwise high quality and professional level      of his work.''       [See Attachment 13, pages 3-4]       when Bonnar and Hollingsworth signed this document in      October 1994, they had already received the allegations about      Walinski's false reports on the Steakley tax evasion case.      For that reason, the reference to ``accuracy of reporting''      in just one internal investigation does not appear to square      with the facts.                              Reassignment       Walinski's personnel records indicate that his transfer      from internal affairs to the Investigative Support Branch      became effective on July 3, 1994.       [See Attachment 14]       As previously reported, Charters suggested during two      interviews that DCIS management ``had lost confidence in      Walinski'' as an investigator ``and moved him into her      office'' as a disciplinary measure. Charters' description of      the reasons behind Walinksi's transfer are consistent with      those provided by Mancuso during an interview on September      14, 1999.       Hollingsworth and Walinski, by comparison, provided a      completely different set of reasons behind the July 1994      move.       During an interview on August 24, 1994, Holllingsworth      suggested that the move was not taken for disciplinary      reasons: ``It was for his health.'' He said Walinki ``blew''      the Johnason case because ``he was totally stressed out.''      Hollingsworth feared he might ``have a heart attack.''       Walinski meaintains that the transfer was driven by routine      considerations.       During an interview on September 8, 1999, he gave the      following reasons for the move: (1) There was an attractive      opening in Charters' organization; (2) The opening offered      him some growth potential into a management position in the      future; (3) He had completed his planned 3-year tour of duty      in internal affairs; and (4) He had a plan for addressing the      training deficiencies in Charters' Directorate. When asked if      there was any other reasons for the move, he said ``No.''       [See Attachment 15, pages 1-2]     Walinski Assigned Inspection Duties       A personnel document, signed by Bonnar and Hollingsworth on      October 12, 1994 suggests that Walinski conduct inspections      long after he was reassigned to ``training'' in Charters'      office. Along with inquiries of employee misconduct,      inspections are the main responsibility of the internal      affairs office. This document suggests that Walinski continue      to perform, work for the internal affairs office--despite his      removal from that office. This document shows that Walinski      played a leadership role in various inspections as follows:       ``He also worked on the preparation for the Los Angeles FO      [field office] inspection. Although the Los Angeles FO      inspection was conducted after the end of this special rating      period when SA Walinski reported to his new assignment in the      Investigative Support Directorate, he returned to assist with      the LA inspection and played a significant role by leading      inspection efforts in the DCIS offices in Phoenix, Tuscon,      Albuquerque, and Honolulu as well as Los Angeles. He worked      independently on these inspections without the need for any      close supervision.''       [See Attachment 13, page 3]       During an interview on September 14, 1999, Mancuso      expressed surprise that Walinski led the inspection of the      Los Angeles field office after his reassignment:       Mancuso said he had no knowledge of Walinski's involvement      in the inspection of the LA Field Office after his transfer.      He would be surprised and concerned if true, and said he      would be checking on the accuracy of that information.     Decision on Inspection Duties Questioned       In an information paper provided on September 30, 1999,      Mancuso admitted that Walinski was involved in the inspection      of the Los Angeles Field Office. However, Mancuso maintains      Walinski was kept on the team only ``to train his      replacement'' and ``did not participate in the actual      inspection.'' Mancuso's statement conflicts with the      personnel document signed by Bonnar, Hollingsworth, and      Walinski in 1994 referenced above.       It is very difficult to understand why Walinski would have      been assigned to prepare the inspection report on the Los      Angeles Field Office in the wake of all the allegations and      complaints flowing from the Johanson case. The re-     investigation of the Johanson case, which began in August      1944 and was concluded in October 1994, was in progress while      Walinski conducted the inspection of the Los Angeles Field      Office. That re-investigation was specifically triggered by      his disputed interviews of at least three agents assigned to      the Los Angeles field Office. Those agents made formal      complaints to management about the quality of Walinski's      reports. In effect, these agents ``blew the whistle'' on      Walinski. Assigning Walinski a leadership role in the Los      Angeles Field Office inspection could be viewed as a      retaliatory measure, and as such, a very questionable      management decision.                        Performance Award--1994       On July 24, 1994--exactly three weeks after his transfer      from internal affairs into training, Walinski received a cash      award of $1,200.00.       [See Attachment 16]       At our meeting with Charters on August 4, 1997, she offered      an explanation for the $1,200.00 cash award--in light of      Walinski's mistakes on the Johanson case. She suggested that      it was given for the rating period August 26, 1993 through      March 31, 1994--``before the problem arose over the Johanson      gun case.''       Charters' explanation is not supported by the facts. The      facts cited below clearly indicate that DCIS management was      aware of the complaints about Walinski's report at least      three weeks before Walinski received the cash award:       --The rating period for which the cash award was given      included the date--March 2, 1994--on which Walinski conducted      interviews of agents that were later characterized as false,      misleading and inaccurate in rank and file complaints to      management;       --Management claims that Walinski was transferred from      internal affairs into training on July 3, 1994 as a      disciplinary measure for the mistakes he made in the Johanson      case. This indicates that management knew about the      allegations prior to that date;       --Walinski admitted that he received a reprimand for making      ``administrative errors'' in his report on the Johanson case      while still assigned to internal affairs--or prior to July 3,      1999;       --Clark informed DCIS management, beginning on July 6,      1994, that Walinski's March 2, 1994 interview of Clark was      completely false;       The facts show that the $1,200.00 cash award given to      Walinski on July 24, 1994 came at least three weeks after      DCIS management had knowledge that Walinski had falsified      reports on the Johanson case.                               Reprimand       The staff was never able to locate the letter of reprimand      that was placed in Walinski's file, nor was the staff able to      establish the exact date on which the reprimand was given.       During an interview on July 12, 1999, Walinski's immediate      supervisor, Tom Bonnar, stated that he was ``furious'' with      Walinski about the Johanson interview statements. He said      Walinski ``was verbally and officially reprimanded and a      letter was placed in his file.'' Bonnar doubted the reprimand      would still be in his personnel file, since it's customary to      remove them after a brief period of time.       [See Attachment 17, page 2]       On September 8, 1999, Walinski confirmed that Bonnar had      indeed ``handed him'' a ``letter of caution'' for making      ``administrative errors'' on the Johanson case, but he could      not remember if he kept it for 30, 60, or 90 days. In a      telephone conversation on August 2, 1999, Walinski claimed      that ``Bonnar told him to destroy it in the shredder after 30      days.''       Walinski also seemed somewhat confused about the actual      date of the reprimand. Initially, he suggested that it was      dated October 12, 1994. However when it was pointed out that      date was the exact day Bonnar and Hollingsworth approved his      last performance evaluation for internal affairs, he      suggested that October 12, 1994 might have seen the day he      destroyed the letter of reprimand. Mr. Walinski seemed      certain of one fact: he received the reprimand while still in      internal     affairs. This statement is consistent with statements by      Charters and Mancuso that the reprimand was issued before      July 3, 1994.       [See Attachment 15, page 2]     Walinski's Rebuttal       Walinski has a simple explanation for the inaccuracies in      his report of investigation on the Johanson stolen gun case.      His explanation was given during testimony to McClelland on      February 14, 1997 and confirmed in a telephone conversation      on August 2, 1999.       He claims it was a clerical error. In a nutshell, this is      his explanation:       ``The headers got switched. The wrong headers ended up on      the Form 1 interview sheet. I said that one guy said one      thing when I said another guy said another thing. This      happened when the interviews got typed up. We had a secretary      that wasn't a top quality individual. She typed them up      wrong. . . . But it was my mistake.''       [See Attachment 18, interview, 2/14/97, pages 74-75, and      telephone interview 8/2/99]       During an interview on September 8, 1999, Walinski offered      a similar explanation:       ``It was an administrative error. I roughed out the form 1      interview reports on my computer and gave my write up to a      secretary. The secretary got the headers mixed up and      switched some paragraphs.''       [See Attachment 15, page 2]       Walinski's explanation is highly questionable for two      reasons: 1) if the Clark interview never took place--as Clark      stated, then how could Clark's name end up on a Form 1      ``header'' that was only inadvertently ``switched''? Clark's      name not should not have appeared on the radar screen; And 2)      Both Young and Shiohama contend that portions of their      interviews were true and accurate. If portions of the Young      and Shiohama interviews were true and accurate, then how      could the incorrect portions of their interviews involved      ``switched headers''?       Furthermore, Walinski states that he prepared his write-ups      of the interviews on a computer and transferred them to a      clerk typist to be finalized. That being the case, a mix up      of headers seems improbable.     Walinski rule       Following the Johanson investigation, DCIS management      instituted investigative reforms, including the so-called      ``Walinski rule.'' Under this rule, all interviews have to be      recorded and transcripts reviewed and verified by witnesses.     Management Backs Up Walinski       During an official DOD IG interview by McClelland on March      13, 1997, both Dupree and Mancuso attempted to diminish the      significance of the allegations that Walinski had falsified      his reports on the Johanson case. They seemed to accept the      `'wrong headers'' excuse used by Walinski.       McClelland questioned Dupree on March 13, 1997 about      ``Walinski's ability as an investigator'' and problems with      regard to ``factual inaccuracies'' in his reports. During the      course of that interview, Dupree offered Walinski's ``wrong      header'' excuse. This is what Dupree said:       ``Matt's [Walinski] probably one of the most capable      investigators I know. It wasn't factual inaccuracies. It was      in the deliberation of putting a lot of statements together.      Unfortunately, some of the comments that were made by      individuals were transposed to other individuals. The      statements and the facts were absolutely correct. They were      just attributed to the wrong person.''       [See Attachment 18, interview, 3/13/97, pages 45-46]       During an interview on March 13, 1997, McClelland asked      Mancuso if he ever got ``any word from Bill Dupree about      inaccuracies in the report of investigation that Walinski      prepared.'' Although McClelland appeared to be asking about      the Steakley report, Mancuso's response seems to address the      Johanson case. Mancuso also accepted the ``switched headers''      excuse:       ``No. Again, I'm a little bit fuzzy because we had one or      two instances where Matt [Walinski] on different cases which      were in the same area, where Matt had inaccurately attributed      certain remarks--had confused witnesses' names in his notes.      But I don't recall any inaccuracies involving Steakley. . . .      Gary [Steakley] was saying Walinski's responsible for other      cases that are now suspect because of inaccuracies. . . .''       [See Attachment 18, interview, 3/13/97, pages 25-46]     Management's Knowledge of Allegations       The testimony given by Dupree and Mancuso to McClelland on      March 13, 1997 clearly indicates that senior management at      DCIS was aware of the allegations about Walinski's falsified      report on the Johanson case.       Rank and file complaints about Walinski's false and      misleading reports went right to the top at Headquarters as      follows:       --On July 19, 1994, Agent Clark signed a sworn statement,      alleging that Walinski had falsified his report [based on      complaints received from Johanson on July 6, 1994]; Clark's      statement was ``solicited'' and witnessed by Bonnar, the      Assistant Director of Internal Affairs and Walinski's      immediate supervisor; A document indicates that DCIS      headquarters was aware of this complaint on or about July 8,      1994;       --On August 4, 1994, ASAC Young in the Los Angeles Field      Office formally complained to Hollingsworth about Walinski's      false and inaccurate reports of interview with agents Young,      Clark, and Shiohama; Young reports that rank and file agents      are ``finding fault with management for not taking some type      of action to have this situation re-evaluated;''      Hollingsworth forwarded Young's formal complaint to Mancuso's      Deputy, Dupree;       --On August 8, 1994, FLEOA addressed a formal complaint to      Dupree, alleging that Walinski falsified his report of      investigation;       --On August 10, 1994, management launched a re-     investigation of the Johanson case based on rank and file      complaints about Walinski's reports;     Mancuso's Knowledge of Allegations       Mancuso's broad responsibilities for internal      investigations suggest that he would have been informed      immediately of rank and file complaints about the integrity      of an ongoing inquiry. Testimony and statements indicate that      Mancuso was kept up-to-date on the progress of all ongoing      internal investigations. Mancuso's responsibilities as DCIS      Director--and the DCIS person chiefly responsible ``for      staffing and direction for the conduct of internal      investigations''--meant that he would have been informed      about the controversy over the Walinski report on the      Johanson case and would have been involved in the decision to      re-investigate the case and reassign Walinski to Charters'      office.       During an interview on September 14, 1999, Mancuso was      questioned about his knowledge and awareness of the      allegations about Walinski's reports. This is what Mancuso      said:       Mancuso admitted that he knew about ``the problems of      Walinski's reporting'' on the Johanson case back in 1994, but      he contends that he was unaware of the allegations that      Walinski had fabricated the Clark interview in its entirety      ``until a few weeks ago'' or in August 1999.       Mancuso said that Walinski was given a reprimand and      transferred [in July 1994] because of rank and file      complaints, of which he was aware, about the credibility of      the work being performed by the internal affairs office. He      said the ``transfer and reprimand were the culmination of      several negative reports on Walinski.'' As a result of these      complaints, policy changes--like the need to record and      verify interviews--were put in place--and the Johanson case      was re-investigated.       Mancuso insisted that he ``did not know about the extent of      Walinski's mistakes.'' He claims that as DCIS Director, he      normally ``did not get beyond that level of detail,'' though      he admitted he got deeply involved with the Steakley case      because of the lack of progress in the investigation.       [See attachment 19, page 1]     Decision to Re-Open Case       The directive that re-opened the Johanson case was dated      September 23, 1994. This memo suggests that DCIS managers      were aware of rank and file complaints about Walinski's      report.       The memo states that the Johanson case was re-opened      ``after allegations of discrepancies were made concerning the      original interviews.'' It also states that Charters and      Hollingsworth directed the assigned agent [Schroeder] ``to      conduct an independent inquiry concerning the circumstances      surrounding'' Johanson's stolen firearm.       [See attachment 7]     Legal Questions about Walinski's Reports       There seems to be a consensus within DCIS that Walinski's      reports on the Steakley and Johanson were ``inaccurate.''      DCIS thinking seems to suggest that Walinski's reports might      have carelessly deviated from the facts, or he may have      misinterpreted a statement. He was just mistaken or careless.      Or as Walinski put it, he just made ``administrative      errors.''       During an interview on July 12, 1999, Bonnar characterized      Walinski's reports this way:       ``The statements in Walinski's reports were inaccurate and      not falsified.''       [See attachment 17, page 2]       Mr. John Kennan, the current Director of DCIS, was      interviewed on August 4, 1999. He indicated that he was well      aware of all the adverse information on Walinski's reports in      August 1994, but he attempted to minimize the significance of      the problem. He said those reports were not a concern      because:       ``Walinski's inaccurate reports did not affect the outcome      of the investigation.''       McClelland offered a similar view in an interview with OSC      on November 5, 1997:       ``Walinski had been inconsistent and inaccurate in his      report on the tax issue (regarding Gianino's testimony) but      that it was not harmful. Walinski was just a sloppy      investigator.''       [See Attachment 20]       The staff believes that Walinski's reports of interview      with Gianino and Clark and his sworn testimony to McClelland      regarding these matters in 1997 went far beyond simple      factual inaccuracies. The staff believes that Walinski      invited or fabricated information contained in those reports      for the following reasons:       First, both Gianino and Clark deny that they were ever      interviewed by Walinski; they deny making the statements      attributed to them by Walinski; and both deny any knowledge      of the facts attributed to them by Walinski.       Second, it is possible to independently verify certain      inaccuracies in Walinski's reports.       --In Gianino's case, Walinski stated ``very shortly after      her [Gianino's] discussions with Steakley she became very ill      and was off     work for an extended period of time.'' Walinski later      explained that ``she had cancer really bad, ovarian cancer.''      Gianino's official leave records clearly indicate that she      had no ``extended illness'' as reported by Walinski. In fact,      she was shocked when told that Walinski had testified in      1997--under oath--that she had ovarian cancer. She stated:      ``That statement is not true.''       --In Clark's case, Walinski stated that Clark had made      statements, which Clark said he never made, at a meeting,      which Clark said he never attended. Clark's appointment      calendar shows that he did not attend the meeting at the DCIS      office identified by Walinski. Instead, he spent that entire      day at another DCIS office with two other supervisory      agents--Young and Smith--who both subsequently confirmed that      fact.       DCIS officials also contend that even if Walinski's reports      contained false information, that information was ``not      harmful.'' For example, what difference does it make if      Gianino did not have an ``extended illness' as reported by      Walinski. They argued that the questionable facts generated      by Walinski did not affect the outcome of the investigation.       The level of danger or harm caused by a false statement is      not a valid standard for determining whether the law was      violated.       Under the law--18 USC 1001--a person who deliberately makes      false statements could be convicted of a felony and sent to      prison for up to five years. The law does not make exceptions      for the extent of damage or harm caused by a false statement.      In fact, a court decision specifically suggests the false      statements need not involve loss or damage to the government      [U.S. v. Fern, C.A. 11 (Fla.) 1983, 696 F.2d 1269].       Furthermore, the staff would argue that Walinski's false      reports did, in fact, cause damage.       First, Walinski's reports undermined the integrity and      credibility of the investigative process at DCIS--the Defense      Department's criminal investigative arm.       Second, Walinski's reports damage the reputations of two      fellow agents--Steakley and Johanson. Walinski's false      reports formed the foundation for charges that were      eventually made against both individuals. According to      Steakley, those reports caused Steakley and Johanson and      their families to incur considerable legal expenses and      mental anguish.     Other Cases       During the course of the inquiry into the Steakley and      Johanson cases, the majority Staff received allegations from      a current and a former DCIS agent that Walinski had falsified      reports during two other internal investigations, but the      staff was unable to investigate and substantiate those      allegations.     Conclusion       Based on a thorough review of all documents bearing on the      Steakley and Johanson cases, it is crystal clear that senior      DCIS management, including Mancuso, were aware of the      allegations about Walinski's witness reports. Although      management made certain administrative adjustments in the      wake of rank and file complaints about Walinski's reports,      management never attempted to determine if those allegations      had merit. Management never attempted to reconcile Walinski's      reports with the facts. Independent interviews of Gianino and      Clark would have quickly established the fact that Walinski      had fabricated at least two witness interviews. This very      simple step would have led to appropriate corrective action.      Instead, the record shows that Walinski was never      disciplined. In fact, the record shows that Walinski actually      was given a cash award--at least three weeks after management      began receiving rank and file complaints about the accuracy      of his reports.

Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the          Courts, Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing regarding the inquiry of      your Subcommittee into certain personnel cases in the Defense      Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS). Your letter of      September 27, 1999, invited the Office of Inspector General      (OIG) to provide a written response based on my interview by      your staff on September 14, 1999. I understand that this      response will be attached to any final report that you may      issue.       In your letter you state that I was allowed the opportunity      to review the factual findings of your staff. I respectfully      disagree with that assertion. I have not been given an      opportunity to review any written work product, nor did your      staff orally share any draft findings. Rather, our meeting      consisted of an interview in which I responded to a lengthy      series of questions. In light of these facts, the OIG would      again request the opportunity to review your final written      report and provide comments prior to its release.       During my nine-year tenure as Director, DCIS, I supervised      approximately 500 investigative personnel at any given time      and the conduct of nearly 10,000 defense fraud      investigations. I have devoted my life to public service and      have proudly served for over 27 years. I am committed to      integrity in leadership within the Inspector General      community and proud of my investigative and management      record.       Given my limited understanding of the scope of the inquiry      of your Subcommittee, I will in this letter attempt to      furnish you with further insight as to the matters in      question. My objective in this matter is to provide you with      the information you need to accurately assess these cases.      Specifically, I will address actions with respect to the      handling of DCIS internal review matters involving Special      Agents (SA) Hollingsworth, Steakley and Walinski.       SA Larry Hollingsworth: SA Hollingsworth was employed by      the DCIS from November 1983 until his retirement in September      1996. I first met SA Hollingsworth some time after his hiring      during which time we were peers, I as Special Agent in Charge      (SAC) of the New York Field Office and he as SAC of the      Chicago Field Office.       In July 1995, I identified a photograph in a law      enforcement journal as possibly that of SA Hollingsworth. The      unidentified individual was being sought by the Department of      State (DoS) relative to the filing of a false passport      application. I immediately contacted the DoS and reported my      suspicions to them and later assisted the DoS in arranging a      surveillance of SA Hollingsworth in anticipation of a search      of his home. Following the search, he was immediately barred      from the worksite and kept from any active service with this      organization. Although he was arrested in July 1995, he was      not indicted until January 1996. During those seven months,      while the DoS investigation was ongoing, SA Hollingsworth was      allowed to use sick leave to the extent verifiable by     medical authorities and accumulated annual leave. Subsequent      to his indictment, he was suspended without pay and denied      further use of leave. He entered a conditional guilty plea in      March 1996 and was sentenced in June 1996.       During this time period I was involved in a variety of      administrative matters in which SA Hollingsworth contested      actions proposed by his supervisor. I, as Director, DCIS, at      the time was his second level supervisor and acted as      deciding official in each of these matters. These      administrative actions were separate and distinct from the      investigation by the DoS and prosecution by the Department of      Justice.       My next involvement with this matter began when SA      Hollingsworth appealed a Notice of Proposed Removal issued by      his supervisor. On August 23, 1996, his attorney requested an      extension until September 13, 1996, to file a written      response and notified us of his intent to make a subsequent      oral presentation. As deciding official, I granted this      request consistent with past DCIS practice and, to      preclude further delay, I simultaneously scheduled the      oral presentation for September 23, 1996. However, four      days prior to his scheduled oral presentation, SA      Hollingsworth retired.       SA Hollingsworth was provided the same due process afforded      to all other DCIS special agents in the form of a review by      the Special Agents Administrative Review Board and reasonable      time to prepare a written and oral response to a Notice of      Proposed Removal. Variation from past practice would have      been unwarranted and inconsistent with my experience as a      deciding official in dozens of disciplinary proceedings.       SA Hollingsworth's criminal conduct was both inexcusable      and inexplicable. His violation of law was totally out of      character and inconsistent with his job performance and      lengthy career. I noted this same observation in a letter to      the sentencing judge as I went on record describing SA      Hollingsworth's job performance.       Throughout this process, the OIG was provided advice by      personnel and legal experts. The course of action taken in      this case was one of the several available options permitted      by Federal personnel guidelines.       SA Gary Steakley: SA Steakley began his employment with      DCIS in December 1987. From that time until he entered the      Worker's Compensation program in February 1993 as a result of      a traffic accident involving a Government vehicle, he worked      in a variety of positions within DCIS. As Director, DCIS, I      selected him for several positions and promoted him to his      last job as manager of a DCIS investigative office in      California.       Subsequent to his vehicle accident, SA Steakley was the      subject of several adverse personnel and disciplinary      actions. With the exception of ensuring that internal reviews      proceeded in due course, my actions with respect to SA      Steakley were taken as the deciding official in these cases.      In addition, as Director, I proposed to involuntarily      transfer him in order to ``backfill'' his management billet      after his accident. In this case, the then Deputy Inspector      General acted as deciding official.       SA Steakley was treated fairly by DCIS, although he has      repeatedly alleged that he was subjected to prohibited      personnel practices. His allegations have been reviewed in      various venues, including the Office of Special Counsel who,      in December 1998, closed their file and declined to pursue      the case further.       SA Matthew Walinski: SA Walinski held a variety of      positions in DCIS from his initial hiring in August 1987,      until his transfer to the Office of Inspector General,      Department of the Treasury, earlier this year. Your staff has      questioned the accuracy of several reports of interview      prepared by SA Walinski to include a report dealing with SA      Steakley. It is my understanding that your staff perceives      that allegations concerning SA Walinski were not pursued with      the same tenacity shown in the SA Steakley investigations.       I was not aware of many of the facts alleged in this matter      until reviewing documents in response to the inquiry of your      Subcommittee. I did, however, have a general concern at the      time regarding the handling of internal investigations. As a      result, I directed that the internal review process be      restructured so as to ensure that all future interviews be      taped and transcribed to preclude any further dispute as to      reporting. I was also appraised by my deputy that SA Walinski      was being transferred from his duties to a position in the      DCIS Training Branch. It is my understanding that SA Walinski      received a downgraded appraisal as a result of his poor      performance as well as a written letter cautioning him as to      the importance of accuracy in his reporting.       In closing, I hope that my insights have provided you the      information you need to accurately assess these cases. I      appreciate your assurance that this letter will be included      in any report that may be issued on this topic and look      forward to an opportunity to review your draft report.           Sincerely,                                                   Donald Mancuso,                                         Acting Inspector General.
