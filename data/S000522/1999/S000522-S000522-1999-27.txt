Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to explain the bill.  I rise in strong support of H.R. 2367, the Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act. Let me point out to my colleagues that on June 29, the Subcommittee on International Relations and Human Rights held a hearing on U.S. policy toward the victims of torture. The testimony that was presented that day emphasized the continuing and compelling need for this legislation. Those who suffer the unspeakable cruelty of torture at the hands of despotic governments bear physical, emotional and psychological scars for the rest of their lives. Often, the ordeal of torture does not end with the victim's release from a gulag, laogai, or prison. Without professional help and rehabilitation, many torture victims will never get their lives back.  United States law, Madam Speaker, regarding torture victims took a giant step forward on October 30, 1998, with the enactment of Public Law 105-320, the Torture Victims Relief Act. I am proud to have been the principal sponsor of that act, which was cosponsored by 30 of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It authorized $12.5 million over 2 years for assistance to torture victim treatment centers in the United States and another $12.5 million for assistance to treatment centers in other countries around the world. It also authorized a U.S. contribution in the amount of $3 million per year to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Torture Victims. Finally, it required specialized training for State Department personnel in the identification of torture and its long-term effects, techniques for interviewing torture victims, and related subjects.  To continue the good work that that law began, I, along with the chairman of the Committee on International Relations, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney), our ranking member on the subcommittee, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), introduced H.R. 2367, the Torture Victims Relief Act Reauthorization. It will extend and increase the authorizations of last year's act through fiscal year 2003.  For each of the 3 fiscal years it covers, the reauthorization act authorizes $10 million for domestic treatment centers. The Center for Victims of Torture estimates that there are as many as 400,000 victims of foreign governmental torture in the United States. At present there are only 14 domestic treatment centers which are able to serve only a small fraction of the torture victim population here in this country. Because many of their clients do not have health insurance, the centers must bear most of the costs of treatment. Our hope is that the money authorized by H.R. 2367 will support these existing efforts and perhaps even enable the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement to establish much needed new centers.  Madam Speaker, the bill also authorizes $10 million per year for international treatment centers. According to the International Rehab Council for Torture Victims, the IRCT, the leading international nongovernmental organization engaged in treating victims of torture, $33 million is needed in 1999 alone for international rehab centers. Currently there are about 175 torture victim treatment centers around the world.  The bill also authorizes $5 million per year for a United States contribution to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. I am pleased to note that the administration greatly increased the U.S. contribution to the fund this year to $3 million, the full level authorized by the Torture Victims Relief Act. We should continue this trend, and I believe we should expand our effort for this worthwhile multilateral effort.  Finally, the bill requires, as it did before, that the State Department report on its efforts to provide specialized training to foreign service officers, as mandated by the Torture Victims Relief Act. It is important that our personnel who deal with torture victims be able to identify evidence of torture and its long-term effects, and that they learn techniques for interviewing torture victims who may still be suffering trauma from their experiences.  At our recent subcommittee hearing, it became apparent that the State Department has not yet implemented the training required by the act. This reporting requirement will serve as a wake-up call to prompt the Department to fulfill its statutory obligations.  Madam Speaker, for the Record I am inserting correspondence between the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley), of the Committee on Commerce, regarding the jurisdictional aspects of this bill, and I greatly appreciate the willingness of the gentleman from Virginia to accede to consideration of this measure on the suspension calendar. I hope all Members will support this legislation.         Committee on International Relations, House of            Representatives,                               Washington, DC, September 17, 1999.     Hon. Tom Bliley,      Chairman, Committee on Commerce, House of Representatives.       Dear Tom: I am writing to thank the Committee on Commerce      for its willingness to waive consideration of H.R. 2367, the      Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act of 1999. As you      correctly note, the Committee on International Relations and      the sponsors of the bill believe it is important to bring      this legislation before the House as expeditiously as      possible.       I am writing to confirm our understanding, upon which your      agreement to waive Committee consideration of the bill was      premised:       Although I am hopeful that the Senate will pass the bill as      passed by the House, I agree to support the appointment of      Commerce Committee conferees, should a conference be convened      on this legislation.       I will gladly include your September 10, 1999 letter as      part of the record during consideration of the bill by the      House.       Thank you again for your prompt attention to this time-     sensitive matter. Do not hesitate to contact me with any      additional questions or suggestions you may have.           Sincerely,                                               Benjamin A. Gilman,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Commerce,                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1999.     Hon. Benjamin A. Gilman,     Chairman, House Committee on International Relations, Rayburn          House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Ben: On September 9, 1999, the Committee on      International Relations ordered reported H.R. 2367, the      Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act of 1999. H.R.      2367, as ordered reported by the Committee on International      Relations, reauthorizes programs for the support and      treatment of torture victims through a variety of sources. As      you know, the Committee on Commerce was granted an additional      referral upon the bill's introduction pursuant to the      Committee's jurisdiction over health and health facilities      under Rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives.       Because of the importance of this matter, I recognize your      desire to bring this legislation before the House in an      expeditious manner and will waive consideration of the bill      by the Commerce Committee. By agreeing to waive its      consideration of the bill, the Commerce Committee does not      waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 2367. In addition, the      Committee on Commerce reserves its authority to seek      conferees on any provisions of the bill that are within the      Commerce Committee's jurisdiction during any House-Senate      conference that may be convened on this legislation. I ask      for your commitment to support any request by the Committee      on Commerce for conferees on H.R. 2367 or related      legislation.       I request that you include this letter as a part of your      committee's report on H.R. 2367 and as part of the Record      during consideration of the legislation on the House floor.       Thank you for your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Bliley,                                                         Chairman.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
