 President, I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee, as well as the Senator from Texas. International relations, this would be a very serious mistake for us to make. Beyond commerce, this will do damage, in my view,to our relations also with Great Britain. This will make it difficult for us to make the case that when we want foreign courts to make concessions based upon our needs, for them to be willing to do so, I think it is a mistake.  I understand and admire the Senator from Alabama for his desire to protect the interests of a citizen or citizens of his State, or others, but I think this is a mistake.  I yield the floor.
