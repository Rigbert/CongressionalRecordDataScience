President, today I am introducing a bill, along with my colleagues Senators Thompson and Bennett, that will require the Department of Justice to pay the legal fees of a former Federal employee, Sheila Heslin, who incurred these expenses as a direct result of the campaign finance investigations conducted by the Congress, the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency.  Earlier this fall, Ms. Heslin testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about actions she took while performing her official duties as an employee of the National Security Council. Everyone who observed her testimony was impressed with her honesty and courage in resisting high-level political pressure. Ms. Heslin told us how other governmental and political officials pressured her to approve a request that Roger Tamraz, a major contributor with an unsavory reputation, be allowed to meet with President Clinton. She resisted these overtures in an effort to protect the integrity of the White House and to ensure that our foreign policy was conducted appropriately. Of all the individuals who testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about the campaign finance problems, Ms. Heslin provided the best example of how career Government officials ought to conduct themselves. She demonstrated courage and a high regard for the proper conduct of U.S. foreign policy.  Ms. Heslin participated in these proceedings as a witness, not as the subject of any investigation. She has provided important information on events and activities that may well become the subject of prosecution. As a result, Ms. Heslin was forced to retain private counsel to advise her in the various investigations because representation by Government counsel would have presented a clear conflict of interest.  It is my understanding that the Department of Justice has to date declined to reimburse Ms. Heslin for the legal fees relating to her testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and other similar inquiries. She is now a private citizen with a new baby and without the personal wealth to afford the legal representation her service as a Government employee has required. As an important and fully cooperative witness in these investigations, she has set an example that ought to not be discouraged by denying Government payment for outside legal representation in a case involving appropriate actions taken during her Federal employment.  Under existing regulations, the Department of Justice normally approves the payment of legal fees for Government employees when ``the actions for which representation is requested reasonably appears to have been performed within the scope of the employees's employment'' and payment is ``in the interest of the United States.'' Both requirements have been met in the case Sheila Heslin.  Moreover, Mr. President, in connection with other investigations, the Department of Justice has paid the legal fees of hundreds of Government employees, some of whom were high-level political appointees. For example, in fiscal year 1996, political appointees at the White House and on the Vice President's staff were reimbursed thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees. To deny the payment of legal fees to Ms. Heslin, who is not suspected of any wrongdoing, while at the same time paying the legal fees of many other Government employees, some of whom were being investigated for possible illegal activities, is simply unfair.  Earlier this month, I asked the Attorney General to personally address this matter and to reverse the decision denying reimbursement to Ms. Heslin. I am still waiting for Attorney General Reno's response to my letter.  In the absence of action by the Department of Justice, I am introducing this bill which directs the Attorney General to pay reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Ms. Heslin as a result of the campaign finance investigations. To ensure that such payments are not excessive, it is intended that the amounts be determined in accordance with applicable Justice Department regulations.  Mr. President, this bill is not only for Sheila Heslin. It is also to send a clear message to every career Government employee who in the future has to choose between succumbing to inappropriate political pressure or doing the right thing. It is also for the American people who are the ultimate beneficiaries when public servants put the interests of the country ahead of the interests of those seeking to buy access and influence for their own narrow purposes.  Mr. President, it is regrettable that we cannot do more to reward people who follow the high standards of conduct we all espouse. At the very least, we should ensure that the actions of their Government do not penalize them. For that reason, I hope my colleagues will support this measure.                                 ______                                       By
