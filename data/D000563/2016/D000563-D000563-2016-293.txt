President, last week the city of Quincy, in my home State of Illinois, lost a tough, principled, and fair public servant--but more importantly, a fine man. Judge Richard F. Scholz, Jr., passed away at the age of 87.  Judge Scholz was the quintessential public servant. He was a voice for the underprivileged and a passionate advocate for the most vulnerable in the community. He spent more than 24years as a judge, fighting for at risk youths and a more equitable juvenile justice system. Although Judge Scholz could be tough, he had a softer side that put a gentle and compassionate face on the criminal justice system. He was celebrated in the courts for his well-reasoned and thoughtful decisions. Throughout his tenure, he was honored by several civic organizations and community groups, but it was dealing one-on-one with people that gave him the greatest joy and satisfaction.  Chuck Scholz, former Quincy mayor and Judge Scholz's nephew, recalled meeting a longtime Quincy resident who told him a story: ``Your uncle sent me to jail, and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.'' He went on to explain how Judge Scholz visited him one day at the correctional facility in St. Charles. The reason for his visit? To make sure he got his diploma while he was incarcerated. And when he was released, Judge Scholz got him a job. That is the kind of man Judge Scholz was. He understood that the job didn't end in his courtroom.  Judge Scholz believed in serving the community by serving the individual. He knew the recipe for building strong, healthy communities was getting the right people involved in the right way. And the community was better for it.  Born in 1928, Judge Scholz grew up in Quincy and attended St. Francis grade school, Quincy Notre Dame High School, St. Ambrose College, and the University of Illinois. After college, he moved down south and received his law degree from Mercer University in Macon, GA. While studying law, he met and married Ellen W. Scholz and shared 58 wonderful years before her death in 2009.  Following law school, the young couple returned to Quincy to raise their family and practice law with his father and brother. In 1958, he was elected judge of the 8th Judicial Circuit and served as chief judge from 1975 to 1979. In 1982, Judge Scholz retired from the bench and returned to private practice.  During his time on the bench, Judge Scholz presided over high profile cases, fought for higher pay for the county's chief probation officer and the Youth Home superintendent, and he worked tirelessly with community leaders to build the Adams County Youth Home, now the Adams County Juvenile Detention Center--one of only nine facilities of its kind in Illinois.  Hanging above the doorway at the Scholz family farm, there was a sign that read: ``You will only be a stranger here but once.'' Always willing to offer a helping hand, Judge Scholz made time for everyone. He helped young attorneys understand the right way to conduct themselves in and out of the courtroom. As a mentor to countless attorneys, judges, and children, Judge Scholz's mark on the community will endure for years.  I will close with one more story. Years ago, a mother from a Quincy family had been murdered. Her children were orphaned, and State welfare officials planned on placing them into different foster homes. Judge Scholz wouldn't hear of it. He said: ``No, you are not breaking up this family.'' The family stayed together, and there is a photo of them standing around Judge Scholz, with the words: our hero, carved into the picture--a hero indeed.  The stories of Judge Scholz's kindness and affection to the children and families in Quincy go on and on--what a legacy and what a great friend to the people of Quincy. Judge Scholz will certainly be missed.                          ____________________
