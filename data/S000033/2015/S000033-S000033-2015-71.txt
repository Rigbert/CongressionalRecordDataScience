 President, Social Security is arguably the most important Federal program we have. It is life and death to millions of senior citizens, people who have to figure out how they pay for food, how they heat their homes, how they pay for their medicine. Social Security is not going broke. It could pay out all benefits for the next 18 years.  What this provision does is make it clear that we go on record to not cut Social Security benefits, not raise theretirement age, not privatize Social Security. Let's stand with the seniors of this country. Let us protect Social Security, not cut it.
