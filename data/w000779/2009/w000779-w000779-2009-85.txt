President, today I am pleased to introduce two bills that will provide two important communities in rural Oregon with the means to promote their cultural history and their economic development opportunities, S. 1139 and S. 1140.  Like anywhere in America, the leaders in rural communities in my state are working every day to build the best place they can. And in many rural communities in my state, that means not much happens without the Federal Government involved. Like many places in the Western United States, the Federal Government owns much of the land surrounding these small communities. To be sure, many of these lands are treasures; they are the source of a vibrant tourism economy; an attraction for individuals and businesses to move to the region; and the daily outlet for the people lucky enough to live there.  By the same token, this high percentage of Federal land ownership sometimes limits the ability of local governments and civic leaders to solve problems and serve the public. The Federal Government can and should be an active partner in advancing communities and improving a region's quality of life.  So today I am introducing legislation that demonstrates the possibilities that can come from a quality Federal Government partnership with a proactive, innovative community that faces challenging economic conditions and a dominant pattern of Federal land ownership.  My first bill, the La Pine Land Conveyance Act, would convey two parcels of property to Deschutes County, Oregon. The bill directs the transfer of Bureau of Land Management BLM, lands to Deschutes County, that will enable the small town of La Pine to develop rodeo and equestrian facilities, public parks, and other recreation facilities.  La Pine has a set of unique challenges well known to the people of Deschutes County. The town recently incorporated, and with incorporation has come a feeling in the community that good things can happen if they work together to make their town as good as it can possibly be.  My bill proposes the transfer of 320 acres of BLM land contiguous to the La Pine city limit, on its western boundary. Ownership of this location will enable construction of public equestrian and rodeo facilities that have become increasingly important in La Pine. The property is within reasonable walking distance of downtown, creating an ideal parade route for the annual 4th of July Frontier Days parade. In addition, the land will provide a location for development of ball fields, parks, and recreation facilities, which can be developed as the town grows and budgets allow.  The La Pine Rodeo and Frontier Days events are currently facing the last year they can hold their events on the currently utilized location because that private property is being developed for other uses. So looking towards the Federal Government, who controls the vast majority of land in the La Pine area, to find a solution provides the right kind of partnership between the federal and local government.  My bill also directs the transfer of approximately 750 acres of BLM lands to Deschutes County for the purpose of expanding the town's wastewater treatment operation.  More than two years ago my office participated in discussions between the La Pine community leaders and the BLM concerning the La Pine community's need for land to serve public purposes. Due to staffing limitations, BLM asked the City to choose one top priority for a land transfer under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. The La Pine City Council responded immediately that its top priority wasthe acquisition of land to enable expansion of their sewer district.  To date, the land has not been transferred, which make this small community unable to be competitive for state and federal economic stimulus funds.  This project is too important to let languish. Perhaps the most important issue affecting water quality in Deschutes County involves the threat to groundwater and the Deschutes River from household septic systems in southern Deschutes County, the region around La Pine. This project directly reduces nitrate loading into south county groundwater in two ways. First, by enabling expansion of the District service boundary to residential areas where septic systems are generating elevated groundwater nitrate levels; and second, by closing the current location for spreading treated effluent, over a relatively high groundwater area, to this new location which is judged not to threaten groundwater. That is why I am introducing legislation today to make sure this transfer moves forward.  My second bill, the Wallowa Forest Service Compound Conveyance Act would convey an old Forest Service Ranger Station compound to the City of Wallowa, Oregon. In Wallowa County, this Forest Service compound was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930's. For many years it was the center of town and this site continues to represent the natural and cultural history of one of eastern Oregon's most beautiful communities. The City of Wallowa, along with County Commissioners, the local arts organizations, and a broad group of community leaders intend to restore this important example of Pacific Northwest rustic architecture and tribute to bygone times, making a valuable community interpretive center at this site. The conveyance of this property will allow the community to move forward with this project. The community is currently working to list the Ranger Station on the National Register of Historic Places, and ownership by the City will allow this coalition to restore the buildings and again develop a vibrant community center. Oregon Public Broadcasting aired a segment depicting an early 20th century railroad logging community--a significant part of the rich and diverse history and traditions that will be preserved and celebrated as this Forest Service Compound is developed as an interpretive center.  I want to express my thanks to all the citizens and community leaders that have worked to build their communities and develop these projects. They represent the pioneering spirit and vision that defines my State.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1139       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
