 We may not fully agree on this issue but I commend my colleague's efforts to develop a bipartisan Higher Education Act reauthorization and the challenges in moving such a bill through the Senate on a reconciliation bill.  I thank my colleague Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this issue, and I look forward to working with him and the chairman through conference on this issue. I appreciate the chairman's commitment to work with me through that process to make sure my voice is heard and interests are met. I think it is critical that, as we work with the House in conference on this issue and others, that we ensure protection and improvement of student benefits, and that any savings generated on this issue be returned to students. We must also work to advance and protect diversity in the lending market, which leads to the competition that provides for improving student benefits in lending.  I thank my colleague for his commitment to working with me and look forward to working with him and Senator Kennedy through that process.
