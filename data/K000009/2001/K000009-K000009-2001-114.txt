Chairman, I was just rising to either ask unanimous consent to strike the last word to get some of my own time on this or to plead with the chairman to see if we could not even get a few more minutes on each side. We have more speakers than we had anticipated, and it is an important issue and lives actually hang in the balance on it. I wondered if we might take a few additional minutes on each side.
