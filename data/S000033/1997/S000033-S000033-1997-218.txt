 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Essex Technical Center in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Lavery. Teenage smoking is a pressing issue in today's      society. We feel there is a need with the tobacco industry to      try to stop the sale of tobacco to minors. In recent news a      big deal was made involving the advertisement of tobacco. For      many years the Joe Camel figure in Camel cigarettes has been      under the gun. The government believes that advertising is      promoting smoking to the young. This is a valid concern      considering 3,000 young people a day become a regular smoker      according to the 1994 report of the Institute of medicine      from the National Academy of Sciences. The number keeps      climbing and in 1995, 4.8 percent of students said they had      smoked in the last 30 days. Two years earlier in 1993, 3.5      percent said they had smoked in the last 30 days. Two years      earlier in 1993, 3.5 percent said they had smoked within the      last month. Most of these students admit to buying them      without showing proof of ID.       Should the responsibility of cracking down on selling be      the sole job of the police? For now it is. It also has to do      with store owners and enforcement of punishment and fines.      Steps to put more responsibility on store owners are being      taken such as the new photo ID law and carding everyone who      looks under 27. As a 17-year-old I can tell you I have bought      cigarettes when I was younger and had no problem. I have      noticed a change in carding more now than I did when I was      15.       The problem is that cigarettes are too accessible to kids.      We took a survey at Essex Technical Center on Do you smoke,      why or why not? 64 percent of the people said that they had      smoked. 35 percent said that they started because of peer      pressure. The majority of the non-smokers said they did not      smoke because it was gross and it kills you.       We have a tape of interviews from students. We also have      those surveys that we did that we can give you and we did.      Perhaps we should also show you why the percentages chose to      smoke. I feel I have smoked previous in my young years and I      quit it because I do not feel I want to die like that. I      think it is a disgusting death.       Ms. Bedel. Yes, it causes cancer, lung cancer, emphysema,      and for young kids it is mostly the fact that the health is--     you know, in physical activity, you know, people aren't      involved in sports as much and I think it is social. It      really has to do with the social part of school.       Ms. Lavery. A lot of it is peer pressure. They see their      friends doing it and everyone picks on you if you do not do      it and you get curious and you try doing it and then it is      very addictive.       Ms. Bedell. I do not think it has to do with people picking      on other people about it, I think it has to do with like the      younger grades in the high school see seniors or juniors in      high school smoking and I think that that has a lot to do      with it. I know at the Tech Center we go to you are not      allowed to--well you cannot smoke on any school property      anymore and we have to go off school property to smoke, and I      think it is just--it is not a privilege because we do not      have a privilege, we have to leave, but I think the younger      students see it as a way to get out of school or a way to try      to fit in with the older kids. Government control over      smoking is going overboard but the money that is spent on      smoking is outrageous and kind of ridiculous considering the      fact that more and more teenagers are smoking each year. And      I agree with the new photo ID law, I am all for that, but I      do not think it is being watched enough, I do not think it is      being used in many cases in small businesses, and I think it      has to start at home, that the government has to take it out      of the police's hands and like storeowners' hands and put it      into the homes and you know, teach parents how to talk to      their kids about smoking because it starts at home.                               ____________________
