President, the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign Operations has a long history of bipartisanship. Over the years, I have served as either chairman or ranking member, and I am pleased that cooperation between Republicans and Democrats is as strong today as it has ever been.  I want to commend Senator Graham, the chairman of the subcommittee, who has been a passionate defender of the budget for international affairs as a key component of our national security strategy. He understands that the use of military power is often an insufficient--indeed inappropriate--way to solve problems or protect our security. There are times when the use of military force is necessary, but diplomacy and development can be a cost-effective investment to avoid the far more costly and dangerous deployment of U.S. troops.  Earlier today, the subcommittee heard testimony from five outstanding private sector witnesses on this very subject--Bill Gates, co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Ben Affleck, co-founder of the Eastern Congo Initiative; ADM James Stavridis, former Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, former Commander of U.S. Southern Command, and current dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University; Scott Ford, founder of Westrock Coffee Company and the Rwanda Trading Company; and John Megrue, chairman of Apax Partners U.S., chairman of Born Free, chairman of the Business Leadership Council for a Generation Born HIV Free, and a director of Millennium Promise and of Grameen America.  Each of these witnesses made a compelling case for increased funding for the international affairs budget. They gave inspiring examples of how partnerships between the U.S. Agency for International Development and civil society organizations in poor countries have brought dramatic improvements to the lives of local people, and more open and stable societies.  In a world that is perhaps more dangerous and unpredictable as any time since World War II, we have a chance to help promote economic growth and political stability, and in doing so build sustainable foreign partners. It is therefore ironic that today we were presented with an amendment, offered by the junior Senator from Kentucky, to slash the international affairs budget by nearly 50 percent for the purpose of bolstering defense spending, even though the Pentagon is among the strongest supporters of diplomacy and development. Fortunately that amendment was resoundingly defeated by a vote of 96 to 4.  At just 1 percent of total Federal spending, this account cannot and should not serve as a bill payer for other priorities. Nor will reducing foreign assistance benefit our military. In fact, the opposite is true, and I commend Senator Graham for calling today's hearing in order to explain why.  I ask unanimous consent that an October 21, 2014 op-ed by retired Gen. Anthony Zinni and retired ADM James Stavridis, entitled Fighting Extremism Requires Foreign Aid, Too be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            [Oct. 21, 2014]              Fighting Extremism Requires Foreign Aid, Too            (By Gen. Anthony Zinni and Adm. James Stavridis)       The American people are justifiably alarmed at the rise of      ISIS and their unspeakable atrocities that are further      destabilizing parts of the Middle East. The threats to our      allies in the region like Israel and Jordan are real, as is      the potential for terrors attacks here on American soil.       But the hard truth is that these terror threats staring us      square in the eye cannot be resolved by military power      alone--nor can it end the cycle of other security-related      challenges occurring in Ukraine, the South China Sea and in      parts of Central America, just to name a few.       The important lessons we learned in our military careers is      that countering the threats to our nation require      comprehensive responses that utilize all our elements of      national power--military and non-military. An indispensable      part of the non-military toolkit is foreign aid--one of the      least appreciated and yet vital means for advancing America's      interests around the world.       Today's battles require melding our military power with      civilian efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and      support the creation of well-functioning governance systems      and civil society, build infrastructure, coalesce diverse      nations around common goals, and promote economic      development. In short, everything that is necessary to      improve the long-term prospects of a nation and keep      extremists from exploiting misery and desperation.       These lessons were made clear after World War II. Through      the Marshall Plan and the creation of Bretton Woods      institutions, the United States helped to rebuild the      economies of our former enemies on the battlefield, Germany      and Japan, who are now strong and valuable contributors to      the global economy and security. The same holds true for      South Korea. None of this came cheap or easy, but we've      reaped the rewards through decades of peace and stability in      these regions. More recently, American-led initiatives in      Colombia and the Balkans have made significant progress in      bringing stability and economic growth after years of      conflict.       The recent status of forces agreement between the United      States and Afghanistan is a good first step toward creating      stability and prosperity in Afghanistan, which is in our      vital national interest. Our efforts will be led by the State      Department in diplomacy and USAID and other civilian agencies      in helping to strengthen governance, rebuild the economy and      educational systems, and move farmers away from growing      poppies. These are roles our diplomatic services and      development agencies, with the support of our military, are      best equipped to play.       For all these reasons, our nation, at long last, needs to      reject misguided narratives that question the value of      foreign aid. The opinion polls consistently showing the      American people favor cutting and even eliminating foreign      aid are deeply troubling--and are often based on wildly      inflated estimates of what we spend in the first place: one      percent of the federal budget.       Make no mistake, the money spent on these programs can save      countless dollars and lives by averting more costly military      involvement and humanitarian crises. That's why we see these      programs as the difference between preventative care and      trauma care. As former Defense Secretary Robert Gates      memorably said, ``Development is a lot cheaper than sending      soldiers.''       The world has changed dramatically since the Cold War when      we began our military     service, and so have the threats confronting our nation.      That's why we must employ all the means of American influence      and power, including strong and effective foreign aid. We're      confident the return on that investment is an essential      contribution to our national security.       General Anthony Zinni, USMC (Ret.) is the former Commander      in Chief of U.S. Central Command. Admiral James Stavridis,      USN (Ret.) is former NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe      and Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts      University. Both are co-chairs of the National Security      Advisory Council of the US Global Leadership Coalition, a      broad-based coalition of more than 400 businesses and NGOs      that supports a smart power foreign policy.                          ____________________
