 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following convention transmitted to the Senate on November 10, 1999, by the President of the United States: Treaty with Ukraine on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters (Treaty Document No. 106-16).  I further ask that the convention be considered as having been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's message be printed in the record.
