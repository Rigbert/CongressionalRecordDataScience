Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. The gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) is a great committee chairman.  One thing that bothers me the most, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) has never been to ANWR, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson) has never been to ANWR, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert) has never been to ANWR. They do not know what they are talking about, period. They are literally taking scripted messages from certain interest groups, that is all they are doing, and mimicking their words.  My people, my people the Kaktovik, they want this drilling. The Eskimos that live there want this drilling. They have seen what has happened in Prudhoe Bay, which has in fact increased the population of the caribou, increased the game population overall.  We can do this safely. To have people sit on this floor, because it is supposed to be the hall of the people, the Representatives of the people, to speak about something they know nothing about is, frankly, very disturbing to me.  I am one of these few people who understand one thing: this is a form of representative government. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) did not go. He had an opportunity to go up and listen to the people, my people, many people who were guaranteed 92,000 acres by this body, and they had it for their social and economic well-being; and you are telling them they cannot in fact drill on their own land. Shame on you.
