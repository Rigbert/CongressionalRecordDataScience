 It is Thursday, 3:15 p.m., and we have finished our business. A lot of people have talked to me about that, and I just thought I would note it.  On Monday next, the House will not be in session in observance of the Columbus Day holiday. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. next Tuesday. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We expect to consider H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act; H.R. 2095, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act; and H.R. 3056, Tax Collection Responsibility Act.  On Friday, there will be no votes in the House.  That is a change in the schedule so everybody will want to note that. That means we expect to have no votes on any Friday for the balance of the month.
