Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 266 to recognize the great benefits of music education. Americans are known around the world for our unique contributions to modem music. But we are far behind many other industrialized Nations in recognizing the educational benefits of teaching music to our children. In Japan, it is mandated by the Ministry of Education that every child, grades one through nine, receive two hours a week of music instruction. In Germany students must take two, 45-minute classes of music education a week.  Unfortunately, in America, the trend over the last several years has been to cut back on music education programs. This is occurring despite mounting evidence that music education can actually alter brain development in children and improve their reasoning skills. A study from the University of California at Irvine found that elementary school students in Los Angeles who took piano lessons boosted their math performance. From the body of data available, researchers have concluded that there are genuine long-term changes in the wiring of the brain that enhance children's abilities to understand how patterns work in time and space.  The educational benefits are clear and according to a recent Gallup poll, nine in tenAmericans believe that music education should be a part of every student's day.  Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of working with the GRAMMY Foundation, the non-profit arm of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. The GRAMMY Foundation is dedicated to advancing music education in schools. We recently held an event here on Capitol Hill to announce that the New American schools, a non-profit corporation established by President Bush to identify new ways of teaching, has welcomed the GRAMMY Foundation's Leonard Bernstein centers for artful learning into their portfolio of cutting-edge educational models.  The GRAMMY Foundation brings music to thousands of children through their ``GRAMMY in The Schools'' program which exposes high schools students to careers in the music industry.  And the Foundation created Smart Symphonies, a classical music CD based on brain research to benefit the development of infants. I applaud the efforts of the GRAMMY Foundation to make music and art education available for all children.  Mr. Speaker, I support this Resolution in the hope that children of all ages across this nation will have access to quality music education programs. If we foster the creative impulses of our children, the possibilities of their success in life will be boundless.                          ____________________
