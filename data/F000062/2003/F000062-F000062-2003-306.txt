  I wish to make one comment about this amendment. This amendment has been in the Agriculture Committee. It has had a hearing. It has been reviewed by both staffs, Republican and Democratic. The Democratic chairman of the committee, Senator Harkin, worked on this. The ranking member at the time, Senator Lugar, worked on this. They have both concurred. They are supporting this legislation. The staffs have reviewed it.  We believe it is bona fide, that it is solid, and that it will stand the test of time.  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.
