Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, in fiscal year 1994, this program was funded at $106 million. The bill before us has a funding level for this program at $152.8 million for fiscal year 1997. Now, that is an increase of about 45 percent over a 3-fiscal-year period.  I believe that that increase is generous enough in light of the extreme fiscal situation that we are facing and the bipartisan drive to try to balance the budget.  Also, the amendment that has been offered by the gentleman from Virginia, while well-intentioned, is an add-on without corresponding offsets. We went through that entire issue in the last amendment, and the House voted very strongly in favor of, where we do have add-on, to have a corresponding offset so that the bill will maintain its fiscal neutrality.  This amendment does not maintain fiscal neutrality. It ends up increasing the authorization by $34 million-plus, and that means $34 million-plus of deficit spending should the Committee on Appropriations match the authorization level.  In summation, I do not think that we need this additional money. I think that it is important that there be on offset, not an add-on. I believe that this program has been given generous increases over the last 3 fiscal years under both Democratic and Republican-controlled Congresses and the amount that is in the bill unamended is enough.
