 Both bills passed out of committee with unanimous support, were subject to hours of debate and deliberation, and included the input of both Democratic and Republican Senators.  The first appropriations measure, for transportation and housing infrastructure, will help ensure air travel is safer and more efficient, invest in important infrastructure, and strengthen America's surface transportation network.  As Senator Collins pointed out last week, this bill includes ``recommendations from more than 75 Senators from both sides of the aisle'' as well as more than three dozen amendments. I thank my friend from Maine for her skilled leadership and hard work with Ranking Member Reed of Rhode Island and colleagues from both sides to advance this measure.  The second funding measure, for veterans and military construction, will ensure that veterans receive benefits and health care they have earned while enhancing oversight and accountability at the VA, helping improve quality of life on military bases for soldiers and their families, and advancing critical national security projects like missile defense. As Senator Kirk noted last week, this bill incorporates over two dozen amendments, both from Democrats and Republicans. Senator Kirk is a true champion for veterans. I know he always had the needs of our heroes top of mind as he worked with Democrats, with Republicans, and in particular with Ranking Member Tester of Montana to move this critical bill forward.  By returning to regular order and working through the appropriations process, we have been able to pass appropriations measures like these that support national priorities in a responsible way.  I also appreciate Senators working toward a compromise approach for Zika. Preventing the spread of Zika is a priority for all of us, and I am pleased the Senate has approved a compromise provision to focus resources on this important health issue. We have now begun discussions on how best to resolve the differences between the House and the Senate and get a bill to the President.                          ____________________
