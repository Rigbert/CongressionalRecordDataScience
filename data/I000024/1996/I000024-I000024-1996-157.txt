We have approximately $40 billion already invested in the Navy's Aegis system that we are merely trying to upgrade to reach into the upper tier.  I would have to say that what offends me more than anything else, because I watch it at work, are the liberals who do not want to invest any money at all in a national defense system, referring to it as star wars because what you get in your head when you hear ``star wars'' is that it is some kind of an image of something from Buck Rogers--some of you may not remember that--or science fiction, when in fact anyone who was watching CNN during the Persian Gulf war knows the technology is there. This is something for which the technology is here.  We are almost there. It is a matter of spending a little more, about 10 percent more than what we have already spent to be able to defend ourselves against missile attack.  I did not really become wrapped up in this issue, Mr. President, until the bombing took place in my State of Oklahoma. I saw all the disaster surrounding that. I watched and heard the stories, and I knew people who were in there, people later found to be dead. I looked at that and I thought, that bomb was equal to 1 ton of TNT. The smallest nuclear warhead that we know of today is 1,000 times that size.  If you multiply the disaster that the whole world grieved over in Oklahoma City, multiply that by 1,000, it gives you some idea. Maybe it is the fact that this magnitude is more than we can comprehend. I do not know.
