A number of those are very important bills in the sense that they affect a large number of people.  We passed making permanent the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and 133 Republicans voted for that bill. It sits, languishing, in the United States Senate, led by a Republican leader.  We passed that anti-hate resolution, and 173 Republicans voted for that.  We passed comprehensive background checks, and only 2 Republicans voted for that. And 90 percent of America--90 percent of America--supports that bill. It sits, languishing, in the United States Senate, unattended.  We have passed 96 percent of the funding of government prior to June 30--96 percent. It hasn't been done before. It sits.  Not a single bill has passed the Republican-led United States Senate--not a single appropriation bill.  We passed a number of bills to make sure that the ACA was stable and preexisting conditions--Republicans didn't vote for that. Well, actually, eight did. It sits, languishing, in the United States Senate.                              {time}  1215  We passed a bill on climate action, what the Joint Chiefs of Staff say is one of the major challenges to our security. Three Republicans voted for that. It sits languishing in the United States Senate.  We passed disaster relief. That did pass.  We passed a lot of health legislation and prescription drug legislation. We said that prescription drug companies can't pay generics not to bring their product to the market. It is called ``pay to delay.'' We passed that. It sits languishing in the United States Senate.  Now, it either sits languishing in the United States Senate because Mitch McConnell is against all of those or it sits languishing so the Republicans can say: You haven't done anything. All you are doing is impeachment.  That is baloney.  Madam Speaker, we had a markup yesterday on a major bill that is going to save $345 billion, according to CBO, and bring prescription drug costs down for every American. It was marked up yesterday. We are going to bring it to the floor before we leave here this work period, and we are going to pass it.  I don't predict how many Republicans are going to vote for it, but I predict this: It will sit languishing in the United States Senate.  We passed the Equality Act so that every American would be treated consistent with our declaration that all are created equal, not just some. It sits languishing in the United States Senate.  So don't say we haven't done anything. Don't say impeachment is taking all of our time. It is not. We have one committee right now--other committees also--one committee now that is giving attention, as it should. But the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, the Education and Labor Committee, and so many other committees are dealing with substantive issues to make sure the lives of our people are better for the people.  I could read another 30 bills like that languishing in the Republican-led United States Senate.  We are doing our work. The government was shut down when we took over, the first time in history the government was shut down when a new Congress was sworn in--the first time. We spent 30 days just opening up the people's government.  We passed appropriations bills. But not one has passed the United States Senate, led by the Republican leadership in the United States Senate. So sad.  We ought to be doing our business. We are doing our business. We are doing the people's business. We are making their lives better, and we are going to continue to do it. And we can do the same as well in dealing with the constitutional protections and the protections of our national security dealing with the President of the United States.
