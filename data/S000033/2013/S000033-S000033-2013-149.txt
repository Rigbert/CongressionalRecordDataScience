 President, I ask to have printed in the Record finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Third Annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' Essay contest conducted by my office. These 21 finalists were selected from over 300 entries.  The essays follow.       Sydney Alderman, Mt. Abraham Union High School (Finalist)       Today we often face the problem of excessive violence      between people, starvation, and economic problems. People      aren't all getting what they need and something needs to be      done. What would fix everything, broaden our universal      communications skills and get things done quicker would be to      unite globally. By working as an entire unit we can all      communicate and work toward the same goal we all crave:      peace. Uniting globally can solve conflicts causing violence,      starvation, and economic problems.       Uniting globally will benefit the people of the world      immensely. By uniting globally it would be much easier to      distribute the necessary resources to sustain everyone, such      as food, water, and energy. When everyone is on the same page      and communicating thoroughly between territories, you can      maintain fair trade and further discuss what laws and human      rights need to be established as well. When we're all united      for a common goal, let's assume peace amongst all people,      discussion is more productive and conclusive and proper      action can be taken at a faster pace. Actions such as      bringing food and water to those who have none, and also      getting the area with these conditions re-established for      suitable living conditions. Everyone benefits from a united      world.       The U.S. economy will be heavily benefitted by uniting      globally. When we unite globally, trade is faster and we can      simply work faster because communication is quicker and more      conclusive than when we're all thinking separately. Trade      will therefore be quicker and we can be more productive about      it with such open communication. It would be easier to      discuss the distribution of currency amongst countries and      people and how we can fix the current economic problems.      Uniting globally will solve the biggest problems of the      world. It will broaden the communication between territories      and will help us resolve conflicts causing famine, violence,      and economic problems universally. When we all band together      we can accomplish anything and finally bring a new era of      peace.         Tyler Bradley, South Burlington High School (Finalist)       Our country needs to invest in clean sustainable energy and      decrease our dependence for oil from other nations. Our      nation should be investing in wind and solar power. Wind is a      renewable source of energy, which will last forever. It does      not pollute our environment and is all natural. Solar energy      also provides us with clean energy, with no combustion. It      too is renewable and causes no greenhouse gases. Although      wind and solar, as energy sources, may prove to be expensive,      it is a small price to pay for the health and safety of our      environment. In contrast, we are eventually going to run out      of oil and the high cost of transporting oil and our      dependency on other nations needs to be eliminated.       We need to stop relying on foreign nations for our energy      supply. If foreign governments continue to control oil      profits they can use that money to fund terrorism mischief.      In addition, these energy rich countries can restrict the oil      supply and therefore make the United States a hostage to      their demands. We need to end this cycle and invest in more      sustainable energy sources.       We need Congress to work harder to obtain sustainable      energy tax incentives like the Investment Tax Credit and      Production Tax Credits. These credits will help reduce the      cost of wind and solar projects and in the long run help      reduce global warming. All across our earth we currently see      record heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and      extreme droughts and floods. The United States must lead the      world in reversing global warming, to preserve a safe planet      for our children and grandchildren.          Annie Arthur, Woodstock Union High School (Finalist)       To be a democracy, our country must be able to hear the      voices of every citizen individually and the population as a      whole. People all over the world are sacrificing their lives      for the hope of the right to vote. In the United States,      eligibility is simple. To vote, one must be a citizen of the      United States and be 18 or older. However, a country as great      as ours does not seem able to succeed in a very seemingly      simple task: vote freely. The State of our Union is teetering      on the edge.       In the 2012 Presidential Election, only 57.5% of the entire      eligible population cast their ballots. About 93 million      citizens did not participate in this most basic foundation of      democracy. How is the United States supposed to run as an      effective democracy if so many citizens remain silent in such      a crucial time to make their voices heard? Granted, part of      this lack of voting is caused by laziness, indifference or      belief that one vote will not change the outcome. However,      there are many citizens who want to vote but restrictions      imposed at the state level have either attempted or succeeded      to suppress participation in this election. In this recent      election there were laws passed to hinder voter participation      by making it difficult to register to vote, requiring voter      photo identifications, miscommunication of date and times,      and threatening voters with imprisonment for voter fraud.      Officials also succeeded in cutting early voting periods,      voting by mail, polling hours and number of locations. Even      though courts temporarily struck down many of these efforts,      there is no reason to believe that state officials will be      deterred from imposing more voting restrictions in the      future.       This national issue should not be determined at state      level. Restriction on voting is a federal problem and should      be addressed by federal powers. This is too important an      issue to leave to individual state governments as clearly      demonstrated by the blatant attempts to deny citizens their      right to vote. The solution is to simply create basic      standards on voting. The federal government could pass a bill      with minimum guidelines for states to follow on voting laws.      This legislation does not need to be a complex list of      restrictions; this bill would be freeing up voting laws by      listing only what needs to happen to achieve successful      voting. Each state would then have the freedom to expand on      these basic requirements. This bill could facilitate      registration, polling hours and ability to mail in votes. It      is an American's right to be able to vote. As the world's      greatest democracy, no political party should be able to      obstruct voting. The United States, a nation for the people,      of the people, by the people needs to set a better example as      the standard bearer of democracy.   Jeannine Bissonette, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)       Ever since Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1913, it has been      a tradition for Presidents to address the nation with their      State of the Union report. As President Obama prepares to      present his State of the Union address, many politically      concerned citizens begin to ponder the thoughts of what will      be produced in the next four years.       With a current national unemployment rate of 7.9%, the      numbers appear to be much lower than the 10% that the United      States endured during October of 2009. Although these rates      suggest a recuperating recession, they have not yet reached a      level in which the nation can sit back comfortably. These      high unemployment rates understandably result in a greater      necessity for more families to reach out to social welfare      services such     as food stamps and local food shelves. According to a local      press interview with food shelf coordinator Mary Ann      Castimore, the Vergennes Congregational Church found      themselves serving a total of approximately fifty to sixty      new families. People are struggling to find and hold steady      jobs; feeding their families continues to be growing concern.       Corresponding with the current economy, the United States      could certainly do more to address the concerns of the young      people. With the lack of vacant positions in the working      world, young adults are learning quickly that it does not      matter so much what they've majored in, but what is      available. As a high school student of Vermont, I have become      increasingly aware of my school advisor's push for me to look      into which fields are in need of laborers, rather than those      that suit me best when determining an occupation. As the      pursuit for jobs lengthens, it is important that the      government restricts outsourcing jobs to other countries and      create said jobs within the nation. Instead of outsourcing      jobs, the United States should provide incentives to retain      these positions in America.       As the United States adapts to the most severe recession      since the Great Depression, the American citizens' fear of a      failing economy is justified. Major issues such as the      nearing fiscal cliff or changes in Social Security are      becoming more common parts of American conversation. As      January approaches, politicians in D.C. are running out to      time to make the decision of who will be taxed in the coming      years. By taxing Americans making over two hundred and fifty-     thousand dollars, more taxes can be gleaned by the federal      government. Additionally, more citizens being taxed results      in more equitable terms. As a federal insurance program,      Social Security is praised highly for the benefits it      provides the retired population. Since American citizens are      now living into their eighties, a shortage in Social Security      money has materialized. The inadequacy of funds has led to an      extended retirement age which is predicted to continue      increasing into the future. The United States must continue      to raise the retirement age in order for Social Security to      continue operating. It takes time and multiple strategies to      solve any major issue: there is no one perfect solution.               Jonah Blatt, Milton High School (Finalist)       Good Evening America,       There are several issues that need to be addressed here      tonight that will benefit our nation in one way or another.      First off, I'd like to touch on the topic of unemployment.      The unemployment rate has dropped significantly. The rate was      10% in November of 2009, which was the highest from January      1st 2009 to January 1st 2013. In the middle of that, the rate      bounced up and down between 9% and 9.5% from 2010 to 2011.      Now here we sit today on a continuous, steady decline all the      way down to 7.7%, and I assure you it is not over. Jobs were      being created at a rate of 151,000 per month in 2012 and we      look to raise that number this coming year. My new plan      allows workers who have lost their job to be placed on      temporary jobs as trainees for short periods to retain their      skills or gain new ones while still receiving benefits. This      was released on April 19th where the unemployment rate was      8.2% and now it is 7.7%. It's working, America.       Cannabis, or better known as marijuana has become a major      topic of discussion these days in America. Is it a medical      miracle or an addiction amongst many? The Office of National      Drug Control Policy and I have stated that we oppose the      legalization of marijuana and other drugs since legalization      would increase the availability and use of other illegal      drugs. Their legalization would bring more health and safety      risks closer to your homes. The legalization and selling of      marijuana could bring some positive to our attention. A      potential boost for the economy if it was sold and taxed      heavily. However in the end I strongly oppose the      legalization process and it should only remain available for      medical use only. The risks strongly outweigh the positives.       Over 50 years ago we created a strong, close relationship      with Israel. We have done joint military planning along with      military research and weapons development. We have      continuously assisted Israel with $3.1 billion in security      assistance and I will not be the president to stop that      trend. The only way for Israel to achieve peace with their      neighbors is to begin with a clear and strong commitment to      the security of Israel. They are also a big export consumer      to our economy. We must stand by our ally through these tough      times between them and the Palestinians. We will look to both      sides to find a common ground to install peace back into the      world between these rival nations. I am in support of      resumption of the aid to the Palestinian government with a      condition that the government renounce terrorism. Israel has      a right to defend themselves from these Palestinian rocket      attacks, but we will look to peace first in order to draw      this to an end. Israel is an important ally in all      perspectives. We must help them.       Thank you and good night America.       Allie Bull, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)       The United States of America is known as the land of      profuse opportunity for all who come here. Throughout the      history of this country, there have been events to be proud      of and events that were not too glorious. As the world      prepares for the new year of 2013, it is a good idea to      reflect as we explore the state of this union, and gain      insight into how this country is running.       Congress is seemingly dysfunctional right now. The current      Congress has passed the least number of bills in history.      This statistic is shocking and embarrassing. The system of      checks and balances within our democracy is designed to      prevent an abuse of power. It is also a known fact that our      system takes longer to pass bills and get things done;      however, the current state of gridlock is not okay. The      nation is frustrated with the leaders and the lack of      compromise in Washington. Congress needs to become a leader      of the whole nation, and not individual leaders of each      political party. The wall between each party needs to be let      down and national issues need to be addressed. It is hard for      congressmen to make decisions that could affect reelection;      yet, the lack of progress being made is not making the      constituents any happier. It is better for these leaders to      leave the nation stronger and prosperous than when they      arrived, as opposed to an unchanged, struggling country.       In the shadow of the Sandy Hook Massacre, gun control      debates have resurfaced. This is a topic that needs to be      addressed, swiftly and promptly. Semi-automatic weapons are      completely and utterly unnecessary in the United States of      America. There is no reason that a person should need or      desire to own one. These weapons are killing machines and      should be banned. Americans have the right to bear arms, but      there is no need for weapons other than hunting weapons. Any      weapons that do remain legal in this country need to be      regulated and controlled with very thorough background      checks. However, the fact that semi-automatic weapons are      available isn't the only cause of these tragedies. Hollywood      portrays gun violence as exciting and desirable. That, in      combination with violent video games, leaves imprints in the      brains of impressionable young people (including the mentally      ill). Semi-automatic weapons should be banned, and violence      movies and games should be regulated. In this country there      is freedom of speech and expression, but the production of      these movies and games results in harm to other citizens. All      of these factors need to be addressed. Politicians who agree      with this stance need to step up and speak out despite the      possible damage to their reelection. The safety of the people      should be more important than reelection.       America is a bright and prosperous place. There are a few      issues dragging it down, but with the known strength of this      nation, these problems can be solved. The only way to fix big      problems is to lay down political barriers and work together,      hand-in-hand.       Emma Davitt, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)       The current state of our Union is multifaceted, filled with      diverse opinions and numerous obstacles. Our Union faces an      interesting future ahead, either a prosperous and promising      future, or a destructive and deleterious future. It is up to      us, the people of the United States, to do everything we can      to ensure a brilliant future, to promise fortuitous and      successful lives for our succeeding generations.       We are currently coping with the most intense, severe      recession in our country since the Great Depression. 7.9% of      the people in the United States are out of work, struggling      to find jobs and earn a living. Detrimental taxes are      traumatizing families, college graduates' degrees are rarely      helping them secure jobs and, throughout these unfortunate      situations, many Americans are still focusing on abortions      and gay marriage rights. It is time for our nation to accept      individuality, embrace the freedom our country was founded      upon, and fix the major problems facing the people of the      United States of America.       The unemployment rate is uncomfortably high. In 2008, many      businesses closed, numerous workers were laid off and the      unemployment rate began to rise. As a result, jobs have      become more valuable, and at a time where few were      comfortable with their living situations and current bank      accounts, taxes rose. To address this situation, taxes must      be lowered for the lower and middle-class families while      returning the economy to a peaceful state, encouraging      businesses to grow and expand in the United States.       The economy is not only affecting the working class of our      nation, but also the children--the future. If children watch      their parents and older siblings with college degrees      struggle to find a job, what will make them want to go to      college? What will convince them that attending college is a      wonderful and beneficial experience? The young members of our      national community will one day be responsible for our      country and our only option to ensure a bright and promising      future is to nurture, teach and help this younger generation.      With this in mind, it should be of great importance to the      United States to make college education more affordable for      the young population. Through grants, aid and scholarships,      many more students will have the opportunities to attend      universities, and with an economy on the mend, we can look to      the future with great hope in the highly educated body that      will one day run the country.       Contemplating these issues, our Union has a lot to focus      on. We have run ourselves into a deep economic and      educational rut and it is our job to work together to climb      out of     it. The future of our country rests solely in the hands of      the upcoming generation, however, how can we have faith in      the subsequent decades if our current society struggles to      find jobs and attend college? The answer is rather simple,      the young people of our country have the chance to make      groundbreaking decisions and be amazing leaders, if given the      opportunities.       Taryn Druge, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)       In an idealistic world we would work for a common good.      Countries wouldn't consider money, land, or rivalry. They      would only see how they could create peace and maintain it.      As Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ``A point has been reached      where the peoples of the Americas must take cognizance of      growing ill-will, of marked trends toward aggression, of      increasing armaments, of shortening tempers--a situation      which has in it many of the elements that lead to the tragedy      of general war . . . Peace is threatened by those who seek      selfish power.'' It is my opinion that, in this world, we are      not driven by the ambition for peace but instead by the      ambition for wealth and power. We, the U.S., are no      different, as much as we would love to believe otherwise and      see ourselves as the peace bearers of the world. We must open      our eyes to the truth. Wealth and power must be relevant in      our dealings with foreign nations because these are some of      the only factors that will drive negotiation.       An example of the struggle for wealth and power is the      United States relationship with China. Currently, the U.S. is      deeply uneasy about China, to whom we are deeply indebted,      for they are our greatest supplier of goods. It is      frightening to think that China's withdrawal could destroy      our entire economy, yet our withdrawal from China would      cripple them as well. Instead of the dependence creating      unity among our nations, it has created discomfort and      hostility. The power complex each country has creates the      belief that dependence upon one another weakens us. When      Thomas Jefferson said, ``Dependence begets subservience and      venality, suffocates the germ of virtue, and prepares fit      tools for the designs of ambition,'' Jefferson could never      foresee that U.S. dependence would extend overseas due to our      economies' desire to manufacture cheaper and thus more      profitable products.       China and the U.S are two great superpowers, and each is      just as self-destructive as the other. Without a strong and      desirable alliance with China, the U.S. becomes weakened to      possible foreign attacks and a collapse of the economy. The      U.S. is feeling out of balance right now: so many goods are      being manufactured overseas at the expense of U.S. jobs being      taken away. This balance could be found when the U.S comes to      the realization that we cannot completely isolate China, and,      at the same time, we must create a political environment that      nurtures U.S. businesses that manufacture products      domestically.       In an ideal world the bonds and alliances of countries      would surpass the separation of race, religion, class and      culture. We must work towards this ideal world, because in it      we will find a far better future we could not possibly      foresee today.                          ____________________
