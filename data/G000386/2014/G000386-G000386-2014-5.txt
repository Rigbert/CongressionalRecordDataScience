 President, I would like to take this time to honor an extraordinary Iowa teacher who has had a positive impact on a great many students. Ms. Clemencia Spizzirri was recently announced as the 2015 Iowa Teacher of the Year. This award honors the great work she has done as a foreign language teacher at Merrill Middle School in Des Moines, IA.  Ms. Spizzirri has been teaching Spanish to eager young minds at Merrill Middle School for 5 years. Despite her relatively short time there, her profound impact is evident. The high praise she receives from her students, colleagues, and community members are a testament to the work ethic and passion she displays in her classroom every schoolday.  As an immigrant herself, Ms. Spizzirri embodies the importance of a broad-based education that helps students understand the world beyond their own country. Born in Quito, Ecuador's capital city, Ms. Clemencia was the youngest of seven children. She learned quickly that success was nearly impossible without a quality education. This drove her to become a teacher. She witnessed firsthand the struggles that accompany poverty and knew she could make a difference through teaching. She started her career teaching English in Quito. When the conditions in her country began to worsen, she obtained a visa and moved to the United States. After immigrating to this country, Ms. Spizzirri received a bachelor's degree in New York. She then moved to Des Moines, IA, where she received her master's degree from Drake University.  Ms. Spizzirri attributes her passion for educating young minds to unfortunate circumstances she has witnessed in her own life. This passion ensures a quality education for all her students and contributes well-rounded citizens to the community. Great teachers are an invaluable resource to all of our communities and Ms. Spizzirri deserves nothing but praise for her tremendous work. I thank Ms. Spizzirri for her service to the people of her community and wish her nothing but the best in her future school years and beyond.                          ____________________
