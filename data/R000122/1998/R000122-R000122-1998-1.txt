President, I speak today about passage of the conference report on the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, S. 1260. Recently, the report was agreed to by both chambers of Congress and sent to the President for his signature.  I supported the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as well as S. 1260. I did so because I recognize the national nature of our markets as well as the need to encourage capital investment. I am pleased that we have been able to further these goals through this legislation. However, I am concerned by the attempt of a few to lessen the obligations owed investors.  Particularly troubling has been the incorrect use of legislative history to imply that a defrauded investor, now barred from discovery prior to the adjudication of a motion to dismiss, must include, in a pleading, evidence of conscious attempts to defraud by the defendant. First, no such implication was made by the 1995 bill. Second, no bill would have passed if such implications were included in the 1998 legislation. Thus, allegations of motive, opportunity, and recklessness, as well as conscious fraud, continue to satisfy the requirements of a 10b(5) pleading. This is the rigorous, but time-tested standard for pleading which has been applied in the Second Circuit. This is the standard that we adopted in 1995, and the national standard created by S. 1260.  The legislative history most frequently cited incorrectly is the Presidential veto message which accompanied his rejection of the 1995 bill; a veto which was overridden. I cannot understand why any weight would be given to the President's interpretation of a bill he vetoed. The purpose of any veto message is to portray the bill as negatively as possible, to avoid a veto override. Accusations the President made about the pleading standard were not only overblown, they were specifically rejected during debate after the veto and prior to the veto override.  Mr. President, as the Senate considered partially preempting state law, many Senators, including the primary sponsors of the bill, made clear that preemption would only occur if the federal standard insured investors protections from fraud. Most importantly this means a proper pleading standard and scienter requirement. This view was shared by Chairman Levitt of the Securities Exchange Commission. This is reflected in Chairman Levitt's testimony before Congress, in correspondence between the SEC and the Senate sponsors of the bill, as well as in statements by Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman D'Amato and the Ranking Member of the Securities Subcommittee, Senator Dodd.  Recent events in foreign markets have made all too clear the havoc that results when investors are not fully apprized of substantial risks and rewards associated with investments. The Senate made clear that, in enacting partial preemption, it would not tolerate implementation of untested standards concerning the obligations owed investors. Nor, might I add, did industry proponents of the bill ask for a lessening of these standards.  In order to better illustrate this point, Mr. President, I ask that a letter I sent to Members of the Conference Committee on S. 1260 be printed in the Record.  The letter follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 1998.     Chairman Alfonse M. D'Amato,     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to you as a conferee on the      Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, S. 1260.      As you know, I supported passage of this legislation, and      voted to override the President's veto of the Private      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While class action      suits are frequently the only financially feasible means for      small investors to recover damages, such lawsuits have been      subject to abuse. By creating national standards, such as      those in S. 1260, we recognize the national nature of our      markets and encourage capital formation.       However, it is essential to recognize that preemption marks      a significant change concerning the obligations of Congress.      When federal legislation was enacted to combat securities      fraud in 1933 and 1934, federal law augmented existing state      statutes. States were free to provide greater protections,      and many have. Many of our colleagues voted for the 1995      legislation knowing that if federal standards failed to      provide adequate investor protections, state law would      provide a necessary backup.       With passage of this legislation, Congress accepts full and      sole responsibility to ensure that fraud standards allow      truly victimized investors to recoup lost funds. Only a      meaningful right of action against those who defraud can      guarantee investor confidence in our national markets.      Recently, on the international stage, we have seen all too      clearly the problem of markets which fail to ensure that      consumers receive truthful, complete information.       Therefore, my support for this bill rests on the      presumption that the recklessness standard was not altered by      either the 1995 Act or this legislation. I strongly endorsed      the Senate Report which accompanies this legislation because      it stated clearly that nothing in the 1995 legislation      changed either the scienter standard or the most stringent      pleading standard, that of the Second Circuit. This language      was central to the legislation receiving the support of      Chairman Levitt of the Securities and Exchange Committee. It      was also central to my support.       As the Senate Banking Committee recognized at his second      confirmation hearing, Chairman Levitt has a lifetime of      experience as both an investor and regulator of markets. That      experience has led him to be the most articulate advocate of      the need for a recklessness standard concerning the scienter      requirement. In October 21, 1997 testimony before a      Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, Chairman Levitt      said, ``[E]liminating recklessness . . . would be tantamount      to eliminating manslaughter from the criminal laws. It would      be like saying you have to prove intentional murder or the      defendant gets off scot free. . . . If we were to lose the      reckless standard we would leave substantial numbers of the      investing public naked to attacks by . . . schemers.''       In testimony before a Senate Banking Subcommittee, on      October 29, 1997, Chairman Levitt further articulated his      position regarding the impact of a loss of the recklessness      standard. He said, ``A higher scienter standard (than      recklessness) would lessen the incentives for corporations to      conduct a full inquiry into potentially troublesome or      embarrassing areas, and thus would threaten the disclosure      process that has made our markets a model for nations around      the world.''       The danger posed by a loss of recklessness to our citizens      and markets is clear. We should not overrule the judgement of      the SEC Chair, not to mention every single Circuit Court of      Appeals that has adjudicated the issue. I would assume that      the motives which led to SEC and the Administration to insist      on the Senate Report language concerning recklessness would      also apply to their views of the Conference Report.       With regard to the pleading standard, some Members of      Congress, and, unfortunately, a minority of federal district      courts, have made much of the President's veto measure of the      1995 legislation. Specifically, some have pointed out that      the President vetoed the 1995 bill due to concerns that the      Conference Report adopted a pleading standard higher than      that of the Second Circuit, the most stringent standard at      that time. As I, and indeed a bipartisan group of Senators      and Representatives, made clear in the veto override vote,      the President overreached on this point. The pleading      standard was raised to the highest bar available, that of the      Second Circuit, but no further. In spite of the      Administration's 1995 veto, this preemption gained the      support of Chairman Levitt. It is, therefore, difficult to      understand how some can argue that the 1995 legislation      changed the pleading standard of the Second Circuit.       The reason for allowing a plaintiff to establish scienter      through a pleading of motive and opportunity or recklessness      is clear. As one New York Federal District Court has stated,      ``a plaintiff realistically cannot be expected to plead a      defendant's actual state of mind.'' Since the 1995 Act allows      for a stay of discovery pending a defendant's motion to      dismiss, requiring a plaintiff to establish actual knowledge      of fraud or an intent to defraud in a complaint raises the      bar far higher than most legitimately defrauded investors can      meet.       Firms which advocate for S. 1260 do so based on the need to      eliminate the circumvention of federal standards and federal      stays of discovery through state court filings. They do not      argue for a lessening of the obligations owed investors. I am      concerned that should the conference committee include      language which could be interpreted to eviscerate the ability      of plaintiffs to satisfy the scienter standard by proof of      recklessness or to require plaintiffs, barred from discovery,      to adhere to a pleading standard requiring conscious      behavior, the bill will lose the support of Chairman Levitt      and many Members of Congress. I urge the Conference to      support language included in the Senate Report and move      forward with a bill that a bipartisan group in Congress can      support and the President can sign.           Sincerely,                                                        Jack Reed,                                                     U.S. Senator.
