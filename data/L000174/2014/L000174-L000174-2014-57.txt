 It has been more than a year since Americans first learned that the government had been secretly sweeping up the telephone records of innocent Americans, regardless of whether there was any connection whatsoever to terrorism or criminal activity. I introduced the original USA FREEDOM Act last October with Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, and the Senate Judiciary Committee held six public hearings to address these issues.  During those hearings, we learned that the bulk phone records collection program had not, as previously advertised, thwarted 54 terrorist plots, or even dozens, or even a few. In fact, we learned through our public hearings that after all the talk about why we needed this program, we learned that the number was maybe one. That is an important fact for these who argue that the NSA's bulk phone records program is somehow essential to our fight against ISIL or other terrorists. It did nothing to stop ISIL from starting in the first place.  Our bill protects Americans. It enhances privacy protections and ends indiscriminate data collection by the NSA, but also keeps the essential tools our intelligence community needs to protect our Nation. That is the simple truth and important to remember. That is why our intelligence community strongly supports this bill.  As someone who worked in law enforcement, and as a native of Vermont where the right of privacy is cherished, I know we can have both liberty and security. The USA FREEDOM Act provides for commonsense reforms to government surveillance, and promotes greater accountability and transparency of the government's surveillance programs, and it improves the FISA Court.  This is a carefully crafted bill that builds on the work of the House of Representatives. It has the unprecedented support of the Director of National Intelligence, the Attorney General, the Director of the NSA, American technology companies, and privacy and civil liberties groups across the political spectrum, ranging from the ACLU and EFF to the NRA and TechFreedom. Lawmakers from all parts of the political spectrum, from the right to left, support the USA FREEDOM Act. They know it is a reasonable and responsible compromise. There is no reason why we should not proceed to a debate on this important bill.  I understand that there are some Members who want votes on parts of it, and that is fine. Let's have the votes. Let's not block this bill and say: Well, we want something better. That means you don't vote yes, you don't vote no, you vote maybe. Let's have some relevant amendments, and let's vote on them. Don't let this get bogged down in procedural nonsense that the American public hates. Senators should allow us to get onto this bill and help us reach an agreement on a limited list of germane amendments to be considered. Let's have germane amendments and vote them up or down. If we work together, we can finish the bill by the end of the week.  We cannot afford to delay action on these reforms until next year. As both the ACLU and the NRA pointed out yesterday in a joint op-ed in the Washington Times, ``every day that the Senate fails to vote on these reforms is a day in which law-abiding citizens have reason to fear that the constitutional protections so dear to the Founders and so crucial to the functioning of a free society no longer apply.''  I echoed the words we heard from the Senator from Utah. Every day that we fail to act is another day that American businesses are harmed. One conservative think tank estimated that the ``mistrust engendered by the NSA's programs could cost the U.S. technology industry between $35 billion and $180 billion over the next three years.'' That is a staggering amount.  Senators should listen to the intelligence community professionals who protect our nation every day, and who are calling for swift passage of this bill. Ask the Director of National Intelligence. Ask the Attorney General. They will tell you that it is better for our national security, and better for our fight against terrorism if we pass the USA FREEDOM Act.  This is a reasonable compromise that all Senators should support, and I thank the Majority Leader for bringing this bill to the floor. And I thank Senators Dean Heller, Mike Lee, Dick Durbin, Al Franken, and Richard Blumenthal for their steadfast work on this bill.  Our bill is good for privacy and civil liberties, and upholds our Constitution. It is good for American business. It isgood for national security. And most importantly, it is the right thing to do on behalf of Vermonters and the rest of the American people. I urge all Senators to vote in favor of the cloture motion pending before us.  I ask unanimous consent that the Statement of Administration Policy in support of the USA FREEDOM Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was orered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Statement of Administrtion Policy                        S. 2685--USA Freedom Act          (Sen. Leahy, D-VT, and 18 cosponsors, Nov. 17, 2014)       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S.      2685, the USA FREEDOM Act. In January, the President called      on Congress to enact important changes to the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that would keep our      Nation safe, while enhancing privacy and better safeguarding      our civil liberties. This past spring, a broad bipartisan      majority of the House passed a bill that answered the      President's call. S. 2685 carefully builds on the good work      done in the House and has won the support of privacy and      civil liberties advocates and the private sector, including      significant members of the technology community. As the      Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence      stated in a letter dated September 2, 2014, the bill is a      reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil      liberties and increases transparency.       The bill strengthens the FISA's privacy and civil liberties      protections, while preserving essential authorities that our      intelligence and law enforcement professionals need. The bill      would prohibit bulk collection through the use of Section      215, FISA pen registers, and National Security Letters while      maintaining critical authorities to conduct more targeted      collection. The Attorney General and the Director of National      Intelligence have indicated that the bill will retain the      essential operational capabilities of the existing bulk      telephone metadata program while eliminating bulk collection,      based on communications providers' existing practices. The      bill also authorizes an independent voice in significant      cases before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court      (FISC)--the Administration is aware of the concerns with      regard to this issue, as outlined in the letter from the      Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence,      and the Administration anticipates that Congress will address      those concerns. Finally, the bill will enhance transparency      by expanding the amount of information providers can disclose      and increasing public reporting requirements.       In sum, this legislation will help strengthen Americans'      confidence in the Government's use of these important      national security authorities. Without passage of this bill,      critical authorities that are appropriately reformed in this      legislation could expire next summer. The Administration      urges Congress to take action on this legislation now, since      delay may subject these important national security      authorities to brinksmanship and uncertainty. The      Administration urges the Senate to pass the USA FREEDOM Act      and for the House to act expeditiously so that the President      can sign legislation into law this year.
