President, in a moment we are going to make a motion to substitute H.R. 3 so we will be considering the Senate-passed bill as it was passed out of our committee on to the floor. I think it is appropriate to make a couple of comments--and, of course, invite Senator Jeffords to also comment if he wants to--on the time we have taken on this bill.  We have worked on this bill for some 2\1/2\ years. It has been bipartisan all the way, all of last year and this year. I think it is something that is a product we can be very proud of. It has provisions in it that if we do not pass will not be considered. If we are on another extension, we will not have the safety provisions. We will not have the streamlining provisions that will help us build more roads per dollar.  We are prepared now to proceed. I understand there is no further debate on the pending motion.
