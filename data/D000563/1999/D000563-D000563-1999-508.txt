I believe our position for sensible gun control to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids is a majority opinion in America. I think our position for the Patients' Bill of Rights, so doctors make decisions and not insurance companies, is a majority opinion in America. We are going to fight for that.  I thank the Senator for his leadership.
