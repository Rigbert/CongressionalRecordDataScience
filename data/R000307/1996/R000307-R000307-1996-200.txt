Speaker, yesterday in the Senate Foreign Relations room in our U.S. Capitol, I joined the many friends and colleagues of Dr. Jerry Waters in paying tribute to an outstanding public servant and to wish him well upon his retirement.  Jerry Waters, a native of St. Francis, KS, first came to Washington to work for Senator Jim Pearson. Prior to coming to our Nation's Capital, Jerry was a political science professor at Kansas State University. Jerry came to Washington with the intent of staying but 1 year but his devotion to and performance of duty was such that he stayed to his State's and Nation's benefit.  Serving as administrative assistant to Jim Pearson, Jerry was responsible for hiring quality staff and one such staffer was the daughter of our former Governor and Kansas political legend, Alf Landon. Yes, we can thank Jerry Waters, in part, for Senator Nancy Kassebaum's outstanding service. Another former Waters' staffer is the current Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman.  In his capacity as administrative assistant, Jerry played a key role in ensuring that agricultural policy was commensurate with the needs of both Kansas and our Nation's farmers. During this time, Dr. Jerry Waters became a recognized expert in agriculture and transportation public policy.  After Senator Pearson retired, Jerry moved to the private sector as a consultant and has worked for the farmer-owned Farmland Industries System representing them and the farmers and consumers they serve in Washington. His expertise has resulted in sound agricultural policy accomplishment.  Part of the reason that Dr. Jerry Waters has achieved significant success in our Nation's capital has been the fact he has never lost touch with Kansas. Some 30 years after coming to Washington, he still owns a farm in his hometown of St. Francis.  Mr. Speaker, I also speak for many, many colleagues and friends--people who have in their own right achieved success in Washington in saying that we have been fortunate to have had Jerry as a mentor, advisor, and friend. I am reminded of the true adage that there are no self made men and women in public service, that it is your friends who make you what you are. In this regard, Jerry Waters is a man who has always kept his word and whose integrity and keen sense of purpose have been an example to us all. He is a man of great institutional memory and knowledge buttressed by his love and respect for the Congress and the people we serve.  On a personal note, Mr. Speaker, Jerry has been a close friend whose advice I have always solicited and from which I have always benefitted. I shall always remember with fondness and a sense of accomplishment the days when Jerry, Bill Kats of then-Congressman Bob Dole's office, Lester Rosen, of Congressman Garner Shriver's office and Charles Freburg of Congressman Mize's office and myself in Senator Frank Carlson's office, were the Kansas delegation administrative assistants.  Jerry showed me the ropes just as he has for so many others in government, in academia, in the business community and in public service. He remains one of my dearest, longtime friends. I speak for all of his friends and colleagues in wishing he and Jan the very best during their retirement years.                          ____________________
