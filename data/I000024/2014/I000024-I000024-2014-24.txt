We hear this administration--knowing the American people want to use this abundance of good, clean, natural gas and oil--sounding supportive of that, but he has done everything he can to retard our efforts to continue to use, as we have since 1948, hydraulic fracturing.  This is interesting because the first Director of the EPA who was chosen and confirmed during the Obama administration was Lisa Jackson. I asked her the question live on TV during one of our committee hearings--I said: Hydraulic fracturing--people are creating problems with this. Yet we have never had a problem, and it all started in my State of Oklahoma. Has there ever been a documented case of groundwater contamination with hydraulic fracturing?  Her answer, I say to my good friend from North Dakota, was no.  So we have the Obama administration saying there is no problem with it. Yet they are doing everything they can to federalize jurisdiction over hydraulic fracturing, with the idea that would make it much more difficult to take advantage of this revolution we are in the middle of.
