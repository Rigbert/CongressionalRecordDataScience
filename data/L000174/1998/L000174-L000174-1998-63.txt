There are times when I have attempted to pull out what little bit of hair I have left, and, frankly, I hope we can move this. I will personally go to anybody who is lodging objection to see what I can do to clear it up, because I absolutely concur with the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, that this is something which should be moved forward; we want to move it forward. I hope I can tell the distinguished majority leader within a few minutes we do have it cleared.
