Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, the AMA opposes this bill. The Organization of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, you heard their statement. We are speaking past one another and we are not speaking to the American public.  Your bill is unconstitutional. You know it. You tried in 17 or 18 pages to restore it. You cannot do it, because you do not include what the Supreme Court requires, protecting the health of the mother.  Our bill is constitutional, and, except for the premise that you make thatdoctors are charlatans and will not be held accountable for breaking this law, which has to be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence, you say this law does nothing. In fact, it is the only statute on this floor which will preclude abortions at late-term being performed by any procedure; by any procedure.  Now, I tried to get the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) to respond. He would not respond. Why would he not respond? Because my friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), for whom I have unrestrained respect, believes the termination of a pregnancy, the taking of a life of a fetus, is wrong, however you do it. He is shaking his head affirmatively. That is an intellectually honest position. I respect it.  Partial-birth as described is an awful procedure. Abortion is an awful procedure. I accept that. And I personally oppose late-term abortions. When I am accused of being for abortion on demand at the 8th month, 29th day, I am not. We ought to protect those lives. But we have to balance it. That is what the Court says, that is what the Constitution of the United States says.  Support the Greenwood-Hoyer alternative. It is the only legislation that will be effective in trying to make some sense of this issue that so vexes America.
