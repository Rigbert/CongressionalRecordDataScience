 President, I am offering legislation with Senator Kyl as original cosponsor, a legislation which provides full reimbursement to state and local counties for costs incurred for emergency medical services and ambulatory services provided to undocumented aliens injured during a pursuit by border patrol or under the custody of federal, state, or local authorities.  This legislation: Authorizes full reimbursement for emergency medical costs, including ambulatory services for illegal aliens who are injured during illegal crossings at land and sea ports, or during a pursuit by border patrol, or while in custody of federal, state, or local authorities;  Authorizes up to $18 million per year for the next 4 years from a separate account under the Attorney General to reimburse states and localities for emergency medical services provided to illegal aliens.  Requires the Attorney General to submit a written report to Senate and House Judiciary Committees on the policy and practice, including custody practice, of the border patrol by March 1, 1998.  Requires annual report by the Attorney General to Senate and House Judiciary and Appropriations Committees on the implementation of this bill.  INS reports show that in FY96, 1.65 million illegal aliens were apprehended, of which 97% or 1.6 million apprehensions were made at the Southwest Border. INS also reports that more than 300,000 illegal aliens come into the country every year and in FY97, over 111,000 criminal and other illegal aliens were put through formal deportation proceedings.  With increased focus on apprehending illegal aliens at the 140 mile stretch of our Southwest border, recent reports also show increases in unreimbursed emergency medical service cost of illegal aliens to state and local county hospitals.  The California State Auditor recently released a report which charged that San Diego alone incurred up to $8.1 million in unreimbursed charges in emergency medical service for illegal aliens between January 1996 and May 1997. The Auditor estimates that San Diego hospitals incurred from $4.9 million to $8.1 million in unreimbursed emergency medical services and ambulatory services for up to 1074 illegal aliens during the seventeen month period. The unreimbursed medical service costs include hospital care, costs incurred for paramedics and air transportations, physicians, surgeons and laboratories. These uncompensated services, which hospitals and other emergency service providers are required toprovide under California law, were provided to illegal aliens who were injured during illegal crossings at the border and while escaping border patrol pursuits.  The Sacramento Bee recently reported the following:       Every time a Border patrol chase results in injuries, San      Diego area hospitals provide `free' care to those injured...      (For instance), medical care for Fransciso Quintera--who was      struck by a car while fleeing Border patrol agents--cost UCSD      Medical Center over $1 million in uncompensated expenses. In      one recent vehicle chase, a van loaded with illegal      immigrants crashed while evading the Border Patrol, costing      Scripps Hospital $200,000 and Mercy Hospital $100,000 in      uncompensated care.  In the 1996 Immigration Act, Congress acknowledged the huge cost shift to state and local county hospitals in unreimbursed cost for emergency medical services provided to illegal aliens by authorizing full reimbursement for emergency Medicaid and ambulatory services.  However, the $25 million appropriated annually over the next 4 years under the Balance Budget Act for emergency Medicaid for illegal aliens is insufficient to cover the full cost of emergency medical services for illegal aliens nationwide, where high immigrant States like California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona and Massachusetts end up picking up the responsibility for caring for the injured illegal aliens.  In fact, for fiscal year 1998, there are no appropriations for reimbursement for emergency ambulatory services, as authorized by the 1996 Immigration Act. Instead, Congress only requires INS to perform a pilot project in Nogales, Arizona and report its findings to Congress.  Appropriating $25 million over the next 4 years and performing a pilot project in Nogales, Arizona is not enough to cover the millions of dollars high immigrant States like California incur every year in unreimbursed emergency medical and ambulatory costs for illegal aliens injured at the border or during a border patrol pursuit.  Mr. President, time has come for the Federal Government to take full responsibility for the cost associated with providing emergency medical services, including ambulatory services, for illegal aliens and lifting the fiscal burden on State and local counties.  Thank you and I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1420       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND                    IMMIGRANT RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996.       Section 563 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant      Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to read as follows:     ``SEC. 563. REIMBURSEMENT OF STATES AND LOCALITIES FOR                    EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.       ``(a) Subject to the availability of appropriations, the      Attorney General shall fully reimburse States and political      subdivisions of States for their costs of providing medical      services, including ambulatory services, related to an      emergency medical condition of an individual who--       ``(1) is injured while, or being pursued immediately after,      crossing a land or sea border of the United States without      inspection or at any time or place other than as designated      by the Attorney General; and       ``(2) is under the custody of the State or subdivision      pursuant to a transfer, request, or other action by a Federal      authority.       ``(b) There is established in the general fund of the      Treasury a separate account out of which the Attorney General      shall provide reimbursement under this section.       ``(c) Reimbursement under this section shall not be taken      out of monies appropriated for the Immigration and      Naturalization Service.       ``(d) There are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal      years 1998-2002 an amount not to exceed $18,000,000 annually      for the purpose of carrying out this section.       ``(e) The Attorney General shall report to the Judiciary      and Appropriations Committees of the House of Representatives      and the Senate annually on the implementation of this      section.       ``(f) By March 1, 1998, the Attorney General shall submit a      written report to the Judiciary Committees of the House of      Representatives and Senate on the policy and practice,      including custody practice, of the United States Border      Patrol with respect to injured aliens.       ``(g) For purposes of this section, the term `emergency      medical condition' has the same meaning as that term has      under section 562 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and      Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.''.                                 ______
