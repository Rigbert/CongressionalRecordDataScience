Speaker, I did not hear and, therefore, was not able to ask for a recorded vote on the motion to rise. The Speaker did not articulate that so the House could hear it, and I request a vote on the motion to rise.  Now, the Speaker may tell me we are past that point, but the fact of the matter is, nobody on this House floor heard the Speaker articulate the issue of whether the Committee ought to rise.
