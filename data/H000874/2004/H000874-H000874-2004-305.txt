Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that representation.  As the majority leader knows, we have been very concerned about that in the past on some of the legislation, the Medicare prescription drug bill in particular. I believe the majority leader and I had a number of conversations on that, and I am pleased at the assurances the leader is giving us on this particular bill.  Mr. Leader, tomorrow we had scheduled, as I understand it, the consideration of the budget resolution conference report. That, obviously, is not coming to the floor tomorrow if we are not going to be here tomorrow. Can the gentleman tell me where the negotiations stand on the proposal that some of us feel very strongly about, and obviously a majority of the Senate feels very strongly about, and that is the pay-as-you-go provision which affects both expenditures and revenues? Where are the negotiations on that issue at this point in time?                              {time}  1715  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, all I can inform the gentleman of as far as negotiations, of which I am not privy, they are fluid and ongoing and constant. There has been a lot of discussion, as the gentleman knows, particularly over the last few weeks and more specifically over the last few days. No resolution has been decided. No conclusion has been reached. Those negotiations will continue.  This will likely sound redundant to the gentleman, but my answer is basically the same as I gave him last week. Our Budget Committee chairman advises me that there is a very good chance that we could have a conference report on the floor next week. I am hoping that will be the case.
