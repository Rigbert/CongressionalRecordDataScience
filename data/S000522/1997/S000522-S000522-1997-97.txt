Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment. I do so with some reluctance. The gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Sanford] is a respected and valuable member of our committee. I know that he acts from exactly the right motives in offering this amendment.  I would warmly support this amendment if some of the cuts came to the multibillion dollar foreign aid accounts, of course, not the foreign aid that goes to save children's lives or feed the hungry, but the foreign aid that goes to international social engineering and sometimes to prop up dictatorships. But let me remind Members that we have already cut the major foreign aid provisions out of this bill. They are not in the bill that is before this body.  Then let us look at the numbers. The total spending in this bill, and this is the administration of foreign relations and refugee protection--it is not foreign aid per se although there are some provisions in it--the total spending in this bill is only 3.1 percent over fiscal year 1997, which is approximately the rate of inflation.  There is no money in this bill to fund empire-building, no money for big new programs or even expansion of old ones. The bill is already substantially below the administration's budget request for fiscal year 1998, approximately $181 million below the administration's request. That is also below the budget resolution, which all of us in this committee have voted for, or at least most of us.  This bill saves money, as against the budget agreement. Again, we are already on record as supporting that agreement. It is a Republican-initiated, administration-backed agreement. We are below that, so anyone who says we are exceeding that--yes, we are below last year's, but we are well in line with the budget resolution.  Second, this bill means even greater savings in fiscal year 1999. If we do not pass this bill, the administration will almost certainly request and perhaps even get higher spending on the State Department and related agencies in fiscal year 1999. This bill actually reduces spending in that fiscal year.  Even more important, we have structured this bill so that the modest increases do not primarily go to fund the Federal bureaucracy. Instead, we enhance profreedom, prodemocracy initiatives such as refugee protection, Radio Free Asia, and human rights programs such as the scholarships for young people who have been forced to flee Tibet, Burma, and East Timor.  Even though the Sanford amendment is not aimed specifically at refugees or at Radio Free Asia, the aggregate cuts it imposes would almost certainly result in cuts in these programs. Unfortunately, the refugee account has already taken a cut in real dollars. The modest funding for refugee protection is not even enough to cover the last couple of years' worth of inflation. In real dollar terms, refugees still take a substantial cut over 3 years. Let us not forget we are awash in refugees. Some 26 million people are refugees throughout the world.  Mr. Chairman, I have a letter that I have received from the InterAction Committee on Refugee Assistance, a dozen organizations, including the principal Catholic, Jewish, Lutheran, and Episcopalian refugee assistance agencies, as well as other humanitarian and human rights groups, which details what these groups call the alarming trend toward reduction of resources for refugee protection overseas.  Mr. Chairman, at the proper time I will ask that that be made a part of the Record so Members can see how these cuts, this slowing down of refugee protection money, has hurt the Christian Karen refugees from Thailand to Burma, has hurt people in Liberia and elsewhere, simply because there is not enough money to protect these very vulnerable people.  I also want to call attention to the effect that this amendment will almost certainly have on the enhancement we voted for last week, on the amendment that I offered to provide and to boost Radio Free Asia by $70 million. That was, and I want to repeat this as I did last week, an initiative that Speaker Gingrich came up with; that rather than 8 hours per day of broadcasting, Radio Free Asia ought to be bumped up to 24 hours a day into China, to send the message of freedom and hope to that beleaguered country. This legislation boosts that from the $10 million in the bill each fiscal year, $20 million total, by $70 million. Again, that was an initiative that the Speaker suggested to us.  Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to vote down this amendment. I do so with reluctance, because I so greatly respect the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Sanford], but I think we have done a good job.  In my Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, and I know that the presiding chairman will look at this very carefully as well, we have tried to hold the line on spending. It is a good bill. Again, we are almost $200 million below the budget resolution so we come in under that number.  Mr. Speaker, I insert the following for the Record:                                              American Council for                               Voluntary International Action,                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 1997.     Hon. Benjamin Gilman,     Chair, House International Relations Committee, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairman Gilman: As you work to develop State      Department authorization legislation for fiscal years 1998      and 1999, the undersigned agencies urge you to authorize at      least $700 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance      (MRA), and to work with the Appropriations Committee to      ensure that this amount is provided. The MRA account has      suffered funding reductions in recent years that seriously      jeopardizes the protection of refugees worldwide.       In addition, we urge you to increase the authorization      level for the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance      account to $100 million. This life saving account is a no-     year appropriation that has been essential in providing      needed flexibility to the Administration to address emergency      needs such as the most recent refugee crisis in the Great      Lakes Region of Africa.       The authorized level for MRA is currently $671 million, and      this amount was appropriated for fiscal years 1994 through      1996. However, for FY 1997 the appropriation was reduced to      $650 million (which is the amount requested by the      Administration for FY 1998). In addition, Congressional      appropriators permitted $12 million of the FY 1997 MRA      funding to be used for the administrative expenses of the      State Department's Bureau for Populations, Refugees, and      Migration (PRM), thus reversing a prohibition on such use of      MRA funds that had existed for the previous two years (during      those two years, PRM administrative expenses were funded      through appropriations for Diplomatic and Consular      functions). The Administration again seeks $12 million for      this purpose in FY 98. The effect of this earmark is to      further reduce the amount available for direct assistance to      refugees. In real terms, this means that unless Congress acts      this time, there will be $33 million less available for      refugees in fiscal year 1998 as compared     to 1996. This real reduction in resources for refugees      overseas is not acceptable.       Within the MRA account, the funding specified for overseas      assistance ($468 million in FY 1997) is used for      contributions to international organizations, primarily the      United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The      role of UNHCR in providing life-saving and other assistance      to refugees is critical to the protection goal of U.S.      refugee policy. For this reason, inadequate MRA funding has a      direct impact on the achievement of refugee protection.               examples of unmet refugee protection needs       In recent months, several alarming trends have been noted.      Among these is understaffing in UNHCR's protection division.      Site visits by many of our agencies to refugee situations      worldwide regularly find that UNHCR's protection corps is      dangerously understaffed, which exposes refugees to serious      risks and deprives UNHCR of the ability to fulfill its      primary task of protection. The results of inadequate      resources are seen in the following examples, provided      through site visits by our organizations:       A site visit to Uganda in Central Africa in 1996 found that      UNHCR did not have a single protection officer in northern      Uganda to monitor the grave protection needs of 200,000      Sudanese refugees there. More than 100 Sudanese were killed      in northern Uganda last year during rebel raids on refugee      settlements. Similarly, in West Africa UNHCR had a single      protection officer in the field to address the needs of      300,000 Liberian refugees in Ivory Coast. These refugees lack      proper identification cards and are vulnerable to harassment      and abuse by local soldiers as well as by combatants      infiltrating refugee sites from Liberia.       In Burundi some 70,000 Burundian refugees were to be      repatriated into potentially dangerous areas of the country,      UNHCR had to suspend its resettlement efforts in part because      it lacked the resources to monitor the safety of returnees.      Because of Burundi's dangerous highways, UNHCR needs an      expensive air capacity to monitor the safety of recent      returnees and gain an early warning capacity for new refugee      flows in inaccessible areas of the country.       The United States has advocated for elections in Liberia at      the earliest appropriate time, even though 750,000 Liberian      refugees--nearly one-fourth of the electorate--are out of the      country and potentially disenfranchised. In order to ensure      the credibility of any Liberian election, UNHCR may need to      bring the electoral process to Liberian refugees if      conditions remain too dangerous to bring refugees home to      Liberia to vote. It would be an expensive but important      undertaking.       In India, UNHCR has terminated assistance to many urban      refugees living in Delhi because of lack of funds. The      refugees, who live in dire circumstances even with UNHCR      assistance, have been despondent, saying that they have no      means to survive. One refugee killed herself after her      assistance was terminated.       In Nepal, border guards continue to hand over Tibetan      refugees to the Chinese authorities. UNHCR is only able to      visit the border occasionally, when a full-time presence      would be warranted. Also in Nepal, UNHCR has reduced the      level of assistance to Bhutanese refugees, despite the fact      that there are not prospects for their repatriation or local      integration.            unmet needs in the voluntary return of refugees       In addition, underfunding of UNHCR's core programs and      special initiatives prevents needed assistance to refugees,      thwarts efforts at repatriation, and in other ways undermines      the goals of the U.S. refugee program. The results of      inadequate resources are seen in the following examples,      provided through site visits by our organizations:       Landmines have become a more prevalent danger to      repatriation. The pending return of 300,000 refugees to      Angola is a case in point--Angola is estimated to contain as      many as 10 million landmines. A major coordinated effort with      international organizations is needed to address this      major impediment to safe repatriation. The threat of      landmines affects relief routes and repatriation routes,      and necessitates landmines awareness programs among      refugees. Removal of landmines is usually an expensive but      necessary component of reconstruction to facilitate the      voluntary return of refugees.       A massive repatriation of 300,000 refugees to Sierra Leone      under a fragile peace accord is being pursued. Yet UNHCR's      financial constraints have impeded efforts to place a      protection officer in the field outside the capital. Similar      constraints exists in Liberia as plans for a massive      repatriation effort from Ivory Coast and Guinea are being      considered. A site visit to Guinea in 1996 found that broken      delivery trucks were hampering food deliveries to 200,000      Liberian refugees over some of Africa's most difficult roads.      Lack of spare parts for truck repairs is a major problem. The      UNHCR had two field officers trying to meet the assistance      needs of 200,000 refugees. Some experts consider the      acceptable ration to be one field officer per 25,000      refugees.       One of the most promising young countries in Africa.      Eritrea, still waits the return home of up to 300,000      refugees. Their repatriation has been stalled for three      years, in part by the expense of conducting a repatriation      program that provides the level of support that returnees      will need in order to rebuild after decades of destruction      from civil war.       American agencies working on the ground in Bosnia continue      to report the lack of shelter, services, and economic      activity as a major deterrent to repatriation of refugees.      With the lifting of temporary protection for Bosnians in      Europe, there is a need for comprehensive durable solutions      to be found. These include voluntary return for most      refugees, who will need an infrastructure to be rebuilt in      their villages and towns. For others, it will involve      resettlement opportunities in third countries such as the      United States.                   special needs of refugee children       UNHCR and other international organizations have recently      recognized that special efforts must be made with regard to      refugee children. Children constitute over 50% of UNHCR's      refugee caseload, and children separated from their parents      and normal care givers constitute one of the most vulnerable      refugee populations. These children need the assistance of      staff trained and equipped to deal with their legal, physical      and mental needs.       These services are particularly crucial in order to prevent      the recruitment of children as child soldiers, military      porters, prostitutes, and forced marriage partners. Refugees      families and communities must be assisted in helping their      children cope with the effects of physical and psychological      trauma and prolonged periods of insecurity and interrupted      family life.       With adequate funding and staffing. UNHCR can coordinate      with ICRC, UNICEF, nongovernmental organizations, and others      to engage in quick intervention, tracing, and reunification      programs. These coordinated efforts can help reunite children      with caring members of their families or former friends and      neighbors willing to help children preserve their language,      culture, and relationships with family and their communities.       Conflicts also produce families headed by children, who      need special attention to care for the needs of their younger      siblings while in exile and particularly on return to their      homelands, where they often lack necessary life and      vocational skills. Other children with special needs include      older teens who have spent years in exile or refugee camps;      demobilized child soldiers; victims of sexual abuse or      torture; and handicapped or landmine injured minors.       Only 30% of refugee children benefit from formal      educational programs, and often teachers and curriculum for      these programs are poor. Agencies are anxious to produce and      oversee better teaching training and to provide curriculum      materials that are educationally challenging and can help      children understand the importance of basic human rights and      democratic values. Such efforts will help these young      students contribute to the reconciliation of their      communities and the rebuilding of their societies.       The MRA account also provides funds for the admission of      refugees to the U.S. We wish to note in this regard that over      the past several years the Administration has drastically      reduced the ceiling for refugee admissions. The current      admissions level of 78,000, for example, represents a 13%      decrease from the FY96 ceiling of 90,000 which in turn was      about 20% lower than the FY95 figure of 112,000. This      decrease is clearly contrary to the will of Congress, as      expressed in last year's defeat of efforts in both the House      and Senate to statutorily cap the number of refugee      admissions. In addition, recent letters to the State      Department from Members in both chambers have urged that the      admissions ceiling be restored to between 90,000 and 100,000.       We thank you for your ongoing work on behalf of refugees      and other forced migrants, and we appreciate your      consideration of our views on this critical funding issue.
