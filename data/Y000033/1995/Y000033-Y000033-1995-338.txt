I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, as the author of H.R. 716, I rise in strong support of this measure to reauthorize and improve the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967.  Mr. Speaker, one of the major motivations for this legislation was an incident that occurred last year when 258 United States fishermen were unfairly charged $1,100 each by the Canadian Government to sail through the Inside Passage. While we were successful in convincing the Canadians to stop collecting these illegal transit fees, the Fishermen's Protective Act [FPA] must be amended to allow these Americans to be compensated for their financial loss.  My bill would reauthorize the FPA for the next 3 years; allow money to be deposited in the Fishermen's Guaranty Fund, regardless of whether Congress appropriates any money; expand the compensation provision to cover those Americans who paid the illegal fee assessed by the Canadians; and prohibit port entry to the vessels of any nation that assesses illegal fees on our vessels in the future.  Furthermore, we are making it clear that we will fully protect the rights of U.S. fishermen. We will not allow Canada, or any nation, to violate international maritime law or fishing treaties without a swift response.  I fully expect the United States State Department to vigorously seek reimbursement of these fees from the Canadians and not to simply make some weak or half-hearted effort because it may be inconvenient to our relationship with Canada. They broke the law and I want the more than $285,000 the Canadians collected paid back to our fishermen.  Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 716 and thank Jim Saxton and Gerry Studds for their bipartisan subcommittee support in joining with me in this important legislative effort.
