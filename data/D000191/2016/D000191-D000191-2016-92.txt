Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the horrible burden the gentleman is talking about is a notice of intent which says where and how something was applied. It is virtually cost free. You can use a standardized form. But it is just good to know where we are putting the pesticides and what pesticides are being used in case there are problems like the massive fish kill in Oregon, which we were able to trace back to one misapplication by one private company, not by the local county or any other public entity.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano).
