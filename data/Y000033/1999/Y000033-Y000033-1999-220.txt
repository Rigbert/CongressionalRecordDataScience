Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that would address several matters of concern to Alaska Natives through amendments to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971.  As my colleagues know, ANCSA was enacted in 1971, stimulated by the need to address Native land claims as well as the desire to clear the way for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and thereby provide our country with access to the petroleum resources of Alaska's North Slope. As the years pass, issues arise which require amending that act. The Resources Committee as a matter of course routinely considers such amendments and brings them before the House.  The bill has three provisions. One of the provisions would restore 50,000 acres back to the village of Elim. The Norton Bay Reservation (later referred to as Norton Bay Native Reserve) was formally established in 1917 by an Executive Order and comprised approximately 350,000 acres of land for use of the U.S. Bureau of Education and the Natives of Indigenous Alaskan race. It is located approximately 110 miles southeast of Nome, Alaska along the shoreline of Norton Bay Reservation. Some of the burial grounds were mass graves of Natives who succumbed to epidemics of disease brought into the Eskimo culture by non-Natives. Today, Elim is home to about 300 Alaska Natives and a small number of non-Natives who live and work in the village.  In 1919, Congress enacted a law requiring that any future Indian Reservations be established only by an act of Congress. In 1927, Congress passed an act which prohibited boundary adjustments to Executive Order Reservations other than an act of Congress.  In 1929, President Herbert Hoover, by an Executive Order, reduced the size of the Elim reservation by 50,000 acres. The land was deleted from the Reservation for the benefits of others and was not offered to be restored to the original Reservation when lands comprising the Reservation were made available to the Native inhabitants of Elim under section 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. The failure to replace these lands has been and continues to be a source of deep concern to the indigenous people of Elim and until this matter is dealt with equitably, it will continue to be a source of great frustration and sense of loss among the shareholders of Elim Native Corporation and their descendants.  This bill will give the Elim Native Corporation 2 years in which to select no more than 60,000 acres depicted on the map dated August 1, 1999, and entitled Land Withdrawal Elim Native Corporation Land Restoration. It also authorizes the Elim Native Corporation to select and receive title to 50,000 acres of lands within the boundary of the lands described on the map. The Secretary is further authorized and directed to receive and adjudicate a selection application by the Elim Native Corporation, and to convey the surface and subsurface estate in the selected lands to the Elim Native Corporation subject to rules, conditions and limitations outlined in this bill.  I am attaching copies of two letters (with my statement) from two individuals who support the restoration of 50,000 acres to the people of Elim. The first letter is from Mr. Donald C. Mitchell, Attorney at Law. Mr. Mitchell, over the course of 20 years, has worked on amendments to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and has written a book regarding the history of the ANCSA. The second letter is from Mr. Rick Steiner, Director of The Coastal Coalition, a highly respected conservation group in Alaska. Their letters simply state a brief outline of support for the restoration of 50,000 acres to the people of Elim.  Another provision of this bill would allow shareholder stock to be transferred to adopted Alaska Native children and to their descendants.  Another provision would amend the definition of a ``settlement trust'' under ANCSA.  This bill is the result of the work of the Alaska Federation of Natives, Elim Native Corporation and myself to restore 50,000 acres back to the Native peoples of Elim. The legislative language changes within the bill were revised with the technical assistance of the Department of the Interior.                                               Donald C. Mitchell,                                              Attorney at Law,                                   Anchorage, AK, October 8, 1999.     Re: Section 7 of H.R. 3013 (Elim Native Corporation          Amendment).     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources, Longworth Building, House          of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon.  George Miller,     Ranking Member, Committee on Resources, Longworth Building,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Representatives Young and Miller: On October 5, 1999      Mr. Young introduced, and the Committee on Resources was      referred, H.R. 3013, the Alaska Native Claims Technical      Amendments of 1999.       In 1971 when it settled Alaska Native land claims by      enacting the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) the      92d Congress determined that social and economic justice      required that Alaska Natives who resided in a village located      within the boundaries of a reservation that had been      established for their benefit should be afforded an      opportunity to select, and to be conveyed legal title to, all      public land located within the reservation's boundaries.       The Inupiat residents of the village of Elim took advantage      of that opportunity, and the Secretary of the Interior      conveyed the Elim Native Corporation legal title to the      public land located within the boundaries of the former      Norton Bay Reservation, as those boundaries existed in 1971.       ANCSA was a milestone in the history of Congress's      relations with Native Americans. But because it was by no      means perfect, since 1971 subsequent Congresses have amended      ANCSA on numerous occasions to provide Alaska Natives      additional land selection opportunities when necessary to      ensure that the Act achieves its objectives.       The most important of those objectives is to afford Alaska      Natives social and economic justice regarding their ownership      of public land they historically used and occupied.       As you know, from 1977 to 1994 I served as counsel to the      Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN), which Alaska Natives      organized in 1967 to lead the fight for a fair and just land      claims settlement. In that capacity I over the years      participated in developing a number of amendments to ANCSA      that Congress enacted to ensure that the objective of      affording Alaska Natives social and economic justice is      achieved.       One of the most grievous cases of social and economic      injustice of which I became aware during my tenure as AFN's      counsel was the caprice with which representatives of the      federal executive in 1929 diminished the land rights of the      Inupiat residents of the village of Elim by adjusting the      boundary of the Norton Bay Reservation without their      knowledge or consent.       The facts regarding that situation are well-known and      uncontroverted. During my tenure at AFN I and others on      several occasions attempted to bring the Elim situation to      Congress's attention, but we were no successful. As a      consequence, I am delighted to find that section 7 of H.R.      3013 attempts to remedy the injustice that was inflicted on      the Inupiat residents of Elim in 1929 when the boundary of      the Norton Reservation was unfairly, and in my view      unlawfully, modified. For that reason, I would respectfully,      but strongly, urge you and other members of the Committee on      Resources to favorably report section 7 of H.R. 3013 to the      U.S. House of Representatives, either as part of H.R. 3013,      or as a stand-alone bill.           Sincerely,                                                     Don Mitchell.                                       ____                                        The Coastal Coalition,                                   Anchorage, AK, October 8, 1999.     Re: Elim Native Corporation Land Restoration proposal     Hon. Don Young, Chairman,     Hon. George Miller,     House of Representatives, Committee on Resources, Washington,          DC.       Dear Gentlemen, I just wanted to offer a few words in      support of the proposal before your committee to return to      the Elim Corporation 50,000 acres of land that had been      deleted in 1929 by Executive Order.       It is my understanding from the history of this issue that      the deletion by Executive Order from the Norton Bay      Reservation was the result of a concerted effort by non-     Natives to gain access to the area for commercial purposes      such as fur farming, prospecting and mining. The deletion      from the Reservation seemed to be yet another profound      injustice perpetrated on Alaska Natives. Apparently, Elim      people weren't even consulted regarding this deletion.       In my many years living in and working in northwest Alaska,      I visited Elim several times, and they were always some of      the kindest, most accommodating people I had the opportunity      to work with. They certainly seem to care a great deal about      their land and cultural heritage.       Before your committee is a remarkable opportunity to right      this wrong, and I urge you to act upon this opportunity. The      return of 50,000 acres of land to the Elim shareholders seems      justified not just on moral and ethical grounds, but also on      the grounds of conservation and protection of valuable fish      and wildlife habitat. Particularly important is the habitat      along the Tubuktoolik River and its wastershed.       I would hope that a protective conservation easement or      other protective covenant could be included with the transfer      in order to secure sustainable protection of the area well      into the future. This would not only protect the lands from      potentially damaging commercial activities, but would also      allow Elim to develop a truly sustainable economy in the      region. As the lands are held at present, there are no such      protections and the area could easily fall victim to short-     term activities against the desires and sentiments of the      Elim people.       Returning this land to the Elim people with protective      covenants is a win-win scenario, as it provides ethical      redress of some rather outrageous federal activity earlier      this century, conservation of the region, and opportunity for      the Elim people to rebuild a sustainable economy on their      land.       Thanks for your attention to this very important issue.           Sincerely,                                                     Rick Steiner,     Director, The Coastal Coalition.                          ____________________
