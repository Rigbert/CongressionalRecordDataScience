 It is kind of like the other side is going in a circle. In regard to the amendment of the distinguished Senate minority whip, the Senator argues against the jobs bill because Social Security funds are used.  Well, let's compare that argument to the arguments Senator Dorgan was using. How does the Senator from Nevada think the Dorgan amendment he supports is paid for? As the Senator from Montana pointed out, general revenues will be used to cover the costs of the Dorgan amendment.  We are in a deficit situation. Everybody acknowledges that. So where does the Senator think these revenues will come from? They will raid the Social Security trust fund to pay for the Dorgan amendment.  Once again, it seems to me the other side is trying to be on three sides of a two-sided coin. Maybe if we keep this up long enough with their circular arguments they will be supporting the jobs bill when we finally get to final passage.  I yield the floor.
