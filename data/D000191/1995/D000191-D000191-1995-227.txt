I, in my first term went to stand with some men and women who were on strike at a lumber mill in my district. I stood there with them and caused some disruption and dismay by the management and ownership of this very large company, and I was asked by a reporter how can you do [[Page H4410]] this? You are dealing with one of the most powerful corporations in America, privately held, one of the 500 richest men in America.  I said, you know, on election day he gets one vote and all these people get one vote each, and that is the thing. People have to come back to the ballot box. They do not have to be a Democrat or a Republican. They can be an Independent, I mean nonaffiliated. They can form a third party. It does not matter. This country is not going to be healed until we get turnouts in the 70s, 80s, 90s. I do not think I will ever live to see the day when we get close to 100 percent.
