Speaker, I rise in honor of National Sportsmanship Day, which is being observed today in America and throughout the world. A national sportsmanship day presents the opportunity to stress the importance of ethics and fair play, both on the playing field and in the classroom.  National Sportsmanship Day was conceived by the Institute for International Sport, which is located in my district at the University of Rhode Island, to create an awareness of the issues of ethics, fair play, and sportsmanship within athletics and society. Since its inception in 1991, over 7,000 schools in all 50 States, have benefited from this program. This year 5,000 schools from all 50 States and 48 countries will join in the National Sportsmanship Day festivities.  The goal of good sportsmanship is an important one. It is worthwhile for us to demonstrate to our children the good values and ethics learned through sports. These same lessons will guide them in all aspects of everyday life.  With the help of Sports Ethics Fellows like Olympic skater Bonnie Blair, the institute is providing an example of the pride young athletes can find in competition. As a result, young athletes learn that while winning is a goal worth working for, it is honesty, integrity, and hard work that is most important.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the Rhode Island congressional delegation in recognizing this day.                          ____________________
