 Today one out of four major corporations pays zero in Federal income tax, because a lot of these multinational corporations are stashing their money in the Cayman Islands and in Bermuda and in other tax havens. I know it is a very radical idea. I guess I am an extremist to think maybe it is more important for corporate America, which is enjoying record-breaking profits--one out of four major corporations pays nothing in Federal incomes taxes--maybe we might want to ask them to pay something in taxes so we do not cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education and nutrition programs.  I think what goes on around here is our sense of reality is distorted because surrounding this building are not working families--they are too busy back home trying to maintain their family. Not children. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. They are not here. But all of the lobbyists from the billionaire organizations and for corporate America are here, telling us what we should be doing.  Well, I think maybe the time is long overdue that we stood for the working families of this country, for the children, and for the elderly, and not move for deficit reduction on the backs of the most vulnerable people.  I yield the floor.
