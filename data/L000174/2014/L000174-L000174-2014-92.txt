President, I appreciate the kind, heartfelt words of the distinguished majority leader when speaking about Tommy Boggs--Thomas Hale Boggs, Jr. Many of us knew him well.  I was at Georgetown law school with Tommy, and we often talked about those days and the friendships we had, and so many people who we knew are still in this town. I think of him walking down the hall, and we would see each other and start grinning or laughing. Whoever his client was would wonder what we were laughing about. It was usually something that happened in our law school class from 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  He was very, very effective. He was very good. He had an easygoing attitude that somehow cloaked the fact that he had a first-class mind. He had an encyclopedia knowledge for facts.  As someone who deals with Members of Congress, he had one unfailing attribute that made him successful. He always told the truth even if it was something one didn't want to hear, and he always kept his word. He was a good friend.                          ____________________
