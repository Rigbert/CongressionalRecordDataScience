Sensenbrenner and myself, and for all those who have been involved in this effort.   Joint Statement of Representatives Hoyer and Sensenbrenner on the          Origins of the ADA Restoration Act of 2008, H.R. 3195       On September 29, 2006, we introduced H.R. 6258, entitled      the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2006.      This bill was a response to decisions of the Supreme Court      and lower courts narrowing the group of people whom Congress      had intended to protect under the Americans with Disabilities      Act (ADA). The Supreme Court had interpreted the ADA to      impose a ``demanding'' standard for coverage. It had also      held that the ameliorative effects of ``mitigating measures''      that people use to control the effects of their disabilities      must be considered in determining whether a person has an      impairment that substantially limits a major life activity      and is protected by the ADA. This holding was contrary to      Congress's stated intent in several committee reports.       We introduced H.R. 6258, which was designed to reverse      these holdings, at the end of the 2006 legislative session.      We intended this bill to serve as a marker of our intent to      introduce future legislation to address this issue. On July      26, 2007, we introduced similar legislation, H.R. 3195, the      ADA Restoration Act of 2007, which ultimately garnered over      240 cosponsors. A nearly identical bill, S. 1881, was      introduced in the Senate on the same day by Senators Harkin      and Specter.       H.R. 3195 as introduced would have amended the ADA to      provide protection for any individual who had a physical or      mental impairment or a record of such an impairment, or who      was treated as having such an impairment. The purpose of this      legislation was to restore the intent of Congress to cover a      broad group of individuals with disabilities under the ADA      and to eliminate the problem of courts focusing too heavily      on whether individuals were covered by the law rather than on      whether discrimination occurred. The bill as introduced,      however, was seen by many as extending the protections of the      ADA beyond those that Congress originally intended to      provide.       In order to craft a more balanced bill with broad support,      we urged that representatives of the disability and business      communities enter into negotiations to try to reach an      acceptable compromise. We maintained contact with these      communities over the course of their negotiations and      supported them in their efforts to understand the needs and      concerns of each community. After several months of intensive      discussions, negotiators for the two communities reached      consensus on a set of protections for people with      disabilities that garnered broad support from both      communities. These protections would significantly expand the      group of individuals protected by the ADA beyond what the      courts have held, while at the same time ensuring that the      expansion does not extend beyond the original intent of the      ADA.       This compromise formed the basis of the amendment in the      nature of a substitute for H.R. 3195 that was voted out of      the House Education and Labor and Judiciary Committees with      overwhelming support on June 18, 2008. The substitute bill      was reported out of the Education and Labor Committee by a      vote of 43-1, and out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of      27-0.        The Provisions of the Committee Substitute to H.R. 3195       The primary purpose of H.R. 3195, as amended by the      committee substitute, is to make it easier for people with      disabilities to qualify for protection under the ADA. The      bill does this in several ways. First, it establishes that      the definition of disability must be interpreted broadly to      achieve the remedial purposes of the ADA. The bill rejects      the Supreme Court's holdings that the ADA's definition of      disability must be read ``strictly to create a demanding      standard for qualifying as disabled,'' and that an individual      must have an impairment that ``prevents or severely restricts      the individual from doing activities that are of central      importance to most people's daily lives'' in order to qualify      for protection. The bill also provides a new definition of      ``substantially limits'' to make clear Congress's intent to      depart from the standard applied by the Supreme Court in      Toyota Motor Mfg. of Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S.      184, 197 (2002), and to apply a lower standard.       Second, the bill provides that the ameliorative effects of      mitigating measures are not to be considered in determining      whether a person has a disability. This provision is intended      to eliminate the catch-22 that exists under current law,      where individuals who are subjected to discrimination on the      basis of their disabilities are frequently unable to invoke      the ADA's protections because they are not considered people      with disabilities when the effects of their medication,      medical supplies, behavioral adaptations, or other      interventions are considered. The one exception to the rule      about mitigating measures is that ordinary eyeglasses and      contact lenses are to be considered in determining whether a      person has a disability. The rationale behind this exclusion      is that the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses,      without more, is not significant enough to warrant protection      under the ADA.       Third, the bill provides that an impairment that is      episodic or in remission is a disability if it would      substantially limit a major life activity when active. This      provision is intended to reject the reasoning of court      decisions concluding that certain individuals with certain      conditions--such as epilepsy or post traumatic stress      disorder--were not protected by the ADA because their      conditions were episodic or intermittent.       Fourth, the bill provides for broad coverage under the      ``regarded as'' prong of the definition of disability. It      clarifies that an individual can establish coverage under the      ``regarded as'' prong by establishing that he or she was      subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA because of an      actual or perceived impairment, whether or not the impairment      limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity. This      provision does not apply to impairments that are both      transitory (lasting six months or less) and minor.       The purpose of the broad ``regarded as'' provision is to      reject court decisions that had required an individual to      establish that a covered entity perceived him or her to have      an impairment that substantially limited a major life      activity. This provision is designed to restore Congress's      intent to allow individuals to establish coverage under the      ``regarded as'' prong by showing that they were treated      adversely because of an impairment, without having to      establish the covered entity's beliefs concerning the      severity of the impairment.       Impairments that are transitory and minor are excluded from      coverage in order to provide some limit on the reach of the      ``regarded as'' prong. The intent of this exception is to      prevent litigation over minor illnesses and injuries, such as      the common cold, that were never meant to be covered by the      ADA.       A similar exception is not necessary for the first two      prongs of the definition of disability as the functional      limitation requirement adequately prevents claims by      individuals with ailments that do not materially restrict a      major life activity. In other words, there is no need for the      transitory and minor exception under the first two prongs      because it is clear from the statute and the legislative      history that a person can only bring a claim if the      impairment substantially limits one or more major life      activities or the individual has a record of an impairment      that substantially limits one or more major life activities.       The bill also provides that a covered entity has no      obligation to provide reasonable accommodations, or      reasonable modifications to policies, practices or      procedures, for an individual who qualifies as a person with      a disability solely under the ``regarded as'' prong. Under      current law, a number of courts have required employers to      provide reasonable accommodations for individuals who are      covered solely under the ``regarded as'' prong.       Fifth, the bill modifies the ADA to conform to the      structure of Title VII and other civil rights laws by      requiring an individual to demonstrate discrimination ``on      the basis of disability'' rather than discrimination      ``against an individual with a disability'' because of the      individual's disability. We hope this will be an important      signal to both lawyers and courts to spend less time and      energy on the minutia of an individual's impairment, and more      time and energy on the merits of the case--including whether      discrimination occurred because of the disability, whether an      individual was qualified for a job or eligible for a service,      and whether a reasonable accommodation or modification was      called for under the law.       In exchange for the enhanced coverage afforded by these      provisions, the bill contains important limitations that will      make the bill workable from the perspective of businesses      that are governed by the law. We have already noted some of      these limitations: there is an exception in the mitigating      measures provision for ordinary eyeglasses and contact      lenses, and the ``regarded as'' provision includes two      important limitations, as described above.       Of key importance, the bill retains the requirement that a      person's impairment must substantially limit a major life      activity in order to be considered a disability.      ``Substantially limits'' has been defined as ``materially      restricts'' in order to communicate to the courts that we      believe that their interpretation of ``significantly limits''      was stricter than we had intended. On the severity spectrum,      ``materially restricts'' is meant to be less than ``severely      restricts,'' and less than ``significantly restricts,'' but      more serious than a moderate impairment which would be in the      middle of the spectrum.       The key point in establishing this standard is that we      expect this prong of the definition to be used only by people      who are affirmatively seeking reasonable accommodations or      modifications. Any individual who has been discriminated      against because of an impairment--short of being granted a      reasonable accommodation or modification--should be bringing      a claim under the third prong of the definition which will      require no showing with regard to the severity of his or her      impairment. However, for an individual who is asking an      employer or a business to make a reasonable accommodation or      modification, the bill appropriately requires that the      individual demonstrate a level of seriousness of the      impairment--that is, that it materially restricts a major      life activity.       The bill also retains the requirement in Title I of the ADA      that an individual must be ``qualified'' for the position in      question. The original version of H.R. 3195 contained      language which could have been interpreted to alter the      burden-shifting analysis concerning whether an individual is      ``qualified'' under the ADA. The substitute bill makes clear      that there was no intent to place a greater burden on the      employer and that the burdens remain the same as under      current law.                        Additional Legal Issues       We would like to clarify the intent of the bill with      respect to particular legal issues. First, some higher      education trade associations have raised questions about      whether the bill will eviscerate academic standards. This      bill will have absolutely no effect on the ability of higher      education institutions to set academic standards. It      addresses only the standards for determining who qualifies as      an individual with disability, and not the standards for      determining whether an accommodation or modification is      required in a particular setting or context. It has always      been, and it remains the law today under this bill, that an      academic institution need not make modifications that would      fundamentally alter the essential requirements of a program      of study. The particular concerns of educational institutions      in ensuring that students meet appropriate academic standards      are, of course, relevant in determining whether a requested      modification is reasonable in an educational setting.       There have been particular concerns with the way that      specific learning disabilities have been treated in the      academic context, and that individuals are not receiving      appropriate accommodations. The Education and Labor Committee      Report's discussion of specific learning disabilities is      specifically targeted toward the academic setting and not the      employment sector.       Second, a concern has been raised about whether the bill      changes current law with respect to the duration that is      required for an impairment to substantially limit a major      life activity. The bill makes no change to current law with      respect to this issue. The duration of an impairment is one      factor that is relevant in determining whether the impairment      substantially limits a major life activity. Impairments that      last only for a short period of time are typically not      covered, although they may be covered if sufficiently severe.       Third, some have raised questions about whether the bill's      provisions relating to mitigating measures would require      employers to provide certain mitigating measures as      accommodations. This bill's provisions are intended to      clarify the definition of disability, not to alter current      rules on provision of reasonable accommodations.       Fourth, the bill's language requiring that qualification      standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria      based on uncorrected vision must be job related for the      position in question and consistent with business necessity      is not intended to change current interpretations of whether      a qualification standard based on a government requirement or      regulation is job related for the position in question and      consistent with business necessity.       Passage of the ADA Amendments Act is a great moment in this      country's history. We would like to thank all the individuals      who worked so hard on these negotiations, and to thank the      thousands of individuals and businesses who care about making      this country a fair and equitable place for people with      disabilities.
