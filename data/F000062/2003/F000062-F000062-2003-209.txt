  Madam President, I very much thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for his remarks. I appreciate very much his leadership and support on this issue. I want to make some comments in response to the chairman's comments.  The first is, on July 16, the House published their report. I would like to read excerpts from the House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act into the Record because I think it sets some things straight:       Before any of the existing program goals have been      successfully demonstrated, the Administration is now      proposing to spend millions on enhanced test readiness while      maintaining the moratorium on nuclear testing, aggressively      pursue a multi-billion dollar Modern Pit Facility before the      first production pit has even been successfully certified for      use in the stockpile, develop a robust nuclear earth      penetrator weapon and begin additional advanced concepts      research on new nuclear weapons. It appears to the Committee      the Department is proposing to rebuild, restart and redo and      otherwise exercise every capability that was used over the      past forty years of the Cold War and at the same time prepare      for a future with an expanded mission for nuclear weapons.      Nothing in the past performance of the NNSA convinces this      Committee that the successful implementation of Stockpile      Stewardship Program is a foregone conclusion, which makes the      pursuit of a broad range of new initiatives premature. Until      the NNSA has demonstrated to the Congress that it can      successfully meet its primary mission of maintaining the      safety, security, and viability of the existing stockpile by      executing the Stockpile Life Extension Program and Science-     based Stewardship activities on time and within budget, this      Committee will not support redirecting the management      resources and attention to a series of new initiatives.  What they are saying is, shouldn't we certify before starting this program? Shouldn't we certify to its safety? There are just a few reasons to do that. I am going to bring up the Rocky Flats plant northwest of Denver.  Fourteen years ago, this plant, which had produced pultonium pits, sank permanently into a multibillion-dollar cesspool of contamination, criminality, and managerial incompetence. I am quoting from an article in the bulletin of Atomic Scientists:       Not to worry says, the Department of Energy, Rocky Flats II      will have all the necessary equipment for suppressing      plutonium fires that regrettably cannot be totally      eliminated, but whose frequency and severity can be reduced,      and even planned for, in the structural and process designs.  This keeps getting mixed up. We already have $2.3 billion appropriated for a pit facility at Los Alamos, and that facility will begin producing 20 pits per year in 2007 and can be equipped to produce as many as 80 pits per year and can be further enlarged to produce 150 pits per year. At what are we throwing this money? How big does this thing have to get? That is what is going on in this. It may be that Los Alamos is having trouble with it. I don't know. But I do know this: Throwing money at it is not the solution.  It might be useful to put the entire report language in the Record. I ask unanimous consent to print the report language in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Funding, House Language on New Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Testing,                            September 12, 2003       The Senate is currently considering the Energy & Water      Appropriations bill. On Tuesday, Senators Feinstein and      Kennedy will offer an amendment to reduce and restrict      funding for specific nuclear weapons budget items.

Excerpts from the House Energy and Water Development Appropriations                     Act, 2004--House Report 108-212       The Committee provides $5,000,000 for RNEP and eliminates      funding for additional advanced concepts research in favor of      higher priority current mission requirements. The Committee      is concerned the NNSA is being tasked to start new activities      with significant outyear budget impacts before the      Administration has articulated the specific requirements to      support the President's announced stockpile modifications.      Under current plans, the NNSA is attempting to modernize the      industrial infrastructure of the weapons complex and restore      production plant capability in order to refurbish the entire      START I stockpile, reengineer the Federal management      structure of the complex     and downsize the workforce by 20 percent by the end of fiscal      year 2004, while struggling to successfully demonstrate its      core mission of maintaining the existing stockpile through      the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Before any of the existing      program goals have been successfully demonstrated, the      Administration is now proposing to spend millions on enhanced      test readiness while maintaining the moratorium on nuclear      testing, aggressively pursue a multi-billion dollar Modern      Pit Facility before the first production pit has been      successfully certified for use in the stockpile, develop a      robust nuclear earth penetrator weapon and begin additional      advanced concepts research on new nuclear weapons. It appears      to the Committee the Department is proposing to rebuild,      restart, and redo and otherwise exercise every capability      that was used over the past forty years of the Cold War and      at the same time prepare for a future with an expanded      mission for nuclear weapons. Nothing in the past performance      of the NNSA convinces this Committee that the successful      implementation of Stockpile Stewardship program is a foregone      conclusion, which makes the pursuit of a broad range of new      initiatives premature. Until the NNSA has demonstrated to the      Congress that it can successfully meet its primary mission of      maintaining the safety, security, and viability of the      existing stockpile by executing the Stockpile Life Extension      Program and Science-based Stewardship activities on time and      within budget, this Committee will not support redirecting      the management resources and attention to a series of new      initiatives.
