Speaker, I rise in honor of National Sportsmanship Day, which is being observed today in the United States and throughout the world. Since its inception in 1991, over 7,000 schools in all 50 States and 48 countries have joined in the National Sportsmanship Day festivities.  National Sportsmanship Day was conceived by the Institute for International Sport, located in my congressional district at the University of Rhode Island. This year's slogan, ``Dare to Play Fair,'' challenges athletes, coaches, administrators, and parents to reflect on the true meaning of competition and to discuss the importance of ethics and fair play in sport, the classroom, and everyday life.  The institute has enlisted the help of several Sports Ethics Fellows, including two time Boston Marathon winner and Olympic gold medalist Joan Benoit Samuelson, to promote this event. These men and women are wonderful role models who can be admired for more than just their athletic prowess. They have consistently demonstrated an interest in furthering the principles of honesty and integrity in sport and society.  Indeed, the Sports Ethics Fellows are helping to teach the important lessons of National Sportsmanship Day by writing articles relating to sportsmanship and assisting in the development of programs for National Sportsmanship Day. Through competition, young athletes can learn that while winning is a goal worth working for, honor, discipline, and hard work are more important. These values will guide them in all aspects of everyday life.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the Rhode Island congressional delegation in recognizing this day and the principles it embodies.                          ____________________
