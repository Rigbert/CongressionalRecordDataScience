President, the issues raised in this are serious matters, and the Senator from Iowa, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cornyn, and others should be concerned about this.  I think of a victim I have talked with, Holly Austin Smith. She was 14 years old when she ran away from home and quickly became a victim of human trafficking. She met a man in a shopping mall who told her she was pretty, and promised he would give her a glamorous life in California. Remember, she was 14 years old. Then he sold her for sex. The first man she was sold to commented that she reminded him of his own granddaughter--but then he paid $200 to rape her.  Thankfully, Holly escaped and has rebuilt her life. She is now a fierce advocate of ending all forms of human trafficking because she knows what happens to those who are trafficked. But many are not so lucky. The physical and psychological scars of being bought and sold, of being raped multiple times a night by different men, are devastating. This terrible crime destroys lives.  As we consider legislation to combat human trafficking, we must remember Holly and the thousands of other vulnerable and victimized children she represents, and we must do everything we can to keep it from happening in the first place.  Last Congress, in 2013, I led the effort to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. That historic bipartisan legislation and the funds it authorized signaled our country's commitment to ending all forms of human trafficking, both here at home and around the world. So I am glad, after the attention we gave to my bill last Congress, to see the Senate return its attention to this issue. Stories such as Holly's make clear we have more work to do.  I support the bill we take up today, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, but I believe we must do more to prevent trafficking in the first place. We have to act to protect our young people before they become victims. It is one thing to say now that you have become a victim, we are here to help you. It does even more if we can stop them from being victims in the first place.  The legislation that Senator Collins of Maine and I have introduced seeks to do just that. Homeless and runaway kids are exceptionally vulnerable to human traffickers. A recent surveyfound that one in four homeless teens was a victim of sex trafficking or had been forced to provide sex for survival needs.  These vulnerable children, alone and on the street, are walking prey. Human traffickers lurk around bus stops and parks where homeless children congregate. They offer promises of something to eat and a night off the streets. They exploit the very sad reality that most of these children have no place to go. The weather may be cold. Far too many of our cities have no shelter for kids, and those who do face a chronic shortage of beds. Then somebody comes up and says: I will offer you food, I will offer you a warm place to sleep for the night.  As Representative Poe recently said at an event on ending human trafficking: We have more animal shelters in this country than places for young people to find a safe place to sleep. What does that say about our priorities? I have nothing against having the animal shelters, but shouldn't we have more for our children than we do for the animals?  If we are serious about preventing human trafficking, we must protect these kids. We have to provide better outreach to them, more beds for them to sleep in, and more counseling to get them on the path to a stable life. This kind of prevention costs money, but it saves lives and prevents the far more costly effects of human trafficking--not just the effects of human trafficking on the victims' part, but the cost to all of us. This is smart money we ought to be proud to invest in our children. We must include the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act in our efforts here to prevent more of our kids from becoming victims. I look forward, at the appropriate place, to offering our bipartisan legislation as an amendment.  I know other Senators have amendments they wish to see considered. Senator Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has an important piece of legislation to combat sex and labor trafficking in countries around the world. I thank him for working with me to make some improvements to its funding provisions and I hope this bipartisan legislation will be considered as an amendment by the full Senate.  I mentioned earlier Senator Klobuchar has been working for years to see the safe harbor bill get passed, to make sure victims are treated as victims and not as criminals. I am proud to cosponsor her bill. After all, as I said about the Violence Against Women Act, a victim is a victim is a victim. They are not criminals. They are victims.  Senator McConnell has long promised a full amendment process. I take him at his word and I expect we will have the opportunity to strengthen the underlying bill with a variety of ideas from Senators. We owe it to survivors such as Holly to pass the strongest possible bill.  We have to provide the resources desperately needed by those on the front lines protecting young people every day, such as those in my home State of Vermont at Spectrum Services and the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs service providers. We owe it to all the survivors who bravely come forward and tell their stories, hoping to prevent just one more child from falling prey to this terrible crime.  The Senate has to pass a strong, comprehensive bill that includes prevention and prosecution, but also services for victims. We haven't accomplished as much as we should if we are only able to prosecute the perpetrator after the fact and forget about helping the victim. We have to stop trafficking from happening in the first place; but if it does happen, we have to help the victims.  An editorial in the New York Times last week noted that:     . . . a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront      this human-rights problem and help its victims, often      runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or      coerced into prostitution.  I agree with that editorial, and I look forward to working with every Senator here to ensure we get this done for the American people.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, March 5, 2015]                 Steps Against Juvenile Sex Trafficking                        (By the Editorial Board)       The impression that America's sex-trafficking problem      mostly involves young people smuggled from overseas has given      way to broad recognition of a cruel homegrown reality: the      tens of thousands of juveniles who are exploited each year by      traffickers in this country.       On Capitol Hill, a consensus is emerging on new initiatives      to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims,      often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or      coerced into prostitution.       The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously      approved a pair of anti-trafficking bills with wide backing      from victim advocates and other experts, and the full Senate      is expected to take up the package soon.       A bill championed by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of      Texas, would create a new pool of financing--through      additional fines on people convicted of sex and labor      trafficking, child pornography and other crimes--for      restitution, victim services and law enforcement. The idea of      aiding victims without committing more tax dollars has drawn      support from Republicans, and any new money for this badly      underfinanced cause would help.       The Cornyn bill would also encourage prosecution of the      ``johns,'' or buyers of juvenile sex, who typically escape      criminal charges even though they are paying for what amounts      to the statutory rape of children and teenagers. Their demand      is what's fueling the highly lucrative human slavery      business.       The second bill, put forward by Senator Amy Klobuchar,      Democrat of Minnesota, would give a preference for Department      of Justice law enforcement grants to states that adopt ``safe      harbor'' laws.       These laws help ensure that young people sold for sex are      treated as victims and offered support services instead of      being prosecuted. The House has approved similar bills, so it      should not be hard to hammer out a strong final package.       A preventive measure that would help ensure housing and      services for homeless juveniles, who are often prey to      traffickers, unfortunately stalled in the Senate Judiciary      Committee. One obstacle was the resistance of some      Republicans to its nondiscrimination provision guaranteeing      fair treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender      youths.       No young person should ``have to choose between selling      their bodies and a safe place to sleep,'' said Senator Susan      Collins, Republican of Maine, who introduced the bill with      Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Undeterred, they plan to      seek consideration from the full Senate.       Trafficking abroad remains a tremendous problem, so it is      fitting that a promising approach comes from the Senate      Foreign Relations Committee, which last week unanimously      approved a measure to create an international public-private      fund dedicated to the issue, similar to the Global Fund to      Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. More resources could do      a lot to help trafficking's victims at home, too.
