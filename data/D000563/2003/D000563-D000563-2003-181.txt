Now that that Superfund is virtually bankrupt and without funds, what the Bush administration has said is we would not dare ask the polluting industries. Instead, we ask every taxpaying family and business in America to pay for Superfund cleanup. That is fundamentally unfair.  Why should ordinary taxpayers face the responsibility of pollution and toxic waste created by an industry? The Superfund, which has been supported by Democratic and Republican Presidents, and rejected by this President, I think was a fair approach. Because this President will not fund it and because he will not come back and ask for the polluting industries to pay, there is no money for the Superfund cleanup.  What do we have left? We have the stern policy from the administration and a new administrator who says he supports it. The result of it? More toxic waste sites in my State, perhaps in the Senator's, that are there to endanger public health. How can that possibly be in the best interest of America?
