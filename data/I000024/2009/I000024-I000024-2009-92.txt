President, a surprise to a lot of people as to what we can do in the oil and gas business when we are concerned right now about the problem we have--our dependence on foreign countries for the ability to run this machine called America--is that we actually could resolve that problem. We could produce enough oil and gas and all the other resources I mentioned earlier so we would not have to be dependent on the Middle East for anything.  Increasing attention has been given to hydraulic fracturing, a key production method which aided in U.S. production of oil and gas from more than 1 million wells and continues to aid in the production from over 35,000 wells a year.  Hydraulic fracturing is a system that forces water into the ground to release oil and gas coming up. In fact, there are two things that open our potential. One is horizontal drilling and the other is hydraulic fracturing. It is a 60-year old technique. It has been responsible for 7 billion barrels of oil and 600 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
