Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for that excellent statement. And I would like to at this point yield to my colleague, the gentleman from West Virginia, Mr. Bob Wise, who is familiar with another aspect of employment in America that at one time was the most dangerous. And were it not for efforts that have been made at Federal and State levels, might still be the most dangerous and still is very hazardous. And I would like to yield at this point to Mr. Wise.
