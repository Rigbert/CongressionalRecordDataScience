 On this record, our friends' objections to Judge Pryor seem inconsistent and arbitrary.  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his time and remind our colleagues that we have confirmed Democratic nominees who have had deep personal objections to Supreme Court precedent. I recall we confirmed Janet Reno 98 to 0, even though her personal views on the death penalty were at odds with Supreme Court precedent. We ought not have a double standard. We should applaud Judge Pryor for his forthrightness and his commitment to the rule of law, and we ought to confirm this distinguished nominee.  I also want to say to my friend from Alabama, I know he probably knows Judge Pryor better than anybody else in the Senate and has had a greater opportunity to evaluate his integrity, his intellect, and has really seen him in action. I think our colleagues ought to listen to the junior Senator from Alabama because he really knows Bill Pryor and can attest to the fact that Bill Pryor took actions much like Judge Pickering did in the 1960s, to which Senator Alexander was referring, that took extraordinary courage given the climate of public opinion in the State of Alabama.
