Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from California yielding, because I suspect this debate is closing.  Mr. Chairman, the Furse amendment is not a referendum on earmarks. A lot of us on a bipartisan basis have reservations, as the gentleman from California [Mr. Brown] has said, about the earmarking concept. What we are concerned about is when a university does cooperate with the bipartisan leadership of the Committee on Science, does things in an above the board way, and incurs these obligations, it is a great mistake to then in effect tear up all of that good work which has the potential to serve the country. This is not a referendum on earmarks. This is a question of fairness for a particular university that has cooperated with the Congress in a bipartisan way.
