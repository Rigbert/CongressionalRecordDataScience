 The Presiding Officer must face the same thing in the State of Florida with your loyalties for sports teams. You cannot win in the State of Illinois. No matter where you go you will run into opposition--whether a Cardinals, Cubs, or White Sox fan.  I think we have made that issue. At least my position on that issue is clear as we can.  I say in closing, and I certainly invite the Senator from Missouri to respond, we ought to ask ourselves the basic question: If you have a business in America that is unsuccessful, and the business has a loss in one given year, we provide in our Tax Code that business can carry that loss forward from the year that it was experienced, so next year's profits can be reduced accordingly. Your tax liability is reduced accordingly. It is a carry-forward provision for business losses.  It seems to me consistent to say that those corporations which have extraordinary profit taking--as we see with these major oil companies--would be subject to additional taxes.  I am sure the Senator from Missouri disagrees with me. But we have now seen virtually--I am trying to figure the calculation--roughly 30 percent increase in profits for the major oil companies in the United States of America, over the last 6 months, over last year. Last year was a big year for them. Last year, in the same 6-month period, they had about $39 billion in profits. This was with $40-a-barrel oil. This year it is up 30 percent over last year's profits.  Why? We know why. When we go to the gas station, we know why. The price at the pump has gone up dramatically.  The Senator from Missouri thinks this is holy ground, that we should not touch that money: My goodness, these people were brave enough and creative enough and entrepreneurial enough to raise gasoline prices, and we ought to accept that as the reality of capitalism.  But the Tax Code says even if you are profitable you pay taxes. My position is that if you have these windfall profits at the expense of our economy and families and businesses you should face a windfall profits tax. The money should come back to consumers. The money should come back to fund the LIHEAP program. The money should come back to create an incentive for automobile manufacturers to make fuel-efficient cars. I don't think that is an unreasonable position to take.  If the oil companies know that every dollar they make in profits by raising the price of gasoline at the pump is subject to a 50-percent tax, maybe they will slow down a little bit. Maybe they will not raise the prices as high next time. Wouldn't that be nice if there was some disincentive for these prices being skyrocketed and kited on the average family and business? I don't think it is unreasonable. When we consider the alternatives we are facing in this town right now, it makes a lot of sense.  We have arguments being made now that to pay for Hurricane Katrina we have to cut basic programs in this country for the most vulnerable Americans. The idea of cutting food stamps and health care for the poorest people in our country in order to pay for the victims of Hurricane Katrina strikes me as unfair to the nth degree. Why in the world would we help the poor people of Katrina by hurting other poor people in America and look the other way when it comes to the profits of oil companies?  For goodness' sake, a windfall profit tax I have proposed could generate about $40 billion. That is a big chunk of the $60 billion we have heard appropriated for Hurricane Katrina.  Is it unreasonable that these oil companies would help to pay for the greatest natural disaster in modern memory? At least something good would come of it, and we would not be cutting the programs and the basic policies that help the most vulnerable people in America.  I didn't mean to try to get the last word in. I wanted to give the Senator from Missouri that opportunity, but because he is chairman of the subcommittee it means he will ultimately have the last word on this bill and anything else that comes before the Senate.                          ____________________[Pages S11461-S11468]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          A NEW ENERGY FUTURE
