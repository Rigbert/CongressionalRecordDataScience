 President, I am offering today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Joseph Gabra and his wife, Sharon Kamel, Egyptian nationals currently living with their children in Camarillo, CA.  Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel entered the United States legally on November 1, 1998, on tourist visas. They immediately filed for political asylum based on religious persecution.  The couple fled Egypt because they had been targeted for their active involvement in the Coptic Christian Church in Egypt. Mr. Gabra was repeatedly jailed by Egyptian authorities because of his work for the church. In addition, Ms. Kamel's cousin was murdered and her brother's business was fire-bombed.  When Ms. Kamel became pregnant with their first child, the family was warned by a member of the Muslim brotherhood that if they did not raise their child as a Muslim, the child would be kidnapped and taken from them.  Frightened by these threats, the young family sought refuge in the United States. Unfortunately, when they sought asylum here, Mr. Gabra, who has a speech impediment, had difficulty communicating his fear of persecution to the immigration judge.  The judge denied their petition, telling the family that he did not see why they could not just move to another city in Egypt to avoid the abuse they were suffering. Since the time that they were denied asylum, Ms. Kamel's brother, who lived in the same town and suffered similar abuse, was granted asylum.  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe that, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States citizen children would endure immense and unfair hardship.  First, in the nine years that Mr. Gabra and Ms. Kamel have lived here, they have worked to adjust their status through the appropriate legal channels. They came to the United States on a lawful visa and immediately notified authorities of their intent to seek asylum here. They have played by the rules and followed our laws.  In addition, during those nine years, the couple has had four U.S. citizen children who do not speak Arabic and are unfamiliar with Egyptian culture. If the family is deported, the children would have to acclimate to a different culture, language and way of life.  Jessica, 8, is the Gabra's oldest child, and in the Gifted and Talented Education program in Ventura County. Rebecca, age 7, and Rafael, age 6, are old enough to understand that they would be leaving their schools, their teachers, their friends and their home. Veronica, the Gabra's youngest child, is just 18 months old.  More troubling is the very real possibility that if sent to Egypt, these four American children would suffer discrimination and persecution because of their religion, just as the rest of their family reports.  Mr. Gabra and Ms. Kamel have made a positive life for themselves and their family in the United States. Both have earned college degrees in Egypt and once in the United States, Mr. Gabra passed the Certified Public Accountant Examination on August 4, 2003. Since arriving here, Mr. Gabra has consistently worked to support his family.  The positive impact they have made on their community is highlighted by the fact that I received a letter of support on their behalf signed by 160 members of their church and community. From everything I have learned about the family, we can expect that they will continue to contribute to their community in productive ways.  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel.  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the private relief bill and the numerous letters of support my office has received from members of the Camarillo community be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 933       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act      (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel shall      each be deemed to have been lawfully admitted to, and      remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible for      adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted      for permanent residence under section 245 of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an      application for such adjustment of status.       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall      apply only if the application for adjustment of status is      filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the      date of the enactment of this Act.       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting      of permanent resident status to Joseph Gabra and Sharon      Kamel, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper      officer to reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent      fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are      made available to natives of the country of Joseph Gabra and      Sharon Kamel's birth under section 202(e) or 203(a) of the      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e), 1153(a)),      as applicable.                                  ____                                                February 14, 2007.       Dear Mrs. Feinstein: I am writing you today to beg you for      help. A friend and fellow parent is scheduled for deportation      on Monday 2/19 at 10:00 a.m. Her name is Sharon Malak Kamel      Hendy (alien # A75-647-452). I was horrified to hear this      information. Sharon is a wonderful person and mother. She has      4 children: Jessica (8) who is in my son's class, Rebecca.      (7), Rafael (6) who is in Kindergarten with my daughter and      Veronica (18 months). All of the children are American      citizens.       Sharon and her husband, Joseph Ayad Gabra Youssef (alien #      A75-647-253) came to the United States in 1998. They fled      their country of Egypt from terrorist threats on their lives      and the life of their unborn child (Jessica) due to the fact      that they are Christians. They have pursued all legal      avenues, to become citizens. Due to time lines being moved      up, both have been notified that deportation will occur.      Sharon is the first to receive the notice.       I am mortified that the United States would deport hard      working people that try to stay the legal way. To top that      off, they parents of 4 beautiful American citizen children.       Please help Sharon and Joseph with extensions and a way for      them to obtain green cards.       Thank you for your time and consideration and May God bless      you.           Sincerely,     Sharon D. Vopat-Mitchell.                                  ____                                                February 14, 2007.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am on staff at Camarillo      Community Church as director of Adult Education and Family      Ministry and am a licensed minister. I am also a California      resident and a navy veteran. I am writing on behalf of the      Gabra family who has been a member of this congregation for      many years.       Joseph and Sharon Gabra fled Egypt seeking asylum because      of the growing persecution of people who identify themselves      with Jesus Christ (Christians). This persecution historically      included job and housing discrimination but now is becoming      more detrimental to the health and safety of Christians.      Kidnapping, rape and murder are common responses against      Christians by radical, extremists Muslims in Egypt.       Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (Gabra) has received deportation      orders and is scheduled to leave Monday, February 19, 2007.      She would leave behind four children, all American citizens.      Should she take them to Egypt it would be very likely they      would be kidnapped or outright murdered. Joseph's case is      still pending but the same logic used to send Sharon back      would still be expected in his case.       I see, on a daily basis, the devastating consequences of      raising children without a mother or father in the home. I      ask you to intervene on behalf of this family, particularly      the American raised children. Please use your influence as a      Senator and a spokesperson for the people of California to      keep Sharon in the United States and eventually giving the      Gabra family permanent status.       Thank you for your consideration.           Very respectfully,     William J. Moyer.                                  ____     Re political asylum applications of Joseph Ayad Gabra Youssef          and Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy.                                                Camarillo, CA,                                                February 14, 2007.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am asking your immediate      attention to a bureaucratic problem which may put one fine      Christian family in terrorist hands. Time is of the essence      as one family member (the mother of their 4 children--ages 8,      7, 6 and 18 mos.), who is scheduled for deportation on 2-19-     2007. They only received the notice on 2-6-2007; our church      family became aware of this problem on 2-11-2007. For your      information other family members have already been granted      political asylum in the United States. They have complied      with all of the laws. Again, this is a problem of      bureaucratic overload and we need real human intervention      from your office to prevent unnecessary family separation,      let alone possible death due to their religion convictions.       I plead with your office to grant an extension as they have      been working since November 1, 1998 on this goal to become      citizens of the United States; from my perspective, their      arrival occurred three years before 9-11-2001 and they knew      their danger. I already call them citizens of America from my      heart as they have shown by their actions and     commitment to be such with pride and honor.       Thank you for your immediate attention on behalf of this      beautiful family as your action would show the real intent of      the Lady of Liberty in New York Harbor as our country is a      land of laws and integrity.           Most sincerely,     Toni Webster.                                  ____                                   Camarillo Community Church,                                                February 12, 2007.       To Whom It May Concern: Please review this deportation      possibility and if possible please help us with a reprieve.       Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (A75 647 452) has four small      children all born in America and is being asked to leave our      country back to Egypt. This seems so unreasonable to send a      mother of four children to a country that is unfriendly to      her religious preference. To separate her from her husband      and children seems so un-American.       Attached is a Summary of the political asylum for you to      review. She has a deportation date of the 19th of February.       Thank you for any help you can give this family. They have      become a part of our church family at Camarillo Community      Church, 1322 Las Posas Road, Camarillo, CA 93010.

Re Joseph & Sharon Gabra.     Senator Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Ms. Feinstein, I'm writing to you on behalf of Joseph      and Sharon Gabra, who are good friends of mine and fellow      members of Camarillo Community Church. The Gabras are      Egyptian nationals who fled Egypt in 1998 due to religious      persecution. As Christians in a Muslim society, they      experienced terrible persecution; they were threatened by      government officials to recant their beliefs and embrace      Islam, or suffer the consequences, which meant their child      would be taken from them and placed in a home where the child      would be raised in Islam. They came to the United States to      raise their family and begin a new life. Sharon was pregnant      with their first child when they arrived here on a visitor's      permit.       Since coming to our country they have had four children,      one of whom is a good friend of my daughter, McKenna. The      Gabras are very involved in our church community, always      willing to lend a hand in the children's ministries. Joseph      is a college-educated accountant and one of the hardest      working men I know, and Sharon has a degree in social work.      Both are very well regarded by the people of our church.       For several years the Gabras have worked diligently to      become U.S. citizens, and have done so in all the right ways,      but it appears they are finally out of options. Sharon      received a notice last week that she will be deported on      February 19, at which time she will be forced to leave her      family behind. This means four children under the age of      eight, including an 18-month-old, will be left in the care of      their father, who must continue to work full-time to support      his family.       With less than a week before Sharon's deportation, I'm      writing to ask that you please stand for this family, that      you would intercede on behalf of Sharon Gabra give her family      a real chance at achieving their dream of a home in the      United States. They are the kind of people we hope will      become American citizens--good, honest, moral, and hard-     working. Thank you for your consideration.           Best regards,     Keith James.                                  ____                                   Camarillo Community Church,                                                    Camarillo, CA.       To the Hon. Senator Dianne Feinstein: I am writing in      regard to Joseph Ayad Gabra Youssef (A 75 647 253) and his      wife Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (A 75 647 452). This Christian      couple has applied for asylum in the United States because      their lives were threatened by Moslem terrorists in their      home country of Egypt. They fled Egypt in 1998 when Sharon      was pregnant with their first child, hoping to find a safe      place to raise their children. They have been seeking asylum      here in the U.S, but the process has been slow and difficult.      They now have four children and the children are all citizens      of the United States, having been born here. This is a      wonderful young family that has become a valued part of our      church and community, but they are now being threatened with      immediate deportation. Our entire church congregation is very      concerned for the welfare of this family and fearful of the      consequence of their return to Egypt. Please, we earnestly      request your help in assisting this family.           Sincerely,                                                Ralph Rittenhouse,     Senior Pastor.                                  ____                                   Camarillo Community Church,                                                February 14, 2007.       Senator Barbara Feinstein: I faxed a note to you yesterday      and apparently the bottom portion of the note was cut off in      the fax so I am resending the fax with this, a more detailed      letter. Yesterday's note was written in a hurry because of      the urgent nature of this request.       I am a Licensed Minister, Pastor of Children's Ministries      at Camarillo Community Church in Camarillo, California. I      have held this position for two years and prior to that I was      the director of a Preschool and After School Program at      Trinity Presbyterian Church in Camarillo, California. I have      a true love and desire to see young children grow to become      confident, successful adults and know that it is only in      building up the child that we avoid the difficult task of      rebuilding the broken man. The issue I am bringing to your      attention deals with the brokenness of man which is now      impacting the lives of four children and their parents who      have become very precious to me and the community of      Camarillo.       It is hard for me, as an American, to truly grasp the      dangers Christians face in the Muslim world; however, the      threats that caused Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (A 75 647 253)      and Joseph Ayad Gabra Youssef (A 75 647 452) to flee Egypt      were real and continue to be present for them should they be      forced to leave our country. The evil caused by children who      have been raised in hatred, towards Americans and/or non      Muslims, who have now become adults in leadership--     terrorists--is REAL. Until we can break the cycle of hatred      and replace it with love and respect one for another      regardless of birth place or faith we will continue to      struggle with adults filled with evil. In the meantime we      must do all we can to protect those in our area from the      evils of terrorism.       Although the Gabra family has been active within our      church, it was not until Sunday, February 11, 2007 that we      became aware of the gravity of their situation. They have      been trying to handle the issue on their own so as not to be      a burden to anyone. They came to America for Safety rather      than financial gain and do not wish to be a burden on our      society. I do not understand the legal hoops that have to be      jumped to keep Sharon from deportation on February 19, 2007--     but I do know that the family has been attempting to meet the      requirements and jump through the hoops ever since their      arrival in 1999. It seems that they have, up to this point,      received less than appropriate or fair treatment in our court      system.       The children, Jessica, age 8, Rebecca, age 7, Raphael, age      6 and Veronica, 18 months are all American born, English      speaking children. They fit the profile of typical American      children, attending public school, active in our children's      ministries programs on Sundays and weekdays for AWANA and      other children's events. Without knowledge of their parent's      birthplace, one would never know there was a difference      between them and their American born peers. They are a family      who treasures one another and desires to be a blessing to      those around them in a safe society. The deportation of their      mother to Egypt--a place where her, her husband's, and the      life of their unborn first child were threatened unless they      turn from Christianity and return to Islam--would be      devastating.       It is my hope that you will be able to use your legal      authority to stop the deportation scheduled for February 19,      2007. Know that there are many in Camarillo depending on your      leadership to help in this matter. We commit to follow the      laws of our country in order to bring this family to safety.      We are asking for the time to help them fulfill the      requirements.           Sincerely,                                                 Elaine Francisco,     Pastor of Children's Ministries.                                  ____                                                February 12, 2007.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I hope that you will please take      the time to read this letter for immediate help to the Gabra      family. The mother of this family is scheduled to be deported      on 2/19/2007 and the father fears the same. The big problem      is that the family has four children between the ages of 8      years and 18 months and are all American Citizens. This      family fled Egypt in 1998 because they were pregnant with      their first child and were threatened to have their child      taken from them because of their Christian beliefs. They came      on a visitor's visa and did all the required steps to become      legal. After 9/11/2001 they thought they would have a better      chance, but by then they were allowing only one Judge to      review the cases instead of 3 which shortened the time for      accomplishing the same number of cases. By the law they      became illegal and were subject to deportation.       Only the Mother, Sharon Malak Kamel Hendy (Alien Number: A      75-647-452) received notice of deportation. She is to be      deported 2/19/2007. This would leave her husband Joseph Ayad      Gabra Youssef (Alien Number: A 75-647-253) here to work and      care for 4 children from age 8 yrs. to 18 months. His      deportation notice will probably come next and this will lead      to danger for the children. If this happens, the children      would suffer the most in Egypt from the Terrorists because      they only speak English.       I have taught Sunday school to 3 of their children and they      are a lovely, hard working, honest family and want to become      citizens. If they are deported their lives are in danger.      Also, as Christians, they will not be able to find      employment. The children are as follows: Jessica Gabra--8      years; Rebecca Gabra--7 years; Rafael Gabra--6 years;      Veronica Gabra--18 months.       Please help us to get an extension for Sharon and a way for      them to get green cards. They are the kind of people our      country would be proud to have as citizens.       I'm pleading with you to help us. I know the time is short,      but they just received the     deportation notice 6 days ago. We would be forever in your      debt if you can help the Gabra Family. This family is fearing      for their lives and safety right now.           Sincerely,     Linda Davis.                                  ____                                                John F. Laubacher,                                  Certified Public Accountant,                                     Camarillo, CA, Feb. 11, 2007.     Senator Dianne Feinstein.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing this on behalf of my      friend and fellow CPA Joseph Gabra and his family. His wife      has been ordered to appear on Feb. 19th for deportation. I      have known the Gabra family for a number of years and am      writing in hopes that you will intervenue on his wife's      behalf and either: a. Seek a stay of execution of the order      to deport Mrs. Gabra; or b. Help them to arrange a green card      to allow her to remain in the U.S.       Mr. Gabra is a great asset to our community. He is employed      by a client of mine as an accountant and I have seen      firsthand the tremendous integrity and thoroughness that he      brings to his job each day. He is a wonderful example to his      co-workers and the general public.       Joseph was not always working as an accountant here even      though he is a CPA in his native country. Finding work as an      accountant was difficult due to a speech impediment. But he      has always been a hard worker, taking manual labor jobs to      stay off any public assistance. He has now been working in      his field and my client is thrilled with the job he is doing.      In addition, he travels to Cal State Northridge to get help      with his speech problem.       Mrs. Gabra is a homemaker and takes care of their four      children that range from 8 years old to 18 months. She is      involved at our church as well in a number of programs. The      family has been a great addition to my church and the      Camarillo community in general.       But if Mrs. Gabra is deported, the damage will not just be      to the community. There is danger that faces the family if      they are returned to Egypt. Mr. Gabra will not be able to      find work there because he is a Christian. The family will      face incredible persecution. The kids are U.S. citizens who      will suffer if they are sent to Egypt because they do not      speake the language and they are Christians, not Muslim. They      could be forced to convert to Islam or be killed. The girls      face a barbaric ritual of female circumcision. They are      dedicated to each other as a family. So, while Mrs. Gabra is      the only one being forced to leave at this time, splitting up      the family into two countries is simply not an option.       Senator, Mr. Gabra is a man of faith. He is confident that      God will provide a rcsolution to this problem. I, too, am a      man of faith. But I believe that perhaps God will use you to      provide the miracle that the Gabra family needs now in order      to stay together. I am asking you to intercede on their      behalf.       Thank you and your staff for taking the time to read this      and consider my request. He's a good man. They are a good      family. And they deserve better than the death sentence the      U.S. Government is giving them. His letter follows along with      the order from the Dept. of Homeland Security. Please help.           Very truly yours,                                           John F. Laubacher, CPA.                                 ______                                       By
