So we will be off Friday. Now, is the gentleman pretty definite on the following Monday that we will be in at 6:30 as opposed to the normal Tuesday?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, as definite as one can be. But as I mentioned, we will evaluate the workload for that week. If at all possible, we could probably start on Tuesday. But I think Members need to plan that we could very well have votes on Monday night.
