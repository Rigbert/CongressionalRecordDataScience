I do not think the administration is yet for parity. They did not offer parity. This Congress has repeatedly said they are for parity. In fact, the President's pay advisory committee says that civilians are further behind comparable private sector jobs than the military. In light of that, certainly we must adopt the premise that 4.1 percent pay raise will be adopted; but I say to my friend that if this is solely for the purposes of supplementation, then I think that it is not objectionable. But my concern is that they fund this, but not the pay raise.
