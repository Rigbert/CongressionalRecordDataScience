 President, I am pleased to bring the fiscal year 1998 foreign operations, export promotion, and related programs appropriations bill to the Senate for consideration today. I might say at the outset that we anticipate finishing this bill tonight. There are very few amendments of which I am aware and, hopefully, we can mirror the speed with which the Department of Defense appropriations bill and the energy and water appropriations bill were completed.  Senator Leahy and I have worked closely together to produce a bill which effectively serves vital international U.S. political and economic priorities with the $13 billion allocated to our subcommittee.  Let me point out right up front that while the bill stands at $13 billion, we are funding $13.2 billion on programs; the difference is due to the Budget Committee's treatment of arrears at international financial institutions.  For the first time in more than a decade, the foreign operations account actually experienced an increase. We can thank Senator Stevens for understanding how important it is to have international options short of sending in U.S. troops. I might just say, Mr. President, on that point, there are a number of our colleagues who are particularly enthusiastic about the defense option, and I am among them. On the other hand, being able to engage overseas without the use of troops is frequently, always, less dangerous and, many times, less expensive.  For the better part of the last 3 years, Senator Leahy and I have warned that the United States would pay long-term consequences if we continued the pattern of shortsighted gains made by reducing foreign assistance.  Finally, the administration listened. I want to commend Secretary Albright for making an increase in the 150 account her first and foremost priority. The nearly $1 billion increase arrested a devastating decade-long decline.  I think it is important to put this increase in perspective. Measured against foreign aid's peak year of 1985, our resources have dropped nearly 60 percent. Since 1990, we have seen a 40-percent reduction. Keep in mind that those cuts have occurred in times when the United States established assistance programs to help strengthen and stabilize more than two dozen new, emerging democracies.  As we welcome Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO, thereby expanding European stability and security arrangements, we should all remember it was the United States economic and security assistance that helped make this possible.  Just taking a look, Mr. President, at the chart here behind me, my colleagues will notice that in 1985, in billions, the foreign operations account was $28.2 billion. A mere 12 years later, it was $12.2. And what we are seeing this year, after a decline of $28.2 to $12 billion, is an increase back up to $13.4 billion.  I will argue, as I did a few moments ago, that given the new responsibilities to the new emerging democracies, that this increase this year in the 150 account is entirely appropriate.  The aspirations, ingenuity, and determination of the citizens of these countries--particularly in Central Europe--combined with American grants, loans, exchanges, training, and equipment to build democratic institutions, strong free markets, and responsible military partners makes a lot of sense.  Obviously, this effort should be continued. The combination of an increase in the foreign assistance allocation, along with progress made by emerging European democracies, have made this a key transition year--one in which we have an opportunity to initiate support for new priorities while ending or establishing clear performance benchmarks in countries where U.S. support is not fulfilling political or economic expectations.  In this context, let me review some of the bill's highlights.  In title I, we have increased export promotion support over the administration's request. We have fully funded the Trade and Development Agency and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and to compensate for dismal forecasting at the Eximbank, wehave increased the funding there as well.  No one is more pleased than I am that there is a new team directing the Bank's important work. However, the new Chairman arrives in with the news that the Bank expects to have to carry over into 1998 nearly $400 million in planned or possible 1997 projects because of a shortfall in available funding. At a time when everyone recognizes that exports are key to American economic growth, we need to support Exim's vital mission. While the administration asked for $632 million, we have provided $700 million to support American business as they venture into tough emerging markets.  Title II provides funding for all bilateral programs, including development assistance activities, programs in the new independent states and Central and Eastern Europe, disaster aid, the Peace Corps, international narcotics control, and a consolidated fund which covers nonproliferation, demining, antiterrorism, IAEA activities, and related programs.  Within this title, there are a number of provisions which reflect the committee's new emphasis of building on success and objectively recognizing and reversing failures.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East. I will not spend a great deal of time at this point on the issue of Egypt's record over the last 2 years. Let me simply say that funding for both Egypt and Israel has always been provided in the context of the Camp David accords and a national commitment to serving the interests of peace.  Leading a renewal of the Arab economic boycott of Israel, rejecting President Clinton's plea to participate in the peace summit, and actively opposing the Hebron agreement between Israel and the Palestinians are a few reasons why Egypt no longer seems to share our commitment to regional stability and peace. To send a signal that improvements are expected if aid is to continue to flow, the committee did not earmark funds for Egypt.  In contrast, King Hussein has taken enormous risks to advance peace, and the committee reflected its support for this effort by substantially increasing economic and security assistance to Jordan. Egypt and Jordan define the basic tenet of this bill: Aid is not an entitlement program. It must be earned, and it must be deserved.  The NIS offers other examples of this approach. For several years the Senate has earmarked funds for Ukraine. Now I believe it is time to assess results. Although Ukraine has made remarkable progress in passing a constitution and introducing a new currency, I think it is time to register our concerns that corruption and the slow pace of reforms may defeat the relevance and impact of our assistance.  As in the past, we have earmarked $225 million, making clear we still believe in Ukraine's strategic importance and support the constitutional and economic changes which have been achieved. However, to leverage improvements and accelerate the pace of reforms, 35 percent of the aid package is withheld until the Secretary of State certificates progress has been made combating corruption, and moving forward with key economic and political policy changes.  Russia offers another example of where aid must better serve United States interests. For the past 2 years, the bill has included language linking the provision of aid to the termination of Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran--a provision always watered down by the administration. With elections around the corner, the administration's argument last year was simple: If we cut off aid, they said, we undermine the election chances of the only people who are committed to ending this lethal program.  Well, we all know the reformers won the election last year, and, unfortunately, the nuclear program is still around. Only now it is expanded, and the Russians are not only collaborating with Iran on a nuclear powerplant. They are working together on a missile technology program. This year a waiver allowing aid to continue--no matter what the Russians do with Iran--is simply out of the question.  Consistent with our effort to take aid off autopilot, the bill also includes language addressing the crisis in Cambodia. In our opening hearing this year, the administrator of AID referred to Cambodia as a democratic success story, a view echoed by the Secretary of State in our closing hearing. Persistent allegations of close collaboration between Cambodia's leadership and major regional drug traffickers were dismissed in that hearing, as were alarming accounts of the two prime ministers arming themselves for a resumption of civil war.  As we all know, a few short weeks ago the committee report called attention to this rapidly deteriorating situation and conditioned assistance of all further aid on progress in four key areas. The Secretary had to certify the government had taken steps to: First, end political violence and intimidation of opposition candidates; second, establish an independent election commission; third, protect voters and election participants by establishing laws and regulations guaranteeing freedom of speech and assembly; and, fourth, eliminate corruption and collaboration with narcotics dealers.  Mr. President, however elusive that goal now seems, each of these steps remains important to the future of democracy in Cambodia. With the coup engineered by Hun Sen last week, I intend to further modify these conditions as we proceed forward with this bill today.  Turning to title III, the committee has provided over $3.3 billion in security assistance, loans and grants and support for international peacekeeping. While this level reflects a slight reduction of the administration's request, we were able to provide an increase in aid to Jordan and an increase in support for Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.  Let me speak for a moment to the case of the Baltic countries. I know I am joined by many of my colleagues who believe the Baltic nations should be the next nations on the list of NATO entrants. Having never recognized their domination by the Soviet Union during the cold war, I think it is a serious mistake for the administration to now bow to Russian demands that the Baltic nations be excluded from NATO. In effect, the administration's policy relegates the Baltic States to the Russian sphere of influence, a perverse reversal of political fortune and a mistake of historic proportions.  These nations are ready, willing, and able to make a meaningful military and political contribution to NATO's mission. The funding we have provided will strengthen and deepen the Baltic ties to NATO by facilitating the completion of a civilian military regional airspace control system, an important step toward membership. This funding reflects a strong view that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia deserve to be integrated into a stable European security structure and have earned our political commitment and continued support for NATO admission.  Finally, let me turn to title IV in the bill, which provides funding for the international financial institutions. Although we have reduced the administration's request, we have been able to meet virtually all current-year obligations as well as make substantial progress on past obligations incurred by this administration.  I want all of my colleagues to know that we have once again withheld funds for IDA until the Secretary of the Treasury certificates that the interim trust fund has removed all procurement restrictions imposed which exclude American contractors.  I want the members of both the trust fund and IDA to be on notice that these restrictions must be gone before this legislation is enacted or I cannot support full funding for IDA in conference.  The last section of the bill is devoted to general provisions. One in particular is worth noting because it is in keeping with the principles we have developed to end aid as an entitlement program.  When the Dayton agreement was signed, each party pledged to support the International Tribunal's efforts to arrest and prosecute war criminals. Today, 66 indicted fugitives remain at large--with potentially many more under sealed indictment.  These are not bandits in hiding living in fear of capture. These outlaws continue to work and wander the streets and, in some cases, such those of Radovan Karadic and Ratko Mladic, they continue to exercise real power.  Section 573 ends assistance to regional authorities refusing to cooperate in the international effort to bringthese fugitives to justice. Peace in Bosnia cannot be sustained if the Tribunal fails to complete its task. Stability and economic growth depend on the repatriation of refugees consistent with the Dayton agreement--and those refugees will not return to communities which continue to be terrorized and intimidated by war criminals.  Section 573 bans aid to countries which have not cooperated in the arrest of war criminals. Waiver authority is granted to the President for a period of 6 months, if he certifies that a country has turned over a majority of war criminals. However, at the end of the 6 months, aid can only continue if the President certifies that all war criminals have been arrested.  The provision exempts democracy building, demining and humanitarian programs in an effort to afford the administration some carrots as it attempts to encourage compliance.  But, this should not be seen as a door which will be opened wider creating more exemptions and weaker standards. Let us be clear on a single point: after more than $400 million in U.S. aid, we need to implement and enforce the moral reckoning which only the Tribunal can offer. Only justice can bridge the deep divides which continue to fracture the former Yugoslavia.  Let me conclude by once again emphasizing that the increase in the 150 account represents both an opportunity and an obligation to more effectively serve American international interests. We can only accomplish this purpose if we end aid as an entitlement program. I believe this bill sets us on the right course and I encourage my colleagues to support it.                   Amendments Nos. 885, 886, and 887  Mr. McCONNELL. As an indication of how quickly we should be able to move this bill, I see that my friend and colleague from Oregon is here ready to offer an amendment, and before I yield the floor for that purpose, I will offer an amendment to earmark aid to Egypt for myself and Senator Leahy, Senator Stevens, and Senator Byrd.  I am also going to send to the desk two amendments on Cambodia.  So, Mr. President, I am sending to the desk three amendments at this time.
