 President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Senator Landrieu, my friend from Louisiana, which would allow the mandatory purchase provision for areas behind levees and dams to be eliminated.  Currently, the flood insurance program suffers from a $17 billion deficit, mostly as a result of payments made to individuals living behind manmade structures such as levees and dams.  The fact that people behind manmade flood protections do not have to purchase flood insurance clearly sends the wrong message. As we all know now, flood protections sometimes fail. Telling people they need not protect themselves from the risks associated with those failures provides a false sense of security.  Keep in mind that all of these individuals will be required to pay a rate that reflects the risk associated with living behind flood mitigation devices. Currently the rates behind many of these structures would suggest an individual homeowner would pay approximately $316 for coverage up to $350,000. That is less than $1 per day for full flood protection; $1 dollar a day. This bill eliminates the entire debt associated with this program that is owed to the Federal Government, but it also demands that in the future people begin to pay a fair price for the risk associated with living in high-risk areas.  This amendment would require that we undertake a study as to the effect of requiring insurance behind manmade structures. I believe we have learned all we need to know about the risk associated with living behind manmade flood protection devices.  The insurance premium takes into account the real risk properties face. Levees fail. They fail all the time. They do not eliminate all risk. Flood insurance protects people against unforeseen risk.  These amendments do not recognize that fact. A prudent course is risk-based premiums for everyone at risk. I strongly oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.
