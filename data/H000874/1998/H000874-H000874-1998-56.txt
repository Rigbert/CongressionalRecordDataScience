Speaker, although I have not consulted with our ranking member, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) I think I speak for Mr. Obey, and he is here, he can speak for himself obviously, but it is not our intention to debate this at any length. Very frankly, we think this issue is known to the House, known to the Senate, and we believe this ought to be done very quickly.  Am I correct?
