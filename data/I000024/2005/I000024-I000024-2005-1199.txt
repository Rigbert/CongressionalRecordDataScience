President, right now, the regular order is the motion to proceed to the highway bill. It is one of the most significant bills we will be addressing this year. It is one that we are very hopeful will pass. Last year, the highway bill passed with a vote of 76 to 21. Having received that very strong majority, we believe that this bill is so much like it that we should be able to do the same thing.  I understand that tomorrow morning at 11:45 there will be a vote. Again, as I have said since 2 this afternoon, I encourage Members to come to the floor to be heard on the motion to proceed to the highway bill, and I am hoping that will happen. I will only make a couple of comments.  I do not want to sound redundant, but I will respond to the distinguished Senator from Illinois. A couple of hours ago I commented that the people from Oklahoma maybe are different from the rest of the country. When I go down the street, people are concerned about the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.
