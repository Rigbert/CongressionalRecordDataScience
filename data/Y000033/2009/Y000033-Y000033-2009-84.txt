Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the following Op-Ed piece from the May 16, 2009 edition of the Wall Street Journal. I believe this piece speaks to the reactive nature of Congress, and will help shed some light on this issue to those both inside and outside the Beltway.              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 16, 2009]            Critics Still Haven't Read the ``Torture'' Memos                         (By Victoria Toensing)       Sen. Patrick Leahy wants an independent commission to      investigate them. Rep. John Conyers wants the Obama Justice      Department to prosecute them. Liberal lawyers want to disbar      them, and the media maligns them.       What did the Justice Department attorneys at George W.      Bush's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)--John Yoo and Jay      Bybee--do to garner such scorn? They analyzed a 1994 criminal      statute prohibiting torture when the CIA asked for legal      guidance on interrogation techniques for a high-level al      Qaeda detainee (Abu Zubaydah).       In the mid-1980s, when I supervised the legality of      apprehending terrorists to stand trial, I relied on a      decades-old Supreme Court standard: Our capture and treatment      could not ``shock the conscience'' of the court. The OLC      lawyers, however, were not asked what treatment was legal to      preserve a prosecution. They were asked what treatment was      legal for a detainee who they were told had knowledge of      future attacks on Americans.       The 1994 law was passed pursuant to an international      treaty, the United Nations Convention Against Torture and      Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. The law's      definition of torture is circular. Torture under that law      means ``severe physical or mental pain or suffering,'' which      in turn means ``prolonged mental harm,'' which must be caused      by one of four prohibited acts. The only relevant one to the      CIA inquiry was threatening or inflicting ``severe physical      pain or suffering.'' What is ``prolonged mental suffering''?      The term appears nowhere else in the U.S. Code.       Congress required, in order for there to be a violation of      the law, that an interrogator specifically intend that the      detainee suffer prolonged physical or mental suffering as a      result of the prohibited conduct. Just knowing a person could      be injured from the interrogation method is not a violation      under Supreme Court rulings interpreting ``specific intent''      in other criminal statutes.       In the summer of 2002, the CIA outlined 10 interrogation      methods that would be used only on Abu Zubaydah, who it told      the lawyers was ``one of the highest ranking members of'' al      Qaeda, serving as ``Usama Bin Laden's senior lieutenant.''      According to the CIA, Zubaydah had ``been involved in every      major'' al Qaeda terrorist operation including 9/11, and was      ``planning future terrorist attacks'' against U.S. interests.       Most importantly, the lawyers were told that Zubaydah--who      was well-versed in American interrogation techniques, having      written al Qaeda's manual on the subject--``displays no signs      of willingness'' to provide information and ``has come to      expect that no physical harm will be done to him.'' When the      usual interrogation methods were used, he had maintained his      ``unabated desire to kill Americans and Jews.''       The CIA and Department of Justice lawyers had two options:      continue questioning Zubaydah by a process that had not      worked or escalate the interrogation techniques in compliance      with U.S. law. They chose the latter.       The Justice Department lawyers wrote two opinions totaling      54 pages. One went to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales,      the other to the CIA general counsel.       Both memos noted that the legislative history of the 1994      torture statute was ``scant.'' Neither house of Congress had      hearings, debates or amendments, or provided clarification      about terms such as ``severe'' or ``prolonged mental harm.''      There is no record of Rep. Jerrold Nadler--who now calls for      impeachment and a criminal investigation of the lawyers--     trying to make any act (e.g., waterboarding) illegal, or      attempting to lessen the specific intent standard.       The Gonzales memo analyzed ``torture'' under American and      international law. It noted that our courts, under a civil      statute, have interpreted ``severe'' physical or mental pain      or suffering to require extreme acts: The person had to be      shot, beaten or raped, threatened with death or removal of      extremities, or denied medical care. One federal court      distinguished between torture and acts that were ``cruel,      inhuman, or degrading treatment.'' So have international      courts. The European Court of Human Rights in the case of      Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978) specifically found that wall      standing (to produce muscle fatigue), hooding, and sleep and      food deprivation were not torture.       The U.N. treaty defined torture as ``severe pain and      suffering.'' The Justice Department witness for the Senate      treaty hearings testified that ``[t]orture is understood to      be barbaric cruelty . . . the mere mention of which sends      chills down one's spine.'' He gave examples of ``the needle      under the fingernail, the application of electrical shock to      the genital area, the piercing of eyeballs. . . .'' Mental      torture was an act ``designed to damage and destroy the human      personality.''       The treaty had a specific provision stating that nothing,      not even war, justifies torture. Congress removed that      provision when drafting the 1994 law against torture, thereby      permitting someone accused of violating the statute to invoke      the long-established defense of necessity.       The memo to the CIA discussed 10 requested interrogation      techniques and how each should be limited so as not to      violate the statute. The lawyers warned that no procedure      could be used that ``interferes with the proper healing of      Zubaydah's wound,'' which he incurred during capture. They      observed that all the techniques, including waterboarding,      were used on our military trainees, and that the CIA had      conducted an ``extensive inquiry'' with experts and      psychologists.       But now, safe in ivory towers eight years removed from 9/     11, critics demand criminalization of the techniques and the      prosecution or disbarment of the lawyers who advised the CIA.      Contrary to columnist Frank Rich's uninformed accusation in      the New York Times that the lawyers ``proposed using'' the      techniques, they did no such thing. They were asked to      provide legal guidance on whether the CIA's proposed methods      violated the law.       Then there is Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson,      who declared that ``waterboarding will almost certainly be      deemed illegal if put under judicial scrutiny,'' depending on      which ``of several possibly applicable legal standards''      apply. Does he know the Senate rejected a bill in 2006 to      make waterboarding illegal? That fact alone negates      criminalization of the act. So quick to condemn, Mr. Robinson      later replied to a TV interview question that he did not know      how long sleep deprivation could go before it was      ``immoral.'' It is ``a nuance,'' he said.       Yet the CIA asked those OLC lawyers to figure out exactly      where that nuance stopped in the context of preventing      another attack. There should be a rule that all persons      proposing investigation, prosecution or disbarment must read      the two memos and all underlying documents and then draft a      dissenting analysis.                          ____________________
