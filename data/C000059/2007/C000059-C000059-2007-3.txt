Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. This Agreement has a positive and significant impact on small business. More than 50,000 companies exported goods from California since 2005. This trade agreement is an important element which contributes to the growth of the California and American economy.  While the positive aspects of trade far outweigh the negatives, Congress must be firmly committed to help minimize any harmful effects that may come from greater trade. Since 2000, southern California has seen a 40 percent increase in container traffic on roads and rails, which is causing serious transportation problems for both business and constituents in my district. Congress must take a closer lookat infrastructure as it relates to trade. There are many barriers to trade, but transportation infrastructure should not be one of them.  This Agreement will also level the playing field of trade with Peru. Under the current trade preferences in place 99 percent of Peru's imports enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. In contrast, only 2 percent of U.S. agricultural products enjoy duty-free access to the Peruvian market. Once the Agreement enters into force, 90 percent of the current trade in U.S. agricultural products will enjoy duty-free access while the remaining products will be gradually phased out. California's exports have grown over 183 percent since the ratification of the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement and I fully expect the U.S.-Peru Agreement to bring similar success to the California economy.
