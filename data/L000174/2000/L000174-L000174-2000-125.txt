President, I want to congratulate Fred Wilber from my hometown of Montpelier, Vermont on his cyberselling success.  For the last twenty-seven years, Fred Wilber has owned Buch Spieler, a music store in downtown Montpelier. Recently the New York Times reported on Buch Spieler's growing sales from its Internet site at http://www.bsmusic.com. Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the New York Times article of September 22, 2000, titled ``The Opposite of Amazon.com,'' be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.  The success of Fred Wilber is a shining example for all Vermont small business owners to follow. By taking advantage of the new markets offered by the Internet for its goods and services, Buch Spieler has increased overall sales by 10 percent and expanded its customer base by 20 percent in the last year and a half. For years we Vermonters have complained about not having access to a major market to sell our goods. Now through the Internet, we can sell our goods in the blink of an eye to anyone in the world as Fred Wilber and Buch Spieler have shown.  I commend Fred Wilber for being a cyberselling leader and tapping into the Internet's world markets.  The article follows:               [From the New York Times; Sept. 22, 2000]                       The Opposite of Amazon.com                          (By Leslie Kaufman)       For 27 years, Fred Wilber has run a quirky music store      called Buch Spieler in downtown Montpelier, Vt., population      of roughly 8,000. The store, which sells out-of-print movie      soundtracks, among other goodies, has had its ups and downs,      but in 1998, as Internet music distributors like CDNow and      MP3.com exploded in popularity, Mr. Wilber began to worry      that the Web would be his Waterloo.       His answer was to build his own Web site (www.bsmusic.com).      Designed by his brother and lacking time-saving features like      one-click shopping, it is hardly slick. But it has been      successful.       In the year and a half since the site went into service,      Mr. Wilber says overall sales have jumped 10 percent. Just as      important, he estimates, the Internet has expanded his      customer base by some 20 percent. It turns out that Mr.      Wilber's peculiar tastes have been strengths on the Web. When      the site was recently sent an e-mail message requesting the      score from ``Gordy! The Little Pig That Hit It Big!'' a 1995      movie, he simply took it off the shelf and shipped it.       ``It is not easy e-commerce,'' Mr. Wilber said of his Web      site. ``But we are not trying to compete with Amazon. We      focus on our own niche.''       To many experts, the advent of the Internet seemed to      signal a grim future for mom-and-pop retailers. Increased      competition and the availability of a diverse array of      merchandise to populations that had been essentially captive      audiences threatened to erode their customer base.       But a survey of more than 1,500 businesses in 16 downtown      commercial districts nationwide, released earlier this month      by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, indicates      that the Internet can spur sales in storefront retail      businesses. Just as they compete in the brick-and-mortar      world against big-box enemies like Wal-Mart Stores and Home      Depot, small retailers seem to do best in the virtual world      by focusing on unusual products or aiming to give excellent,      personalized customer service.       The National Trust is a nonprofit organization that      develops programs to support and maintain historic downtown      areas. And because the survey canvassed only merchants in      towns where some revitalization of historic downtown areas in      under way, the National Trust said its results probably      overstate the positive impact of the Web on all small      businesses. Even so, the news was surprisingly upbeat.       The trust's survey, one of the first in the nation to      examine the impact of e-commerce on small retailers, found      that some 16.4 percent of Main Street businesses it polled      were already using the Internet to sell things. Further, the      survey found, merchants that sell online--with most of them      starting their Web sites only within the last 18 months--have      experienced a 12.8 percent increase in overall sales. On      average, 14.3 percent of their total sales are now      attributable to the Internet.       Small, specialized businesses ``are really starting to      gravitate toward the Web,'' said Kennedy Smith, director of      the National Trust's Main Street Center. ``The thing that was      a surprise was the extent to which it was helping them.'' For      a struggling storefront operation, a 5 percent increase in      sales can make the difference between shutting its doors or      staying open, Ms. Smith said.       The news about small storefront retailers presents a stark      contrast to larger, purely e-commerce retailers. Many experts      once suggested that even individual entrepreneurs working out      of homes and garages--selling everything from books to bow      ties--would prosper on the Internet as barriers to entry were      eliminated. But as it has turned out, while several of these      pure e-retailers had jumps in sales initially, they are now      struggling to make money as the challenges of     marrying cyberspace and the real world have become clear.      Hundreds of these operations are now cutting back or going      out of business entirely.       Established name-brand retailers, so-called clicks-and-     mortars, have also had their share of tribulations on the      Internet. While many have recorded strong sales through their      online arms, it has often come at enormous cost. To sustain      the level of service associated with their stores, most big-     name retailers have had to do everything from hire new      workers to set up a separate warehouse operation to handle      the orders.       There is no way to know exactly how many small storefront      merchants do business over the Web, but their ranks are      already in the tens of thousands and growing. As of May, some      29 percent of all American small businesses--from retailers      to public relations firms--had Web sites, according to the      Kelsey Group, a consulting firm specializing in local      advertising and e-commerce. That is up from 23 percent in May      of last year.       Of this Web-connected minority, almost half are selling      goods over the Interent, according to the Kelsey Group, which      gets its information from a survey of a national panel of 600      businesses with fewer than 100 employees.       The use of the Web by small retailers is likely to      accelerate because many larger companies, hoping that small      businesses could be revenue generators, have been      intensifying efforts to bring mom-and-pop stores online over      the course of the last year.       Last September, for example, Amazon.com started zShops, a      service that allows small businesses to have a link to their      products pop up when a visitor to Amazon clicks on a relevant      book or compact disc. A seller of spice grinders, say, could      arrange for a link to appear every time a person clicked on a      book about Indian cooking.       Web developers of all sizes--from Microsoft to tiny outfits      run by a couple of a guys in a college dorm--are offering      small businesses access to a range of Web services, from Web      site design to purchasing banner advertising. In fact, the      business of providing Web services to small operators has      already become competitive enough that many of the mom-and-     pop retailers said their entry costs had been very      reasonable.       James and Mary DeFore, for example, own a women and      children's store called Unique Boutique in downtown      Thomasville, Ga., a small city of about 20,000 people. They      were doing a healthy side business in prom dresses, and      decided that if they offered them on the Web they might      attract rural customers who could not get into town. So last      January, they hired a local service provider, who for a few      hundred dollars designed a simple but colorful Web site with      the catchy name Time for Prom (timeforprom.com).       The site went live in February, and by march the DeFores      were getting up to 40,000 visitors to their Web site each      month. By June, they had nearly 500 orders for dresses that      cost $150 to $200. And requests came not just from rural      areas in Georgia but also from Missouri and West Virginia and      even Hawaii and Japan. ``The biggest problem,'' Mr. DeFore      said, ``was fulfilling all the orders.''       Despite not having a powerful brand name or being linked to      a powerful portal like Yahoo or America Online, Time for Prom      shows that small retailers need not get lost in the vast      clutter on the Internet if they develop a clear, arrow      identity.       In fact, another Thomasville retailer, Hi-Fi Sales and      Service, which specializes in equipment for home theaters and      live field recording, did $1.9 million in business over the      Web last year, which represented a significant portion of its      total sales, and now gets some 30 percent of its new      customers online with no advertising.       The key to the success of Hi-Fi Sales is making sure it is      visible. ``We spend a lot of energy making sure we come up      high in the search engines,'' said Jim Oade, one of the three      brothers who co-own the business. Each search engine has      different rules for deciding in what order to list businesses      related to key words, he said. So one of the brothers, Doug      Oade, devotes himself, among other things, to keeping current      with the rules and making sure the company's Web site      (www.oade.com) has enough of the right key words to pop up      swiftly when a consumer wants audio products.       The Oade brothers' national customer base is still fairly      unusual among mom-and-pop ventures. Most storefront retailers      use the Internet mainly for defending and cementing the      relationship with customers they already have--a relationship      that is very much under siege by giant retailers.       Osborn Drugs in Miami (pronounced Mi-AM-a), Okal., has been      a family drugstore for 29 years. Since it started its Web      site in 1996, sales through the Interent have increased only      about 5 percent a year, according to Bill Osborn, who runs      the store with his father. But more than 90 percent of the      traffic on the Web site comes from regular long-term Osborn      customers who just like to e-mail their prescriptions in.      ``We view it as a way to service customers we already have,''      Bill Osborn said. ``We are not trying to go public as      osborndrug.com.''                          ____________________
