President, I rise today to introduce the Adoption Report Card Act of 1997 to redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care.  According to the American Public Welfare Association, the population of children in foster care is growing 33 times faster than the United States child population in general. During the past 10 years, more children have entered the foster care system than have exited. Every year, 15,000 children graduate from foster care by turning 18 with no permanent family. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 40 percent of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare.  In addition to the 50,000 children who today are legally free to be adopted, there are hundreds of thousands more who drift for days, months, or years within the state-run system--a system that too often lets down some of society's most vulnerable--our children.  I have already introduced legislation to promote kinship care as one solution to this problem. However, more still needs to be done. Part of the problem is we simply don't have any data on where children are in the system. No one knows how long our children are languishing in the foster care system, or how long it takes a State to find adoptive placements for children. Finding comprehensive data for each State is a challenge and, until recently, the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] did not collect comprehensive national data on adoption from every State.
