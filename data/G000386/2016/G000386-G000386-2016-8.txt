 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize Lt. Col. Wade E. Wiegel for his 22 years of service in the U.S. Marine Corps. Wade is a native of Iowa, and I am proud to say that I nominated him for the U.S. Naval Academy in 1990. In May 1994, he earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering and reported to the Marine Corps' The Basic School. From there he completed flight training and was designated a naval aviator in March 1997. He deployed aboard the USS Enterprise in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.  Wade later served as the commanding officer for the VMFA-122 ``Crusaders'' and forward deployed the squadron for 6 months into the Pacific Theater in support of theater security cooperation activities with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. After graduating from the National War College, he served as a military adviser in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Most recently, Wade has served in the Office of Legislative Affairs as a congressional affairs officer. His personal decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with Gold Star, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Gold Star.  As he prepares to retire from the Marine Corps, I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his service to our country and to wish him well in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
