Speaker, I have 3 minutes to discuss with the American public why their country is going to be put deeper into debt by passing this legislation.  It would be good legislation if it were paid for. It was good legislation when it was included in Mr. Camp's overall tax reform bill. But it is very bad policy and very bad legislation in this unpaid-for, discreet form. And, by the way, there is about another $160 billion of debt to follow.  What a sad day for America. What a sad day for this House. What a sad day for the Ways and Means Committee. What a sad day for fiscal responsibility.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to vote for the temporary political benefit of saying you gave somebody a tax cut, but vote for fiscal responsibility. Vote to keep on a path of a big deal to solve the fiscal challenges that confront our country. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
