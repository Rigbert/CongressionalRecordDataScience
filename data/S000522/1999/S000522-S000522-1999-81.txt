Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding to me.  Absolutely not. As a matter of fact, we faced that back in 1984 when the Mexico City policy was first crafted, that there is only one government per country, whereas there are a multitude, a myriad of NGOs to whom we could provide money. And if a certain NGO said it wanted to promote abortion and lobby to bring down the right-to-life laws, we could find another NGO that wanted only to do family planning.
