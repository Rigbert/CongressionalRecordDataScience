 President, finally, for the information of all of our colleagues, the Senate will convene on Friday, January 3, to kick off the 2nd session of the 116th Congress. However, no rollcall votes are expected that day, and Members should be prepared to be back and voting on Monday, January 6.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
