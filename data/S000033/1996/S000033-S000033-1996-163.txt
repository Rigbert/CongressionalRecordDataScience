 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by David Smith, a high school student from Brattleboro, VT, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people:       A couple of days ago, I heard two men laughing about the      term, ``representation of the people,'' claiming that the      people are no longer really represented. Unfortunately, I'm      beginning to agree with this, because I have a problem      believing that a politician is going to think about me--the      average voter--when the oil and gas industry gives Congress      $17-18 million annually; when the health industry gives $68.8      million, when the banking industry gives $42.1 million; and      that's just to name a few. Our government is overrun by the      influences of special interest groups, industries,      corporations, unions and other bit spenders.       But you, the politicians, are also stuck, because the      average House election is up way past $150,000; the average      Senate election is up past $3.5 million. And that's average,      which means that the backwater, small-time candidate has no      chance of competing with the mainstream Republican or      Democrat, because he or she has no corporate, big-spender      backing. In short our campaign finance system is outdated,      flawed, and full to the brim with loopholes. We need changes.       What I'm proposing today is a publicly financed system. My      proposal starts in September, 8 months before an election,      with candidates collecting low-dollar contributions. This is      the only private money in my whole system; and, since it's      low-dollar, it doesn't have any influence over a candidate.      This seen money lasts until the first primary in February. To      qualify for public financing, candidates must receive 20% of      the vote. Parties may also qualify for public financing by      getting 20% of the vote between two candidates, and sending      their most winning . . . candidate to run. Candidates who      receive the required vote will receive an account of money to      work with.       In addition to monetary funds, the candidates will also      receive radio and TV space. But instead of getting 45 second      soundbites, candidates will receive 15 minute blocks, almost      like ``informercials,'' and this will force them to really      discuss in detail their platforms. And you can also get      debates going, and really educate the public. Lastly,      government will pay for one or two mass mailings per      candidate. Winners of the national conventions will then be      given money to campaign in the general election.       Now, how are we going to pay for this? The Working Group on      Electoral Democracy estimated that a plan similar to this one      would cost between $5-600 million annually. And I've devised      two ways to pay for this: the first is a $6 flat tax on every      taxpaying American. Unfortunately, the taxpayers don't really      want another tax. So, an alternative plan would be a one      dollar check-off box on tax returns for Congressional      funding, right next to the one for Presidential funding.      Also, a one percent shift in funds from the military to      campaign finances, and last, the first national lotto game.      Vermont alone already receives around $23 million in funds      from various lotto games, and I think that a national lottery      game could bring in at least half of the money needed to fund      this campaign system.       What this system will do, is it will do 5 things: first, it      will stop all public legislation from being influenced by the      wealth of industries, corporations, all private money will be      taken out of politics. Second, it creates a level playing      field for all candidates, rich and poor candidates must have      the same chance of being elected as everyone else, and voters      must start to elect candidates on their merits, not on their      money. Thirdly, it allows politicians to spend their time at      politics, not at campaigning. I've heard that politicians      spend between anywhere from 40-80% of their time campaigning.      In this system, they would spend 5% of their time      campaigning. [Fourth] it will allow politicians to get in      touch with what voters want, not what the heavy contributors      want. If they have to go to the grassroots to get their      support, then there will be more talk about what the real      voters want. Finally, it closes down all loopholes, so that      no private money can influence the private system, and we      will return to the ideal of ``representation of the people.''       Congressman Sanders. Thank you. (Applause) You've touched      on a very important issue. David, let me ask you a couple of      questions. First, give us some examples, if you might, of the      role that big money plays in influencing politics,      influencing legislation. Do you have any examples that you      might be able to provide?       Answer. Sure. A little while ago, the Legislature allocated      money for the Pentagon to build new bombers. This was in      spite of the Pentagon saying that, ``We don't want any new      bombers, we don't want the money.'' The reason the money was      allocated, was because of the influence of the corporations      that make and help produce those bombers. They have such      power, with their monetary funds that they can almost shape      the way legislation works.       Congressman Sanders: You're absolutely right, that is a      very good example. Let me ask you the second question:      recently the Speaker of the House went on a tour around the      country, and he spoke at $10,000/plate fundraising dinners;      $10,000/plate to have dinner with House Speaker Gingrich. Why      would anybody pay $10,000--it was a very good dinner, no      doubt--but other than the good quality food, and you think of      another good reason why someone would want to go to dinner      with the Speaker for $10,000/plate?       Answer. Sure. It was influence. By paying $10,000 to a      candidate, you get influence over that candidate so they will      better represent what you want. An example: if I was a      politician and I came back to the office one day and there      were 14 messages for me; 13 were from people I never heard      of, and the last was from someone who has paid me $10,000 at      a local charity the week before, the first person I'm going      to call back is that big payer. So, by paying lots of money,      we get more influence.                          ____________________
