 President, the debate over the small engine provisions is focused on California for this point. But it is also clear that the effects go far beyond California.  Remember that under the Clean Air Act, once California passes the regulation, other States can then replicate that to any degree they so choose. This is where it begins to affect a number of other States. The small engine provision in the VA/HUD appropriations bill is a problem for every State and for every Senator who believes individual States should be able to adopt their own rules and regulations on issues such as these. States with serious pollution problems include Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Illinois, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and many others know they need to be able to reduce pollution from every possible source. Some States have already moved forward with regulations affecting off-road engines.  This legislation--the underlying bill, as well as the amendment that we understand will be sent to the desk shortly--will cut this off, remove the right from a State and give it to the EPA that historically has been a slow mover in this area.  According to the associations representing State and local pollution control officials, the original version of the small engine provision would have blocked the current program in seven States--Alaska, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nevada, Texas, and Wisconsin.  The 175-horsepower engine would also block programs in at least eight States that are considering future regulations: Alabama, Illinois, Nebraska, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, in addition to the District of Columbia.  The States recognize this threat to their rights. I have already quoted a letter from Environmental Council ofthe States. We have also received letters in opposition to the Bond provision from the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Southeastern State Air Resources Managers representing State air pollution control agencies in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and the associations representing State and local air pollution control officials from all 50 States.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Southeastern States Air                                      Resource Managers, Inc.,                               Forest Park, GA, November 20, 2003.     Re Bond Provision of S. 1584--Fiscal Year 2004 VA, HUD and          Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill.     Hon. Zell Miller,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Miller: Southeastern States Air Resource      Mangers, Inc. (SESARM), representing the directors of the      southeastern state air pollution control agencies in Alabama,      Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina,      South Carolina, and Tennessee, is writing this letter to      encourage your support of the removal of a provision      introduced by Senator Bond in S. 1584, the Fiscal Year 2004      VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill. The      provision would amend Section 209(e)(1)(A) of the Clean Air      Act to curtail state's authority to reduce emissions from      diesel and gasoline off-road equipment and engines.       While Senator Bond's proposed provision regarding the off-     road engines apparently was intended to address rules adopted      only in California, it will limit the ability of all states      to solve serious public health-related air quality problems.      Senator Bond's proposal revises a very important provision of      the Clean Air Act which allows states to adopt engine      emission standards more stringent than the federal standards      as long as appropriate federal review processes are followed.      Congress wisely put this provision into the Act to give      states the ability to deal with serious air quality problems      across the country. SESARM opposes the impact of the Bond      proposal on this important provision.       Please note that other compromise amendments which fall      short of fully restoring Section 209(e)(1)(A) are, in our      opinion, unacceptable and will constrain states as discussed      above. SESARM and your state air pollution control agency      would appreciate your support of removal of the Bond      Amendment from S. 1584.           Sincerely,                                                 Hon. E. Hornback,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                            National Conference of                                           State Legislatures,                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 2003.     Re S. 1584, FY2004 VA, HUD and Independent Agencies          Appropriations Clean Air Act Amendment.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Conference of State      Legislatures, I write to urge your support for amendments      that would strike a provision of S. 1584 that amends Section      209(e)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act and curtails state      authority to regulate diesel and gasoline off-road equipment      and engines. Emissions from off-road sources contribute to      ozone and fine particulate matter pollution. They pose a      threat to public health and to state achievement and      maintenance of national ambient air quality standards for      ozone and particulate matter.       NCSL strongly believes that federal environmental policy      should be addressed in substantive committee deliberations      and not made through riders to appropriations bills. The      amendatory language in S. 1584 would strip states of long-     standing authority to exceed federal standards. It      compromises state and local government capacity to determine      the most effective means to address specific air pollution      problems. It also has implications for agriculture and      natural resource management none of which are addressed      through the use of an appropriations rider.       The Clear Air Act appropriately recognizes that states are      best suited to determine which sources, including off-road      equipment and engines, contribute most significantly to air      pollution and which strategies are most effective in      addressing pollution-related problems. I again urge your      support of amendments that strike the aforementioned off-road      provision from S. 1584. Thank you for your consideration of      NCSL's concerns.           Sincerely,                                                    William Pound,                                               Executive Director.
