Speaker, Lucas County, Ohio will celebrate Public Health Week April 7-13, 2003. I am pleased to recognize the efforts of the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department and its Public Health Planning Committee in its efforts to promote health education for the citizenry of our region.  The Toledo-Lucas County Health Department provides a wide array of services, including immunizations, AIDS/HIV counseling and testing, specialty health clinics, wellness programs, outreach, and advocacy. It is the local agency responsible for ensuring safe water and air, environmental services, food protection, animal control, and health assessments of the people in Lucas County. Its staff, administration, and volunteers are committed to public service, and deeply dedicated to the promotion of public health and wellness.  Celebrated in 46 states, Public Health Week is a coordinated effort to utilize the resources of the systems of public health to educate people about a wide array of issues. This year's effort focuses on weight and obesity. With two-thirds of adults overweight, and the number of overweight children tripling in twenty years, Public Health Week 2003 urges Americans to ``shape up their future.''                          ____________________
