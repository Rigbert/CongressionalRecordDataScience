Speaker, it is with great enthusiasm and respect that I wish to congratulate the multitude of volunteers who donate their time and effort to the Lake County Purdue University Cooperative Extension Office located in Crown Point, Indiana. The devoted assistance of these selfless individuals has brought a spirit of volunteerism to the Northwest Indiana community that embodies the culture of its people. The citizens of Northwest Indiana owe them a debt of gratitude, and they will be honored for their commitment, at a dinner reception celebrating National Volunteer Week on April 23, 2002.  Mr. Speaker, National Volunteer Week has been celebrated since 1974, when President Nixon issued an executive order establishing the week as an annual celebration to honor those who volunteer at the local, state, and national levels, and also as an opportunity to impress upon others the benefits and sense of satisfaction that volunteerism provides. This year's theme, ``Celebrate the American Spirit--Volunteer!'', carries added significance after the tragic events of September 11, 2001. The outpouring of generosity was evident in the days and weeks following the attacks, as volunteers around the country helped initiate the healing process. Through the efforts to these courageous individuals, the Northwest Indiana community continues to unite.  Through a variety of programs, the Lake County Purdue University Cooperative Extension Office assistance to those throughout Lake County. The local 4-H Club is committed to positive youth development by planning camps, workshops, and other activities in which the young citizens of Lake County can participate. Master Gardeners is a program that provides volunteers an opportunity to revitalize their communities through activities related to gardening. Members of this group answer questions related to gardening, conduct gardening schools, and work diligently on community beautification projects. The Extension Homemakers Association works to strengthen Lake County families and help them to develop their homes and communities. Volunteers in this group assist families to maintain physical and mental health and to use their human and economic resources in the most efficient manner. These programs, along with the many others that the Lake County Purdue University Cooperative Extension Office provide, serve as vital resources to the citizens of Lake County.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating the volunteers of the Lake County Purdue University Cooperative Extension Office for their loyalty and dedication to the Northwest Indiana community. The contributions these individuals make to their fellow citizens and the improvements they provide to their communities cannot be measured with numbers. They create a feeling of camaraderie that expands throughout their neighborhoods and helps to bring a sense of belonging to each of their follow citizens. Volunteers are a vital part of our community, and I am proud to represent these dedicated individuals in Congress.                          ____________________
