Speaker, it is with a certain degree of sadness that I rise. I think frankly that the specter of election-year politics raises its head very high in this instance.  I am one who consistently opposed the Clinton administration's policies and without exception supported the unilateral, immediate lifting of the arms embargo. I did that so that peoples under siege, peoples being raped, pillaged, children being killed, ethnic cleansing occurring, yes; genocide occurring could be stopped. I believed that it was immoral and wrong for the United States and its Western allies to keep from the Bosnian people the means for self-defense. But the West as a joint policy, with the British and the French leading the argument, ``Do not arm. It will put our troops at risk that are on the ground.''  Contrary to the representations of the gentleman from California [Mr. Cox], the President did not lie. He said he wanted a unilateral withdrawal, but he thought it would undermine our alliance and therefore would not support it.  But the fact of the matter is we, as the gentleman from Virginia pointed out, by law, and I do not know how the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] or the gentleman from California [Mr. Dornan] or the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] or the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Goss] or the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] or the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Smith], who are on the floor, voted on that, but we said, ``Mr. President, you must stop arms coming to these defenseless people.''  We said that. We directed them in the defense authorization bill of 1994. Now, as the Presidential campaign is about to get underway, we lament the fact that the President of the United States followed the law and allowed them to get from whichever source they could the arms to defend their homes, their freedom, the democracy that they wanted to establish, the multicultural society which had been a fact of life in Sarajevo and in Bosnia.  What a tragedy, Mr. Speaker, that we now found ourselves driven solely by politics to this point where we raise the issue that a President of the United States, any President of the United States, and I will tell my friend from Virginia, I thought the Bush policy initially was correct in Bosnia, which was to leave it to the Europeans. It turned out we were all wrong. The Europeans did not engage it and solve it. Ultimately the United States had to do that.  But I regret my friend from New York, who is a very close friend forwhom I have great respect, and the gentleman from Illinois, for whom I have very great respect, are at this time looking at what I believe to be a very short time frame, not the long time frame where history will judge America not only by what it does, but if we had stopped the Bosnians from getting arms from whomever they could, we would have been wrong.  A gentlewoman on your side of the aisle, one of your most conservative Members walking with me yesterday said, ``Well, good for the Iranians getting them arms. They needed arms, and I was for them getting arms.''  That was an honest, nonpolitical response.                              {time}  1215
