 President, I am pleased to offer today, legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Zhenfu Ge. Mrs. Ge is the grandmother of two U.S. citizen children who face the devastation of being separated from their grandmother after losing their mother just last month.  Mrs. Ge came to the United States in 1998 to help care for her two grandchildren while her U.S. citizen daughter Yanyu Wang and her son-in-law John Marks worked. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Ge's daughter filed an immigration petition on her behalf. She was scheduled for an April 26 Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, interview, which is the last step in the green card process. The family anticipated that the interview would result in Mrs. Ge's gaining a green card.  In a tragic turn of events, Mrs. Ge's daughter was diagnosed with a rare and deadly form of lymphoma and given only 7 months to live. As Mrs. Wang's health quickly declined, she asked her mother to care for her 3-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son after her death. Mrs. Ge promised her daughter she would care for her grandchildren and quickly became the most active maternal figure in their lives.  On April 15 of this year, 11 days before Mrs. Ge's scheduled INS interview, her daughter died. Because current law does not allow Mrs. Ge to adjust her status without her daughter, Mrs. Ge now faces deportation.  This family has certainly felt the pain of a significant tragedy. With the death of Yanyu Wang, her family must begin to rebuild their lives and face a future without their loved one. Losing a grandmother to deportation will only further the grief and compromise the emotional health of her two young grandchildren, who are still mourning the loss of their mother. According to her son-in-law, John Mark, Mrs. Ge ``represents continuity and a tie to their mother for our children, and her presence will allow me to continue to successfully support my family.  Mrs. Ge has done everything she could to become a permanent resident of this country. But for the tragedy of her daughter's untimely death, she likely would have attained that status.  I hope my colleagues will support this private legislation so that we can help Mrs. Ge, her grandchildren, and son-in-law begin to rebuild their lives in the wake of their family tragedy and allow Mrs. Ge to keep the promise she made to her daughter.  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Marks be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 949  [Data not available at time of printing.]                                                Sausalito, CA,                                                   April 19, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to appeal for your help in      an exceptional immigration case regarding my mother-in-law,      Zhenfu Ge (United States Immigration & Naturalization Service      reference #A78192014.)       Mrs. Ge came to the United States from her native Shanghai,      China in 1998 after our daughter was born. The purpose of her      immigration was to care for our infant and for our nine-year-     old son to enable my wife and me to work. I have lived in      California most of my life and I work for Kaiser Permanente      in San Rafael; my wife, Yanyu Wang, was a research scientist      for Onyx Pharmaceuticals in Richmond, and a naturalized      citizen of the United States.       We had applied for naturalization for Mrs. Ge to allow her      to remain in the United States to care for her grandchildren      indefinitely. We had every expectation that the INS hearing      set for April 26 (see correspondence enclosed) would result      in the successful completion of her application.       My wife had learned that she was suffering from lymphoma in      1999. Unfortunately, despite every possible medical      intervention, she died on April 15, eleven days before her      mother's hearing for naturalization. We are advised by our      attorney that absent her daughter, Mrs. Ge's case will be      dismissed out-of-hand, and she will be forced to return to      China.       I hope you will agree that Mrs. Ge's presence in our family      is even more important following the death of my wife. She is      the     only maternal figure for our children, she represents      continuity and a tie to their mother for our children, and      her presence will allow me to continue to successfully      support my family notwithstanding the reduction of our income      to a single salary.       Before she died, my wife implored her mother to do      everything possible to remain in the United States to ensure      that our children would be raised with her care and love. I      ask for your help in enabling this to happen.       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.           Sincerely yours,                                                        John Mark.                                 ______                                       By
