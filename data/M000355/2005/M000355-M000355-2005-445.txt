 President.                                SCHEDULE  Mr. President, shortly, we will resume consideration of John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. Last night, we locked in a consent which provides for the final vote on confirmation. That vote will occur at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday.  Today, we have controlled time to allow Senators to come to the Chamber to give their statements on this extremely important nomination. As usual, we will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 for the weekly policy luncheons.  As mentioned last night, the Appropriations Committee is expected to report the Defense appropriations bill tomorrow. We expect the Senate to begin consideration of that bill on Thursday following the Roberts nomination.  I also remind my colleagues that we need to pass a continuing resolution by the close of business this week.  Finally, I once again alert all Members that we are working under a very compressed schedule. Next week, we will need to accommodate the Rosh Hashanah holiday, and therefore we will be stacking rollcall votes for midweek. Given this schedule, it is extremely important that we use our time wisely, both this week and obviously next week as well.
