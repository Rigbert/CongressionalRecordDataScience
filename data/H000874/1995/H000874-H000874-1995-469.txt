Speaker, reclaiming my time, I want to thank the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] who, as I say, is a very close friend of mine. We say that about most, but in this case it is really the case. He has always been fair, and he and I have always, since I can remember, fought on the same side of issues as they relate to justice and international fairness and opposition to human rights abuses.  I would say to my friend that I appreciate that effort and, obviously, if I am not successful today, I will work with the gentleman to bring that bill forward as quickly as we can.  But I say to my friend, it is unfortunate that we do not allow sufficient time on this issue, which is so timely. There is no more timely foreign policy issue that currently confronts the United States and its western allies than the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as we all know.
