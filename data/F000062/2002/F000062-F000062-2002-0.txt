 President, I rise to address the fact that by the end of the year more than 2 million Americans will have exhausted their unemployment insurance.  There is no more pressing issue facing our Nation's workforce, and yet Congress has chosen to put partisanship ahead of what nearly everyone agrees is smart policy.  By passing widely divergent bills, the House and the Senate have virtually ensured that on December 28 of this year thousands of workers will be in the impossible position of trying to feed, clothe, and house their families with no work and no benefits.  I strongly support the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002, a bipartisan compromise bill which was introduced in the Senate in late September.  This bill, introduced by Senators Wellstone, Clinton, and Kennedy, with the support of 33 Senators, extends unemployment benefits nationwide for 13 weeks, and provides 20 weeks of extended benefits for California and other high unemployment States.  It provides crucial temporary assistance to those who have been hardest hit by the current economic downturn, and provides them a chance to support themselves and their families while they look for work.  Although the compromise bill passed by the Senate does not include the 20-week extension that is vital to States such as California, which suffer from a higher unemployment rate than the national average, it provides a meaningful extension that could help American families, especially during the Christmas holiday.  Let me stress that this bill is the product of bipartisan compromise, and is supported by Senator Nickles and other Republicans who have been vocal on this issue.  At the moment, millions of Americans have lost their job and are unable to find another, despite their efforts to reenter the labor force. The number of Americans unable to find employment has increased from 5.7 million at the end of 2000 to more than 8.2 million today.  Even more disturbing, due to continued economic weakness, the number of Americans who have been out of work for over 6 months has almost doubled from 900,000 to 1.5 million in the past year.  Between May and July of this year, approximately 900,000 workers exhausted the benefits made available through the extension that was passed in March.  By the end of this year, that number will increase to 2.1 million individuals. Those are the individuals at greatest risk for falling through the social safety net we have provided for them.  This illustrates the critical need for an extension of unemployment insurance that makes sense.  When the national economy was booming 2 years ago, California was particularly blessed. California's economy grew at double-digit rates, and California become the fifth-largest economy in the world.  Billions of dollars of investment flowed into our State, and thousands of talented workers moved to California to take advantages of opportunities in Silicon Valley and other growth engines of the New Economy. Now that picture is dramatically different.  A recent report by a group of economists at UCLA predicted that California's unemployment rate will rise to 6.5 percent next year, and that nonfarm jobs in the San Francisco Bay area contracted by an annual rate of 4.6 percent between April and June of this year. After dropping to a decade-long low of 4.7 percent in December of 2000, the unemployment rate is back up to 6.4 percent as of the end of October. The number of Californians receiving unemployment benefits has increased to 470,000 from 430,000 1 year ago.  During this period of great economic hardship, we have a duty to give people the chance to get back onto their feet. This is an obligation that we have met in the past, most recently when faced with an economic downturn during the first Bush administration.  The Senate voted in 1991 to extend temporary unemployment insurance on five separate occasions. Each time such extensions were approved by overwhelming bipartisan majorities.  Therefore, I call on the House and Senate leadership to ensure that an extension of unemployment benefits for a full 13 weeks be the first item considered during the 108th Congress. Although that will not prevent the expiration of benefits for many Americans, it will provide a fairly rapid restoration of benefits to those who will be cut off at the end of the year.  With that goal in mind, I have sent a letter to Speaker Hastert and Senator Lott with the signatures of more than 40 of my colleagues in the Senate, asking them to bring up an extension of unemployment insurance immediately upon reconvening next year.  Let me be clear: by ducking this issue we seem to be hoping that this problem will disappear.  It will not, and if we do not address it now, we will not be living up to our obligation to the families of this Nation.                          ____________________
