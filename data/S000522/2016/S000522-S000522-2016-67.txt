Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Mr. Fortenberry for his very eloquent remarks and for reminding us that this is an existential threat to Christians, but really, as well, to civilization. I thank him again for the resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Staten Island, New York (Mr. Donovan). He is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
