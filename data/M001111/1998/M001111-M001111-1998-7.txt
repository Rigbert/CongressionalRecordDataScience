 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 264 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, that the resolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table without intervening action.
