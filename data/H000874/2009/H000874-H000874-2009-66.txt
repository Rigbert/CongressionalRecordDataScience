I would yield to him if he recalls, but if he doesn't recall, the answer is zero.  Why? Because you had considered that bill a long time; your proposition was that we had all had an opportunity to discuss it, albeit one-tenth of one one-hundredth of the time that this piece of legislation has been under consideration, but there were no amendments from this side allowed.                              {time}  1845  But what we did have allowed was a substitute. Now, I will tell my friend, and I have said before, that your side has told me you have a bill. Somebody waved it around, as a matter of fact, on national television. I presume that hopefully you're going to get that scored. Hopefully you will give us 72 hours' notice of that. And once we get the score and the 72 hours' notice of your substitute, we will be glad to consider it.  But I will tell the gentleman that we expect the same 72 hours' notice and we expect it to be scored. And I will help the gentleman facilitate the scoring of your substitute.
