 President, I would only add my own sentiment with regard to next week. It will be a challenging week; budget week always is. For those who are interested in offering amendments, obviously the earlier in the week, the better.  The majority leader and I have talked about the challenges associated with the so-called vote-arama that occurs at the end of the budget debate every year, which is frustrating to both sides. Some have thought it mutually assured destruction in terms of morale. The only way to have any real impact on that obviously is for Members to offer their amendments earlier in the week, hopefully to be allowed votes earlier in the week, thereby minimizing the multiplicity of votes that frequently occur--in fact, always occur--at the end of a budget resolution when the time expires.  We look forward to a challenging week and will see all of our Members next week.
