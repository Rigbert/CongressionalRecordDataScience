Speaker. Many of the Members of this body talk about the Contract With America. I think it has been an important document in the sense that it has set an agenda. Obviously some of it I do not agree with; some I have agreed with. But, as we have a Contract With America in terms of some of us having signed a document and said, if we are elected, this is what we are going to do, it seems to me as well we have a moral and ethical contract with those whom we ask to serve their country as Federal employees, as employees of this House, employees of the Federal service, and that contract essentially says that, if you work with us and if you perform well, we will do certain things. We will pay you a salary, we will automatically adjust that salary from time to time, and we will provide a retirement system for you, and we will give you health benefits.  Those are the three benefits that Federal employees have. There are no stock options obviously as there are not in public service, and although that is, perhaps, not a legally enforceable contract in the sense that our Federal employees, and our staff in this Chamber, and in this House and across the way in the Senate cannot take us to court and say, you know, we have worked for 5, or 10 or 15 years because you told us that this was the deal, this was the consideration, this is how you would treat us. Although they cannot take us to court, in my opinion that is amoral contract that we have with our people, and just as so many of your party, Mr. Speaker, have argued that we ought to keep the contract that we signed in September 1994, we ought to keep our contract with our employees, and if we make changes, it is fair to do so to those we hire anew and say this is the arrangement. We have changed it because we found it was too expensive, and so we are changing it, and so when you come on board, when you come on as an employee, understand there are new rules, and even for those who are not now vested in the system, who do not now have, in effect, a reason to say this is now mine, the 5-year vesting, we could say to them, look, you have not vested yet, and we are going to change, but for those folks who are vested in this system, it is unconscionable for us to now say we did not tell you the truth, we are going to change the rules, we are not going to meet our commitment to you, your compensation will be less than we promised.  I hope we do not do that, Mr. Speaker.  I had not intended to talk today on this issue, but Mr. Mica, one of his colleagues, took a special order to discuss this issue, and I wanted the full context of this issue to be discussed today because next week this issue will be on the front burner. I hope the Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Solomon, the chairman of the Committee on Rules, and others, decide to take this out of the tax bill, to put it back to your committee, Mr. Speaker, have hearings, consider this, and take such action as we then deem appropriate.                          ____________________
