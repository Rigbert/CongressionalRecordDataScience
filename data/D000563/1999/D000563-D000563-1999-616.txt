CRAIG. No, I will not. I will let the Senator seek the floor to debate on his time.  I suggest that the Hatch-Craig amendments are a major step toward the enforcement of gun laws in this Nation, of stopping criminals who use a gun in the commission of a crime, to make sure that the transaction does not result in guns falling into the hands of criminals, and still recognizing that the Internet is a fair and first amendment-protected expression as long as those expressions are not found to be illegal.  I yield the floor.
