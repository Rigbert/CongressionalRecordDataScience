 President, I rise today with Senator McConnell to introduce a joint resolution renewing the ban on all imports from Burma for another year.  I regret that we must take this action once again.  I had hoped that since we last took up this resolution last year, the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, would have, at long last, heeded the voices of the people of Burma and the international community and put Burma on a path to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.  Sadly, the regime responded to these calls in true fashion, by trying yet again to break the will of Burma's democratic opposition and stifle any movement for change.  Just last month, the military junta arrested and detained Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Burma's democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on trumped-up charges of violating her house arrest.  Currently standing trial--behind closed doors and without due process--she faces up to 5 years in prison if convicted. This will come on top of spending the better part of the past 19 years isolated and alone under house arrest.  The regime's actions should come as no surprise. They represent yet another attempt to hold on to power and crush any opposition.  Almost 20 years ago, it annulled parliamentary election results overwhelmingly won by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.  Six years ago government-sponsored thugs attempted to assassinate Suu Kyi and other members of her National League for Democracy by attacking her motorcade in northern Burma.  Two years ago, the regime brutally put down pro-democracy demonstrations of the Saffron Revolution led by Buddhist monks.  And last year, we saw the regime ignore offers made by the international community and international humanitarian organizations to help Burma respond to the devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis, leading to countless deaths of innocent civilians.  In addition, they imposed a new constitution on the people of Burma, one that was negotiated behind closed doors without the input of the democratic opposition and one that will entrench the military's grip on power.  The SPDC understands all too well that the vast majority of Burmese citizens embrace Suu Kyi's call for freedom and democracy and reject the junta's oppressive rule.  That is why they are trying once again to silence her voice.  We cannot allow this brutal dictatorship to succeed.  For those of my colleagues who are disappointed with the lack of progress in bringing freedom and democracy to Burma since we first enacted this ban in 2003, I share their disappointment.  But now is not the time to turn back. Now is not the time to reward the regime for its oppressive tactics by lifting any part of our sanctions regime on Burma.  It has not made ``substantial and measurable progress'' towards:  ending violations of internationally recognized human rights;  releasing all political prisoners;  allowing freedom of speech and press;  allowing freedom of association;  permitting the peaceful exercise of religion and;  bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC and the National League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic nationalities on the restoration of a democratic government.  By renewing the import ban we express our solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition who bravely stand up to the regime and reject their abuses.  They understand that the import ban is not directed at the people of Burma, but at the military junta that dominates economic and political activity in their country and denies them their rights.  And I remind my colleagues that this import ban renewal is good for 1 year and we will have the opportunity to revisit this issue again next year.  I am hopeful that the United Nations Security Council and the international community will follow our example and put additional pressure on the SPDC to release Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally and engage in a true dialogue on national reconciliation, one that will lead to a truly democratic constitution.  I urge my colleagues to pass this Joint Resolution as soon as possible.                          ____________________
