 President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Art Gratias of Mason City, IA on receiving the Legion of Honor from the French Government for his contribution to the liberation of France. Art Gratias enlisted in the U.S. Army in January of 1942, having begun the enlistment process before the attack on Pearl Harbor that led to the formal participation of the United States in World War II. As a member of the 2nd Infantry Division, he participated in the D-day invasion of Normandy, which took place on his first wedding anniversary. Art fought in numerous campaigns in France and Central Europe, including the Battle of the Bulge. He was wounded on August 16, 1944, receiving the Purple Heart and later returned to combat.  The French Government has expressed its gratitude to Art Gratias for what he did for their country. I wouldnow like to take this opportunity to thank Art for his service to our country. In fact, despite the fact that he gave more to this country through his military service than we can ever thank him for, he continued to dedicate his life to public service. Art has been a school board member, teacher, and school administrator. He has been very active in the Kiwanis, American Legion, and his church. Art has served on numerous volunteer boards, and in the Iowa Senate. Art Gratias is a prime example of that remarkable American spirit of voluntarism that the French writer Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the early years of our Nation so it is fitting that he was singled out by the French Government for its highest honor. I am proud to add my voice to those who pay tribute to his life of service.                          ____________________
