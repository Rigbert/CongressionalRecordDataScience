 We look forward to dealing with his amendment tomorrow.  In that regard, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, has an amendment related to cooperation with Cuba on drug interdiction that he would like to have considered after the Sessions amendment is disposed of tomorrow. That has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Specter amendment be taken up after the disposition of the Sessions amendment on tomorrow.
