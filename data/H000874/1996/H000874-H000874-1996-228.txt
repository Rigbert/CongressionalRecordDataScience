Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Visclosky amendment and want to reiterate the point made by the gentleman from New Jersey, [Mr. Pallone]. This amendment does not reference Turkey. Let me at the outset state that I believe that Turkey is a friend. Turkey is an important ally. Turkey has strategically been of great assistance to the United States of America.  As I pointed out, when I spoke on the additional funds for the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, we need to hold accountable in the international community those who did not meet international norms, friend or not a friend.  I am one who has been substantially critical of Turkey, notwithstanding my premise that they are a friend and important ally. Whether it relates to the Kurds, whether it relates to their treatment of prisoners or the press, whether it deals with any other matter, all of us need to hold one another accountable for transgressions and for a failure to meet international norms.  Now, in the Humanitarian Corridor Act we said one of the norms was allowing assistance to go to those in trouble. Not combatants, not adversaries, but people in trouble. People in trouble because of conflict, perhaps beyond their control, children in trouble. We have provided, and other Western nations have provided, humanitarian assistance. Not to aid combatants, not to aid one side or the other, not to make an ideological point, but to say that, when there are people in trouble, it is the objective of the international civilized community to give aid and comfort and help.  We ought to ask all of our allies and our friends to assist to the greatest extent possible in the delivering of that humanitarian assistance. That is all this amendment says.
