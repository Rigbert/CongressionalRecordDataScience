President, 18 years ago I wrote a law that has been repeated annually ever since and is now codified as section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act. It has become widely known as the ``Leahy Law'' and it has two primary purposes.  The first is to prevent U.S. taxpayer funded training, equipment, or other assistance from going to units of foreign security forces that have committed heinous crimes. We saw many instances when U.S. aid ended up in the hands of foreign military or police forces that had engaged in rape, murder, torture, or other gross violations of human rights, and the U.S. was tainted by association with those crimes.  The second is to encourage foreign governments to bring to justice the individual members of units responsible for such atrocities. In many countries that receive U.S. aid there is a long history of impunity for crimes committed by government security forces. Rather than protect their citizens, they abuse them, and then they beat up or kill witnesses and threaten prosecutors and judges. They act outside the law and literally get away with murder. They are the antithesis of professional, accountable military or police forces.  A similar, although not identical, provision that is also known as the Leahy Law is contained in the annual Defense Appropriations Act.  Both Leahy Laws serve important national interests and they have become increasingly institutionalized within the U.S. government. The State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor has developed a database for vetting foreign units and individuals that is continually updated, and they and the Defense Department increasingly coordinate to apply the laws consistently. The Department of State and foreign operations appropriations bill for 2015, reported to the Senate on June 19, includes $5 million to pay salaries and other costs of the vetting process, an increase of $2.25 million above fiscal year 2014.  While the Leahy Laws have been modified over the years and their implementation is a continuing work in progress, I appreciate the support they have received from the highest levels of the State and Defense Departments, and the willingness of officials in those agencies to work with Congress and representatives of human rights organizations and foreign governments to address issues of interpretation and implementation as they arise.  As with many laws, the Leahy Laws have their detractors. However, with rare exceptions questions about, or criticism of, the laws have been due to misinformation or misunderstandings that have been easy to clarify or resolve.  While I know of no one who has expressed opposition to the Leahy Laws, some have raised concerns with their implementation, suggesting that they pose unacceptable obstacles to the ability of the U.S. military to engage with foreign counterparts. Not only do the facts indicate otherwise, the laws are working. In more than 90 percent of cases the foreign units or individuals vetted have been deemed eligible to receive U.S. assistance under the Leahy Laws. In the rare instances when a unit or individual was denied assistance, it was due to credible information that the individual or unit had committed a heinous crime and the foreign government had done nothing about it.  At a July 10 hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations, Stephen Rickard, a former Senate staff member, State Department official, director of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, director of Amnesty International's Washington Office, and now executive director of the Open Society Policy Center, provided testimony on the Leahy Laws. His testimony does an excellent job of describing the purposes and impact of the Leahy Laws, and addressing key questions that have been asked about their implementation. I ask unanimous consent that his statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Statement of Stephen Richard, Executive Director, Open Society Policy                                  Center Presented to the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global       Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations                Human Rights Vetting: Nigeria and Beyond                             July 10, 2014       I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Smith and      Ranking Member Bass for holding this important hearing and      for their leadership on human rights.       I have worked on the Leahy Laws in one form or another for      nearly 17 years and have discussed them with countless State      Department and Defense Department officials, as well as with      human rights experts working all over the world. I also spent      a period of time as a Franklin Fellow in the Department of      State during which time I was able to learn in detail about      the process for implementing the Leahy Laws. I have been      engaged on detailed questions about the application of the      Leahy Laws in Colombia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka,      Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya and dozens of other countries, and      I believe that these laws are among the most important human      rights statutes on the books. The law has been poorly      funded--less than two-hundredths of one percent of the cost      of U.S. military assistance is spent on Leahy Law vetting.      And it has often been misunderstood and misrepresented.       But with President Obama proposing a new $5 billion fund      for military assistance to combat terrorism it is essential      to help the public understand this vital law and to help      insure that it is vigorously implemented.     A Common Sense Formula for Security Cooperation Consistent          With U.S. Values       The Leahy Laws are common sense laws that prohibit the      United States Government from arming or providing military      training to security force and police units abroad who have      been credibly alleged to have committed gross human rights      violations. These laws (there is one for State Department      assistance and one for Department of Defense assistance) do      not prohibit the United States from providing assistance in      violent, conflict-wracked countries like Nigeria and      Colombia. On the contrary, because they involve a unit by      unit examination, the Leahy Laws provide a formula for the      United States to assist foreign military forces even in      countries where some government forces are committing gross      atrocities. They are a formula for success in such countries,      not a prohibition on engagement.     Four Numbers       There are four important numbers to keep in mind about the      impact of the Leahy Laws. (All these statistics have been      provided by the State Department and cover 2011-2013.) The      first number is 530,000. That's the approximate number of      foreign military and police units which the United States      government considered arming or training over the last three      years and subjected to Leahy vetting.       The second number is 90 percent. That is the minimum      percentage of prompt approvals given under the Leahy Law--     generally within 10 days of a request. There is even a ``fast      track'' approval process for countries with generally good      human rights records. Some vetting requests require more      information, investigation or discussion. But at least 90%      are approved more or less immediately.       The third number is 1 percent. In every one of the last      three years less than 1 percent of all units vetted under the      Leahy Law were ultimately declared to be ineligible for      assistance under the law. Of course it is true that the      number will be higher in some specific countries, but taken      as a whole the Leahy Law actually blocks aid in a miniscule      percentage of cases.       The final number is 2,516. The Leahy Law blocks aid in a      tiny percentage of cases, but that doesn't mean that it is      unimportant. Because the U.S. now provides training to so      many people, even 1 percent is a lot. And 2,516 is the number      of vetted units that the U.S. Government found to be credibly      linked to gross atrocities over the last three years when it      took the time to examine their records because of the Leahy      Law.       Those 2,516 units were not being asked to satisfy a high      standard. In no way does the Leahy Law require pristine      forces. In fact, the State Department defines ``gross human      rights violations'' to include a very short list of only the      most heinous offenses: murder, torture, rape, disappearances      and other gross violations of life and liberty. That's it. So      even though less than 1 percent of proposed units failed the      standard, it is still pretty     shocking that over the last three years the United States      Government probably would have armed and trained 2,516 units      (or individuals in those units) containing murders, rapists      and torturers without the Leahy Law.       The Leahy Laws don't actually prohibit the U.S. from      working with even these units--the ones that have committed      murder and torture. It only says that the U.S. cannot arm or      train them until the foreign government takes steps to clean      up the unit.     Three Questions       So whenever anyone says that it is a problem for the United      States that it cannot train or arm a particular foreign      battalion or police unit, one should ask three questions:       (1) What did the unit do? If we can't work with them, it      must mean that the United States has determined that this      unit is one of the worst of the worst. It is in the 1 percent      of units where the U.S. government found credible information      linking it to murder, rape, torture or another gross      atrocity. So, when someone argues that we should arm a Leahy-     prohibited unit, one should ask, ``What did the unit do to      get on the list?''       (2) Why won't the government clean up the unit? Maybe the      foreign government wants to make a point to the U.S.--it      doesn't accept the U.S. commitment to human rights; it won't      let the U.S. ``tell it what to do.'' Maybe the government has      no control over its own military and cannot do anything to      clean up the unit even if it wanted to do so. But one should      insist on knowing: ``Why won't the government clean up the      unit?''       (3) Finally, if the unit committed murder, rape or torture      and the foreign government won't or can't clean it up, why      should U.S. taxpayers give that specific unit guns anyway?      Under what possible circumstances would it make sense for the      United States to arm known killers who are either completely      out of their government's control, or who work for a      government that refuses to take any action against them?     Responses to Three Criticisms       Tempus Fugit: There are a number of arguments raised      against the Leahy Law which might make some sense if the law      covered lesser offenses. For instance, there is an argument      that it makes no sense to keep a unit on the Leahy Law      ``pariah'' list long after the atrocity occurred, especially      if everyone who was in the unit has now moved on. But there      are no other contexts in which we would accept a 4 year, or 8      year or even 15 year statute of limitations on murder,      torture or rape. So why accept one here? And the law is      intended to create an incentive for foreign governments to      improve their human rights records and to hold people      accountable. Letting a unit off the hook because the      government rotated people out of the unit (and into other      ones) or because the foreign government simply waited us out      for a few years sends exactly the wrong message. Moreover,      units have reputations and traditions that are regularly      passed on to new members of the unit over many years and even      decades. That is often true for units with gallant histories.      But it is also true of death squads and praetorian guards.       Just as importantly, one needs to ask what it says about a      foreign military ``partner'' if documented cases of murder,      rape and torture go without redress after decades. The      government always has the option of working with the United      States to create new, carefully vetted units--something that      has been done in a number of countries with gross human      rights problems. If the government will not do that, it is      probably trying to make a point. Is it appropriate to reward      such behavior with assistance?       Pariah Forever: Critics of the law also sometimes argue      that it is impossible for a tainted unit to be rehabilitated.      This is, of course, completely false--unless the government      in question refuses or is unable to take any meaningful      action to address the problem. So what these critics are      really saying is: It is almost never the case that America's      military partners in these countries have the political will      or commitment to human rights to take the kind of      disciplinary action against killers and rapists that is      absolutely routine in the U.S. military. And that is a very      odd sort of argument for waiving or weakening the Leahy Law      so that we can give more guns to these government's forces.       In fact, there are cases in which specific units have been      rehabilitated. But it takes a willing partner. This is one      area where critics of the law and its supporters should make      common cause to support earmarked funding for remediation of      tainted units. One percent of U.S. military assistance--just      one penny out of every dollar--should be set aside for      vetting and remediation. It should be used to help foreign      militaries set up JAG officer corps, criminal investigation      services and other elements of a professional disciplinary      system. This should simply be considered a cost of doing      business in some of the most violent places on earth. There      is a precedent for applying a fixed surcharge as a ``cost of      doing business.'' Every time the United States Government      sells weapons abroad it applies a surcharge--currently 3.5%--     to administer the sale. The U.S. should apply a 1% surcharge      to ensure that it knows what is being done with the other 99%      and so that it can help move its partner forces in a positive      direction on human rights.       Just a Few Bad Apples: Critics sometimes argue that it is      wrong to hold whole units accountable for the acts of just a      few, or perhaps even just one, member of the unit. They argue      that we should vet specific individuals rather than units and      only withhold information from those individuals who are      linked to atrocities.       Here it is important to understand that the Leahy Law was a      compromise. There was and is an important human rights law--     Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act--which does not      permit the United States to engage in a unit by unit      assessment of foreign partner forces: ``No security      assistance may be provided to any country the government of      which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of      internationally recognized human rights.'' There is a very      strong argument to be made under Section 502B that the United      States should be providing no assistance whatsoever to      Nigerian forces, and many others around the world.       But historically the United States has been extremely      reluctant to invoke Section 502B even in the most extreme      cases. So the Leahy Law was proposed as an intermediate step:      If the U.S. will not completely cut off governments engaging      in a consistent pattern of gross human rights violations,      then at least it should not arm the specific military units      it believes are the ones actually committing the gross      violations. However, Senator Leahy also believed that it      would be absurd and unreasonable to ask that human rights      victims be able to identify the specific murder, torturer or      rapist by name before the U.S. took any action. So, his law      states that if credible information can be presented that      links an identifiable unit to a specific atrocity the United      States would be required to cut off that unit--at least until      the foreign government identifies the specific individuals      within it who are responsible and deals with them.     One Final Thought       The Bible tells us in the Book of Acts that before his      conversion on the road to Damascus the Apostle Paul was a      persecutor of the Christian Church. In fact, according to      Acts (Chapter 7, Verse 59) he was present at the killing of      St. Stephen and held the cloaks of those who stoned him. He      cast no stones himself; but he was complicit. He gave aid to      the killers. When we go to places like Nigeria, shouldn't we      at least ask, ``Whose cloaks are we holding?'' That's all the      Leahy Law says.       The Leahy Law cannot guarantee that the U.S. will never arm      bad people. It's not a panacea. It's just the least we can      do.                          ____________________
