Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am very pleased to bring before the House H.R. 2540, as amended, Veterans Benefits Act of 2001.  This is the fourth major piece of legislation that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has brought to the floor this year. Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 801, the Veterans' Survivor Benefits Improvements Act of 2001, which was signed into law on June 5.  This legislation, Public Law 107-14, expands health and life insurance coverage for dependents and survivors of veterans. The House also approved H.R. 811, the Veterans' Hospitals Emergency Repair Act, which provides $550 million over 2 years to repair and renovate VA medical facilities.  While this legislation is still awaiting action in the Senate, having passed the House, funding was included in the VA-HUD appropriations bill approved last night to begin these needed repairs.  In addition, the House has approved H.R. 1291, the 21st Century Montgomery G.I. Bill Enhancement Act, which also is awaiting Senate action. It provides a 70 percent increase in G.I. educational benefits to qualifying service members.  Mr. Speaker, today we bring yet another vitally important piece of legislation to the floor that will provide increases in VA compensation payments to disabled veterans and their survivors.  Mr. Speaker, there are more than 2.3 million disabled veterans or survivors of disabled veterans today receiving compensation who will receive a boost with passage of H.R. 2540, including more than 170,000 veterans rated 100 percent disabled who will get an additional $767 each year added to their existing benefit.  I would note parenthetically in the State of New Jersey there are 3,246 disabled veterans with a rating of 100%, and they, too, will get an additional $767 in benefits.                              {time}  1230  Upon enactment of this legislation, all veterans or qualified survivors will get the 2.7 percent COLA. The cost for this will be over $400 million in the first year and $543 million over the next 4 years. In all, the compensation package for the COLA will be $2.5 billion over 5 years.  Another very important component of this bill addresses the lingering effects of service to Persian Gulf War veterans. Many veterans who applied for disability compensation for poorly-defined illnesses found that a beneficial law we adopted in 1994, the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act, had a ``Catch-22.'' If a doctor could diagnose the illness, and the symptoms had not arisen in service or within 1 year, the claim was denied.  Mr. Speaker, there is an evolution occurring in medicine today with respect to so-called chronic multi- symptom illnesses. Some of these illnesses, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, have case definitions that are generally accepted in the medical profession, although their cause and effect and treatment are unknown. Concerned physicians who study and treat many patients with one or more symptoms may not agree that a given set of symptoms fit one case definition or another. At other times, physicians may decide to treat discrete symptoms without reaching a definitive diagnosis. This bill provides the expansion authority; and my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Benefits, will explain this momentarily in greater detail.  Let me also say that this legislation is the work of a tremendous amount of bipartisanship as well as a great deal of work by our respective staffs, and I would like to single out a number of Members. First of all, beginning with my good friend, the ranking member, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), who was instrumental in working on section 2 of this important piece of legislation. He has contributed very constructively to the shaping of this bill.  I would especially like to thank the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), as I mentioned before, chairman of the Subcommittee on Benefits, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes). I would just note that while the gentleman from Idaho is only in his second term and is already a subcommittee chairman, he is not new to policy making. Chairman Simpson is an accomplished lawmaker. As I think many of my colleagues know, he served in his State legislature for 14 years. His positions included majority caucus chairman, assistant majority leader in the Idaho House of Representatives; and he served as speaker, for 6 years in the Idaho House of Representatives. He is also a member of the Idaho Republican Party Hall of Fame. We are very fortunate to have him serving as chairman.  Let me also thank some of the other Members who worked on this. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis),who helped shape the final outcome of this bill. After markup, some issues remained that were hammered out in a constructive dialogue. There were some lingering issues that needed to be resolved, and he was instrumental in crafting that compromise.  Let me also thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer), a Persian Gulf War vet himself, who worked on this legislation very mightily; the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Gibbons), who intended on offering an extension on the bill--a compromise--extends the period by 2 years. I also want to thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Shows); and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo), the latter who had a major bill on Gulf War vets with multiple cosponsors, in excess of 200, who was also very instrumental in shaping this legislation.  Finally, I want to thank our staff: Jeannie McNally, Darryl Kehrer, Paige McManus, Devon Seibert, Kingston Smith, Summer Larson, and my good friend and chief counsel, Patrick Ryan.  Also the minority staff: Beth Kilker, Debbie Smith, Mary Ellen McCarthy, and Michael Durishin, who worked hard on this bill. I urge support for this important veterans legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
