  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, next week the Nation will celebrate Memorial Day. A fitting celebration of Memorial Day in this House would be to crack down on the waste, fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon so that we can better equip our troops and we can meet our obligations to our veterans.  At the run-up to the last war, the Pentagon was scrambling to find chemical and biological suits. But it turned out that another part of the Pentagon had put them up for sale for surplus on the Internet, usable suits, and were selling them for pennies on the dollar at the same time that we did not have enough to go around in the field.  But that is nothing new at the Pentagon. They have misplaced $1 trillion, T, trillion, not million, not billion, trillion dollars according to the GAO. They lost 56 airplanes, 32 tanks, 36 Javelin missile command launch units. They spent $20 billion trying to overhaul their accounting system, and then abandoned that effort.  That did not help one soldier in the field, did not help one veteran, did not help the Nation. Waste, fraud, and abuse by contractors and bureaucrats is not patriotic. Let us clean up the Pentagon. Let us do something in the bill today to make certain this no longer occurs.                          ____________________
