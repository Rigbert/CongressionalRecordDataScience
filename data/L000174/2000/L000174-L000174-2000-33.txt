President, recently the Burlington Free Press had an article about Ann Kriesel of Burlington, VT and praised her as the volunteer of the week.  The Leahy family has known Ann Trueblood Kriesel almost from the time she came to Burlington. She is an extraordinary person, loved and respected by all who know her. She and her husband, Peter, are dear friends of Marcelle's and mine, and she has made her mark on our community in a way that would bring great pride and credit to anyone.  As an exemplary teacher, as a mother and grandmother, her intelligence, quiet wit and grace has helped Vermonters of all ages.  It is with pride that I ask the article about her be included in the Congressional Record, so that all Senators might know this exemplary woman and how much she and Peter mean to all of us.  The article follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Oct. 18, 2000]             Former Teacher Enjoys New Role as a Volunteer                          (By Beth Gillespie)       Anne Kriesel is one of those special people who go out of      their way to enrich other people's lives.       The volunteer at The Converse Home in Burlington browses      through local libraries for short stories, essays and      articles that the home's residents would enjoy and reads the      selections once a week. She also calls out for bingo games      and facilitates group crossword puzzles.       A hostess during their social hours, Kriesel visits with      people and serves refreshments, and during outings she helps      those who use walkers get on and off the bus, carries      articles for them and keeps track of everyone.       Kriesel introduces herself to new residents and helps them      feel comfortable. She worked one-on-one with one woman until      her death, visiting with her and playing canasta, Kings in      the Corner, rummy and other games.       ``Anne is generous, genuine and dependable,'' says Patti      Meyer, activity/volunteer director for Converse. ``Her bright      personality and positive `can-do' attitude are priceless--she      enthusiastically embraces her responsibilities and gladly      does whatever she can to help out. Anne has become part of      our family as she helps to make Converse a true home. The      time she shares with us is very precious and we thank her      from the bottom of our hearts.''       Kriesel also substitutes for Meals on Wheels and is      involved with the Joint Urban Ministries Program through her      church, College Street Congressional. She greets clients who      come to the Urban Ministries Program for counseling, helps      them fill out forms and visits with them until they can see a      counselor.       A retired teacher, Kriesel spent 22 of her 27 years in      education at Colchester Middle School, and now works part-     time for the University of Vermont Department of Education as      a supervisor of student teachers. She lives in Burlington      with her husband, Peter, and the couple has two adult sons      and one granddaughter. She enjoys walking, gardening,      cooking, reading and writing.       ``I loved my 27 years of full-time public school      teaching,'' Kriesel says. ``It's fun for me now to branch      out, try some new things and work with people at the opposite      end of the age spectrum. I find that they have such rich      lives and wonderful stories to tell.''                          ____________________
