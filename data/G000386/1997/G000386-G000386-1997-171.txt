 President, I would like to address some of Mr. Hamre's assertions.  First, Mr. Hamre's remarks imply that my criticism is somehow personal.  Nothing could be further from the truth. He is a very likeable person.  But my personal feelings have absolutely nothing to do with my position on his nomination.  What I have tried to do is examine all the facts and then reach a conclusion based on those facts.  These are the facts as I know them.  In 1992, the inspector general [IG] examined the Department of Defense's [DOD] progress payment procedures.  The IG along with legal counsel declared that these policies ``resulted in the rendering of false accounts and violations of the law.''  The IG told the Department to get on the stick and fix the problem.  The bureaucrats balked.  Under pressure, they finally signed an agreement in March 1993.  In signing this document, they agreed to comply with the law.  One of the persons who signed this agreement was Mr. Alvin Tucker.  Well, 7 months after Mr. Tucker signed the agreement, Mr. Hamre became Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer or CFO.  Well, guess what?  Mr. Tucker became Mr. Hamre's most senior deputy. He became the Deputy CFO.  Mr. President, after becoming CFO, Mr. Hamre did nothing to meet the terms of the agreement and comply with the law.  Instead, he sided with the bureaucrats who were thumbing their noses at the law.  He gave them the green light to keep breaking the law.  He personally reauthorized their illegal operation.  Then, early this year he floated a legislative proposal.  His draft language would have sanctioned the procedure that the IG had declared illegal and that he, Mr. Hamre, had personally authorized.  Mr. President, those are the facts.  In my opinion, Mr. Hamre was attempting to legalize a crime.  Mr. Hamre knew full well his progess scheme was operating outside the law.  Otherwise, why would he feel like he needed some legal cover?  Second, he accuses me of making a mountain out of a molehill.  He claims I am focusing on a ``small policy'' issue.  I take issue with the notion that this is somehow an insignificant issue.  The statute that Mr. Hamre's progress payment scheme violates is section 1301 of title 31 of the United Statess Code.  This law embodies a sacred constitutional principle: Only Congress has the power to decide how public money many be spent.  This is the device that Congress uses to control the purse strings.  So, Mr. President, this isn't Mickey Mouse stuff. I'm talking about a constitutional principle.  When a constitutional principle is involved, it's very difficult for me to see the smallness of an issue.  Third, Mr. Hamre claims this is an acquisition issue--not a finance and accounting question.  This is an obvious attempt to deflect responsibility--away from himself.  It's an attempt to make it someone else's problem.  His reasoning is flawed.  If Mr. Hamre thinks this is an acquisition issue, maybe he has abdicated his responsibilities under the law--as CFO.  The CFO's responsibilities are spelled out in the ``Money and Finance'' section of the United States Code. That's in title 31.  His payment scheme violates section 1301 in the same book--title 31.  It does it by deliberately charging payments to the wrong accounts and then juggling the books to cover it up.  Anyone who thinks this is an acquisition issue needs to consult the law books.  When you go to the law library and locate title 31 and open the book, the subtitle staring you in the face is: ``Money and Finance.''  Section 1301 lies in a chapter entitled ``Appropriations.''  Mr. President, misappropriation, mischarging and cooking the books takes Mr. Hamre deep into the realm of money and accounting.  If this is just an acquisition issue, I'll eat my hat.  Fourth, when Mr. Hamre became CFO in October 1993, he declared war on financial mismanagement.  To claim success today, he cites ``steep drops in contract overpayments.''  Mr. Hamre's claims are not supported by the facts.  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has issued a series of reports on DOD overpayments.  These reports demolish Mr. Hamre's success stories.  The most recent report says Mr. Hamre's progress payments scheme is the biggest, single driver behind overpayments. He's to blame.  That's right, Mr. President, Mr. Hamre's own operations are causing overpayments to happen.  That's exactly what it says on page 12 of the GAO report entitled: ``Fixing DOD's Payment Problems is Imperative.''  This report is dated April 1997 and has the designation NSIAD-97-37.  GAO reports also say that DOD has no capability to detect overpayments.  Virtually every overpayment ever examined by the GAO was detected bythe person who got the check in the mail--the contractor--and not the Government.  In almost every case, overpayments were voluntarily refunded by the contractor who got the checks.  Now, Mr. President, if Mr. Hamre were really serious about eliminating overpayments, why didn't he just shut down the illegal progress payments operation--like the IG asked?  That would have removed the primary source of overpayments.  If Mr. Hamre has no capability to detect overpayments, how does he know whether they are going up or down?  How does he know they are going down, if he doesn't know how many there are?  Perhaps, if overpayments are really going down--like he says, it must mean the contractors have stopped making voluntary refunds.  Maybe they have decided to keep the money. That would help to keep the numbers down.  Mr. President, I will have much more to say about Mr. Hamre in the weeks ahead.  Some of my colleagues have asked me why I oppose this nomination.  I want to be sure they know where I am coming from.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, May 27, 1997.     President William J. Clinton,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to inform you that I am      opposed to the nomination of Mr. John J. Hamre to fill the      number two position at the Department of Defense (DOD).       Secretary Cohen has recommended that Mr. Hamre be the next      Deputy Secretary of Defense.       I am opposed to this nomination because Mr. Hamre has      authorized and protected an illegal payment operation.       The procedure in question is the one DOD uses to make      progress payments on contracts. Under Mr. Hamre's policy,      payments are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts.      Then, after the payments are made, DOD attempts to ``adjust''      the accounting ledgers to make it look like the checks were      charged to the right accounts when the money was, in fact,      spent some other way. Deliberately charging the wrong      accounts and then juggling the books to make them look right      is what I call ``cooking the books.''       Legal counsel has said that DOD's progress payment      procedures ``result in the rendering of false accounts and      violations of Section 1301.'' Section 1301 is a little known      but very important law. It embodies a sacred constitutional      principle: Only Congress decides how public money may be      spent. Section 1301is the device the Congress uses to control      the purse strings.       After the Inspector General declared that DOD progress      payment procedures were illegal, the department's Chief      Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Hamre, had a responsibility to      institute some reforms. In fact, his senior deputy made a      formal commitment to obey the law. But instead of fixing the      problem, Mr. Hamre tried to legalize the crime. Earlier this      year, he circulated a piece of draft legislation for review      and comment. His legislation would have sanctioned the      payment procedures that the IG had declared illegal and that      he had personally authorized in writing after becoming CFO.       Mr. Hamre's draft bill tells me that he knew full well that      his progress payments process was operating outside the law.      Otherwise, why was he seeking legal cover?       Mr. President, when I found out about what Mr. Hamre was up      to, I went straight to the floor of the Senate to denounce      his actions. I did it on two occasions. Once on January 28th      (See pages S695-696 in the Record) and again on February 12th      (S1265-1267).       I think Mr. Hamre has probably done an excellent job in      making a case for the DOD budget before Congress. And that is      the John Hamre that most senators know--the one wearing the      budget hat. That's John Hamre, the Comptroller. But the      budget is just part of his job. He wears another hat. He is      also the department's CFO. As CFO, he is responsible for      financial management and accounting. This has been his      downfall. In the accounting field, Mr. Hamre has done a lousy      job. I would give him a grade of F for his performance. The      department's books are in a shambles. True, they were that      way when he became CFO, but that was four years ago, and they      are still that way. The department's books are in such a      mess--so much documentation is missing--that they can't be      audited as required by the CFO Act of 1990. And the situation      is not expected to get much better anytime soon. The IG      expects to keep giving DOD disclaimers of opinion ``well into      the next century.''       One reason why DOD keeps flunking the CFO audits is sloppy      bookkeeping. DOD refuses to do routine accounting work on a      daily basis as transactions occur. And one of the most      flagrant examples of sloppy bookkeeping is the progress      payment process. As legal counsel said, it results in the      rendering of false accounts and violations of Section 1301.      Payments are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts and      then DOD doctors the books to make them right with the law.      With this kind of bookkeeping operation, it's next to      impossible to either locate or follow the audit trail.       Mr. President, this is not ``mickey mouse'' accounting      stuff that only ``bean counters'' need to worry about. This      is about the breakdown of discipline and internal controls.      That leaves the department's accounts vulnerable to theft and      abuse. In recent years, several employees succeeded in      tapping into the DOD money pipe undetected, stealing millions      of dollars. They were caught as a result of outrageous      personal behavior and not because of effective internal      controls. How many others are still out there, ripping off      the taxpayers?       Under the CFO Act, Mr. Hamre is responsible for ``improving      internal controls and financial accounting.'' Because of his      personal involvement in the illegal payment process and his      failure to clean up the books, I do not believe that Mr.      Hamre deserves to be promoted to Deputy Secretary of Defense.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senator.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, May 29, 1997]            Official in Line for No. 2 Defense Post Rebuked                          (By Bradley Graham)       John Hamre, the Pentagon comptroller in line to become the      Defense Department's new second-in-command, has come under an      unusually sharp attack from Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa)      triggered by a dispute over how the department accounts for      progress payments on contracts.       In a letter to President Clinton made public yesterday,      Grassley accused Hamre of having ``authorized and protected      an illegal payment operation'' and announced he would oppose      Hamre's expected nomination.       The accounting practice, Grassley said, is symptomatic of      the Pentagon's chronically ``sloppy bookkeeping.'' He charged      Hamre had ``done a lousy job'' revamping the Pentagon's      financial management during his four years as comptroller,      adding that the Pentagon's books remain a ``mess.''       Hamre, a former Senate staff member who enjoys widespread      favor on Capitol Hill, was stunned and puzzled by the      harshness and personal focus of Grassley's remarks. At issue,      he said, was just an honest disagreement over a Pentagon      contracting practice that dates back several decades.       ``The senator has taken an important but small acquisition      policy issue and applied it to my entire tenure,'' Hamre said      in a brief phone interview. ``I'm sorry he's done that, and      I'd welcome a chance to talk about it.''       Grassley repeatedly has called attention to the Pentagon's      antiquated accounting system, deploring its waste and      vulnerability to fraud. Hamre, in turn, declared improvements      in controls and methods a top priority when he took over as      the Pentagon's top financial officer in 1993. Since then, the      Pentagon has reported steep drops in contract overpayments      and unmatched disbursements, begun a shift from paper-based      to electronic payments and consolidated financial offices.       But what troubles Grassley is the Pentagon's continuing      practice of making periodic payments on contracts without      correlating them to the work done, a process that Grassley      says the Pentagon's inspector general declared illegal in      1992.       ``Under Mr. Hamre's policy,'' Grassley wrote, ``payments      are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts. Then, after      the payments are made, DOD attempts to `adjust' the      accounting ledgers to make it look like the checks were      charged to the right accounts when the money was, in fact,      spent some other way.       ``Deliberately charging the wrong accounts and then      juggling the books to make them look right is what I call      `cooking the books,' '' the senator added.       Hamre maintains there is nothing nefarious about the      practice. He said the system of progress payments was adopted      years ago to allow the contractor to avoid having to borrow      money, and thus keep project costs down. Whether the Pentagon      should move to a more precise billing process now, he said,      is a contracting issue, not a financial management one. Just      how far Grassley intends to go in thwarting Hamre's accession      is unclear. While Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has      recommended Hamre for the job of deputy secretary, Clinton      has not publicly affirmed the choice.       If the nomination goes to Capitol Hill, Grassley could      simply vote against it or, as he has done in previous      instances, exercise his senatorial prerogative to block the      nomination from coming to a floor vote.       ``I don't know what we're going to do yet,'' a Grassley      aide said.
