President, today, as we approach the national celebration of Sunshine Week 2008, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the OPEN FOIA Act of 2008, a concise and straightforward bill to further strengthen the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. This bill is the next step in the important work that Senator Cornyn and I have undertaken to reinvigorate and strengthen FOIA, and it follows the enactment late last year of the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act, a law which made the first major reforms to FOIA in more than a decade.  The OPEN FOIA Act simply requires that when Congress provides for a statutory exemption to FOIA in new legislation, Congress must state its intention to do so explicitly and clearly in that bill. This commonsense bill mirrors bipartisan legislation that unanimously passed the Senate during the last Congress, S.1181. I hope that the Senate will once again promptly and unanimously pass this good-government bill.  While no one can fairly question the need to keep certain government information secret to ensure the public good, excessive government secrecy is a constant temptation and the enemy of a vibrant democracy. For more than 4 decades, FOIA has served as perhaps the most important Federal law to ensure the public's right to know and to balance the government's power with the need for government accountability.  FOIA contains a number of exemptions to its disclosure requirements for national security, law enforcement, confidential business information, personal privacy and other circumstances. The FOIA exemption commonly known as the ``(b)(3) exemption,'' requires that Government records that are specifically exempted from FOIA by statute may be withheld from the public. Of course, neither I nor Senator Cornyn would quibble with the notion that some Government information is appropriately kept from public view. But in recent years we have witnessed an alarming number of FOIA (b)(3) exemptions being offered in legislation--often in very ambiguous terms--to the detriment of the American people's right to know.  The bedrock principles of open government lead me to believe that (b)(3) statutory exemptions should be clear and unambiguous, and vigorously debated before they are enacted into law. Of course, sometimes this does happen. But more and more often, legislative exemptions to FOIA are buried within a few lines of very complex and lengthy bills, which are never debated openly and publicly before becoming law. The consequence of this troubling practice is the erosion of the public's right to know and the shirking of Congress' duty to fully consider these exemptions.  Senator Cornyn and I both believe that Congress must be diligent in reviewing any new exemptions to FOIA, to prevent possible abuses and a situation where the exceptions to disclosure under FOIA swallow this important disclosure rule. The OPEN FOIA Act will ensure openness and clarity about how we treat one of our most important open Government laws. Our bill will also shine more light into the process of creating legislative exemptions to FOIA--which is the best antidote to exemption creep.  Democratic and Republican Senators alike have rightly supported and voted for this bill in the past. As I have said many times before, open Government is not a Democratic issue, nor a Republican issue. It is an American value and a virtue that all Americans can embrace. I urge all Members to support this bipartisan good-government bill to strengthen the public's right to know.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2746       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``OPEN FOIA Act of 2008''.     SEC. 2. SPECIFIC CITATIONS IN STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS.       Section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended      by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:       ``(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute      (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute--       ``(A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the      public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the      issue; or       ``(ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or      refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and       ``(B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN      FOIA Act of 2008, specifically cites to this paragraph.''.                                 ______                                       By
