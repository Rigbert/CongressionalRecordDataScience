It is important for the legislative history of this section to note that the conference report states.  In carrying out the program . . . the Secretary shall promote grounds and surface water conservation by providing cost-share payments, incentive payments, and loans to producers to carry out eligible water conservation activities with respect to the agricultural operations of producers, to--(1) improve irrigation systems; (2) enhance irrigation efficiencies; (3) convert to--(A) the production of less water-intensive agricultural commodities; or (B) dryland farming; (4) improve the storage of water though measures such as water banking and groundwater recharge; (5) mitigate the effects of drought or (6) institute other measures that improve groundwater surface water conservation, as determined by the Secretary, in the agricultural operations of producers.  In addition to all those excellent purposes, this section requires that a Secretary may only provide this money to a producer if the net result is ``a new savings in groundwater or surface water resources in the agricultural operation of the producer.'' Chairman Harkin, it appears to me that these purposes coincide with the purposes of the original Klamath language in the Senate farm bill: water conservation and improved agricultural practices; aquatic ecosystem restoration; and improvement of water quality. Do you read it the same way?
