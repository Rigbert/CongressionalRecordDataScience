  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I noticed yesterday that the President gave a speech and he said that those who oppose his fast track authority have an ignorance of the new world international economy.  I saw the face of the new world economy last weekend, and I would like the President to hear about it. He should go to Juarez, Mexico: a 77-percent increase in maquiladora jobs since fast track passed.  Two-earner families living in hovels without water, heat, or even walls. They are made of pallets and packing crates. Working 45 hours a week for U.S. corporations, jobs that were here before NAFTA, for $40 a week. No environmental controls, no labor protections, no right to organize. That is the face of the new world economy, Mr. President.  There is one place we are running a surplus today, that is in Latin and South America. And now the President wants fast track authority to go down there and see if he can screw that up too, and take more of our jobs south of the border so our corporations can exploit cheap labor and the environment. No.                          ____________________
