She has the distinct honor of being the first female General Officer in the history of the Iowa National Guard. Her hard work and dedication to service are celebrated by this promotion. I want to extend my deepest congratulations to Brigadier General Tymeson.  Serving in the Iowa Army National Guard for nearly 30 years, she continues to prove herself a capable and responsible leader and one who garners respect from her colleagues.
