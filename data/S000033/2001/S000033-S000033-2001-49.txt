 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of the State of Vermont, I rise and in the strongest possible terms condemn the unspeakable acts which were perpetrated yesterday by cowardly terrorists. I also wish to express my condolences for the thousands of families who are suffering tonight from their losses on the four planes that went down, the losses at the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon.  Mr. Speaker, the goal of terrorism is to demoralize people and to create fear, uncertainty, and instability. Our Nation must not succumb to that and give terrorists that victory.  Tonight we grieve for the incredible and horrendous loss of life that we suffered yesterday. It is unprecedented in the modern history of our country. But tonight we also pledge to capture and punish all of those who are responsible for this despicable deed.  There is no difference of opinion on that issue in this Congress or in this country. Mr. Speaker, the world must know and will know that those who committed these unspeakable crimes will not get away with it.  As we go forward in this effort, we must also be calm and focused and be thinking long term on how to defeat this terrible evil. We must also be thinking about how we can work better and more effectively with law-abiding people throughout this world, because terrorism is an international crisis, and it will be solved by decent people from one end of this world to the other working together.  Let me conclude by saying that we should also be extraordinarily proud and reassured by how people throughout our country and in my own State of Vermont are coming together, how they are giving blood, how they are raising funds and how they are doing everything that they can to support the victims and their families. Let us go together and we will defeat international terrorism.
