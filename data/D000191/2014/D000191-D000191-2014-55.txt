 The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, first my condolences to the gentleman from Utah for being a Cubs fan. I am a Red Sox fan, and we have had some problems too. But that was an interesting moment and an interesting analogy made.  Mr. Chairman, I am not aware of the specifics of the instance of which he speaks. But I would say that this, as a remedy for a past action, would apply in the future, and it would not undo whatever took place in the past that the gentleman is referring to. And the principle here is fairly extraordinary. It kind of says, Federal bureaucrats never make mistakes.  So we have proposed leases in an area. We go through a public comment period. Local people comment. A hunting and fishing group comes in and says, you know, this is absolutely, like, the primo area for hunting or fishing or something else. Or it becomes apparent that this is, like, right in a main recreation corridor, something that the Federal bureaucrat overlooked in drawing up the lease boundaries.  But if this were adopted and became law in the future, at the end of the public comment period, it would be, We are the Federal Government. Thank you very much for pointing out that we really screwed that up, that we were just about to wipe out a prime habitat, that we were just about to block or really degrade a prime recreation corridor. We are bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. We didn't realize that. But we are sorry; public comment periods don't mean anything anymore. We cannot condition, withdraw, or change the lease. And that would be it.                              {time}  1030  I don't think that would be good. I really don't. So, there may have been--and, again, I am not aware of the circumstances to which the gentleman is referring in the specific, but I believe that this amendment, looking forward to whoever is in the White House and whoever is administering these programs, would really preclude any part of the public from having meaningful comment and getting a meaningful response from the Federal bureaucracy which has proposed leasing in their neighborhood.  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
