 President, Senator McCain is here and will be seeking recognition momentarily, but let me suggest that this is not the most efficient way to move forward with the bill. We have been down this path before on virtually every measure that comes before the Senate. The most expeditious way to move forward is by agreement, not by the filing of cloture.  Having said that, I hope that once it is clear cloture is not going to be invoked, we can get back to the normal way we handle debate on these matters and therefore have a better chance of processing this very important bill and moving it toward passage.  I don't know if my friend from Arizona wanted to ask a question or wanted to get recognition.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to seek recognition, but I see the assistant majority leader is up, and I will be glad to wait on him.
