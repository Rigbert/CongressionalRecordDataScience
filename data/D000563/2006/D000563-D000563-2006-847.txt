I ask the Senator: If someone were to step back at this moment and say the Senate is debating a constitutional amendment, which everyone concedes will not pass, we are going to spend the whole week on it, and this issue ranks 33rd on the list of priorities of the American people, the States are already dealing with it directly, they have spoken to this through a variety of constitutional amendments and referenda in each and every State, virtually every State, I ask the Senator from Nevada, does that lead to the conclusion the cynicism the American people feel toward Congress and the leadership, the Republican leadership, in this Senate has been verified by the agenda we are dealing with this week?
