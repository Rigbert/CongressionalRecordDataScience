 I am not so sure it would be a great idea for the leadership of the Democrat and Republican Party to decide who represents the Independent political movement in this country, of which there are more of than there are Democrats and Republicans. But having said that, I thank the gentlewoman for her efforts.  I would say this, Mr. Chairman. As a strong supporter of Shays-Meehan, and understanding that I would go further, but I think that is the likely legislation that might pass and I will support it, the main point that we have got to understand is the American people know very, very well today that the political process in Congress and throughout this country is controlled by big money interests who make huge contributions to both political parties.  Just this past week we know that the Republican Party held a fund-raising dinner in Washington for some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in America and they walked away with $11 million in one night. And, of course, the Democratic party, maybe not quite so successfully, tries hard to do the same thing.  Mr. Chairman, sometimes I think people think that when we talk about campaign finance reform this is an inside-the-beltway issue; that it is something esoteric; that it does not affect them. Wrong. Campaign finance reform is an issue which affects every American in every aspect of public policy.  This week the Republican leadership in the Senate killed legislation that would have required the tobacco industry to compensate our society for the death and disease it has created. Was there some connection between the defeat of this legislation and the many millions of dollars in soft money that went to the Republican Party from the tobacco interest? I think one has got to be very naive not to see the connection.  Mr. Chairman, Americans, people in our country, pay more money than any other people in the industrialized world for prescription drugs, and the Federal Government continues to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical industry. Is there any connection between the $18 million that the drug companies have provided to both political parties since 1991 and the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs in this country? Once again, one would have to be very naive not to see the connection.  Mr. Chairman, this Congress continues to spend billions of dollars for weapons that we do not need, including B-2 bombers that cost us over $2 billion a plane. Meanwhile, we cut back on health care, education, desperately-needed housing, Medicare, Medicaid, and many other programs that ordinary Americans need. Is there a connection between the fact that the aerospace industry and military contractors contributed $5 million during the 1996 election cycle to the high rate of military spending? I think, again, you have got to be naive.  Last year, Mr. Chairman, in the budget bill passed by this Congress, we provided huge tax breaks to some of the largest corporations and wealthiest people in America. Meanwhile, and this is an important point to be heard, the wealthiest one quarter of 1 percent contributed over 80 percent of all campaign contributions. Should we be shocked that, having received all ofthis money from the richest people in America, Congress decided that most of the tax breaks would go to the very rich while, at the same time, we cut back on Medicare?  Mr. Chairman, we have heard a whole lot about the role that labor unions play in the political process. Do they contribute a lot of money? Yes, they do. But let us not forget that in the 1995-1996 election cycle corporations and groups and individuals representing business interests outspent labor 11 to 1.
