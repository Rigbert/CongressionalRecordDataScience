Mr. Speaker, I thank all of those who have supported this bill through an incredibly arduous process, as well as for the kind and important comments that were made on the floor.  Mr. Speaker, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act contains several mutually reinforcing provisions, probably two most notable of which are reforms to the United States criminal law to provide severe punishment, up to life imprisonment in the worse cases, for criminals who buy and sell human beings or who profit from the deliberate, premeditated and repeated rape of women and children. This includes people who recruit, transport, purchase, and sell these innocent victims as well as those who manage or share in the proceeds of trafficking enterprises. And of equal importance the bill establishes preventive programs, and provides real, tangible protections for the victims.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we cannot wait one more day to begin saving these millions of women and children who are forced every day to submit to the most atrocious offenses against their persons and against their dignity as human beings. I urge unanimous support for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.
