Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I congratulate the gentleman from California on a very thoughtful amendment. Actually, I am having a personal experience with this right now. Since we have discovered we have a major fault off of southern Oregon, the Corps has decided that they need to come back in and bore and reevaluate the dams on my Willamette River system. This should be, I would think, a pretty routine thing for the Corps.  I asked: Why do you have to do that?  They said: Back when we built those dams, we didn't know about it, and we aren't really quite sure of their seismic stability.  I think there are probably many, many, many other Corps projects in California, Oregon, and elsewhere that need that kind of scrutiny; so what the gentleman is doing is shining a light on a problem. As I mentioned earlier, the Corps has a $2.5 billion backlog on O&M. This will come out of the O&M budget. I am happy to send this mandate to the Corps.  In revisiting my objections to the bill yesterday, which is going to cause me to vote against the bill, underspending the tax which is levied on all imported goods--paid for by all Americans who buy imported goods--and diverting that money to other programs when the Corps has critical needs like this is stupid. I really regret, again, that my harbor maintenance trust fund amendment was pulled out of the bill, but this just underlines the need for the Corps to have more resources.  I urge a positive vote on this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters).  The amendment was agreed to.                Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Quigley  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 114-794.
