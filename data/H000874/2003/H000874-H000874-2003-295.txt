Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Oregon and thank the chairman. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), thegentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) for a provision in this bill which I think is very important.  I represent three general aviation airports that are within the 15-mile radius of the White House. As a result, they were shut down. They were not shut down because they were not operating safely and fairly; they were shut down because it was the perception and the belief of those in charge of our national security that they posed a risk.  Obviously, they are all owned privately. They are not public airports. As a result, there was a very substantial adverse financial impact to many people, both who own the airports and who had concessions at the airports.  There is authorized in this bill $100 million for the purpose of, both at National and other surrounding airports, not only here but throughout the country, those who suffered damage as a result of 9-11 in a very real financial sense, for them to be not made whole, because that would be impossible at this point in time, but to be compensated for the losses they sustained.  I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) for their leadership, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) in getting this authorization effected. I appreciate it. I know they appreciate it. It is the right thing to do.  I talked to Sean O'Keefe, of course, who now heads NASA, but was deputy director of OMB at the time of 9-11. He said he thought we ought to do this. It has taken us some time to get it done. I appreciate the leadership shown by the committee to effect this. I enthusiastically support the bill and this provision.  In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary flight restrictions on the small aircraft of general aviation as part of its effort to make commercial air travel safer and to restore the public's confidence in the security of our Nation's airways and airports.  Unfortunately, while those restrictions were lifted for general aviation in the rest of the country, small airports in the Washington metropolitan area have continued to languish under binding restrictions on their operations. In fact, the only airports in the country that are closed to incoming and outgoing general aviation are Reagan National and the three D.C. area general aviation airports. As a result, these small airports, specifically College Park Airport, Potomac Airfield, and Washington Executive, are on the brink of financial ruin. These airports have been forced to nearly cease their operations, effectively, endangering the livelihood of their employees who have lost income and jobs and airport owners who have lost income and jobs and airport owners who have lost long-time customers and revenue. In speaking with airport managers at all three of these airports, I have heard their disturbing reports on loss of operations, reductions in fuel sales, and loss of revenue since these flight restrictions were put in place.  Lee Schiek, manager of the College Park Airport, reported earlier this year that flights in and out of College Park plummeted from about 1,800 per month before September 11 to 164 per month at the beginning of 2003, and 55 of the airport's 87 based aircraft have left for other airports.  There is no doubt that we must stem this tide of economic decline for general aviation. This industry is a proven, integral part of the nation's economy, providing vital services and economic stability to individuals, families, churches, hospitals, colleges, industry, small businesses, and communities. Aviation transportation in Maryland is a $1.3 billion industry, an industry too large and too important to be hobbled any further in an already weak economy.  Today, the House of Representatives passed the FAA reauthorization bill that will provide $100 million to general aviation to help alleviate the cost incurred in meeting security requirements and the revenue lost because of the interruption in operations.  The $100 million grant gives the Congress an opportunity to do for general aviation, small airports, and small business, and the independent pilot what we did for the airlines, large airports, and the insurance industry in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. This shows that we recognize the sacrifice that general aviation has made in the effort to make us more secure. Let's not forget: the Federal Government imposed the restrictions on general aviation, and the Federal Government should do its part to help ease the financial burden those restrictions have caused. This is a fair restitution that will start the process of a return to financial health of general aviation.                              {time}  1515  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
