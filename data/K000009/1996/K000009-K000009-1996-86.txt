Speaker, this Sunday, May 19, the Interracial Religious Coalition in my community will hold its Sixth Annual Honorees Banquet at the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo. The coalition is to be commended for its celebration of interracial and interreligious harmony and unity.  Four individuals who have contributed to the quality of community relations in our city will be honored at the banquet, Rev. Claude Christopher, pastor of St. Paul AME Zion Church; Joan Coleman, Toledo city councilwoman; Rev. Martin Donnelly, pastor of St. Martin DePorres; and Larry Sykes, division of business development and retail lending, Fifth Third Bank.  I also rise to commend the coalition for passing a recent resolution in response to current strife and loss of life in Lebanon:       Be it resolved that the Interracial Religious Coalition      called upon its Members to pray for peace in the Middle East,      pray for those who have lost their lives in the strife, and      to ask our government to stop the bombing on both sides and      continue the pursuit of peace.  The diplomats of Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and France brought together by the Clinton administration in Washington, DC, to arrange for monitoring of the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas would do well to follow their lead.                          ____________________
