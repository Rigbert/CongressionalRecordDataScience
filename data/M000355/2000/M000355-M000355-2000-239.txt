 President, it could be argued that we might even need ``Federal flag police'' to go around and look after proper respect to the flag under this amendment. It seems to me if we were going to take it seriously and amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years and enshrine this in the Constitution, presumably we would take this as a serious matter.
