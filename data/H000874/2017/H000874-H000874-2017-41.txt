 Mr. McCARTHY. My friend is correct on a lot, but understand one thing. In this job and when we run, we are passionate about our beliefs. My parents always told me: If you can't handle the heat, you probably shouldn't run.  But the one thing that should happen here is, if we want to come to a conclusion, just as you and I and my good friend sat yesterday in my office talking with the White House on our concerns about the hurricane that came to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, the only way you solve a problem is you come together. The only way you come together is you show up in the meetings and you can air your differences.  But at the end of the day, when we walk into this House, we don't walk in as Democrats or Republicans. We walk in as an American. It is about time we put the people before politics.  We have got a shorter time to do our job. I look forward to seeing people here Monday. I look forward to seeing us get our work done.
