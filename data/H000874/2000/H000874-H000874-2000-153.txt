Chairman, I say to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), I understand the importance of county money laundering efforts at the State and local level, and the role the grant program plays in those efforts.  As the gentlewoman knows, I supported her amendment on the House floor last year that provided the initial funding for this program, and she has, and will have, my continued support.  I share her concerns about this particular report language, and I will work with her to make sure it gets corrected in the conference report.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).
