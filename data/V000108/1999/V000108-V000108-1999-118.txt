Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to commend the members of the Gary, Indiana, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). On Friday, May 21, 1999, the Gary NAACP will hold its 36th Annual Life Membership Banquet and Scholarship Dinner at the St. Timothy Community Church in Gary, Indiana.  This annual event is a major fundraiser for the Gary branch of the NAACP. The funds generated through this activity, and others like it, go directly to the organization's needed programs and advocacy efforts. In addition, the dinner serves to update and keep the community aware of the activities, accomplishments, and accolades of the local and national chapters of the NAACP on an annual basis.  The featured speaker at this gala event will be South Carolina's Congressman James E. Clyburn. Representative Clyburn represents the 6th Congressional District of South Carolina and was first elected to Congress in November of 1992. He currently serves as the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and is a Life Member of the NAACP.  This year the Gary NAACP will honor five outstanding leaders for their efforts to further equality in society. Joining more than five hundred outstanding civil, community, and religious leaders of the region, the following distinguished individuals will be inducted as life members of the Gary NAACP: Louise Lee, Foster Stephens, and Father Pat Gaza of Gary, Indiana; James Sudlek of Hammond, Indiana; and Joyce Washington of Calumet City, Illinois.  The Gary NAACP was organized in 1915 by a group of residents that felt there was a need for an organization that would monitor and defend the rights of African-Americans in Northwest Indiana. The national organization, of which the Gary branch is a member, focuses on providing better and more positive ways of addressing the important issues facing minorities in social and job-related settings. Like the national organization, the Gary branch of the NAACP serves its community by combating injustice, discrimination, and unfair treatment in our society.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Louise Lee, Foster Stephens, James Sudlek, Father Pat Gaza, and Joyce Washington, as well as the other members of the Gary NAACP for the efforts, activities, and leadership that these outstanding men and women have utilized to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
