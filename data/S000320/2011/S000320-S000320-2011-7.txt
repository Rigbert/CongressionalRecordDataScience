 President, this past Saturday evening in my home town of Tuscaloosa, AL, there was quite a scoring event--I think most of the people in the Nation watched it--and that was between the No. 1 ranked football team in the Nation, LSU, Louisiana State University, and the University of Alabama. Senator Sessions and I were there. We had a bet that Senator Sessions and Senator Vitter initiated--and Senator Landrieu and I concurred with--on the outcome of the game. All in fun, but you know we all like to win.  This was a tremendous football game: no touchdowns on either side, five field goals, overtime. LSU won. I congratulate them. I congratulate my two Senator colleagues here today. It was hard fought between two great football teams, and today--people have probably seen me on the Senate floor a number of times--I have never worn the purple tie, but I have one on today because I lost the bet. We lost the game. I will not wear it every day, but out of respect for my colleagues from Louisiana: congratulations Senator Landrieu, congratulations Senator Vitter, congratulations to the people of Louisiana and to the football team and the coaching staff in Baton Rouge.
