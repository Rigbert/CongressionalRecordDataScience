Josephine Arnold of Portage, Michigan, for her nearly 30 years of distinguished service to the Portage Senior Center and the greater Kalamazoo area.  Jo began working with the Portage Senior Center in 1979 and was named its charter director in 1992 when the Portage City Council created the Department of Senior Services to give the senior center a direct link to the council. Since its inception 30 years ago, the Portage Senior Center has gained 2,000 members and currently has a regular daily attendance of 200 senior citizens. Under Jo's leadership in 2000, the Portage Senior Center became Michigan's first nationally accredited senior center and one of an elite group of 127 centers that have been nationally accredited. Throughout the years, Jo's overriding goal at the center has been to promote personal growth, health, friendship, and independence for area seniors and all generation participants. In addition to her career with the city of Portage, Jo has been an active community member as an instructor at Kalamazoo Valley Community College and as the activities director of Friendship Village.  Jo has been an inspirational figure, exuding friendship, generosity, and leadership in her commitment to a population often neglected by society. Her dedication to community development will be remembered for years to come and her example followed to continue to aid senior citizens in Kalamazoo.  Once again, I would like to personally congratulate and thank Jo Arnold for her many years of public service to the citizens of this great country. Southwest Michigan is truly a better place because of her contributions.                          ____________________
