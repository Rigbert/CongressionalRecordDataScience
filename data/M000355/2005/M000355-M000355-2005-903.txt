 COLEMAN. Absolutely.  Mr. McCONNELL. Did I understand the Senator from Minnesota correctly that he was posing two questions to the proponents of the Reid amendment, No. 1, whether intent was left out of the amendment on purpose, and No. 2, whether it covered Members of Congress?  I was wondering if anyone on the other side was prepared to answer the questions of the Senator from Minnesota.
