I was listening, and I think I can pretty well summarize why my colleagues are distressed about the demagoging going on in the reconciliation legislation.  We have to remind the American people that there was a mandate that went with the 1994 elections: Less Government involvement in our lives, balanced budgets, and to do something about the tax increase of 1993. In other words, let us offer tax relief and welfare reform and Medicare reform. That is exactly what we have in our reconciliation effort.  I really think that those who are trying to stop these major changes and the revolution from taking place are underestimating the intelligence of the American people. I would like to read a couple paragraphs of something that appeared just the other day. This was the day of the vote in the U.S. Senate of this reconciliation bill. This is a quote: ``I have been in this field all my adult life, almost 60 years now, and I have never seen a change of this magnitude.'' This is Richard Nathan, provost of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs. He said: ``This is bigger than Lyndon Johnson's Great Society because it is going to profoundly affect the American federalism and social policy.'' And then Jim Richley, a political scientist from Georgetown University, said, ``Nothing on this scale has ever been attempted before.''  I think that it is necessary to talk about the magnitude of what we are doing here. This is something we have been talking about all these years. This is something that we talked about during the campaign of 1994. And this is something that the President is trying to reject. He has come out and said he is going to veto this. It is very difficult for us to understand how he can talk about vetoing it when these are things he has talked about, when he ran for President of the United States on this very platform--welfare reform, reducing taxes, Medicare reform, balancing the budget. That is exactly what we are trying to do. I want to stick with this and not give in.  There is an interesting statement that was made just the other day by the President. I will quote that statement. I think this gets to the crux of where we are in this debate. He said: ``Probably, there are people in this room still mad at me for the budget because you think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think we raised them too much, too.''  This is exactly what we have been saying. If you were not for the largest single tax increase in the world--and that is not conservative Republican Jim Inhofe talking, that is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee when this was passed--if you were not for that largest tax increase that now even Bill Clinton says he was not for, and that was his tax increase, then you ought to support repealing part of that tax increase. That is exactly what we are doing with some of the tax cuts that we are suggesting, Mr. President.  I think that when you talk about the cuts, it is interesting that we have a President now who is saying over and over again that the Republicans are trying to cut Medicare and Medicaid.  I will read you another quote, and this came from the President in a speech to the AARP on the October 5, 1993, just 2 years ago: ``Today, Medicaid and Medicare are going up three times the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up two times the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare or Medicaid cut. So when you hear all this business about `cuts,' let me caution you that that is not what is going on.''  So there is the President saying--very accurately, I might add--back in 1993, that we are talking about slowing down the growth in the areas of Medicare and Medicaid because if we do not do it, the system is going to go into bankruptcy. He is turning around now and saying that which we want to do on the Republican side is cutting Medicare and Medicaid when, in fact, it is not.  So it is a very difficult thing when you are dealing with these moving targets, and you have a President that says one thing one day, has his polls around the White House, and he says something different the next day. That is very discouraging.                          ____________________
