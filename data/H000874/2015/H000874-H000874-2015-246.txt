 Mr. McCARTHY. But you also very well know, the votes in the Senate that just took place for the last 2 days were to bring the bill up. And that quote you gave from John McCain? He is frustrated because he would like to get on to the bill.  There are two different Chambers. If it is, as you say, a strong bipartisan vote over there, the only people holding up bringing this bill to the floor are the Senate Democrats. It is unfair to claim anything other.  They have denied for 2 days straight. If they want to make an amendment, if they want to change the bill--but they deny the American people the chance to even bring the bill up.  So let's be honest with the American people on where we are because nobody on this side of the aisle wants Homeland Security in any trouble.  We passed the bill early. We sent it to the Senate early. For 2 days in a row, the majority has asked to allow the bill to come to the floor, and for 2 days straight, the Democrats have said ``no,'' not even to debate it. That, to me, is unacceptable.  If you have a difference of opinion, you debate the opinion. But to deny the American public the chance to have that debate, that is unacceptable, and I will not stand for it.
