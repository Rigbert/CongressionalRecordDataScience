 In fact, if you look at the patents filed every day, which I look at as the seed capital of the future of this economy, a third of those patent applications are from very small inventors. They are from universities. We see every day major counterfeiters around the world taking our ideas and doing knockoffs. They actually come to your district, Congressman Rohrabacher, before they come to mine, because you have got that port down there in Southern California.  But we know how counterfeiting occurs and what the potential is in other places to cheat, and we have protections for our people against that.
