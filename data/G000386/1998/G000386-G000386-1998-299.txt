 President, the first amendment that I am offering today will simply place a counsel--a lawyer--in the National Taxpayer Advocate's office.  The purpose of doing this is to give the Taxpayer Advocate ready access to legal opinions and legal judgments, Currently, the Taxpayer Advocate must put requests into the Office of Chief Counsel.  In order to make the Taxpayer Advocate more independent, which is what this bill does, it logically follows that the Taxpayer Advocate should have its own legal counsel. This will guarantee it fast, confidential legal advice to help those taxpayers in greatest need. Because it is the taxpayers in greatest need who go to the Taxpayer Advocate.  The second amendment should not be controversial. It applies only to Iowa. It is only a pilot project. We created an identical pilot project in Montana last year. A nationwide project like this was recommended by the IRS Restructuring Commission. My amendment is only a pilot program and it is only for Iowa.  This project would simplify reporting for some Iowa businesses. It would give a try to a program that would allow them to report taxes on one form. This gives businesses more time to conduct business, and spend less time on paperwork.  Mr. President, these amendments have been cleared by the other side, and I ask that they be adopted by consent.
