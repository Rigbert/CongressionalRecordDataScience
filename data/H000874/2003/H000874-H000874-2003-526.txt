 Secondly, could the majority leader tell me when he expects the budget resolution to be scheduled for the floor? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I will say we will be as ambitious as I have seen in a long time in trying to bring the budget to the floor of the House, get the budget process done in an expedited manner. The Committee on the Budget is continuing to hold hearings with administration officials, economists and other budget experts; but we expect the House to consider the budget resolution actually on a schedule that allows us to have the conference report completed by April 15, as the Budget Act requires.
