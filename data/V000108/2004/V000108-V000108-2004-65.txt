These individuals, in addition to the other Local 599 members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long period of time, are a testament to the exemplary American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hardworking.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, honorable, and outstanding members of the Hammond Carpenters Union Local 599, in addition to all the hardworking union men and women in America. The men and women of Local 599 are a fine representation of America's union workforce; I am proud to represent such dedicated men and women in Congress. Their hard labor and resolute courage are the achievement and fulfillment of the American dream.                          ____________________
