 President, I am in support of the unanimous consent for the adoption of H. Con. Res. 361 making technical corrections to H.R. 2356 passed by the Senate yesterday.  Several weeks ago, I met with Senator McCain to discuss a list of 12 technical corrections to H.R. 2356. Of those 12 items, we were able to come to an agreement in principle on 6. After weeks of negotiations between my staff, and the staffs of Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, we have before us today the fruit of our labor. I thank them and their staff, specifically Jeanne Bumpus and Bob Schiff, for their hard work and persistence in making these minor corrections.  The items contained in this concurrent resolution are a compilation of technical corrections sought by me, and corrections sought by the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin. In fact, the independent expenditure reporting correction was raised by FEC Commissioners Brad Smith and Dave Mason and advanced by the staff of my colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin. I applaud my colleagues for addressing this technical issue and will ask consent that a letter from Commissioners Mason and Smith outlining technical issues with H.R. 2356 for the Senate to consider be included in the Record. Similarly, the correction to the citation to the Immigration and Nationalization Act was raised by the FEC. Shays-Meehan inadvertently cited the definition of ``advocates'' rather than ``lawfully admitted for permanent residence.''  These technical corrections clarify some other important points: Respecting the primacy of State law in financing State and local party buildings; continuing to allow members to transfer excess campaign funds to party committees without limit; ensuring that we do not change the rules for 2002 candidates engaged in a run-off, recount, or election contest; providing for direct member challenges to the constitutionality of H.R. 2356; and providing a sunset provision for expedited review in the D.C. court so that plaintiffs who live on the west coast do not forevermore have to come to Washington, DC, to challenge provisions of the act.  However, I remain strongly opposed to the underlying H.R. 2356 and believe its disparate treatment of individuals, parties, groups, corporations, and labor unions runs afoul of our fundamental constitutional rights. By singling out national party committees and chilling their speech at the State and local level, this legislation ensures the end of ``national'' party committees and the beginning of ``federal'' party committees. Further, the broadcast gagprovisions in the bill are not only unprecedented in scope, but haphazard in applicability. I will ask consent that 5 additional items be included in the Record which highlight the egregious constitutional and practical problems with this legislation.  Again I thank Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for their efforts on this concurrent resolution and commend the House for their swift action on this concurrent resolution.  I ask to have additional material printed in the Record.  The material follows.                                  Federal Election Commission,                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2002.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Ranking Member,     Senate Committee on Rules.       Dear Senator McConnell: You have asked for comments on      provisions of H.R. 2356 that appear sufficiently problematic      in enforcement or interpretation as to require legislative      clarification. We urge Congress to consider ways to address      these issues which could otherwise hinder our ability to      effectuate the will of the Congress or to administer the      Federal Election Campaign Act.       We note that we have had only a few days to review the      House-passed version of H.R. 2356, so the list below may not      be exhaustive of all desirable technical and clarifying      changes.       1. Should the Commission regulate Internet web pages or e-     mail as ``Public Communication''? The proposed new definition      of ``Public Communication'' (proposed Part 22 of Section 301      of the FECA [2 USC 431]) includes ``any other form of general      public political advertising.'' The Commission has treated      Internet web pages available to the public and widely-     distributed e-mail as forms of ``general public political      communication.'' Thus, the new definition combined with the      Commission's established interpretation of the FECA could      command regulation of Internet and e-mail communications.      Congress should clarify whether it intends for the Commission      to regulate publicly-available web pages and widely-     distributed e-mail as forms of ``Public Communication.''       2. Does Congress intend to prohibit state or local      political parties from making contributions to state or local      PACs? Proposed new Section 323(d) prohibits contributions by      national state or local political parties to 527      organizations other than political parties, ``political      committees,'' and authorized committees of state and local      candidates. Since the term ``political committee'' as used      in the FECA is limited to Federal (e.g. FECA-registered)      political committees, Congress may wish to clarify whether      it intends to prohibit state and local political parties      from making state-permissible (non-Federal) contributions      to state-registered political committees.       3. Does Congress intend to prohibit Federal Officeholders      from appearing at fundraising events for state an local      candidates? Proposed new Section 323(e) prohibits raising of      non-Federal funds by Federal officeholders, except for state      or local party committees or for the official's own campaign      for state or local office. Congress may wish to clarify      whether it intends to allow Federal officeholders to appear      at fundraising events for authorized committees of state or      local candidates.       4. Does Congress intend to exempt non-Federal amounts spend      on ``Federal Election Activity'' (``Levin Amendment'' funds)      from state reporting requirements? Section 453 of the FECA      pre-empts state law ``with respect to election to Federal      office.'' This provision prohibits states from imposing      reporting requirements additional to those of the FECA.      Section 103 of H.R. 2356 requires state and local parties to      disclose to the FEC non-Federal amounts expended for a share      of ``Federal Election Activity.'' Thus, these funds reported      to the FEC as ``Federal Election Activity'' would presumably      be exempt from state reporting requirements. The ``Levin''      funds must be ``donated in accordance with state law'' (but      not ``reported'' pursuant to state law). However, if these      funds are not reported to relevant state agencies, the FEC      will have difficulty determining whether they were      ``donated'' in accordance with state law. Congress should      clarify whether it intends to exempt non-Federal amounts      spent on ``Federal Election Activity'' from state reporting      requirements, or to require dual (Federal and state)      reporting.       5. Does Congress intend to repeal the requirement that      Independent Expenditure reports be received (rather than      ``filed'') within 24 hours? Just over a year ago Congress      revised the FECA to require that last-minute Independent      Expenditure reports be received by the Commission within 24      hours. Previous provisions required filing by mail, which      sometimes resulted in a several day delay in receipt of ``24      hour'' reports. Section 212 of H.R. 2356 would impose      additional reporting requirements for Independent      Expenditures. However, Section 212 appears to be based on the      pre-2000 version of the FECA and thus, presumably      inadvertently, would have the effect of repealing the      recently-imposed requirement that 24-hour reports be received      within 24 hours. Similarly, Congress should consider whether      personal expenditure notifications under Sections 304 and 319      of H.R. 2356 must be received or merely filed within 24      hours. (See item 6 below for additional comments on Sections      304 and 319)       6. Does Congress intend to repeal the requirement that      reports of Independent Expenditures in support of or      opposition to Senate candidates be filed with the Secretary      of the Senate? Section 212 (discussed above) in restating the      Independent Expenditure reporting requirements also omits the      provision in 2 U.S.C. 434(c) providing for Senate-related      reports to be filed with the Senate, and requires all      Independent Expenditure reports to be filed with the FEC.      Congress may wish to consider whether this change is      intended.       7. Are the existing and proposed new ``coordination''      provisions intended to be read consistently? Section 202 of      H.R. 2356 treats an electioneering communication      ``coordinated'' with a candidate or party as a contribution      to that candidate or party. Earlier versions of H.R. 2356      included a definition of ``coordination,'' but that      definition was deleted in preference to retention of the      existing statutory rule addressing ``cooperation,      consultation or concert'' (441a(a)(B)(i)). Congress should      harmonize the terminology between existing subparagraph (B)      and proposed new subparagraph (C) of this section, lest      confusion arise as to whether Congress intended a common      regulatory standard to apply. Similarly, Congress should      clarify the relationship between ``expenditures'' addressed      in subparagraph (B) and ``electioneering communications''      addressed in proposed new subparagraph (C). We are also      concerned that the instruction (Section 214(c) of H.R. 2356)      that a new coordination regulation ``not require agreement''      could be read so broadly as to encompass virtually any      communication whatsoever (even `'disagreement'') between      candidates and persons making expenditures of electioneering      communications.       8. Does Congress intend to punish inadvertent solicitations      of foreign nationals? Section 303 of H.R. 2356 helpfully      strengthens the ``foreign money ban.'' It appears that      Congress intends to hold foreign nationals strictly liable      for violations of this provision. However, the provision also      prohibits ``solicitation, acceptance or receipt'' of funds      from a foreign national, read most naturally to apply even      when the solicitor is unaware that the contributor is a      foreign national. Thus, candidates signing direct mail      fundraising appeals could be held in violation of this      provision if the mailing list included the name of a foreign      national Congress should consider instead prohibiting the      ``knowing solicitation, acceptance or receipt'' of foreign      national funds. The ``knowing'' standard is distinct from      ``knowing and willful,'' thus, this change would protect      genuinely inadvertent solicitations while still      distinguishing between simple and aggravated violations.       9. Does Congress intend for the FEC to audit all self-     financing candidates and their opponents? The ``millionaire''      amendments (Sec. 304 and 319 of H.R. 2356) include eight      variables (two of which will change as often as daily).      Section 304 additionally provides for graduated increases in      contribution limits.       We are concerned that candidates who may be entitled to      benefit from this provision will be prevented from doing so      because of both its complexity and the lag time between      personal expenditures and resulting increases in contribution      limits. The complexity will also make it difficult and costly      for the Commission to enforce, likely requiring an audit of      every campaign in which this provision comes into play. (The      Commission currently has resources to audit approximately two      Senate campaigns per election cycle. At least twelve Senate      campaigns would have been affected (by triggering or being      eligible for increased contributions) had these provisions      been in effect for the 2000 elections.)       The distinction between primary and general elections could      allow wealthy candidates (particularly in states with late      primaries) to spend unlimited funds attacking a prospective      general election opponent during the primary without      triggering increased contributions limits. Similarly, wealthy      candidates might contribute excess funds during the primary      and carry them over to the general election, making      potentially unlimited amounts of personal funds available      without triggering increased contribution limits. Further,      the intended application of the ``gross receipts'' factor      (Section 316) is unclear: Are the gross receipts figures from      June 30 and December 31 added together, or combined, compared      or applied in some other fashion? A provision with a higher      initial threshold, fewer offsetting factors, and a non-     graduated response (similar to the House provision) might      strike a better balance among the goals of aiding candidates,      limiting the size of contributions and reasonable simplicity      of application.       Finally, the provisions require candidates benefiting from      increased contributions limits to return unspent funds within      fifty days of the election. However, the bill requires      reports on the disposal of these contributions ``in the next      regularly scheduled report after the date of the election.''      For general elections, this date would fall only thirty days      after the election, and for many primaries, the relevant date      would be less than thirty days following the primary. Thus,      committees would be required to report on how they had      disposed of funds before they are required to dispose of      them. Congress should consider requiring the ``disposal      report'' in a report due sixty days or more (allowing fifty      days for return of excess contributions and some time to      complete the report) after the relevant election.       10. Does Congress intend to extend the Commission's      ``allocation window'' during the soft money transition      period? A floor amendment to H.R. 2356 clarified that the      national party soft money transition rule (Section 402(b)) is      not intended to allow parties to pay ``hard money'' debts      with soft money. However, the statutory provision allowing      payment of debts through December 31, 2002 would appear to      override the Commission's regulation which requires that      party committees make non-Federal reimbursements to their      federal accounts between 10 days before and not later than 60      days after expending funds. Congress may wish to clarify      whether it intends for national party committees to comply      with the Commission's existing allocation regulations      (including the 70-day allocation window) during the      transition period.       11. Does Congress intend for the expedited Judicial Review      and exclusive jurisdiction provisions of Section 403 to apply      in perpetuity? Section 403 provides for a special three-judge      District Court panel and expedited appeal to the Supreme      Court for any constitutional challenge to the Act. However,      by not limiting the provision to initial challenges (brought      within a specified period), Section 403 would require      convening of a three-judge panel and expedited appeal to the      Supreme Court for actions filed years in the future. All such      future challenges would have to be filed only in the District      of Columbia, and circuit court review would be permanently      foreclosed. Special FECA procedures governing constitutional      challenges enacted in 1971 and 1974 have been employed in the      Third Circuit and District of Columbia in the past two years.      Congress may wish to set a time limit for these special      judicial review provisions and allow normal judicial      procedures to govern constitutional claims raised in      subsequent years.           Sincerely,     David M. Mason,       Chairman.     Bradley A. Smith,       Commissioner.                                  ____                 [From the Detroit News, Mar. 15, 2002]                  Donations Don't Seem To Change Votes                         (By John R. Lott Jr.)       A lot of politicians have been explaining the money they      have gotten from Enron. When U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-     Mich.), the powerful ranking Democrat on the House Energy and      Commerce Committee, was asked about the donations he      received, he said: ``when somebody gives me money, they, I      assume, are supporting one thing: good government. And that's      what they got, and that's what Enron got.''       In recently passing new campaign finance regulations,      public interest groups and the press insist that donors      supposedly only give money to politicians to buy influence.      There is little doubt that campaign contributions and voting      records often go together. But few mention that this      relationship might simply reflect that donors only support      candidates whose views they share.       Fortunately, there are cases where we can separate these      two motives. Consider a retiring politician. He has little      reason to honor any ``bribes,'' for re-election is no longer      an issue. Even if earlier there were corrupting influences      from donations, the politician would now have freedom to vote      according to his own preferences. Therefore, if contributions      are bribes to make the politician vote differently from his      beliefs, there ought to be a change in the voting record when      the politician decides to retire.       Yet, this proves not to be the case. Together with Steve      Bronars of the University of Texas, I have examined the      voting records of the 731 congressmen who held office for at      least two terms during the 1975 to 1990 period. We found that      retiring congressmen continued voting the same way as they      did previously, even after accounting for what they do after      their retirement or focusing on their voting after they      announce their retirement.       Despite retiring politicians only receiving 15 percent of      their preceding term's political action committee (PAC)      contributions, their voting pattern remains virtually the      same: They only alter their voting pattern on one issue out      of every 450 votes.       If anything, these statistically insignificant changes even      move in the wrong direction. Retiring politicians are      slightly more likely to favor their former donors. This makes      no sense if contributions had been buying votes.       The voting records also reveal that politicians are      extremely consistent in how they vote over their entire      careers. Those who are the most conservative or liberal      during their first terms are still ranked that way when      they retire. Thus the young politician who does not yet      receive money from a PAC does not suddenly change when      that organization starts supporting him.       The data thus indicate that politicians vote according to      their beliefs, and supporters are giving money to candidates      who share their beliefs on important issues.       A reputation for sticking to certain values is important to      politicians. This is why political ads often attack policy      ``flip-flops'' by the opponent--if a politician merely tells      people what they want to hear, voters lack assurance that he      will vote for and push that policy when he no longer faces      re-election. Voters instead trust politicians who show a      genuine passion for the issues.       If donations were really necessary to keep politicians in      line, why would individual donors ever give money to a      politician who is running for office for the last time? If      politicians simply took positions to get elected, why would      voters ever elect such a politician who would then be able to      vote anyway that he likes?       Proponents of campaign finance reform have managed to claim      the mantle of dislodging the entrenched political      establishment. But, in fact, the reverse is true: Allowing      large contributions is instead the key to letting new faces      into politics. Existing federal and state donation limits      have entrenched incumbents, who can rely on voters' greater      familiarity with them as well as use their government      resources to help them campaign and generate news coverage.       It is very difficult for challengers to raise numerous      small donations. Incumbents have an advantage here, as they      have had years to put together long mailing lists as well as      making a wide array of contacts. Allowing large donations      would make it easier for newcomers to raise a large sum from      a few sources. The long start required for fundraising mean      that if a candidate falters, it is virtually impossible for      other candidates to enter in at the last moment.       For example, Sen. Eugene McCarthy, nicknamed ``Clean      Gene,'' would--under current restrictive rules--not have been      able to challenge Lyndon Johnson for the presidency in 1968.      He relied on six donors who bucked the party establishment      and almost entirely financed his campaign. McCarthy raised as      much money (after adjusting for inflation) as George W. Bush      has so far in the last election, but Bush has had to raise      the money from 170,000 donors.       George McGovern's 1972 presidential primary campaign only      succeeded because of extremely large donations from one      person, Stuart Mott.       Donation limits have reduced the number of candidates      running for office; cut in half the rate at which incumbents      are defeated; given wealthy candidates an advantage, raised      independent expenditures; increased corruption of the      political process; as well as led to more ``negative''      campaigns. More of the same will follow if we continue the      path of stricter and stricter campaign ``reform.'' The Enron      case is no more relevant to advancing campaign finance than      the hopes that new rules will somehow make campaigns more      competitive.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 15, 2002]                    Now, the Unintended Consequences                          (By David S. Broder)       It was a famous victory. The campaign finance bill now has      passed both the House and Senate and likely will become law      with President Bush's signature.       The bill has one great virtue. It will end the ugly and      indefensible practice of federal elected officials extorting      six-figure contributions to their political parties from      corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. it is clear and      definitive about doing that, and it will be effective.       Beyond that, the consequences of the bill the Senate      approved last year and the House passed early Thursday      morning are probably not what supporters have been led to      believe. The optimism of the backers is exceeded only by the      folly of the House Republican leadership, which must be      grateful today of fraudulent Republican amendments so nakedly      intended to kill the bill. Their tactics give hypocrisy a bad      name.       Still, parts of the bill are probably unconstitutional, and      other parts largely unworkable or unenforceable. As with      previous campaign finance legislation, it is likely to have      big unintended consequences.       For example, the Democrats who furnished the bulk of the      votes for passage may be dismayed to learn that in the view      of Michael Malbin, the widely experienced head of the      nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, the bill hands      President Bush an enormous advantage in his 2004 reelection      campaign.       Here's why: In 200, when Bush rejected public financing of      his race for the Republican nomination, he assembled a record      treasury of ``hard money'' contributions (limited to $1,000      per person) from family friends, Texas supporters and allies      in the business world. As an incumbent president, he can      probably double or triple his take, while at the same time      avoiding the spending limits that go with public financing.       No Democratic challenger is likely to be in a position to      reject the taxpayer subsidies, and in a serious contest, on      the accelerated calendar Democrats recently adopted, all the      Democrats may well hit their spending limit by mid-March. In      the past, the winner could turn to the Democratic National      Committee and ask it to finance waves of TV ads from its      ``soft money'' account at least until August, when the      convention formally made him the nominee and a Treasury check      for the autumn campaign arrived.       If this bill becomes law, Malbin points out, the Democrats      will have no federal soft money account; their nominee may      well be off the air and invisible for five months, while Bush      dominates the political debate.       Another unintended consequence may well be to shift the      flow of soft money from national parties to state and local      parties. Contrary to the impression left by many editorials,      this bill does not make all soft money contributions illegal.      The amendment sponsored by Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl      Levin allows state and local parties to receive individual      soft money contributions of up to $10,000 a year ($20,000 per      election cycle), as long as they do not spend the money on      ads for federal candidates.       Theoretically, one wealthy individual could drop $1 million      or more into his favorite party, by writing separate checks      to 50 state or local party headquarters.       You can call this a giant loophole or a wise provision to      support grass-roots activity, but it goes against the      centralizing forces in our politics--which have strengthened      not just recent presidents but congressional leaders of both      parties.       When the national parties do less for their presidential      nominees and their congressional candidates, those men and      women become even more individual political entrepreneurs.       It is perhaps not a coincidence that all four of the      sponsors--Sens. John McCain and Russ Feingold, Reps. Chris      Shays and Marty Meehan--are notable for their maverick      tendencies. It is likely this legislation will breed more of      their kind.       Finally, the issue the opponents of this bill tried without      success to raise its effect on the relative power of interest      groups and political parties. The most dubious parts of the      measure are those regulating ``issue ads'' that non-party      groups run during election campaigns. These provisions      implicate basic First Amendment rights of expression, and if      the courts find them unconstitutional, then the net effect      may well be to empower interest groups while restricting the      parties' participation in campaigns.       Interest groups are as American as apple pie. But their      agendas are, by definition, narrower than those of the broad      coalitions called Republicans and Democrats. It will not help      our politics to magnify the power of narrow interests at the      expense of the two-party system.                                  ____              [From the American Prospect, Mar. 25, 2002]   With Victories Like These . . . the Glaring Inadequacies of Shays-                                 Meehan                          [By Ellen S. Miller]       What a cruel twist of fate: campaign finance reform that      benefits Republicans and big money.       The Shays-Meehan bill is back-to-the-future reform:      legislation that takes us back to just before 1980, when      there was no ``soft money'' but still a huge imbalance in the      influence of the big contributors over the rest of the      population. Under the terms of the bill that passed the      House, the national parties' committees can no longer raise      soft money--the unlimited and unregulated contributions that      totaled $498 million in 2000. A very good thing, that. But      the tradeoff to eliminate this most notorious campaign      finance ``loophole'' will actually enhance the power of      wealthy special interests, for it loosens a whole series of      strictures on hard-money donations--and hard money has      already eclipsed soft. Total hard-money contributions to      candidates, political action committees (PACs), and parties      in the 2000 election cycle came to $1.8 billion, nearly three      times the soft-money total.       To ease shock to big-money politics, Shays-Meehan contains      three separate increases in the amounts that individual      donors can give in regulated hard money, plus a huge      exemption that enables campaigns to sidestep the limits      altogether. The first increase involves the aggregate      contribution limit for individuals. The legislation nearly      doubles it to $95,000 per two-year election cycle. The second      hike is in what individuals can give to national political      parties, which rises from the current $20,000 per cycle per      party committee to $57,500. Within these limits, the bill      also provides for another dramatic increase: the amount      individuals can give to House and Senate candidates doubles      to $2,000 per election.       But say that a self-funding multimillionaire candidate is      running for office, as is frequently the case these days.      Should that happen, Shays-Meehan raises the cap on individual      donations to that candidate's opponents from $2,000 to      $12,000. Another limit--that imposed on the political parties      for their coordinated expenditures to supplement the      campaigns of party candidates within the states--is lifted      altogether.       Politically, this provision could prove more unsettling for      the Democrats than for the Republicans. While only five of      the 19 federal legislative candidates who spent $1 million or      more of their personal money in 2000 won their races, four of      them were Senate Democrats--three of them newcomers (Jon      Corzine of New Jersey, Mark Dayton of Minnesota, and Maria      Cantwell of Washington) and one returning (Herb Kohl of      Wisconsin).       So who would gain power from these fixes? To understand      just how off kilter this reform is, you have to understand      one primary factor: Today, less than one-tenth of 1 percent      of Americans make a contribution of $1,000 to candidates, but      these 340,000 individuals accounted for fully $1 billion of      the $2.9 billion in hard and soft money that politicians,      PAC, and parties banked in 2000. Most of this money comes in      large bundles from the ``economically interested''--     executives and business associates who've been armed-twisted      into supporting a corporation's electoral favorites.       Under the new legislation, those bundles will only grow      larger. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona admitted to      being embarrassed recently by the disclosure that he took      431,000 from individuals associated with the now bankrupt      telecommunications firm Global Crossing as he argued their      case before the Federal Communications Commission. Just how      tainted would be feel if he got double that amount (allowable      under the new limit) from them the next time he runs for      president?       After all these years of struggle, why did reformers settle      for so little?       In fact, after more than a decade of seeing their more      ambitious ideas come to naught even as the amount of money in      politics grew exponentially, reformers and their editorial-     board allies felt that they desperately needed a win.      According to Derek Cressman of USPIRG (the only campaign-     finance-reform organization to oppose the bill), Kentucky's      Republican Senator ``Mitchell McConnell wore down the reform      movement by defeating stronger legislation year after year.      Legislators kept compromising and the watchdogs let them do      that.'' As a result, the reform package grew steadily weaker.      ``I can't think of any other legislation that's had a tough      fight that ended up actually rolling things back,'' Cressman      says. ``This bill could have passed easily 10 years ago.''       Speaking not for attribution, some reformers admit that      forward movement--even if only one small step forward--became      their goal. A second factor, perhaps perversely, was the      Democrats' growing proficiency at raising big money      themselves--a skill that may have lulled them about the      political ramifications of Shays-Meehan. Buoyed by near-     parity with the GOP in soft money fundraising, the Democrats      generally--and party chairman Terry McAuliffe particularly--     came to believe that they could complete in the hard-money      game, too. That made the bill's tradeoff between hard money      and soft money acceptable.       As the proposed reforms grew steadily more modest, their      appeal to the center and center-right grew. Moderate      Republicans in the Senate and the House took the lead and the      Democrats stood back to let them carry the fight. A seemingly      enlightened segment of the business community, some of whom      were executives tired of being dunned for six-figure checks,      jumped on the bandwagon out of their own self-interest. The      scope of reform dwindled until hardly anything remained at      all.       There should be nothing surprising in the spectacle of      White House Press Secretary Ari Fleisher trying to steal      credit for the bill on behalf of his boss. And why shouldn't      Bush sign it? Shays-Meehan favors Republicans. The GOP      outraised the Democrats in the 2000 cycle $466 million $275      million; and in just released figures for the current      election cycle, the Republicans are leading the democrats in      hard money $131 million to $60 million. Moreover, Shays-     Meehan certainly favors the incumbent president in his 2004      campaign. Bush is a hard-money dynamo: In 2000 he raised $103      million in hard-money donations for the primaries alone,      while sitting veep Al Gore raised a paltry $46 million in      hard money. Worse yet, signing Shays-Meehan helps to      inoculate Bush from the taint of Enron's political money.      Nonetheless, Bush taking credit for campaign finance reform,      notes Public Campaign analyst Micah Sifry, is ``like Harry      Truman claiming credit for sparking the nuclear-     disarmament movement by dropping the bomb on Hiroshima.''       But this dubious victory may hold the seeds of more      sweeping changes. One thing is certain: The kind of      incremental reform that the House has enacted is far from the      kind of dramatic change that can actually renew people's      faith in our political system. But passing Shays-Meehan at      least clarifies the challenge. For years, progressives have      endorsed public financing, specifically public financing that      covers both primary and general elections. The AFL-CIO has      long supported it, and recent converts include the NAACP, the      ACLU, the Sierra Club, and the National Organization for      Women. The small state experiments in Maine and Arizona have      shown what a huge difference it can make. Activists on the      national front are poised to move forward. The next victories      are likely to come at the state level in judicial elections.      Spurred by the American Bar Association's endorsement of full      public financing for judicial races, activists in North      Carolina, Wisconsin, and Illinois are moving to change their      state laws. Public financing of campaigns for the      legislature, though further down the road, is most likely in      Minnesota, New Mexico, and Connecticut.       Now that soft-money reform is off the table, it's time to      focus on the real deal.                                  ____          ACLU Campaign Finance Position Protects Free Speech   [Statement of Nadine Strossen, ACLU President, Ira Glasser, ACLU   Executive Director, and Laura W. Murphy, ACLU Legislative Director]       Washington.--Nine former leaders of the American Civil      Liberties Union today released a statement saying that they      have changed their positions on campaign finance and now      disagree with legal scholars, Supreme Court Justices and the      ACLU's long-standing policy to seek the highest      constitutional protection for political speech.       In their statement, these leaders argue that the Supreme      Court misread the First Amendment in 1976 when it issued its      ruling in Buckley v. Valeo, which struck down legislative      limits on campaign expenditures in a holding that reflected      many legal precedents and has been repeatedly reaffirmed. Our      former ACLU colleagues say that our opposition to current      legislation allows members of Congress to hide behind an      unjustified constitutional smokescreen.       We are untroubled by the questions they raise and believe      that it is they who allow members of Congress and President      Clinton to hid behind so-called reforms that are both     unconstitutional and ineffective. As long as measures like      McCain-Feingold or Shays-Meehan are allowed to masquerade as      reform, neither Congress nor President Clinton will get      serious about adopting true reform, which we believe lies in      the direction of fair and adequate public financing.       Just last year, we offered Burt Neuborne, a former ACLU      Legal Director and one of the principal opponents of our      campaign finance policies, the opportunity to argue his      position before the ACLU's 83-member National Board. After      hours of debate and discussion, Neuborne completely failed to      shift the ACLU Board to his view. Many Board members in fact      argued that Neuborne's position was in direct conflict with      the First Amendment rights that form the foundation of our      democracy. Ultimately, the one Board member who had offered a      motion to radically alter our long-standing policy withdrew      it rather than allowing it to come to a vote.       Yet our former ACLU colleagues persist, offering sweeping      proposals that would constitute a wholesale breach of First      Amendment rights and that ignore the real-world impact of      limits on speech. They speak approvingly of efforts to impose      ``reasonable limits on campaign spending'' without saying      specifically what such regulations would do. But when we look      at those consequences it becomes clear that current campaign      finance measures would do immeasurable damage to political      speech. The devil, as the cliche goes, is in the details.       A key provision of both McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan      would, for example, establish limits that effectively bar any      individual or organization from explicitly criticizing a      public official--perhaps the single most important type of      free speech in our democracy--when the official is up for re-     election within 60 days. If that kind of law had governed the      recent New York City mayoral election, it would have      effectively barred the ACLU (and other non-partisan groups)      from criticizing incumbent Mayor Giuliani by name on the      subject of police brutality in the wake of the horrific Abner      Louima incident precisely during the pre-election period when      such criticism is most audible. That prohibition would have      gagged us even though the ACLU has never endorsed or opposed      any candidate for elective office and is barred by our non-     partisan structure from doing so. Similarly, anti-choice      groups like the National Right to Life Committee would be      effectively barred from criticizing candidates who support      reproductive freedom. Yet such criticism of public officials      is exactly what the First Amendment was intended to protect.       In contrast, there are many reform measures the ACLU      supports that would protect and increase political speech.      These include instituting public financing, improving certain      disclosure requirements, establishing vouchers for discount      broadcast and print electoral ads, reinstating a tax credit      for political contributions, extending the franking privilege      to qualified candidates and requiring accountability of and      providing resources to the Federal Elections Commission. None      of these proposed reforms would run afoul of the First      Amendment.       Still, our former ACLU colleagues press proposals that      would inevitably limit political speech. We continue to shake      our heads, wondering how such measures can be regarded as      ``reforms'' by anyone who is genuinely committed to the First      Amendment.
