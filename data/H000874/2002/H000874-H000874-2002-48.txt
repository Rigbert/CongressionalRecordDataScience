Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.  Let me begin by recognizing the outstanding leadership of the gentlewoman from Florida. I am not objecting. She is a close friend. She is a close friend. I am a strong admirer. She has had an extraordinary career in this House, State senate, in the Legislature of Florida and her community. The cause of election reform has no greater advocate. She has been motivated not just by a conviction that it is good public policy, but also by firsthand experience of the indignities a voter can face.  When registration rolls are improperly maintained, when provisional ballots are inadequate and voting equipment is so obsolete it fails to register duly cast votes, indeed, Mr. Speaker, I can think of few Members of this body, perhaps the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) come to mind, but few Members who are as qualified to speak on election reform in uniquely moral, constitutional and American terms than my friend the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek).  Mr. Speaker, in less than 4 weeks this Nation will hold its first Federal elections since the November 2000 debacle. Mr. Speaker, I will include the balance of my remarks, but I want to say this. I want to say it to all the Members of this House, Mr. Speaker. We took a historic step last year in December and passed overwhelmingly election reform. Over 350 Members of this body voted for that. Some 5 months, 6 months later, the United States Senate passed a bill 99 to 1, passed it in April. April has come and gone. May has come and gone, June, July, August, September. Now we are in October. We are in a new fiscal year.  The 107th Congress is about to end, and, Mr. Speaker, we have yet to pass election reform. We have yet to pass the bill that arguably had the greatest impetus coming out of the 2000 election of any issue in this land, and that was ensuring that every American not only had the right to vote, but would be facilitated in making that vote, and that their vote would be accurately counted.  Mr. Speaker, I have had a lot of optimism that we are going to pass this bill. I continue to have optimism, but the hour is late. This motion is absolutely appropriate, and I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for making it. We have been working in private, difficult sessions, tried to iron out differences. The good news is, Mr. Speaker, from my perspective, we have agreement on 90 percent of this bill's major points.  Mr. Speaker, it would be tragic, but more than that, it would be disgraceful, if this House and the Senate adjourned sine die without passing this particular piece of legislation.  Mr. Speaker, since September 5, I suppose, when we reconvened here, maybe it was the 4th, we have done little. We have not passed any appropriation bills. The end of the fiscal year came on September 30 and went. We passed a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. We are going to pass another continuing resolution tomorrow, but we have not done anything of substance, Mr. Speaker. Neither this body nor the other body has passed any legislation of significance in the past 25 days.                              {time}  1330  Mr. Speaker, we will debate next week the issue of war and peace. We will debate how we extend the blessings of democracy and protect people from those who would visit terror and death and destruction upon them, their families, and their countries. Mr. Speaker, as we do so, let us hope that we also pass a piece of legislation which will say that in the world's greatest democracy that believes that all men and women are created equal and that in this Nation every one of them is entitled to have their voice heard and that in a democracy, that that voice is heard through the ballot box.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that you, I hope that I, I know that the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek) will work as tenaciously and vigorously as we know how to ensure that we will vindicate that right in legislation; in legislation which will extend to the States resources to give us the best technology possible, resources to provide training for those who administer our elections, resources to educate our voters, and requirements that we have a statewide registration system so that a voter does not come to the polls and hear, oh, I am sorry, we cannot find you on the list; and by the way, we cannot get through to the central office on our phone.  I hope this will be legislation which will ensure that everybody, irrespective of the disability with which they are challenged, will be able to cast their vote and cast their vote in secret; legislation which will say that that person that comes to the poll will get a provisional ballot; and legislation which will say and guarantee that election officials will be able to say to individuals, if the technology permits and an individual makes a mistake and that vote may not be counted, do you want to correct it? Do you want to correct it so that your voice in this democracy will be heard?  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time; but much, much more importantly, I thank her for the courage, the conviction, and the time that she has spent through more than 5 decades of public service to make this a better country.  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by recognizing the outstanding leadership of the gentlewoman from Florida, for whom the cause of election reform has been motivated not just by a conviction that it is good public policy, but also by firsthand experience of the indignities a voter can face when registration rolls are improperly maintained, when provisional ballots are not available, and when voting equipment is so obsolete it fails to register duly cast votes.  Indeed, Mr. Speaker, I can think of few Members of this body--Representative Brown and Representative Hastings come to mind--who are as qualified to speak of election reform in uniquely moral terms as Representative Meek.  Mr. Speaker, in less than 4 weeks, this Nation will hold its first Federal elections since the November 2000 debacle.  Nobody can predict with certainty how smoothly those elections will go.  After almost 2 years studying what went wrong in November 2000, I am convinced that confidence in this Nation's election system will not be restored until this Congress enacts meaningful national standards, and offers State and local authorities the resources to improve their election infrastructure.  I am pleased to report that Congress is on the threshold of doing just that.  Thanks in large measure to my colleague and good friend from Ohio, Chairman Bob Ney, we are closer than ever to enacting the most comprehensive package of voting reforms since the Voting Rights Act of 1965:  Reform that will require States to offer provisional ballots to all voters whose registration materials have been mishandled by election officials.  Reform that will require States to maintain statewide, computerized registration lists to ensure the most accurate, up-to-date rolls and minimize the number of voters who are incorrectly removed from the voter rolls.  Reform that will reward States for retiring obsolete voting machines--especially the notorious punch cards machines and their dangling chads--that prompted this Congress to act in the first place.  Reform that will require voting systems to be accessible for individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual accessibility for the blind and visually impaired, and allow them to vote privately and independently.  Reform that allows voters to review and correct their ballots before they are cast.  Reform that does not weaken any existing voting rights laws, includes meaningful enforcement, and ensures that every vote counts.  Mr. Speaker, this motion is intended to ensure that we on the Conference Committee complete our work prior to October 1, 2002.  Given the extraordinary progress the Conference Committee has made in the past 14days, there is no legitimate reason we cannot meet that deadline.  Indeed, given the larger context in which we operate, I would submit that this congress has a moral obligation to enact election reform before we adjourn:  Mr. Speaker, over the last year this country has committed vast resources to ridding the world of those who would employ the tools of terror to destroy systems of government that derive their legitimacy from the ballot box.  In just the past few weeks we in Congress have been challenged to contemplate the use of overwhelming military might to bring to heal one of the great despots of the past 50 years, a figure whose utter contempt for democracy and the people he rules is the only reason he has held power for so long.  As we consider such profound measures to extend democracy where it does not now exist and strengthen it where it is fragile, we have an urgent responsibility to do the same at home.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this motion.
