Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.,  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment offered by Mr. Smith of New Jersey: Page 78,      after line 6, insert the following new section:                  prohibition of funding for abortion       Sec. 564. (a) In General.--       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or      other law, none of the funds appropriated by this Act for      population assistance activities may be made available for      any private, nongovernmental, or multilateral organization      until the organization certifies that it does not and will      not during the period for which the funds are made available,      directly or through a subcontractor or sub-grantee, perform      abortions in any foreign country, except where the life or      the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to      term or in cases of forcible rape or incest.       (2) Paragraph (1) may not be construed to apply to the      treatment of injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal      abortions or      to assistance provided directly to the government of a country.       (b) Lobbying Activities.--       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or      other law, none of the funds appropriated by this Act for      population assistance activities may be made available for      any private, nongovernmental, or multilateral organization      until the organization certifies that it does not and will      not during the period for which the funds are made available,      violate the laws of any foreign country concerning the      circumstances under which abortion is permitted, regulated,      or prohibited, or engage in any activity or effort to alter      the laws or governmental policies of any foreign country      concerning the circumstances under which abortion is      permitted, regulated, or prohibited.       (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to activities in      opposition to coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.       (c) Coercive Population Control Methods.--Notwithstanding      any other provision of this Act or other law, none of the      funds appropriated by this Act may be made available for the      United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), unless the President      certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that      (1) the United Nations Population Fund has terminated all      activities in the People's Republic of China; or (2) during      the 12 months preceding such certification there have been no      abortions as the result of coercion associated with the      family planning policies of the national government or other      governmental entities within the People's Republic of China.      As used in this section the term ``coercion'' includes      physician duress or abuse, destruction or confiscation of      property, loss of means of livelihood, or severe      psychological pressure.
