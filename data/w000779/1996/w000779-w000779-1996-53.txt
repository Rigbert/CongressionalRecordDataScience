I have not reviewed the Indiana law, but I just cannot believe that Indiana law does permit these kinds of gag rules. That is all we do in this legislation. If the Senator is looking for a way to vote against what physician groups and patients all across this country have been calling for, so be it. I know the Senator has done a lot of good work in health care. But I cannot believe that Indiana law is coming out in favor of these kinds of gag provisions. All we are seeking to do in this legislation is prevent them as well.
