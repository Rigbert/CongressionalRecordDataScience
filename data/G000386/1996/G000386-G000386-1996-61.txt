''  General Powell said the military services were organized like a pyramid. He said, ``you can't just cut at the bottom. You have to take some off at every level so it still has the proper shape to it.''  Mr. President, that is Colin Powell talking, and he should know something about how the military is supposed to be organized. Colin Powell says we should reduce the number of generals when the force structure is shrinking.  So why are we adding brass at the top when the force is getting smaller? Someone needs to provide an honest answer to that question. I have not heard one yet.  If we keep adding at the top and cutting at the bottom, pretty soon the military pyramid will lose its shape. We will have an upside-down pyramid.  Congress must not allow its decisions to be driven by interservice rivalry. There has to be a better way to determine the right number of generals.  On July 19, I wrote to the President, asking him to intervene in this matter. He is our Commander in Chief and needs to take charge and show some leadership.  I asked him to delay this decision until an independent review is conducted to determine how many general officer positions are needed, based on real military requirements. I have never received a response.  I am afraid he's been steamrollered by the generals, just like the Congress.                          ____________________
