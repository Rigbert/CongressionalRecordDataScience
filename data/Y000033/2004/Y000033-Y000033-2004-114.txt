Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I will say, though, I am usually in favor of what occurs by State action, but what this amendment does, it allows the State of New Jersey to limit large trucks and twin-trailer combination trucks to the interstate system, not intrastate, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway, except when making local deliveries. It is amazing when you need your donors you allow a twin-trailer truck to arrive at the door but nobody else.  In 1999, the New Jersey DOT actually allowed New Jersey to ban, that is DOT of New Jersey, large trucks from certain roads. However, that was challenged in court by the trucking industry; and if I am correct, just recently, last week of this year, the U.S. District Court from New Jersey ruled that the New Jersey truck highway access regulatory system discriminated against interstate commerce and violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.  This amendment would reverse that decision; and, again, I would suggest that New Jersey use all the recourse through the law. Because to take now a case that has been won by one side of the argument in the court and now us, as a Congress, to reverse that----
