DIA employees who are part of DOD's tactical intelligence programs, which are outside the scope of the authority of the NID, the answer in that case would be no. So it depends. But if they are part of the national intelligence program, which thousands of DIA employees are, the answer is yes.  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that. What I do not understand, though, is what I thought I heard earlier on about the Senator's distinction between tasking and control. That does sound like control to me. The Senator from Maine is saying they can task but they cannot control. Basically, that sounds like control to me if you can move someone.
