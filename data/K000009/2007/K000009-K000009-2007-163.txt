Both will be honored at the inaugural ``Stand Up for Victims'' event on April 25, 2007, sponsored by Advocates for Victims and Justice, Inc. in Toledo, Ohio. The organization was developed by Mr. Pizza and Mrs. Coleman to assist crime victims and provide educational and prevention programs to the community. Advocates for Victims and Justice, Inc. also assists older adult victims of crime as well as victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Joan Coleman was the first Executive Director of the Toledo/Lucas County Victim Witness Assistance Program, initiated in 1990 by then Lucas County Prosecutor Anthony Pizza. The Prosecutor believed that the victims of crime and their families suffered needlessly through inadequate attention from the court system itself and deserved special attention as they navigated that system. Under Joan Coleman's able tutelage, the Victims Witness Assistance Program has grown to a staff of seventeen with offices throughout Lucas County.  A graduate of the University of Toledo with a degree in Education/Social Work, Joan put her experience as a community activist to work in establishing and growing the Victim Witness Assistance Program into a premiere service providing outreach for Spanish-speaking victims; assistance to victims of juvenile offenders in Juvenile Court; a crisis response team for short-term assistance to victims of domestic violence throughout the county, a three-part intervention in the local schools to educate schoolchildren about the effects of crime on victims, offenders, and the community known as the Victims Forum; Kids' Space for children of female victims of violent crime who could not appear in court without this free child watch service; Suburban Courts' Services to provide support and advocacy for victims in the Maumee and Sylvania court systems; and Victims Forum Peacemakers, a school-based program which teaches children the skills to combat bullying.  In an effort to fully address the challenge of funding for all of these services, Joan sought the establishment of a non-profit foundation. Advocates for Victims and Justice, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 to help retain and expand victims' services to meet the ever-increasing needs of the community. Private donations remain a vital source of funding for the programs which Joan worked so tirelessly and passionately to establish.  Those honoring her describe Joan best as they ``gratefully thank and honor the woman whose vision, energy, commitment and passion for victims of violent crime and their families has given many thousands of people a sense of acceptance and hope.'' More than just an administrator, Joan Coleman has accompanied thousands of victims into the courtroom remaining by their side. It is not unusual for victims and their families to remain in contact with the Victim Witness Assistance Program long after their proceedings have been finalized. This fact is the most telling tribute to this remarkable woman.  Anthony G. Pizza, was elected Lucas County Prosecutor in 1976 and served continuously until his retirement in 1996. In this twenty-year period, Tony ``endeared himself to the citizens of Lucas County as a man with both a huge heart and a passionate conviction that crime has no place in our community.''  Born in Toledo in 1921, Tony graduated from St. Charles grade school and Libbey High School, where he played varsity football and was class salutatorian. He attended Kenyon College and graduated from the University of Toledo College of Law in 1950. He and his wife Madlynn, married now 63 years, together raised four children and have six grandchildren and four great grandchildren.  Tony actually began his career in the Prosecutor's Office in 1951, where he served as an assistant prosecutor. Thus it can be said that Tony devoted his entire career as an advocate for justice on behalf of the citizens of our community. In all, Tony Pizza served our community for 45 years in the office of the Lucas County Prosecutor, an impressive tenure during which he often used innovative methods to fight crime. During all those years, he never let difficult situations or personal tragedy drag him down and his ``sunny disposition, leadership, and dedication to our community'' inspired us all.  Tony Pizza also understood the ability of his office to address non-criminal needs and causes. As one example, he successfully stopped the State of Michigan from building a hazardous waste dump which would pollute the waterways of Northwest Ohio by filing suit in the U.S. District Court.  Though retired as Prosecutor for a decade, Tony still practices law. His family remains paramount and he has earned the privilege of spending warm winters in Florida. The recognition offered him in the tribute describes this incredible man among men as ``a most deserving attorney and Prosecutor, as well as a uniquely blessed and courageous human being. `Lest we forget!' is the testimony inscribed on the Toledo Police Memorial. It also perfectly describes Anthony G. Pizza, mentor and friend to all of us privileged enough to know him.''  It is wonderful that the Advocates for Victims and Justice, Inc. has chosen to honor these two amazing people while they are able to enjoy the recognition and know how much they mean to the people of our community. I offer my personal congratulations to both Joan Coleman and Tony Pizza as they receive this honor, and my own heartfelt thank you to each for courageous and selfless service.                          ____________________
