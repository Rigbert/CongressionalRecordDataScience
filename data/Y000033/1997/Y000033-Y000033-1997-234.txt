Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 8, the Coral Reef Protection Resolution of 1997.  Interestingly enough, Alaska has the distinction of being the northernmost point in the Pacific which supports coral growth. A variety of corals live in the Gulf of Alaska, along the Aleutian chain, and in the Bering Sea. However, due to cold water temperatures, these corals are unable to create extensive reef structures.  House Concurrent Resolution 8 is noncontroversial and has broad bipartisan support. It deserves favorable consideration in both Chambers of Congress, and I urge you to vote ``aye'' on this important measure.
