Speaker, the Democratic Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity was launched to bring to the forefront of Congress' attention the everyday challenges of Americans living in poverty.  On Tuesday, the President sent us a budget that invests in meeting our greatest challenges: creating opportunity for all, an objective that all of us I think are committed to.  The budget expands Pell grants to make college more affordable and supports more apprenticeships and skills training so that young people and others can make it in America. It doubles investment in clean energy and R&D to attract more jobs while tackling climate change.  The President's budget expands access to quality child care and paid leave for working parents and provides children from low-income families healthy meals over the summer months when they are out of school, but are still eating, of course. It makes it easier to save for a retirement and provides a better backstop for when economic circumstances push careers off track.  Now, Mr. Speaker, it is up to Congress to craft a budget. I hope Republicans will work with us to provide the opportunities necessary to escape poverty, as Speaker Ryan says we ought to do.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, Barbara Lee, and her members of the task force for undertaking and focusing on this important effort.                          ____________________
