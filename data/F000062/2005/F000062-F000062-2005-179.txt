 President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I also acknowledge as well Senator Kyl's work in this area. It seems to me those of us from the Southwest or whose borders are in the Southwest have been beating this drum year after year. Sometimes we make a little bit of progress, but very often we do not. This is a very bad year in terms of the amount and the need.  So I thank the distinguished chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee. I always appreciate working with her, and this is one more instance of that.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
