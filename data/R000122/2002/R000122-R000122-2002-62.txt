President, today I introduce the Museum and Library Services Act of 2002. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Kennedy, Collins, Jeffords, Frist, Cochran, Levin, Chafee, Landrieu, and Dayton in introducing this legislation to strengthen museum and library services.  Museums and libraries are rich centers of learning, woven into the fabric of our communities, big and small, urban and rural.  Today's library is not simply a place where books are read and borrowed. It is a place where a love for reading is born and renewed again and again, and where information is sought and discovered. American libraries also coordinate and provide comprehensive services to meet the needs of their communities and people of all ages. They provide Internet access, family literacy classes, homework help, mentoring programs, English as A Second Language, ESL, classes, job training, and resume writing workshops.  America's museums bring wonderment and joy to young and old alike, encouraging discovery and celebrating our heritage and our heroes. Today's museums bring everyday objects, art, music, science, technology, and much more to life. Museums help us preserve our past, understand our present, and plan our future.  The Federal Government has a long history of supporting our Nation's libraries and museums, providing direct aid to public libraries since the adoption of the Library Services and Construction Act, LSCA, in 1956 and funding to museums since the enactment of the Museum Services Act in 1976.  The Museum and Library Services Act was enacted in 1996, reauthorizing federal library and museum programs under a newly created, independent federal agency called the Institute for Museum and Library Services, IMLS. The Museum and Library Services Act consists of two main subtitles, the Library Services and Technology Act and the Museum Services Act. Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and my predecessor, former Senator Claiborne Pell, were instrumental in the development and enactment of this law.  Under the Library Services and Technology Act, LSTA, IMLS funds four grant programs for libraries to improve access to information through technology, to ensure equity of access and to help bring resources to underserved audiences. These programs serve all types of our nation's 122,000 libraries: public, academic, research, school, and archive.  In Rhode Island, LSTA funding allows libraries to provide summer reading programs for students and participate in the Rhode Island Family Literacy Initiative that helps families with limited English language skills. Last fall, the Providence Public Library was one of 6 museums and libraries recognized by IMLS with a National Award for Museum and Library Service.  Under the Museum Service Act, IMLS provides funding and technical assistance to museums for preservation of museum collections, new technologies for exhibits, and general operations. Approximately 15,000 U.S. museums from aquariums to arboretums and botanical gardens, to art museums, to historic houses and sites, to nature centers, to science and technology centers, to zoological parks benefit from the IMLS's existence. Several Rhode Island museums have received IMLS funding, including the Children's Museum of Rhode Island, the Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of Design, and the Slater Mill Historic Site in Pawtucket.  The legislation we are introducing today is based on the testimony we heard at an April 10 hearing of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which I chaired, as well as proposals that the museum and library communities each crafted using a cooperative and collaborative process. We are grateful for their efforts to come together on proposals so the law meets the future needs of museum and library users.  The Museum and Library Services Act of 2002, which extends the authorization of museum and library services for six years, makes several important modifications to current law. The bill ensures that library activities are coordinated with the school library program I authored and contained within the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. It establishes a Museum and Library Services Board to advise the Director of IMLS, and it authorizes IMLS to award a National Award for Library Service as well as a National Award for Museum Service. The bill also ensures a portion of administrative funds are used to analyze annually the impact of museum and library services to identify needs and trends of services provided under museum and library programs, and it establishes a reservation of 1.75 percent of funds for museum services for Native Americans (a similar reservation is currently provided for library services under the Library Services and Technology subtitle). Lastly, the bill updates the uses of funds for library and museum programs, and it increases the authorization of LSTA from $150 million to $350 million and Museum Services from $28.7 million to $65 million.  I want to specifically highlight one other provision in the legislation. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2002 doubles the minimum State allotment under the Library Services and Technology Act to $680,000. The minimum State allotment has remained flat at $340,000 since 1971, hampering the literacy and cultural efforts of our Nation's smaller states. An analysis prepared by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee shows that it would take $1.5 million for our small States to keep pace with inflation. The library community has instead suggested a modest, but essential doubling of the minimum State allotment to $680,000. This will enable every State to benefit and implement the valuable services and programs that larger States have been able to put in place. We heard about the importance of this change from David Macksam, Director of the Cranston Public Library, during the April 10 hearing. I will be fighting to retain this provision as we work with the House to put this legislation on the President's desk for his signature.  The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has already taken action on a reauthorization bill. Last year, during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), I was pleased to work with Senator Collins, Chairman Kennedy, and others to secure funding for school libraries for the first time in twenty years. I hope we can also move forward on a similar bipartisan basis on a swift reauthorization of the Museum and Library Services Act.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work for its passage.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2611       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
