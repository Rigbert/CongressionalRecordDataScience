 President, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 743, the Social Security Protection Act of 2003.  The Social Security Protection Act of 2003 provides the Social Security Administration with important new tools to fight waste, fraud, and abuse. This bill would eliminate benefits to fugitive felons. It would prohibit benefits to illegal workers. It would eliminate the ``last day'' loophole in the Government Pension Offset. It would provide additional oversight of representative payees. Finally, the bill would improve benefits for person with disabilities.  This bill passed the House of Representatives in April. The Senate Committee on Finance approved the bill in September with a number of important changes.  In order to expedite passage of this legislation, Senator Baucus and I have worked closely with the chairman and the ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee over the past several weeks. The result of this work is reflected in the managers' amendment that has now been incorporated into this bill.  I have drafted an explanation of the amendment that has been agreed to by the chairman and the ranking member of the House Social Security Subcommittee, as well as by the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. I ask unanimous consent that the explanation be printed in the Record.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Explanation of the Manager's Amendment to H.R. 743, the ``Social  Security Protection Act of 2003'' as Reported by the Senate Committee                        on Finance, Report 108-176     Section 107. Survey of use of payments by representative          payees       The Manager's amendment would limit the scope and cost of      the survey and change the organization designated to have the      responsibility for conducting the survey.       As a result of the Manager's amendment, the Commissioner of      Social Security, in consultation with the Inspector General      of the Social Security Administration (SSA), the General      Accounting Office, the Committee on Ways and Means of the      House of Representatives, and the Committee on Finance of the      Senate, shall conduct a one-time audit of a representative      sample of representative payees who are not subject to      triennial onsite review or other random review under SSA      policy or law, as amended by this bill. That is, the sample      shall include individual representative payees serving one or      several beneficiaries; individual ``high-volume'' payees      serving more than several but fewer than 15 beneficiaries;      individual ``high-volume'' payees serving more than several      but fewer than 15 beneficiaries; and non-fee-for-service      organizational payees who are serving fewer than 50      beneficiaries. The cost of this audit will not be greater      than $8.5 million. The results of the audit should be      presented in a report to the Committee on Ways and Means of      the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of      the Senate.       The audit shall assess the extent to which representative      payees are not performing their duties as payees in      accordance with SSA standards for payee conduct. Such SSA      standards include, but are not limited to, whether the funds      are being used for the benefit of the beneficiary. To the      extent possible, the report shall identify which types of      payees have the highest risk of misuse of benefits, and      suggest ways to reduce those risks and better protect      beneficiaries.       In conducting the audit, the Commissioner shall take      special care to avoid excessive intrusiveness into family      affairs, including making appropriate adjustments to its      audit methodology. if some or all of the audit is contracted      out, such contractor shall be chosen with due regard for its      experience in conducting reviews of individuals and families,      as well as businesses and other organizations.       In the course of conducting the audit and preparing the      report, the Commissioner, or a designated contractor, may      make observations about the adequacy of payees' actions and      recommendations for change or further review. However,      determinations as to whether funds have been misused and/or      whether a payee should be changed must be made only by the      Commissioner. Further, those conducting the survey should not      provide advice, guidance or other feedback to payees that are      reviewed under this audit regarding their performance as      payees.       This provision authorizes and appropriates up to $8.5      million under subsection 1110(a) of the Social Security Act      to carry out this audit. However, these funds are      appropriated in addition to any funds appropriated for this      subsection under any other law. There is no intention of      reducing the funds that would otherwise be available under      this subsection to carry out any other projects.       It is expected that the Commissioner will carry out a      survey that is statistically valid at reasonable levels of      confidence and precision. However, if the Commissioner      determines that such a survey can be prepared for less than      the amount appropriated, then the full $8.5 million should      not be used. The Commissioner has the authority to limit the      amount expended under this provision to that lesser amount.      The Committees expect the Commissioner to carefully assess      the design of the audit to ensure that it is being performed      as economically as possible, while still meeting the      objective of obtaining information that is of sufficient      statistical validity to assist in increasing the knowledge      and understanding of the representative payee program and      facilitating its possible improvement.                             Effective Date       The report will be due to the Committee on Ways and Means      of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance      of the Senate 18 months after the date of enactment of this      Act.     Section 203. Denial of Title II benefits to persons fleeing          prosecution, custody, or confinement, and to persons          violating probation or parole       The Manager's amendment would substitute the following      ``good cause'' exception for the original provision included      in the Committee-reported bill.       Press accounts, hearing testimony and other information      provided to the Committees have identified cases in which      benefit continuation may be justified due to extenuating      circumstances. In light of this, the provision gives the      Commissioner authority to pay Title II or Title XVI benefits      that were withheld, or would otherwise be withheld, if there      is good cause in the following circumstances:       First, the Commissioner shall apply the good cause      exception if a court of competent jurisdiction finds the      person is not guilty, charges are dismissed, a warrant for      arrest is vacated, or there are similar exonerating      circumstances found by the court.       Second, the Commissioner shall apply the good cause      exception if the individual establishes to the satisfaction      of the Commissioner that he or she was the victim of identity      fraud and the warrant was erroneously issued on such basis.       Third, the Commissioner may apply the good cause exception      if the criminal offense was non-violent and not drug-related,      and in the case of probation or parole violators, both the      violation and the underlying offense were non-violent and not      drug-related. However, in such cases, the Commissioner may      only establish good cause based on mitigating factors such      as the nature and severity of the crime, the length of      time that has passed since the warrant was issued, whether      other crimes have been committed in the interim, and the      beneficiary's mental capacity to resolve the issue.       This document (which is to accompany the Manager's      amendment) also seeks to clarify two issues with respect to      current law. First, section 1611(e)(5)(A)(ii) of the Social      Security Act (42 USC 1382(e)(5)(A)(ii)) requires a law      enforcement officer to notify the Commissioner that an SSI      recipient has information necessary for the officer to      conduct his official duties.       The Manager's amendment deletes this information      requirement in (A)(ii) to clarify that a law enforcement      officer only needs to notify the Commissioner of the      recipient's fugitive status (or parole / probation status),      and the officer's duty to locate or apprehend the recipient.      This change is not intended to have any effect on the      existing interpretation or application of section 1611 and is      consistent with current practices and procedures.       Second, several recent decisions by Administrative Law      Judges have noted that neither     the current statute nor the current regulations define the      phrase ``fleeing to avoid prosecution.'' This report provides      the following clarification. If it is reasonable to conclude      that the individual knew or should have known that criminal      charges were pending, or has been made aware of such charges      by the SSA, then the individual should be considered      ``fleeing,'' whether or not law enforcement seeks arrest or      extradition.     Section 206. Penalty for corrupt or forcible interference          with administration of the Social Security Act       The Manager's amendment makes a technical correction to      address a drafting error.     Section 209. Authority for judicial orders of restitution       The Manager's amendment makes technical corrections and      eliminates the special restitution account created within the      Treasury Department. Funds collected through restitution      would instead be credited to the Social Security trust funds      or the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, as appropriate.     Section 210. Information for administration of provisions          related to non-covered employment       The Manager's amendment would strike this section.     Section 212. Prohibition of payment of Title II benefits to          persons not authorized to work in the United States       The Manager's amendment would make a technical correction      related to certain non-citizens and change the effective      date.       B-1 visa holders are generally aliens visiting the United      States temporarily for business on behalf of a foreign      employer. According to State Department regulations, the B-1      visa holder conducts business as a continuation of his      foreign employment. D visa holders are generally alien flight      attendants who enter into an employment contract in the      United States with a U.S. airline and who only fly into and      out of the United States.       Although these categories of visa holders are not      technically authorized to work in the United States, such      persons are legally present in the United States while they      are working. Thus, they should not be subject to the benefit      prohibition.       The Manager's amendment would also change the effective      date to limit the application of this provision to persons      with Social Security numbers issued after January 1, 2004.      This change would provide the Social Security Administration      the opportunity to develop the recordkeeping system necessary      to enforce the provision.     Section 302. Temporary extension of attorney fee payment          system to Title XVI claims       The Manager's amendment re-designates Section 302 as      Section 304 and adopts the House-passed provision to extend      the current Title II attorney fee withholding process to      Title XVI for a period of five years.       The amendment would also cap the 6.3 percent assessment on      approved attorney representation fees at $75 (indexed for      inflation), as provided for Title II claims under Section 301      of the bill.       With respect to the cap of $75 for Title II and Title XVI      claims, it should be noted that the cap applies on a per case      basis. (Concurrent cases shall be treated as a single case      for this purpose.) In a case multiple representatives, the      SAA should apply the assessment proportionately to each      representative issued a check and in no case should the      cumulative assessment exceed $75.       Finally, the amendment would amend the existing dedicated      account and installment payment provisions in Title XVI.      Under current law, dedicated accounts are required when an      individual receives past-due benefits equal to 6 times the      Federal Benefit Rate (FBR); installment payments are required      when past due benefits are to be 12 times the FBR. The      amendment clarifies that these triggering amounts would be      based on the amount of past-due benefits that remain after      attorney fees that the Social Security Administration paid      directly to the attorney out of past-due benefits are      deducted.                             Effective Date       Applies with respect to fees for representation that are      first required to be certified or paid on or after the date      the Commissioner submits to Congress a notice that she      has completed the actions necessary to fully implement the      demonstration project under Section 303.     Section 303. Nationwide demonstration project providing for          extension of fee withholding procedures to non-attorney          representatives       The Manager's amendments adds the following new section.                              Present Law       An individual applying for Title II or Title XVI benefits      may seek the assistance of another person. The person      assisting the applicant may not charge or receive a fee      unless the Social Security Administration (SSA) approves it.      If the person assisting the individual is an attorney and the      individual is awarded past-due benefits under Title II, the      SSA may deduct the attorney's fee from the individual's      benefits and pay the attorney directly--minus a fee to cover      the SSA's administrative costs.                        Explanation of Provision       This provision would authorize a nationwide demonstration      project to allow non-attorneys the option of fee withholding      under both Title II and Title XVI for a period of five years.      The SSA would charge a 6.3 percent assessment on approved      fees, subject to a $75 cap (indexed for inflation), as      applies to attorneys under section 206 and section 1631(d)(2)      of the Act.       Non-attorney representatives seeking direct payment of fees      under the demonstration project would need to meet at least      the following prerequisites: hold a bachelor's degree or      equivalent experience, pass an examination written and      administered by the Commissioner, secure professional      liability insurance or the equivalent, undergo a criminal      background check, and complete continuing education courses.      The provision would require the Commissioner to implement and      carry out the demonstration project no later than one year      after the date of enactment. The demonstration project would      terminate 5 years after being fully implemented.       The Commissioner may charge a reasonable fee to individuals      seeking approval for direct payments. Such fees should be      comparable to the fees charged to other professionals subject      to similar regulation.       The Commissioner should consult with relevant experts in      the area of disability policy and professional ethics      (including, but not limited to, experienced non-attorney and      attorney disability claimant representatives, disability      advocates, and organizations that develop and administer      examinations for the regulation of professionals) in      developing the exam and in determining whether other      prerequisites should be required.       The Commissioner would be required to submit interim      reports on the progress of the demonstration and a final      report after the conclusion of the demonstration.                           Reason for Change       The demonstration project authorized by this section would      allow the SSA to pay all qualified representatives directly      out of past-due benefits for Title II and Title XVI claims      and would enable Congress (in conjunction with the GAO study      required under Section 304) to assess whether such an      extension of fee withholding would increase access to      qualified professional representation.                             Effective Date       Applies with respect to fees for representation that are      first required to be certified or paid after the date the      Commissioner submits to Congress a notice that she has      completed the actions necessary to fully implement this      demonstration project. The interim reports would be due      annually, and the final report would be due 90 days after the      termination of the demonstration.     Section 304. GAO study of fee payment process for claimant          representatives       The Manager's amendment re-designates Section 302 as      Section 304 and modifies the GAO study.       The Committee-reported bill called for a study based upon      the potential results of extending fee withholding to Title      XVI and to non-attorneys. As modified by the Manager's      amendment, the study will now be based on the actual results      of such an extension as provided in Section 302 and Section      303 of the bill.       The GAO report would provide a comprehensive overview of      the appointment and payment of claimant representatives. It      would include a survey of all categories of representatives--     both attorneys and non-attorneys, as well as those who do and      do not elect fee withholding. It would compare claimant      outcomes by type of representatives. It would also compare      the costs and benefits of fee withholding from the      perspective of the Social Security Administration, claimants,      and representatives.       GAO would evaluate the interactions between fee      withholding, the windfall offset, and interim assistance      reimbursement. This evaluation would consider the effects of      such interactions on claimant outcomes, access to      representatives, and reimbursements to the Federal and State      governments.       Finally, GAO would make recommendations for any legislative      or administrative changes deemed appropriate. The report      would be due no later than 3 years after the implementation      date of Section 303.     Section 401. Application of demonstration authority sunset          date to new projects       The Manager's amendment would extend the demonstration      authority through December 18, 2005, rather than making it      permanent, and allow projects initiated by December 17, 2005      to be completed thereafter.     Section 407. Reauthorization of appropriations for certain          work incentives programs       The Manager's amendment adds the following new section.                              Present Law       The Ticket to Work Act directs SSA to establish a      community-based program to provide benefit planning and      assistance to disabled beneficiaries. To establish this      program, SSA is required to award cooperative agreements (or      grants or contracts) to State or private entities. Services      include disseminating accurate information on work incentive      programs (the Ticket to Work, section 1619 programs, etc.)      and related issues to all disabled beneficiaries. In      fulfillment of this requirement, SSA has established the      Benefits Planning, Assistance, and Outreach (BPAO) program.      The Act also authorizes SSA to award grants to State      protection and advocacy (P) systems so that they can      provide protection and advocacy services to disabled      beneficiaries. Services include information and advice about      obtaining vocational rehabilitation and employment services      and advocacy or other services that a     disabled beneficiary may need to secure, maintain, or regain      employment. SSA has established the Protection and Advocacy      to Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS) Program pursuant      to this authorization.       The Ticket to Work Act authorizes certain funding amounts      to be appropriated for these BPAO and PABSS programs for the      fiscal years 2000 through 2004.                        Explanation of Provision       This provision extends the authorization to appropriate      funding for these programs for another five fiscal years.                           Reason for Change       SSA cannot continue to fund the BPAO and PABSS programs      beyond fiscal year 2004 without an extension of      authorization. These programs provide essential vocational      rehabilitation and employment services for disabled      beneficiaries to secure, maintain, and regain employment and      reduce their dependency on cash benefit programs.                             Effective Date       Upon enactment.     Section 416. Coverage under divided retirement system for          public employees in Kentucky and Louisiana       The Manager's amendment would incorporate the House-passed      provision in place of the Committee's provision, and add the      State of Louisiana, as requested by its State Treasurer.     Section 418. 60-month period of employment requirement for          application of government pension offset exemption       The Manager's amendment would adopt the House-passed      provision with a revised effective date and transition rule.      This provision is effective with respect to individuals whose      last day of State or local government service occurs on or      after July 1, 2004. The Manager's amendment would adopt the      House-passed provision with a revised effective date and      transition rule. This provision is effective with respect to      individuals whose last day of State or local government      service occurs on or after July 1, 2004. The transition rule      allows State or local employees, who retire from government      employment within five years of enactment, to count previous      work within the same retirement system towards the 60-month      requirement. Such previous work must meet both of the      following criteria: (a) the work was covered under both      Social Security and the government pension system, and (b)      the work was performed prior to the date of enactment.       The Manager's amendment also consolidated existing      provisions of the Social Security Act in order to co-locate      the government pension offset provision with the provision on      which it is modeled, the dual entitlement rule for covered      workers.     Section 419. Disclosure to workers of effect of windfall          elimination provision and government pension offset          provision       The Manager's amendment re-designates Section 419 as      Section 420 and adds the following new section.                              Present Law       There are approximately 7.5 million workers who do not pay      taxes into the Social Security system. The majority of these      workers are State and local government employees. Many of      these government workers may eventually qualify for Social      Security as the result of other employment, or as the spouse      or survivor of a worker covered by Social Security. The      Government Pension Offset (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination      Provision (WEP) were enacted--in 1977 and 1983,      respectively--to provide more equitable treatment of covered      and non-covered workers.                        Explanation of Provision       This provision requires the Social Security Administration      to send a modified Social Security Statement to non-covered      employees that describes the potential maximum benefit      reductions that may result from the receipt of a Federal,      State, or local government pension based on employment that      is not subject to Social Security payroll taxes.       It also requires government employers to notify newly hired      non-covered employees of the potential maximum effect of non-     covered work on their Social Security benefits. The employer      shall obtain signed documentation of such notification from      the employee and transmit a copy to the pension paying      entity.                           Reason for Change       Organizations representing State and local employees report      their members are often unaware of the GPO and WEP provisions      until they apply for retirement benefits. The Committee      believes the Social Security Administration should utilize      the annual earnings statement mailed to every employee age 25      and over to more explicitly inform State and local employees      about the GPO and WEP. It is important that these employees      also be informed about their options to become exempt from      these provisions by electing coverage under the Social      Security program.                             Efective Date       Government employers must provide notification of the      potential effect of non-covered work beginning with employees      hired on or after January 1, 2005. The Social Security      Administration must provide the modified Social Security      Statements beginning January 1, 2007.     Section 420A. Elimination of disincentives to return to work          for childhood disability beneficiaries       The Manager's amendment adds the following new section.                              Current Law       A Childhood Disability Beneficiary (CDB)--sometimes also      referred to as a Disabled Adult Child (DAC)--whose benefits      terminate because disability ceased can become re-entitled on      the parent's record only if he or she is disabled within the      7-year period following the month benefits terminate and is      not entitled to higher benefits on his or her own record.                        Explanation of Provision       The provisions would allow re-entitlement to childhood      disability benefits after the 7-year period if the      beneficiary's previous entitlement had terminated because      disability ceased due to the performance of Substantial      Gainful Activity (SGA) and the beneficiary is not entitled to      higher benefits on his or her own record. This provision      would not apply to beneficiaries whose previous entitlement      terminated based on medical improvement.                           Reason for Change       Prohibiting re-entitlement to childhood disability benefits      after the expiration of the 7-year period is a significant      disincentive to return-to-work for a CDB. Many CDBs find that      the benefits for which they qualify on their own work record      are less--often significantly less--than the benefits they      received as a CDB based on a parent's work history. The      permanent loss of benefits on the parent's record remains a      major disincentive for a CDB to attempt to return to work,      one not addressed by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives      Improvement Act of 1999. Although this provision is expected      to affect very few individuals, the change will make a      significant difference for those individuals in their efforts      to work to the fullest extent possible.                             Effective Date       The provision is effective on the first day of the seventh      month that begins after the date of enactment of this Act.     Section 426. Technical amendments to the Railroad Retirement          and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001       The Manager's amendment strikes subsections (e)(1) and      (e)(3).     Section 432. Modification of the dedicated account          requirements       The Manager's amendment strikes this section.     Section 434. Exclusion of Americorps and other volunteer          benefits for purposes of determining supplemental          security income eligibility and benefit amounts and          social Security disability insurance entitlement       The Manager's amendment strikes this section.     Section 439. Update of resource limit       The Manager's amendment strikes this section.     Section 440. Review of state agency blindness and disability          determinations       The Manager's amendment strikes this section.
