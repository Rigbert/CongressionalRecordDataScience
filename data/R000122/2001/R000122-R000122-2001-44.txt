President, today I am introducing legislation that I believe is very pertinent to the current debate over managed care protections. My longstanding concern has been to ensure that the needs of children in managed care are not left out of the debate. That is why I am reintroducing the Children's Health Insurance Accountability Act.  This legislation sets the standard for what kinds of protections ought to be in place for children who receive care through health maintenance organizations. Specifically, this bill provides common sense protections for children in managed care plans such as: access to necessary pediatric primary care and specialty services; appeal rights that address the special needs of children, including an expedited review if a child's life or development is in jeopardy; quality measurements of health outcomes unique to children; utilization review rules that are specific to children with evaluation from those with pediatric expertise; and child-specific information requirements that will help parents and employers choose health plans on the basis of care provided to children.  I am pleased that the major provisions of this legislation are incorporated into the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patient Protection bill, S. 1052. It is difficult enough to have a sick child, but to face barrier after barrier to necessary care for your child is unconscionable. Our current system is often failing our kids when they most need us. It is this simple: if we do not have health plan standards, there is no guarantee that we are providing adequate care for our children. And when it comes to our children, we should not take risks.  Not one of us can deny that managed care plays a valid role in our health care system. Managed care's emphasis on preventive care has benefits for young and old alike. And HMOs have resulted in lower co-payments for consumers and higher immunization rates for our children. However, many questions have arisen about patient access to medical services and the consequences of cost-cutting measures and other incentives under managed care.  The Children's Health Insurance Accountability Act seeks to address these concerns as they relate to children. Children are not small adults and often have very different health and developmental needs. We should be sure that we are always vigilant when it comes to their health and well-being, not only in the context of patient protection legislation, but in other policy measures we consider this year.  I am pleased that this legislation is supported by a number of children's health and advocacy organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund and the National Association of Children's Hospitals.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1070       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Health Insurance      Accountability Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Children have health and development needs that are      markedly different than those for the adult population.       (2) Children experience complex and continuing changes      during the continuum from birth to adulthood in which      appropriate health care is essential for optimal development.       (3) The vast majority of work done on development methods      to assess the effectiveness of health care services and the      impact of medical care on patient outcomes and patient      satisfaction has been focused on adults.       (4) Health outcome measures need to be age, gender, and      developmentally appropriate to be useful to families and      children.       (5) Costly disorders of adulthood often have their origins      in childhood, making early access to effective health      services in childhood essential.       (6) More than 200 chronic conditions, disabilities and      diseases affect children, including asthma, diabetes, sickle      cell anemia, spina bifida, epilepsy, autism, cerebral palsy,      congenital heart disease, mental retardation, and cystic      fibrosis. These children need the services of specialists who      have in depth knowledge about their particular condition.       (7) Children's patterns of illness, disability and injury      differ dramatically from adults.     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.
