 President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, who is the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and who was a manager of the recent conference on H.R. 2854, the 1996 farm bill.  As the Senator from Indiana knows, we had a problem in Iowa in 1994 and 1995 with the Natural Resources Conservation Service delineating wetlands. It is my understanding that NRCS used aerial photography and soil surveys to review prior wetland delineations. In most cases, NRCS found additional wetland acreage on the farmland subject to this review.  This caused a lot of anxiety and uncertainty for these landowners. They had accepted the initial delineation, changed their farming practices accordingly and then, through no action of their own, received a new, more expansive delineation.  The Senator will recall that because of this situation I introduced a moratorium on new delineations until passage of the new farm bill. This moratorium passed the Senate by unanimous consent and was later accepted by the Department of Agriculture.
