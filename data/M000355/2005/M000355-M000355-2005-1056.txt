 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday, June 28. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then resume consideration of H.R. 6, the Energy bill, and immediately proceed to a vote on passage as provided under the previous order.  I further ask consent that the Senate stand in recess from 12:30 to 2:15 to accommodate the weekly party luncheons.  I now ask unanimous consent that second-degree amendments be relevant to the first degree to which they are offered.
