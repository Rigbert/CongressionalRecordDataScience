 President, I wish to thank and honor David Kris, who is leaving his position this week as the Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice, DOJ.  Many of us in Congress--especially those of us on the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee who work closely with the administration on national security issues--are very sorry to see David Kris leave DOJ.  As one of the Nation's leading experts on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, I will personally miss hearing from David, especially as the Congress moves to extend the sunsets on important provisions of FISA this spring. He testified with clarity and precision on issues of great complexity in all of his appearances before the Senate. I valued his insights.  Congress created the position of Assistant Attorney General for National Security in 2006 to bring together the intelligence and the counterterrorism and counterespionage prosecution functions of the Department of Justice. Over the past 2 years, building on the professional, nonpolitical foundation established by his predecessors, Kenneth Wainstein and Patrick Rowan, David has managed the National Security Division in what has been, arguably, the most dangerous period since the September 11 attacks.  Since David was sworn in at DOJ on March 25, 2009, terrorism investigations and prosecutions have been unfolding at an unprecedented scale and pace. Consider the following high profile counterterrorism arrests and prosecutions involving the National Security Division: the al-Qaida plot to bomb the New York subway system by Najibullah Zazi; the attempted bombing of Times Square by Faisal Shahzad; the attempted bombing of flight 253 on Christmas Day 2009 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab; the arrest and prosecution of David Headley, an American who helped plot the Mumbai attacks; and the arrest and prosecution of Hosam Smadi who was sentenced to 24 years in prison last year for plotting to blow up a Dallas skyscraper.  Under David's leadership, the National Security Division also played an important role in the investigation and prosecution of a number of significant espionage, export control enforcement, and leak cases. In the summer of 2010, David played a prominent role in the arrest and swap of illegal Russian agents. He directed the prosecutions of Cuban spies, illegal exports of fighter jet engines and parts to Iran, and assistance to China in designing stealth cruise missiles. During his tenure, the National Security Division joined the Criminal Division in prosecuting more leak cases than ever before.  David Kris joined DOJ in March 2009 after being confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. He had previously served in the Justice Department from 1992 to 2003 as an attorney in the Criminal Division and as Associate Deputy Attorney General.  I know that prior experience at DOJ served David well because once he was sworn in, he went to work right away to develop partnerships with the Intelligence community, the National Security Council, and Congress.  And I know David worked hard to ensure that the relevant agencies and entities were aware of the National Security Division's activities and that its activities were properly coordinated with the intelligence community and the Defense Department.  It has been clear to us that David made it a priority to ensure that FBI national security investigations were conducted in accordance with the Constitution, statutes, and applicable guidelines. David also expanded the number of oversight attorney staff in his division and, as a result, the division's oversight section exceeded its annual goal for national security reviews for the first time in its history.  I wish David Kris well in his future endeavors in the private sector. His replacement will have big shoes to fill.                          ____________________
