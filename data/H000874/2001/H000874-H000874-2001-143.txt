Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education regarding funding for the Pell Grant maximum.  I am happy to see that the bill fixes a technical problem with title I funding with ESEA and the Department of Education, but I am disappointed that we were not able to do the same with the Pell Grant maximum funding. In the final fiscal year 2001 appropriationsbill, the Pell Grant maximum was set at $3,750, a $450 increase over fiscal year 2000, an increase that will help millions of low-income students go to college.  However, because of unexpected growth in the number of eligible students, the fiscal year 2001 Pell Grant appropriation was $117 million less than the amount actually needed to support the $3,750 maximum.  Mr. Chairman, I had intended to offer an amendment to fix this problem, but was hesitant to do so without an offset. Furthermore, we had discussed this issue. It is my hope, and I think the gentleman's as well, that we may work together to remedy this situation as soon as possible.
