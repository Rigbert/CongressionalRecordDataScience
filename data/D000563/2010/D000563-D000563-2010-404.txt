 Is it my understanding that we have been debating this small business bill, which has come out of the committee the Senator from Louisiana chairs, for quite some time now? Isn't this the second week, or maybe even longer? Is it true the other side objected to a provision in the bill because it related to agricultural disaster assistance in a few States?
