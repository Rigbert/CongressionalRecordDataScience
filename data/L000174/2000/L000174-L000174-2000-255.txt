President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, I am pleased to introduce at the request of the Administration ``The 21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act.'' This bill reflects the continuing aggressive approach of this Administration and this Department of Justice, under the leadership of Attorney General Janet Reno, to keep the both the violent and property crime rates in this country going down.  Under the Attorney General's leadership and the programs established by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the nation's serious crime rate has declined for eight straight years. We are seeing the lowest recorded rates in many years. Murder rates have fallen to their lowest levels in three decades. Even juvenile crime rates have also been falling. According to the FBI's latest crime statistics release, on May 7, 2000, in just the last year, there has been a seven percent decline in reported serious violent and property crime from 1998 totals. Both murder and robbery registered eight percent drops, while forcible rape and aggravated assault figures each declined by seven percent from 1998. This is cause for commendation for the Attorney General and our Federal, State and local law enforcement officers, to whom all Americans owe an enormous thanks for a job well done.  This Administration has not rested on its laurels, however. Instead, the Administration has crafted the bill I introduce on their behalf today. It contains a number of good ideas to which the Judiciary Committee and the Congress should pay attention. Unfortunately, the Committee and the Congress has spent more time on symbolic issues, such as a proposed amendments to the Constitution to protect the flag and crime victims than to other concrete steps we could take to combat crime and school violence. Indeed, the majority in Congress has stalled any conference action on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice legislation, S. 254, which passed the Senate by a substantial majority in May, 1999.  The Administration's bill contains five titles focusing on various aspects of crime. Title I contains proposals for supporting local law enforcement and promoting crime-fighting technologies, including expanding the purpose of COPS grants by funding an increase in the number of prosecutors as well as police; authorizing grants to improve the technology used for investigations in underserved rural areas--less than 25,000 people; and extending the Leahy-Campbell Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act.  Title II contains many proposals for breaking the cycle of drugs and violence. Title III would promote investigative and prosecutorial tools for fighting terrorism and international crime. Title IV would reauthorize certain VAWA programs and provide other assistance to victims of crime and consumer fraud. In addition, this title contains important proposals to prevent and punish abuse and neglect of the elderly and other residents in nursing homes and health care facilities and environmental crimes. The last title would strengthen federal criminal laws to combat white collar crime, including in correction facilities and involving the theft of government property.  While I have concerns with certain parts of the bill, such as proposals for increases in mandatory minimum penalties, a new death penalty provision and broad administrative subpoena authority, I support many other parts, such as the Extension of Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act to assist law enforcement in Vermont and across the nation obtain bulletproof vests and stay safe on the job.  Again, I commend the Attorney General and the Administration for this important legislation and their efforts to keep Americans safe from crime.                                 ______                                       By
