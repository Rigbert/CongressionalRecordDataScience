 President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee particularly for his fine observation. There has been an effort on the part of some--and I am sure we will hear it again Tuesday--to say this is about insurance companies. This is not about insurance companies. It is about doctors, and it is about patients.  The AMA does support the McConnell amendment. I ask unanimous consent that a letter indicating their support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 American Medical Association,                                 Chicago, Illinois, July 25, 2002.     Re Medical Liability Reform Amendment     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: The American Medical Association      (AMA) commends you for your leadership and initiative in      offering an amendment to S. 812 (``Greater Access to      Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001'') that would bring      several common-sense reforms to our nation's broken medical      liability litigation system.       Many states in our nation are experiencing an emerging      medical liability insurance crisis. Due to large jury awards      and the burgeoning costs of defending against lawsuits      (including frivolous claims), medical liability insurance      premiums are skyrocketing. In many cases, physicians are      finding that liability insurance is no longer available or      affordable. The media now reports on almost a daily basis      that the situation has become so critical in some states that      physicians are forced to limit services, retire early, or      move to another state where the medical liability system is      more stable.       The most troubling aspect of our unrestrained medical      liability system is the effect on patients. Access to care is      seriously threatened in states such as Florida, Mississippi,      Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania,      Texas, Washington, and West Virginia. In other states,      including Kentucky, a crisis is looming. Emergency      departments are losing staff and scaling back certain      services such as trauma care. Many OB/GYN's have stopped      delivering babies, and some advanced and high-risk procedures      are being postponed because surgeons cannot find or afford      insurance.       Your amendment includes key building blocks to effective      reforms, such as allowing injured patients unlimited economic      damages (e.g., past and future medical expenses, loss of past      and future earnings, cost of domestic services, etc.),      establishing a ``fair share'' rule that allocates damage      awards fairly and in proportion to a party's degree of fault,      preventing double recovery of damages, allowing periodic      payment of future damages, and preventing excessive attorney      contingent fees (thereby maximizing the recovery of      patients).       In addition to these necessary reforms, we urge you to      include a reasonable limit of $250,000 for non-economic      (e.g., pain and suffering) damage awards, while allowing      states the flexibility to establish or maintain their own      laws limiting damage awards that have proven effective as      stabilizing the medical liability insurance market. Multiple      studies have shown that a limit on non-economic damages is      the most effective reform to contain run-away medical      liability costs. Such reform has also been proven effective      at the state level. We also urge you to include a reasonable      cap on punitive damages, such as the greater of 2 times      economic damages or $250,000.       By enacting meaningful medical liability reforms, Congress      has the opportunity to increase access to medical services,      eliminate much of the need for medical treatment motivated      primarily as a precaution against lawsuits, improve the      patient-physician relationship, help prevent avoidable      patient injury, improve patient safety, and curb the single      most wasteful use of precious health care dollars--the costs,      both financial and emotional, of health care liability      litigation.       The proposals in your amendment are an important step in      the right direction to strengthen our health care system. The      AMA looks forward to working with you regarding a reasonable      reform on non-economic damages.           Sincerely,                                        Michael D. Maves, MD, MBA.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Ohio in the Chamber. I will be happy to yield him such time as he may need.
