 We are not in agreement, Mr. Speaker. What we will be doing would be 180 degrees different. We would not be pretending that we are going to repeal an Affordable Care Act that has been a success.  We do not agree, Mr. Speaker, that having 30 million Americans insured that were not insured before the Affordable Care Act is a failure. We do not agree that people with preexisting conditions who can now get insurance is a failure. We do not agree that people who are 26 or younger being on their family's policy when they don't have a job or alternative insurance is a failure. We do not agree that Americans having the security that their insurance will not be canceled becausethey reached an annual limit is a failure. We do not agree that Americans having no lifetime limit so that if they have a catastrophic illness they will still have coverage--that is not a failure.  What is a failure is to have pretended for the last 6 years that they wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and have no replacement as of this time. That was a failure.  The President says, Mr. Speaker, that his plan is going to make sure that everybody is insured, comprehensive coverage, and that costs will come down. He, of course, Mr. Speaker, has now offered a bill to effect that objective. We would welcome such a bill so that we can consider it.  No, Mr. Speaker, had the 3 million additional people who voted for Hillary Clinton more so than voted for Donald Trump prevailed--the Electoral College prevailed, but the majority of the American people that voted, the plurality, voted for policies to keep the Affordable Care Act as Mrs. Clinton said she would do if she were elected.  So, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader is in deep error on we would be having the same debate. But he is right; we had an outcome of a party and a President who said they were going to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers stated: ``Let me be clear: no one who has coverage because of ObamaCare today will lose that coverage.''  The majority leader said something about the President saying, if you like your policy, you can keep it. In fact, the President was substantially right on that. Yes. Were there minimum coverages so that people weren't scammed by insurance companies saying you got insurance, but, oh, by the way, we don't cover that, by the way, we don't cover that? Have you seen those ads about, I bought a new car and I had a wreck a day later and, guess what, the insurance company wants to give me 80 percent, 90 percent, 70 percent less? That is what the insurance companies were doing. People thought they had insurance for something, and they didn't have it.  So Cathy McMorris Rodgers says you are not going to lose anything. Well, I don't know. If it was so bad, why don't you repeal it? Why don't you offer a bill to repeal it and to undermine all those factors of the Affordable Care Act that are now available to the Americans that I suggested?  President Trump--I said this, but I want to repeat it--said last month that Republicans were nearing completion of an ACA replacement that would provide insurance for everybody. Bring it on. Bring it on. Insurance for everybody. Let's see it.  He went on to say his plan would have lower numbers, much lower deductibles. God bless him. Bring it on. Let us see it. Let's vote on it. It is not on the floor, and I am not sure when it will be on the floor, but perhaps the majority leader could tell us.  My question to you is: When do you expect such a bill consistent with the President's representation to the American people of everybody having insurance and at lower cost and lower deductibles? When do we expect a bill like that on the floor?  I yield to the majority leader.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Since ObamaCare has passed and now that we know what was in it, you would know that there are 1,400 pages in there that give a great deal, amount of power to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Unfortunately, today, that Secretary has not been confirmed.  That Secretary has not been confirmed simply because of politics. It is not on my side of the aisle. It is on the Democrats' side of the aisle over in the Senate.                              {time}  1100  Do you know how far they have gone? How much do they really want to work on health care when you actually said it needed to be reformed? They wouldn't even show up in committee. So how much do they really care about Americans? They don't even show up in committee to ask the questions. They wanted to run and hide. So how much do they really want to work?  If we want to go quote by quote, when we go back to what President Obama said when the premiums were going to lower by $2,500, what do we say to Arizona when they went up 116 percent or to Tennessee by 63 percent and then three-quarters of Tennessee counties only have one provider or to Minnesota by 59 percent or to Oklahoma by 59 percent or to Alabama, 58, or to Pennsylvania, 53, or to Nebraska, 51?  Can we stop this rhetoric, and can we now get to work? Because I will tell you this: next month is when we begin because I am hopeful that we will no longer put up with the political games on the Senate side and that we will confirm the new Secretary because you have to have a Secretary in place if you want to reform ObamaCare, because you gave so much power to the Secretary. We all know that. So let's work together on behalf of the American people and end this pain.  I will tell you this: the unfortunate reality, in today's system, is that coverage does not always mean care. The deductibles are so high that many people don't even go to their doctors. I can tell you that in States, prior to ObamaCare, their high-risk pools were cheaper then for their care than now in just buying ObamaCare. We all know it is a failure. So let's stop playing the political games, and let's put the people before politics, and let's put a system in that works. Our door is open, and the committee is open for all ideas. Let's work together to solve it.
