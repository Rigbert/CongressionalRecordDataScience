Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate one of the most selfless and caring citizens of the First Congressional District of Indiana, Mr. John H. Betjemann. John has spent the past 23 years dedicating his life to promoting healthcare development and community service to all of Northwest Indiana. His career as President and CEO of the Methodist Hospitals in Gary, Merrillville, and surrounding communities has allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous people. In honor of his gracious service to his community, there will be a celebration of his accomplishments on June 26, 2003 at St. Timothy's Church in Gary, Indiana.  John Betjemann has accomplished many visionary goals throughout his career. He has focused his work on Neuroscience and Oncology medical services for diagnostics and treatment of cancer, brain tumors, and many other diseases. He has also provided Northwest Indiana with the Midlake Campus, which helps in the development services for children and new paramedic training for employees. He has also assured the identification of youth who are at risk of sudden cardiac trauma by providing high school athletic screening programs at no charge. Also in 1999, John established the Smoke-Free Hospital Policy to help promote better healthcare environments for the patients, employees, and visitors of Methodist Hospitals.  Along with the countless service organizations and programs that John has initiated, he has also been involved in many community organizations and projects. He has been a powerful member of the Horace Mann Ambridge Neighborhood Improvement Organization, which rehabilitates homes in the Northlake Campus area for low income, disabled families, and provides resources for repair and maintenance to these homes. He has also been a strong leader of the Adopt-A-Park Project, which along with IVY Tech, Gary Parks Department, and Lake County Job Training, helps to enhance Gary City parks by installing modern play equipment.  Along with his many other accomplishments, John has also received numerous community service and leadership awards. In 1988, John was given the Community Service Award by the Tolle-Mann Business Association. In 1995, he was the recipient of the Crystal Globe Award, which was given by the Asian American Medical Society. The Wellness Council also acknowledged him in 2000 for implementing the Health Institute.  Mr. Speaker, John has given his time and efforts selflessly to his employees and patients throughout his years of service. He has taught every member of his staff the true meaning of service to all members of the Northwest Indiana community. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. John Betjemann for his outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District. I am proud to commend him for his lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
