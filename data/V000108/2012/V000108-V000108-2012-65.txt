Chairman, and I also rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  Our country really does need a diversified energy portfolio. Nuclear is part of that. Almost a quarter of all of our electrical power today is generated through nuclear power. It is carbon free, and I do not think this is the time to withdraw research support.  In light of, particularly, the tragedy in Japan, the safety of our existing fleet and progress as far as improved technologies is vital.  And, again, I would add my voice to that in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed.                              {time}  1420  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:                 Fossil Energy Research and Development       For necessary expenses in carrying out fossil energy      research and development activities, under the authority of      the Department of Energy Organization Act (Public Law 95-91),      including the acquisition of interest, including defeasible      and equitable interests in any real property or any facility      or for plant or facility acquisition or expansion, and for      conducting inquiries, technological investigations and      research concerning the extraction, processing, use, and      disposal of mineral substances without objectionable social      and environmental costs (30 U.S.C. 3, 1602, and 1603),      $554,000,000, to remain available until expended: Provided,      That of such amount, $115,753,000 shall be available until      September 30, 2014, for program direction: Provided further,      That for all programs funded under Fossil Energy      appropriations in this Act or any other Act, the Secretary of      Energy may vest fee title or other property interests      acquired under projects in any entity, including the United      States.                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Hirono
