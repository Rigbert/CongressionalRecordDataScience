 Under my amendment, the FDA can still use the current radura symbol and the disclosure statement. No information would be hidden from consumers. In the same manner that the FDA alerts purchasers to the presence of allergens, the FDA has the ability to inform consumers of the use of food irradiation. I also want to emphasize that this modest labeling improvement does not diminish the need for the FDA, USDA, the food industry, and consumer groups to work together to improve the public's understanding of how food irradiation works and its potential benefits to public health.  Mr. President, I believe that the inclusion of these amendments in S. 830 demonstrates the U.S. Senate's interest in food safety and effective labeling. Again, I greatly appreciate the consideration that the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources have given to these targeted food labeling reforms.                               Exhibit 1        [From the New England Journal of Medicine, May 29, 1997]         Cyclosporiasis and Raspberries--Lessons for the Future                       (By Michael T. Osterholm)       One hundred years ago, Osler observed that to know syphilis      was to know clinical medicine. Today, to know and appreciate      the many clinical, microbiologic, and public health aspects      of the outbreak of cyclosporiasis associated with raspberries      that Herwaldt and colleagues describe in this issue of the      Journal \1\ is to know foodborne disease in the modern world.      The investigation conducted by Herwaldt et al. illustrates      the changing epidemiologic characteristics of foodborne      disease in this country.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Footnotes at end of article.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Two of the key factors that have contributed to these      changes are the substantial alterations in the American diet      over the past two decades and the globalization of the food      supply.\2\ Although the promotion of a ``heart-healthy'' diet      (high consumption of fruits and vegetables and low      consumption of fat) may be improving cardiovascular health,      it has led to a new range of problems for the      gastrointestinal tract. Infectious-disease specialists      frequently remind persons traveling to developing countries      to reduce the risk of traveler's diarrhea by eating only      foods that can be boiled or peeled. Yet seasonally, up to 70      percent of selected fruits and vegetables consumed in this      country come from developing countries. One does not need to      leave home to contract traveler's diarrhea caused by an      exotic agent. Although produce from U.S. growers is also a      source of pathogens, fruits and vegetables from developing      countries are cause for additional concern. Many developing      countries are just entering the global produce market. The      first raspberry vine was planted in Guatemala in 1987, yet      approximately 20 percent of all fresh raspberries sold in May      1996 in the United States came from Guatemala.       Emerging or reemerging infectious agents are another factor      associated with the changing epidemiologic characteristics of      foodborne disease. Cyclospora cavetanensis is such an agent.      When an emerging foodborne agent is first recognized, there      are typically many unanswered questions about the      epidemiologic characteristics of the infection and its      prevention. Furthermore, clinicians need to be aware of the      clinical presentations associated with new agents. For      example, a patient presenting with a diarrheal illness of      five or more days' duration, severe fatigue, and loss of      appetite should be evaluated for cyclosporiasis regardless of      whether the patient has traveled to a foreign country or      consumed contaminated water. Clinical laboratories now need      to be proficient at performing routine examinations for a      wide variety of emerging agents. Moreover, public health      officials need to be aware of the importance of initiating      and maintaining population-based surveillance for these types      of agents. Today, the resources for conducting surveillance      are severely limited at the state and local levels.       A serious problem posed by new agents such as C.      cayetanensis is our lack of understanding of their biology.      Herwaldt et al. emphasize the potential role of contaminated      water. However, there appears to have been only limited      consideration of the role that birds or other animals may      have had in contaminating the berries. Recent evidence      suggests that eimeria, a recognized coccidial parasite in      birds, may be very similar to C. cayetanensis, if not the      same agent.3,}}4 Eimeria has long been recognized      as an important cause of diarrheal disease in birds.      Consumption of berries by birds is a major cause of crop loss      and results in frequent contamination of the berries. The use      of high-quality water for irrigation and pesticide spraying      and other good management practices will not solve the      problem of C. cayetanensis contamination if birds play a      major part in that contamination. A similar outbreak of      cyclosporiasis in Florida during the spring of 1995 was only      later recognized as likely to be associated with Guatemalan      raspberries. Yet no outbreaks were documented in association      with the fall harvest and shipment of Guatemalan raspberries      in 1995 or 1996. The season migration of wild birds in      Guatemala needs to be evaluated as a possible explanation for      the patterns seen with berry shipments and outbreaks of      disease in the United States. One test of this hypothesis      will be whether there is another outbreak of cyclosporiasis      associated with this year's spring shipment of raspberries      from Guatemala.       I believe that one of the unfortunate lessons of the      outbreak in the spring of 1996 came from public announcement      of the apparent association between a product and an illness      without sufficient epidemiologic evidence. The implications      of this lesson reach far into the future. When an outbreak      occurs, public health agencies are often under pressure to      act quickly. The public has come not only to expect a quick      response but also to demand it. The Texas Department of      Health and the Houston Department of Health and Human      Services investigated a cluster of cases of cyclosporiasis      among 20 participants at a May 9, 1996, conference in      Houston. On June 8, these agencies issued a press release      summarizing the results of their epidemiologic investigation.      In that announcement, they concluded that the consumption of      fresh California strawberries was associated with the      illness. The need to warn the public is legitimate, but it      must be weighted carefully against the possibility of being      wrong, which will result in economic loss for the falsely      accused industry, as well as weaken the confidence of both      industry and the public in future public health warnings.      Confusion about the actual cause of this outbreak persisted      for more than six weeks, until additional epidemilogic      studies conducted by state and local public health agencies,      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and health      officials in Canada concluded that raspberries from      Guatemala were the source of the outbreak.\5\       We need to establish well-defined criteria for evaluating      the quality of epidemiologic data from investigations of      outbreaks, particularly when the etiologic agent is not      readily isolated from the implicated food product.      Furthermore, when a widely distributed product is implicated      in an outbreak, we must ensure that before public      announcements are made, all available epidemiologic and      microbiologic evidence and information on product      distribution are reviewed quickly and that the conclusion is      supported by federal, state, and local experts in foodborne      disease.       On January 25, 1997, President Bill Clinton announced an      important new initiative to improve the safety of the      nation's food supply, including improvements in our ability      to detect foodborne outbreaks and coordination of the local,      state, and federal responses. However, we already have the      means of virtually eliminating the problem of cyclosporiasis      associated with fruit and vegetable consumption--namely,      irradiation. The use of ionizing radiation for food      pasteurization has been extensively evaluated and is      supported by the World Health Organization, the Food and      Agriculture Organization, the International Atomic Energy      Agency, and various other international agencies,     scientists, and government officials.\6\ Irradiation provides      the greatest likelihood of substantially reducing bacterial      and parasitic causes of foodborne disease associated with      numerous foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables.      However, the food industry remains reluctant to use this      technique out of fear of incurring the wrath of activist      groups that wrongly proclaim that irradiation is unsafe or      seriously compromises the quality of the food product. The      time has come to use irradiation; we must not let any group      use arguments without a scientific basis to keep such an      important technique from the marketplace. This may be the      most crucial lesson to be learned from the story of      cyclosporiasis and imported raspberries.                          footnote references       \1\ Herwaldt BL, Ackers M-L, Cyclospora Working Group.

Mitch McConnell,     Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, Russell          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: We are writing to advise you of our      enthusiastic support for an amendment you may offer to FDA      Reform legislation regarding labeling of food products under      the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We understand that      your amendment is intended to remove labeling impediments      that discourage consumer acceptance of irradiation as a      technology designed to strengthen food safety and expand the      availability of safe and affordable food products.       Irradiation is a simple and inexpensive process used since      the 1950s to kill harmful pathogens in many foods, but is      rarely used today because of FDA's label disclosure      requirements. Irradiated food products must prominently bear      the international ``radura'' symbol and the phrase ``treated      with radiation'' or ``treated by irradiation.'' These bold      labeling requirements more prominent than required warning      statements, render the foods virtually unmarketable. Again,      we understand that your amendment would require irradiated      foods to bear an appropriate disclosure requirement, but      specifies that the disclosure need not be more prominent than      the ingredient statement. In this way, concerned Americans      may be assured that food that has been irradiated will be      marked as such but the prominence of disclosure will not be      so bold as to create the false impression that the      irradiation statement is a warning. Broader use of      irradiation and other pathogen-reducing technologies promises      a significant step forward in further improving food safety.       We enthusiastically support your irradiation prominence-of-     disclosure amendment. It would provide for labeling policies      that encourage the use of FDA-approved food safety and      agricultural production technologies.           Sincerely,         American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry            Association, American Meat Institute, Animal Health            Institute, Apple Processors Association, Chocolate            Manufacturers Association, Florida Fruit And Vegetable            Association, Food Distributors International, Institute            of Food Technologists, Millers' National Federation,            National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National            Confectioners' Association, National Fisheries            Institute, National Food Processors Association,            National Meat Association, National Pork Producers            Council, National Turkey Federation, Northwest            Horticulture Association, Produce Marketing            Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, United Egg            Producers, United Egg Association, United Fresh Fruit &            Vegetable Association, and Western Growers Association.
