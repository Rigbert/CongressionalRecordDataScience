Virtually all agree that it is useful to share information, but sharing information without robust privacy standards creates as many problems as it may solve.  The first amendment I am offering is supported by a wide variety of organizations across the political spectrum because they want what this amendment would do; that is, reasonable efforts have to be made to strike unrelated personal information before it is handed over to the government. Without that, you have a flimsy standard that says: When in doubt, hand it over.  I urge colleagues to support this amendment. It is backed by progressive groups and conservative groups.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Warren as a cosponsor to my amendment.
