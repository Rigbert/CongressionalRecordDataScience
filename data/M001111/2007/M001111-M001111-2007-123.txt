 President, I will yield for the Senator from Kentucky to speak for a few minutes, and then I will come back, and we will try to get unanimous consent, again, to set the vote at 4 o'clock.  I remind all Members of the Senate on both sides that the majority leader has asked us to finish this Transportation/Housing bill by tonight. We are going to be here late. Members do need to get their amendments to the floor, get them offered. We will work our way through them. But it is imperative we understand from everyone as soon as possible what business they need us to accomplish. Again, we expect to finish this bill by tonight.
