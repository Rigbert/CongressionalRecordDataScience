. House of Representatives that National Child Awareness Month should be established in the month of September.  September is traditionally ``back-to-school'' month, a time when families focus on preparing children for the coming school year. Recognizing September as National Child Awareness Month will heighten the American public's attentiveness to the importance of our children's health, education, safety and character development through the ongoing efforts of the numerous organizations and individuals who help to protect and nurture them. With this resolution we express our support for a month-long effort to recognize the importance of children in our society as they grown into responsible citizens.  It is widely recognized that a strong, supportive family unit is the most important factor in the well-being of a child. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that every child will have a support system to depend on. Thankfully there are many organizations that provide for the most disadvantaged children in communities across the country. Even children with solid support systems benefit from youth-serving organizations which enrich their lives through activities such as sports, the arts, philanthropy and further education outside of the classroom.  I would like to extend my sincerest appreciation to the 69 bipartisan cosponsors and to the gentlelady from Orange County, the lead sponsor, Loretta Sanchez, for her efforts on behalf of this resolution. In addition I would like to extend a special thanks to the Education and Labor Committee for moving the bill quickly. It is my hope that Senators Feinstein and Burr will quickly pass a companion resolution in the Senate chamber and that President Obama will by Presidential Proclamation, designate September as National Child Awareness Month so that the many child-focused programs of the federal government might also be highlighted.  Most importantly, I commend the many local and national youth-serving organizations and charities dedicated to the well-being of children across the nation and the world.                          ____________________
