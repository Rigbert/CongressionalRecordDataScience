I certainly hope we can reach some accommodation. I wish to do a little bragging on behalf of my home State.  We are pretty proud of our basketball heritage in Kansas, but I note that we have not received national recognition to the extent I think we should in regards to the recent accomplishment I wish to highlight.  I rise to congratulate the Wichita State University Shockers.
