Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2810 and urge swift passage of this noncontroversial legislation. Prior to adjourning in August, the Senate passed legislation, S. 2810, to extend the deadline by which INTELSAT is required to conduct its IPOs. I commend my colleagues in the other body and thank them for addressing this important issue.  Under the Open-Market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications (ORBIT) act, INTELSAT is required to privatize, and as part of that effort, INTELSAT is to conduct an IPO by December 31 of this year. As detailed by the FCC, INTELSAT has made significant progress in its privatization efforts. Moreover, INTELSAT has made substantial preparations to conduct its statutorily mandated IPO.  However, volatility in the financial markets in general, and the telecommunications sector specifically, make this statutory deadline unrealistic. Indeed, one is hard-pressed to select a worse time for a satellite company IPO. Equally important, such an ill-timed IPO runs counter to one of the central policy objectives of ORBIT, dilution of foreign government ownership. If this IPO is forced to take place now, it is very likely that the foreign governments holding nonstrategic investments in INTELSAT will decide not to sell in this unattractive market. Rather, they will decide to hold on to their investments until a more attractive market price is available. The end result: no foreign government dilution in the near future.  S. 2810 would therefore give INTELSAT another year in which to conduct its IPO. It also provides the FCC authority to allow an additional extension of time if warranted by market conditions. Congress provided identical relief last year to Inmarsat. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important yet noncontroversial legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
