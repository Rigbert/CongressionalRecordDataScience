 President, I rise today to address what I believe is a national security and public safety weakness.  The United States currently has a system in place to keep known or suspected terrorists off of airplanes. But even though they can't fly, these very same terrorists can walk into any gun store anywhere in the country and purchase a firearm.  If a terrorist is too dangerous to board an airplane, that same individual is too dangerous to possess a gun.  That's why we are introducing the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, a bill to fix this glaring loophole in our background check system.  This is not a hypothetical issue.  Individuals with links to terrorism regularly purchase guns in the United States.  According to data just received from the Government Accountability Office, between February 2004 and December 2014, there were at least 2,233 cases in which a known or suspected terrorist--individuals who at the time were on federal terrorist watch lists--tried to buy a firearm or obtain a firearm or explosives license or permit.  In 91 percent of these cases, a total of 2,043 separate occasions, those known or suspected terrorists successfully passed a background check.  The Kouachi brothers, the terrorists who killed 12 people at Charlie Hebdo in Paris, are reportedly on the U.S. no fly list.  However, if they had made it to the United States, the fact that they were on terrorist watch lists would have done nothing to prevent them from legally buying firearms or explosives.  One of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was reportedly placed on two terrorist watch lists in 2011.  He later killed three and injured 170 with homemade explosives and killed a police officer with a handgun.  In 2009, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad opened fire at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas. He killed one and critically injured another.  According to press reports, Muhammad had been under investigation by the FBI for suspected links to terrorism after traveling to Yemen, where he was arrested for using a Somali passport. Those actions certainly would have placed him on terrorist watch lists, but would not have kept him from buying firearms.  The bill that we are introducing today is very simple.  It would close this dangerous loophole by giving the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone from buying explosives or a gun if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism.  It would also give the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone from obtaining a license to sell guns or explosives if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism.  The Attorney General could use a range of tools to make this decision, most notable terrorist watch lists and the no fly list.  In addition to making the decision at the discretion of the Attorney General, the bill includes other safeguards to make sure innocent individuals are not denied the ability to buy firearms or explosives.  The first safeguard is that very high standards already exist for an individual to be designated as a known or suspected terrorist.  The FBI or the National Counterterrorism Center must nominate the individual to be included in the Terrorist Screening Database.  There must be sufficient identifying data about the person to ensure they can be accurately matched with the terrorist on the watch list.  The circumstances must meet the ``reasonable suspicion'' standard. This means the facts of the case must be strong enough to reasonably determine the person is known or suspected to be engaged in terrorism.  The second safeguard is that every provision in current law allowing individuals to appeal the denial of a firearm or explosive purchase will also apply to this bill.  The office within the FBI that handles the background check system, known as the NICS Section, or the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Section, must provide the reason for denial upon request.  Individuals then have the right to correct any inaccurate records in the background check system. If a purchase is still denied, individuals can take the Justice Department to court to overturn the decision.  Gun safety safety bills are often labeled as Democratic bills. That is not the case here.  This bill was first proposed by the Justice Department under President George W. Bush, who recognized that keeping guns away from terrorists is good policy.  Attorney General Holder has also testified that the Justice Department under President Obama continues to support this proposal.  The bill has also been endorsed by Everytown for Gun Safety. This group represents more than 1,000 current and former mayors, both Republican and Democrat.  The legislation has also been endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Violence Policy Center, Americans for Responsible Solutions, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.  I would also like to thank the bill's cosponsors: Senators Whitehouse, Schumer, Durbin, Blumenthal, Boxer, Reed, Menendez, Gillibrand, Murphy, Warren, and Markey. All of you are champions for stronger gun safety laws.  The terrorist attack in Paris should be a wake-up call for everyone.  This sort of terrorist attack is very possible here in the United States, and the ability for known and suspected terrorists to buy guns and explosives makes it even more likely.  Congress should close this loophole in our background check system and ensure that known and suspected terrorists can't easily gain access to these weapons.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                 ______                                       By
