That is what we talk about. That is what we do.  I had the honor of being in South Dakota before the election, and as I walked around in South Dakota and looked around, I thought, I could just as well be in Oklahoma. While I was there, I talked to the farm bureau people there, and they said it is the regulations. That is a farm State. Oklahoma is a farm State, and we understand that.  Of all the regulations they have and the problems they have, they say the EPA overregulates and causes the greatest problems. They singled one out--endangered species. They singled another one out--the waters of the United States. Currently, we are doing legislation on the waters of the United States, and it is legislation that is going to get that burden off of the people from South Dakota and Oklahoma. Right now, we are considering the most expensive of all the regulations, which is the ozone regulations. It would constitute the greatest single increase in expenditures or taxes of anything in the history of this country.  So it is nice to know we have someone who is so committed to the goals of this committee to be singling this out in a maiden speech as his greatest concern. I appreciate that as the chairman of that committee, and we are going to do wonderful things together for South Dakota, Oklahoma, and America.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
