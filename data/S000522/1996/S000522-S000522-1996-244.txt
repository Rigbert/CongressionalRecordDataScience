Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a resolution advocating a peaceful end to the conflict between the Turkish Government and Kurdish militants. The ongoing war undermines the very foundations of both the Turkish State and our bilateral relations and its persistence challenges the desires of the United States and Turkish Governments to establish a secure, long-term relationship. For the sake of the people of Turkey, the end of the conflict will strengthen Turkish democracy, help eliminate the scourge of terrorism, resuscitate a shaky economy and promote regional stability.  Mr. Speaker, Turkey is home to half of the world's 25 million Kurds and has experienced 28 Kurdish uprisings in the past century. Since 1984, more than 20,000 people have died in clashes among security forces, the Kurdistan Workers Party [PKK] and shadowy Moslem fundamentalist groups. In the past 3 years, security forces forcibly evacuated or destroyed more than 2,650 villages in southeast Turkey and displaced more than 3 million people. Villagers have been rounded up by security officials and subjected to beatings, mass arrests and intimidation. Death squads, believed connected to security forces and fundamentalists, have been responsible for hundreds of extrajudicial killings and disappearances. PKK fighters have also snuffed out the lives of innocent civilians. Each month there are reports of individuals killed in detention and torture remains widespread in cases involving political charges. Eight southwestern Turkish provinces are under a constant state of emergency authorizing local authorities to curb political and media activity.  Mr. Speaker, successive Turkish Governments have viewed the PKK solely as a terrorist phenomenum undermining its sovereignty and dividing the country along ethnic lines. The Government has dismissed as propaganda recent PKK statements renouncing violence and separatism and calling for peaceful and lasting political solutions. Turkey's Government has given the military free reign in responding to the PKK, and its heavy-handed approach has also stifled legitimate Kurdish political voices.  Mr. Speaker, in southeastern Turkey, citizens are often forced to choose between supporting the guerrillas and risking violent reprisal by Turkish security--or not helping and facing equally harsh PKK retribution. Locals believed to be sympathetic to Turkish authorities have been executed by the PKK. Eleven years of violence has polarized Turks and Kurds and threatens to rend Turkish society along ethnic lines. Kurds, resentful of military abuses, become more supportive of the PKK. Turks, angered by the costs and brutality of terrorism, become increasingly intolerant of the rights of Kurdish citizens.  Mr. Speaker, no one disputes Turkey's key role in preserving U.S. strategic, political and economic interests in a critical region. However, the inability of successive Turkish Governments to resolve the Kurdish crisis remains an obstacle to improved ties and enables persistent human rights problems to stunt Turkey's democratic development. The time has come for Turkey's true friends and supporters to call on all sides in the conflict to abandon violence and settle their differences peacefully, democratically and within the framework of the territorial unity of the Republic of Turkey. Following recent elections, Turkey's Government finds itself in a state of protracted paralysis. Observers believe that any new government is unlikely to offer substantially new approaches to the Kurdish issue because of prevailing nationalist sentiments and the possibility of new elections in the near future. Additionally, Turkey's military supports the war in southeast Turkey, although its approach has failed to do anything but foster local support for the PKK.  Mr. Speaker, I have learned from our experiences dealing with the PLO and Israel, the ANC and South Africa, and the IRA and Britain, that the longer it takes to begin reconciliation, the harder it becomes to look beyond the bloodshed and suffering. Mr. Speaker, violence will not resolve this conflict. The time for dialog is long overdue.  Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Government has often been instrumental in promoting peace in troubled areas. So too should we demonstrate our commitment to encouraging the resolution of this destructive and bloody conflict. The resolution which I am introducing, along with Mr. Steny Hoyer, ranking minority member of the Helsinki Commission, is an important first step in this direction. I would ask our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this resolution. I ask that the language of the resolution be printed in the Record at this time.                          H. Con. Res. ______       Whereas armed conflict has existed in southeastern Turkey      since 1984, and the entire region has been placed under a      state of emergency since 1987;       Whereas the human toll of this conflict has been great,      with the loss of more than 20,000 lives, the displacement of      more than 3,000,000 civilians, and the destruction of more      than 2,650 Kurdish villages;       Whereas free expression in Turkey is restricted by laws      which criminalize nonviolent expression, resulting in the      incarceration of journalists, writers, academics, human      rights activists, and others as political prisoners;       Whereas in the past 2 years, 13 Kurdish members of Turkey's      parliament have been removed from office, jailed, or exiled      for expressing political opinions or having alleged contacts      with the illegal Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK);       Whereas Kurdish citizens of Turkey have been denied certain      basic political and civil rights such as the right to full      and free participation in political life, the right to be      educated in their mother language, and the right to freely      write and publish materials in the Kurdish language;       Whereas the conflict between Kurdish guerrillas and Turkish      armed forces has spilled over Turkey's borders and threatens      the stability of the region;       Whereas the escalating conflict poses grave threats to      economic stability and the existing political order and      prevents realization of full-fledged democracy;       Whereas international and local humanitarian organizations,      including the International Committee of the Red Cross, have      been denied access to southeastern Turkey;       Whereas terrorism poses a grave threat to human rights and      violates international law;       Whereas Turkey's leaders have made commitments to building      a democratic society and have made significant progress in      realizing this goal;       Whereas the Government of Turkey has acceded to upholding      international human rights agreements, including the United      Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Geneva      Conventions, and the Helsinki Final Act;       Whereas Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty      Organization and the Organization for Security and      Cooperation in Europe, is an important strategic and economic      partner of the United States;       Whereas long-term strategic and economic interests of the      United States are jeopardized by the continuing conflict in      Turkey;       Whereas after 11 years, Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)      guerrilla leaders have offered to lay down their weapons;       Whereas a military solution to the Kurdish question in      Turkey is not possible, and only a nonviolent political      solution can bring peace, stability, full democracy, and      prosperity to Turkey; and       Whereas such a solution must be sought and implemented      within the framework of      the territorial unity of the Republic of Turkey: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--       (1) the Government of Turkey should immediately release all      political prisoners and lift restrictions on free expression      and thereby enable all Turkish citizens, including those of      Kurdish origin, to enjoy the political and cultural rights of      peoples in all democratic countries;       (2) the President should take every opportunity to      encourage the Government of Turkey to initiate steps to end      the armed confrontation in that country;       (3) the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) should declare a      cease-fire and restate support for resolution of the conflict      through democratic means and within the framework of the      territorial unity of the Republic of Turkey;       (4) the Government of Turkey should declare a cease-fire      and reaffirm a foundation upon which its Republic is based:      ``Peace at home. Peace in the world'';       (5) upon cessation of hostilities, the International      Committee of the Red Cross and other appropriate humanitarian      and monitoring organizations should be given access to      southeastern Turkey;       (6 ) the Government of Turkey should take steps to further      reduce the potential for future confrontation, including--       (A) allowing all political parties committed to nonviolence      to participate in Turkish political life;       (B) repealing the state of emergency in southeastern      Turkey;       (C) dismantling the paramilitary ``village guard'' system;       (D) lifting all constraints on the dissemination in the      Kurdish language of television and radio broadcasts, print,      music, and other media;       (E) allowing schools to offer instructions in the Kurdish      language; and       (F) establishing consultative mechanisms to defuse sources      of conflict and propose strategies to resolve current crisis      in southeastern Turkey; and       (7) the President should support providing technical      assistance to carry out paragraphs (1) through (6).                          ____________________
