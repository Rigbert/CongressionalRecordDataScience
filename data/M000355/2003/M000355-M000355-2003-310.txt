 President, included in the cleared amendments that I sent to the desk is an amendment by myself providing funding for media freedoms to Russia; another McConnell amendment providing authority to ESP assistance for transition initiatives; another one relating to development credit authority guaranteed loans; and an amendment by Senator Brownback related to refugee admissions. Senator Leahy has four technical amendments and one providing funds for administrative expenses for USAID in the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste; another Leahy amendment increasing funding for Colombian-United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; and a Schumer amendment withholding funds for nations that refuse to pay diplomatic parking tickets.  That is the summary of the amendments that are at the desk. As I have indicated, they have been cleared on both sides.
