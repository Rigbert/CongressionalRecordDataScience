President, at-long last the Congress is approving and passing S. 249, the Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act, which will reauthorize programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and will authorize funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I have been working since 1996 to get this legislation reauthorized. For each of the past several months I have come to the floor to express my disappointment over how long it has taken to pass this noncontroversial legislation.  I had some minor concerns with the House amended version of S. 249, but as I said in my statement June 30 of this year, after receiving some clarification and assurances from Secretary Shalala on these concerns, I decided that the House amendments should not keep this important piece of legislation from passing. I am pleased that we could finally clear this bill on the other side of the aisle.  The Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 reauthorizes programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and authorizes funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Both programs are critical to our nation's youth and to our nation's well-being.  In addition to providing shelter for children in need, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act ensures that these children and their families have access to important services, such as individual, family or group counseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources available to help these young people and their families get back on track. As the National Network for Youth has stressed, the Act's programs ``provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the country.''  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provides extremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families facing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the National Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 missing children. The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and law enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which provide free services to parents in search of their children and have also developed extensive training programs.  I do want to thank the many advocates, who have worked with me over the years, for their tireless efforts to improve the bill. In particular, I must mention the members of the Vermont Coalition of runaway and Homeless Youth Programs and the National Network for Youth for their dedication throughout this process.  This bill, S. 249, should have been enacted last year. It should have been enacted when the Houses finally sent it back to us in May of this year. There was absolutely no reason to stall on this noncontroversial legislation. I am pleased that we were finally able to pass it so these important programs can continue to succeed.  I reincorporate my remarks from June 30, July 15 and August 5 and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to Secretary Shalala and the response that I received be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1999.     Hon. Donna Shalala,     Secretary of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Shalala: I am pleased that we are close to      enactment of S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway      Children Protection Act of 1999, which will reauthorize      programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) and      authorize funding for the National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children. The Senate passed the Leahy-Hatch      substitute to S. 249 on April 19, by unanimous consent.      Yesterday, the House passed its version of this legislation.       I am concerned about language inserted into the bill during      House consideration upon which the Senate was not consulted.      That language provides for a ``consolidated review of      applications'' of RHYA grants. Before agreeing to the new      language, I need to be assured that this could in no way be      construed as consolidating any of the RHYA programs under a      single formula allocation.       As you know now, under the RHYA, each year each State is      awarded at a minimum $100,000 for housing and crisis services      under the Basic Center grant program. Effective community-     based programs around the country can also apply directly for      the funding available for the Transitional Living Program and      the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grants.       I hope that you can clarify that the new language inserted      by House will do nothing to collapse the distinct programs      authorized under the RHYA. These programs are very important      and I would like to see the legislation passed without      further delay.       I have been working since 1996 to enact this reauthorizing      legislation. I worked to have the Senate pass this      legislation during the last Congress and again earlier this      year. With your assurance that Vermont and other small states      will not be disadvantaged by the language inserted by the      House in competing for national grant funding, I will seek to      expedite enactment.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                              Department of Health                                           and Human Services,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1999.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: You have asked us to consider the      impact of certain language recently inserted into the House      version of S. 249, the ``Missing, Exploited, and Runaway      Children Act of 1999''. Specifically, you have asked us to      consider whether proposed section 385, Consolidated Review of      Applications, will adversely affect the eligibility of small      States to receive Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA)      funding above the minimum grant allotment of the RHYA Basic      Center Grant program.       I am advised by General Counsel that currently the      Secretary has wide statutory discretion to prescribe the      procedures which will be used in awarding various grants      under the RHYA. The Secretary presently exercises this      discretion by choosing to include in a consolidated grant      announcement several discrete funding opportunities with      distinct application requirements. After studying the      pertinent language in S. 249, General Counsel has concluded      that the proposed legislation provides for a similar level of      discretion with respect to procedures to be     used for various grant awards under the RHYA. Therefore,      since the proposed legislation does not require the Secretary      to change in any way her current procedures for awarding RHYA      grants, it will not require the Secretary to commingle the      current separate and discrete RHYA funding opportunities so      as to adversely affect the eligibility of small States to      receive RHYA funding above the minimum grant allotment of the      RHYA Basic Center grant program.       I hope this information is helpful to you as you proceed      with final consideration of S. 249. The Department deeply      appreciates all your efforts to reauthorize the Runaway and      Homeless Youth Act.           Sincerely,                                               Richard J. Tarplin,                              Assistant Secretary for Legislation.
