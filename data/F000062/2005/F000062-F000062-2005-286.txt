 We would also hope that the committee would add language to clarify that exempt energy transactions are subject to the CFTC's antimanipulation and false reporting authorities.  It is our hope that the Agriculture Committee will include these proposals in legislation when reauthorizing the CFTC this year. However, should the committee report a mark that does not include similar provisions when placed on the Senate Calendar, we would like assurances from the chairman of the Agriculture Committee that we will have the ability to offer an amendment to address these issues when this bill is considered by the full Senate.
