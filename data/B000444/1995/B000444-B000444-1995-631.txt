 President, this is not a very propitious time for me to send an amendment to the desk.  Let me, while Senator Bumpers is still here, say one thing to Senator Bumpers.  I was with Senator Bumpers and others on the 50th anniversary of D-Day on those beaches, including down in Italy in Anzio.  I was 2 years old when the people of Dale's generation, although I do not feel like he is a different generation than me --and I mean that sincerely, and I do not--until I stood on those beaches.  I came home and said something to my father that I never said before. My father was not on any one of those beaches. As I stood there and watched Senator Heflin, Senator Bumpers, Senator Hollings and Senator Glenn and others with whom I was attending these ceremonies, and the thousands of veterans who were there, I marveled at one thing.  Being a U.S. Senator for 22 years, I have been to a lot of veterans' events. I did not see one bit of revelry. I only saw reverence. I watched these men and their counterparts--civilians--walk out on those beaches--which seemed to be 20 miles wide--in solitude. There were 10,000 individuals there, all lost in their own memories.  It impressed me in a strange way, I say to my friend from Arkansas. Here is what I told my dad. I came back with such a sense of awe. As a student of history, thinking I was a pretty smart, well-educated guy, until you stand on those beaches. Now I understand why they all came in at midtide. I am assuming it was equally as bad or worse at Iwo Jima, and I have never been there.  I not only had a sense of awe and pride in my father's generation and a renewed respect for that generation,  [[Page S2736]] but I had an incredible sense of envy, almost a feeling of anger. John Kerry is a veteran. John was a decorated veteran in Vietnam. My generation went to war in Vietnam without the benefit that your generation had.  When you stood there on the beaches of Iwo Jima, or deciding whether or not to get out of the landing craft on Omaha Beach, you knew, had you failed, all of humanity would have suffered. There was no question that the fate of mankind hung in the balance. Had you not prevailed, your wives, mothers, and children would have lived under an oppression unlike anything that had been seen in the previous two centuries.  When John Kerry rode down some god-awful river in Vietnam, he did not know who the hell he was after, was not quite sure why he was there, did not have any idea anymore than my friend from Virginia had as to who might be shooting at him, and I suspect never had the absolute certainty that what they were doing, as difficult as it was, was something that, beyond question, had to be done.  I understand my dad's generation better, having been there, because now I understand why guys like my dad--and God, it seems ridiculous to talk to you as if you were my dad's age because I have worked with you all my professional life--why you have such an incredible sense of optimism. Why on either side of the aisle, whether it is you or John Chafee or whomever it is, have this unabating notion that we can, in fact, get things done.  I look at my generation and those who are younger, and I am not nearly as surprised as to why they are as confused as they are about the ability, and not even thinking about it in your generation, why they wonder whether or not this institution makes any sense, whether or not the system works.  It seems to me you not only did something incredibly courageous--and I see Dan Inouye, and nobody in this whole body have I ever felt closer to than Dan Inouye, and he knows I am not just saying that. Here is a guy, he goes and loses his arm. He should have gotten the Medal of Honor, in my view, if you read about his exploits. And he acts like he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He acts like not a single thing ever happened to him in his life that was difficult. He acts like the world is just a cupcake, and we can make it great for everybody.  It is an incredible, incredible thing that your generation has passed on. I do not know how it gets renewed. But I know one thing: More people should hear you talk about it. More people should go and stand on Omaha Beach or go to Iwo Jima or go up into the hills in Italy where these guys--Bob Dole and others--got stopped.  I know it sounds corny, but I defy anybody of any generation to have been there on D-Day and not walk away with a deeper understanding of why your generation has done so much for this country and why other generations have been so uncertain about what they can do. The biggest thing it does, it seems to me, is hopefully remind people in this era of bitter politics, of political invective, of the mindless things that are being said on the left and the right, of the personal characterization of political motivation of whatever anybody does, of the era of 30-second personal attacks on anybody that disagrees with you, you must be un-American or must be less dedicated than whomever it is they are arguing with.  I hope they understand that, as corny as it sounds, the women and men who served in this body--and I have been here for 22 years--I have not met a one, I have not met a one in either political party when they walk out of here and get in their car at night or go down to the train station like I do and look in the rear view mirror, they see that Capitol dome, do not still get a chill.  I noticed people when we were over there on D-Day, Dale, there was not anybody watching us. Everybody was the same. I watch people when they play the ``Star Spangled Banner.'' There was not any hometown crowd. I watched peoples' eyes mist and people got goosebumps. I know it is not in vogue to say those things, and probably an editorial will say how corny we were today--or I know I was.  The best thing that can happen in this sick political atmosphere we find ourselves in, is for more people to understand, whether it is the Rush Limbaughs of the world or a left-wing version of Rush Limbaugh on the air who makes everything personal about what people do, there is so much more that we agree on in this Chamber than we disagree on. There is so much more that your generation did for this Nation than you understand and appreciate, if I can say so, so much more.  But you had something that I think we are all still searching for, and that is the absolute certainty that what we were undertaking needed to be done, was noble, was moral, was necessary, and was right. I think that is what everybody is searching for. You paid a horrible price for having found it in your generation, but having found it and survived it, you made this country something that it never had been, because of the growth and the optimism and the absolute enthusiasm you all brought back from having done what you did and literally saved the world for democracy.  I want to tell you I had not planned on speaking on it at all, but my respect for my father has always been great. My respect for his generation and my mother's, as well.  I end with one little story. I was with you, and we split up after the President spoke. I went up to the cemetery. I was walking around the cemetery, just kind of in a daze. My wife and I--my wife was not even born during any portion of World War II -- were looking at the crosses, just wandering through, and this guy was being pushed in a wheelchair by his two sons. And I am looking at a grave marker. I did not even see him. And he said, ``Is that you, Senator Biden?'' And I turned around. I did not know the fellow. He was from Indiana. I turned to him and I was like most of us were, somewhat emotional about what we just observed. And I said, ``Thank you for what you did.'' And he said, ``Don't thank me, thank my wife.'' And I turned around, and his wife was not with him. And I said, ``Thank your wife?'' I said, ``Why, sir?''  He said, ``My wife did as much to make sure I could get on that landing craft and get here because she made it. She made it at home. She produced the reason we were able to win, because of the industrial might of the people we left behind to produce and outproduce the Germans.''  But it was typical. Here is a guy going through a graveyard where his friends are buried. I compliment him and he tells me to thank his deceased wife who made the landing craft.  I sure as heck hope there is some way we can rekindle that kind of notion of sense of duty, sense of responsibility, sense of shared glory that seems to be missing so much in this country today. And I hope in God's name we can do without another war. But I want to compliment you all.                          ____________________
