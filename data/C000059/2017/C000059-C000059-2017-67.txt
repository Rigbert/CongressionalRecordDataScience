Chair, I won't take 1 minute. I just want to support the gentleman's amendment.  It is my hope that the gentlemen from Virginia and Pennsylvania may be able to work with the new administration, find common ground on approaches that will improve water quality in a flexible manner which works for everybody.  Mr. Chair, I support the amendment and urge an ``aye'' vote.
