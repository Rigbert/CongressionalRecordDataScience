It provides tax relief for families, and it provides a helping hand to those who are unemployed, so they can afford health care insurance if they have lost their job, for example. It does provide infrastructure programs and projects. It is my understanding we are a little over 4 months into this 2-year stimulus program--not quite 5 months into it--and the Senator from Louisiana wants to basically declare it a failure, never having voted for it. I ask the Senator from California, when the Senator from Louisiana talks about the number of dollars committed, the number of projects we have agreed to, it was my understanding that, as of a couple weeks ago, we had obligated over $200 billion out of the $787 billion, meaning we promised we will pay, once the projects are underway and the jobs are actually created, and that number is going to continue to grow as we obligate it. Is it not also true that we want to make certain, whether we are spending money for projects under the highway trust fund or the stimulus bill, that we don't waste taxpayer dollars; we want to look carefully at each project to make sure it serves a public purpose and make certain Americans are going to work at a decent wage, and when it is over, we not only get through the recession, but we have a legacy of projects that will serve our economy and our Nation.  If the Senator from Louisiana has his way, he is going to take the money out that we are currently investing into creating jobs in America and move it into the highway trust fund. I am wondering if the Senator could respond. Does it make any sense for us to take a different approach on the stimulus and not be careful that the money we spend is actually spent well?
