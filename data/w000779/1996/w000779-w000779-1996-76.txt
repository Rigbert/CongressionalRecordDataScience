 Mr. President, I, too, rise to speak in support of the Bradley-Frist amendment. I am going to be very brief this afternoon, but I did want to take a minute or two and discuss a General Accounting Office report that I will have coming out next week. The General Accounting Office has summarized a number of findings in a report for me, which report will be available next week, and I would like to discuss those findings very briefly.  First, it seems to me that, if you pass this important legislation, our country increases the odds that the next generation gets off to a healthy start. That is what this legislation is all about: getting off to a healthy start.  As I mentioned, I asked the General Accounting Office a number of months ago to help the Congress identify the risks attributable to foreshortened hospital stays for mothers and their newborns, as well as to analyze health care plans on how well they provide postpartum care.  The General Accounting Office has given me a letter, Mr. President, that I will make a part of the Record this afternoon, but I would like to summarize very briefly just four of the findings in the General Accounting Office report that they will have next week.  The first is the General Accounting Office has pinpointed studies analyzing readmission statistics that indicate that babies staying less than 48 hours do, in fact, have a higher rate of rehospitalization for health problems.  The General Accounting Office concludes that not every early discharge is a danger to each and every child, but certainly there are studies that do indicate that readmission statistics demonstrate that babies staying less than 48 hours do, in fact, have a higher rate of rehospitalization.  Second, the General Accounting Office has found that a number of the discharge plans are simply that they are just a drive-by delivery with no at-home follow up to ensure that the mother and the child are doing well.  Third, the General Accounting Office has found that while a number of the States do have laws on the books that deal with this practice, not all of the insured individuals, and certainly some of the most vulnerable of America's families, are protected by these laws. So I think it is fair to conclude that there is a very significant variation with respect to consumer protection in terms of State laws, and I think that, too, makes a compelling argument for the Bradley-Frist legislation.  Fourth--and I close with this point, because I think it is the most significant one and, in and of itself, makes the case for the Bradley-Frist bipartisan legislation--the General Accounting Office has found that a significant number of plans offer doctors alternative financial incentives for early discharge and significant penalties for keeping young mothers and babies in the hospital longer than the plans would like. So what we have--and I point out that this will be the first Government study looking at this problem--is already significant evidence that two sets of disincentives to good health for young families exists on the basis of the GAO report: first, the question of plans offering financial incentives for early discharge and, second, the matter of heavy penalties that the GAO has found in a number of instances for keeping young mothers and babies in the hospital longer than the plans would like.  What it comes down to--and I sure hope we get a unanimous vote in a few minutes with respect to this legislation--is that this Congress has a chance to put some votes behind all of the family-friendly rhetoric.  I am very hopeful that the Bradley-Frist legislation will pass on a bipartisan basis. I think that the Senator from New Jersey has contributed so much, but what an important bill on which to finish a stellar career.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the General Accounting Office to which I referred.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       GAO, Health, Education, and                                      Human Services Division,                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1996.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senator Wyden: To contain costs, some health care      plans have adopted guidelines to shorten hospital stays      associated with maternity care--the most common condition      requiring hospitalization. Some plans have limited hospital      coverage for mothers and their newborns to a maximum of 24      hours after delivery. As a result, between 1980 and 1994, the      percent of 1-day postpartum hospital stays rose from about 9      percent to about 40 percent of all births. Many in the      medical community have voiced concerns that these shortened      stays expose newborns to undue risks.       To better understand the issues involved, you asked us to      (1) identify the risks that are attributable to short      hospital stays for maternity care, (2) examine health plan      actions to ensure quality postpartum care for short-stay      mothers and newborns, and (3) determine state responses to      concerns about patient protection. To do this study, we      analyzed pertinent trend data and interviewed medical experts      and representatives from hospital maternity programs, managed      care organizations, home health agencies, medical specialty      societies, and health care trade associations. In briefing      your staff on our work, we noted that our report would be      available by the end of next week. In the interim, you asked      us to summarize the results of our work. Our key findings      include the following:       Guidelines issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics      suggest--notwithstanding the presence of complications--     either minimum 2-day stays for vaginal deliveries and 4-day      stays for caesarean sections or shorter stays if: (1) Medical      stability criteria are     met, (2) the decision on length of stay is agreed to by      physician and patient, and (3) provisions are made for      timely, comprehensive followup care delivered by a maternity      care professional.       Neither researchers nor medical experts agree about the      direct effect of short stays on maternal and newborn health.      Using hospital readmission rates as an indicator of adverse      outcome, one recent study shows no association between the      number of days a newborn spends in the hospital and the rate      of readmission, while other studies show increased risk      for newborns discharged within 48 hours of birth.       Some plans allow physicians flexibility to apply early      discharge policies selectively. In addition, they have      programs of maternity care services that include intensive      prenatal assessment and education and comprehensive followup      care provided within 72 hours of discharge by a trained      professional at home or in a clinic. We found, however, that      some plans with shortened postpartum stays do not provide      adequate prenatal education or appropriate followup services.      For example, some plans' followup care consists of a phone      call rather than an actual home or office visit.       Early discharge policies have prompted more than half the      states to enact laws that regulate the length of maternity      stays but vary widely in degree of consumer protection and do      not apply to all insured individuals. For example, states      vary on whether the law specifies stay minimums, identifies      discharge decision makers, or mandates number of home visits      covered, among other things. The laws are also limited in      jurisdictional scope in that they: (1) Do not apply to plans      that are exempt from state regulation under the Employee's      Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) or (2) may not      apply to individuals living in one state but working and      receiving insurance in another.       Federal legislation has been introduced to make maternity      care more consistent nationally and available to all      privately insured women. The Senate is considering S. 969,      Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, which would      mandate a minimum 48-hour hospital stay for normal vaginal      deliveries and 96-hour stays for caesarean section deliveries      unless the attending provider, in consultation with the      mother, makes the decision to discharge early and coverage is      provided for prescribed timely followup care. Timely care is      defined as care provided in a manner that meets the health      care needs of the mother and newborn, provides for      appropriate monitoring of their conditions, and occurs within      24-72 hours immediately following discharge. These provisions      are consistent with the findings contained in our forthcoming      report.       We hope that this information meets your needs in      considering proposed federal legislation on hospital length      of stays for maternity care. Please call me on (202) 512-7119      if you or your staff have any questions regarding the issues      discussed above.           Sincerely yours,                                              Sarah F. Jaggar,                                        Health Service Quality and                                             Public Health Issues.
