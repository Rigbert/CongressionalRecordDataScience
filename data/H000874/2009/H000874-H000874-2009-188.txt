The status of the health bill, I think as the gentleman probably knows, is it's still in the Energy and Commerce Committee. The Energy and Commerce Committee has not reported out that bill.  I don't know the Speaker's commitment, but certainly the Speaker and I both had the hope that we would be able to pass the health care bill by the time we left here on the 31st of July. My view is at this point in time, that may not be possible. However, that does not mean necessarily that we won't be here perhaps longer. I hope that's not the case; but if it proves to be necessary, we may be here a little longer, either on the Saturday or the 3rd or the 4th. I don't want anybody to be planning on that at this point in time. But currently the status of the bill is it's still in the Energy and Commerce Committee.
