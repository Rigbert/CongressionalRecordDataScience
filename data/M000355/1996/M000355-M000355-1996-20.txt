 President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Christopher Coburn to the Board of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. I believe the nomination of Mr. Coburn to this board would put the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant at a disadvantage in the siting of the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation [AVLIS] technology.  As a member of the USEC Board, Mr. Coburn will have the responsibility of implementing the privatization of the USEC and charting its future course, including the implementation of the AVLIS technology.  The commercialization of this technology would mean billions of dollars of investment as well as ensuring the continued viability of the U.S. enrichment industry. If I may put the issue in stark, but accurate terms, the USEC's decision about siting AVLIS is more fundamentally a decision about which one of these plants will be able to remain competitive and viable into the next century.  Earlier this year, President Clinton appointed Mr. Coburn to the board because he believed Mr. Coburn was uniquely qualified following his service as the executive director of the Thomas Edison Program and as the science and technology advisor to the Governor of Ohio. It has come to my attention that while serving as the executive director of the Thomas Edison Project, Mr. Coburn developed a proposal to locate the AVLIS technology in Portsmouth, OH.  Mr. President, the placement of Mr. Coburn on the USEC's board at this time would cause serious doubts about the objectivity and fairness of the USEC as it begins to assess which facility should obtain the AVLIS technology. The stakes concerning this decision are so monumental that we cannot allow any inference of bias to infect the process by which that decision is made.  In an effort to protect the interests of the workers employed at the Paducah plant and the economy of western Kentucky I asked the President to withdraw the nomination of the Mr. Corburn. Since the President has ignored my concerns I have tried to block the confirmation of Mr. Coburn.  Unfortunately, I realize the votes are not in my favor. Nonetheless, I willcontinue to follow the actions of the Board and Mr. Coburn to ensure that the best interests of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant are protected.                          ____________________
