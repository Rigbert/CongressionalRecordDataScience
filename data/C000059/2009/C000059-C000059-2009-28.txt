Speaker, as a native of southern California, Cinco de Mayo celebrations have been a part of my life as long as I can remember. It is a day to celebrate our southern neighbors and the cause of Mexican independence. The historic battle at Puebla, Mexico on the fifth of May, 1862, is a David versus Goliath story that demonstrates that man can overcome any obstacle in the pursuit of freedom. On Cinco de Mayo we remember the brave stand at Puebla and we celebrate the cause of freedom around the world.
