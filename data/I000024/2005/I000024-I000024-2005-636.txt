President, the Senator from Missouri is accurate. We have been talking about this for 3 years now. I do not think there is anything new that can be said, but I do renew my congratulations and thanks to all the staff who worked on this bill, certainly Senator Jeffords, Senator Baucus, and Senator Bond.  I agree it would be nice if we had something with which everyone agreed. It is impossible to do. The only way to do that is in a way that is not desirable. We did a formula, and we took into consideration all the factors--donee, donor States, size of the States, passthrough, fatalities--and I think we have a good bill.  I yield back the remainder of my time. Have the yeas and nays been requested?
