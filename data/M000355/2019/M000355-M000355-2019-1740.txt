 Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:                              S. Res. 151       Whereas, in the case of United States v. Pratersch, Cr. No.      19-26, pending in the United States District Court for the      Middle District of Florida, the prosecution has requested the      production of testimony from Greta Hasler, an employee of the      office of Senator Bernard Sanders;       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the      Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a)      and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to      represent current and former Members and employees of the      Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for      testimony relating to their official responsibilities;       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United      States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate      may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from      such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;      and       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or      in the possession of the Senate may promote the      administration of justice, the Senate will take such action      as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the      privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That Greta Hasler, an employee of the Office of      Senator Bernard Sanders, and any other current or former      employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant evidence      may be necessary, are authorized to testify and produce      documents in the case of United States v. Pratersch, except      concerning matters for which a privilege should be asserted.       Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to      represent Senator Sanders and any current or former employees      of his office in connection with the production of evidence      authorized in section one of this resolution.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing the production of testimony, documents, and representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for evidence in a criminal action pending in Florida Federal district court. In this action the defendant is charged with threatening to assault and murder Senator Sanders in voicemails he left with the Senator's Burlington, Vermont office. A trial is scheduled for April 29, 2019.  The prosecution is seeking testimony from one of the Senator's staff assistants who listened to the voicemails at issue. Senator Sanders would like to cooperate with this request by providing relevant employee testimony and documents from his office.  The enclosed resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other current or former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant evidence may be necessary, to testify and produce documents in this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel of such staffers and Senator Sanders.                          ____________________
