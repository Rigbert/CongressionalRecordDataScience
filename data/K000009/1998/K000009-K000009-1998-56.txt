Chairman, I yield the 15 minutes under my control in this debate to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), a key leader in this House and truly one of the most knowledgeable and hardworking and influential leaders on U.S. sugar policy. I would have to say that no one could be a finer spokesman both for our producers as well as our farm workers than the gentleman from Hawaii.
