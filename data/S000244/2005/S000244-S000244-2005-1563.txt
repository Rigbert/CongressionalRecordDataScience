Speaker, I was honored to support H. Res. 190, a resolution passed April 6 that commended the life and achievements of His Holiness Pope John Paul II. Likewise, I am proud to say I was the lead sponsor of legislation that was passed by the House and Senate in 2003, House Concurrent Resolution 313, that urged President Bush to present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the Pope. Thankfully, President Bush did just that in June of last year.  In a time when many leaders look to the polls and test political winds for guidance, Pope John Paul II stood unflinching at the center of the most controversial moral debates of our time, and held firm, always supporting the sanctity and dignity of every human life. His presence will be sorely missed, but his accomplishments will long be relished.  Mr. Speaker, as a reminder of the Pope's enduring and historic contributions to world peace, human freedom and to the security and national interests of the United States, I request that the following remarks that I delivered on the House floor on November 18, 2003 be printed in the Record.
