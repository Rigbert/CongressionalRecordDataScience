 Let me ask further--and I know the answer to this question is that we will have to see, but I have put our own Caucus on notice, Mr. Leader--if we may need to be here for the week after the break for the holy days. Is that consistent with your thought?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Currently, we are scheduled to be here that last week. There has been no change to that schedule. As I noted just a little earlier, the only change we made is coming back this Monday. I want to make sure all the Members have enough time to digest and get their questions answered, but currently that schedule continues to hold.
