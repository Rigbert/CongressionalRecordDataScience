Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of the joint resolution.  Mr. Speaker, House Joint Resolution 129 would grant congressional consent to an interstate compact between Vermont and New Hampshire. Congressional approval is required before the towns involved can apply for Federal funds to upgrade a joint water-treatment plant. The compact will also permit future joint water-supply facilities of the New Hampshire-Vermont border. Compacts between Vermont and New Hampshire are not new. In fact, there is already one relating to sewer systems.  The towns are hoping to begin construction once the weather turns warm enough to break ground, so I urge speedy passage of this noncontroversial legislation.  Identical legislation has already been passed the Senate by voice vote on December 18, 1995.  This measure was urged before the committee very eloquently by the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] and the gentleman from New Hampshire [Mr. Bass], and I would hope that we would all join them in supporting this very worthy measure.
