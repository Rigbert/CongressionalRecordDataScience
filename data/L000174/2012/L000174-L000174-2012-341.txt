President, today, Thursday, April 19, is Holocaust Remembrance Day. Observances and remembrance activities are taking place across the Nation in civic centers, schools, churches and synagogues, on military bases and in workplaces.  As always, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum--created as a permanent living memorial to its victims--is taking a leading role in this annual observance.  We must never forget the horrors of the Holocaust, we must never let the world forget, and we must never forget or neglect the Holocaust's lessons.  Never forgetting means keeping alive the memory of those who suffered and died in the Holocaust.  Never forgetting also means declaiming against crimes against humanity that erupt in our midst, and on our watch.  As searing as the Holocaust's lessons are, the world is too easily tempted to avert its eyes from heinous crimes committed by governments and others against our fellow human beings. The community of nations will always bear the shame of doing so little during the massacres on the killing fields of Cambodia, and in the villages of Rwanda.  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum itself has taken the lead in shining a light on atrocities in our time in Darfur, and I commend its Committee on Conscience for lending its unmatched moral authority to the crusade to bring an end to the violence there.  In that spirit, our voices are also needed to expose the crimes against humanity that are occurring behind the walls of the prison camps of North Korea. More and more information now is coming to light about the systematic, state-sponsored brutality that is being waged upon some 200,000 people, according to the State Department, in those camps. The fact of these prison camps is not new. But horrifying new glimpses are now coming to light from those who have successfully broken free and crossed the frontier to eventual freedom. Publicly available satellite photos are helping to expose a system whose very existence the North Korean government continues to deny.  A new report on these prison camps, authored by David Hawk, has been released by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, a U.S.-based, private organization. It documents the imprisonment of entire families, including children and grandparents for the ``political crimes'' of other family members.  At the report's Washington release this month, a young man born to prisoners--and thereby condemned to spend his entire life in one of these camps--spoke about visiting the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, every time he comes to Washington. Shin Dong-hyuk's harrowing escape is detailed in a new book by Blaine Harden, a former Washington Post reporter.  We have vital national security interests at stake in our dealings with the North Korean regime, which has acquired nuclear weapons. I am onewho believes that we can fully and effectively pursue these interests through diplomacy and other means, without having to mute our outrage about human rights atrocities like these.  I welcome the strong comments about this report made by Robert King, the United States human rights envoy for North Korea, who said that conditions in North Korea's prison camps are worse than in the former Soviet Union's gulag. I would hope that today's leaders of Russia and China would voice similar outrage about these atrocities.  Social media and a powerful video recently brought the story of the crimes of Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army to an audience of millions of people around the world. Let us individually and together similarly raise our voices against the crimes against humanity that are taking place behind the walls and barbed wire of North Korea's labor camps, where some one in four people die each year--starved to death, or worked to death, or executed.  Let it not be said by future generations that though we knew enough, we did not care enough to condemn and to lend our efforts to end this brutal system.  Several news organizations have reported or commented on this new information about North Korea's prison camps. I commend to the Senate's attention two recent such writings. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial, and a commentary by Fred Hiatt, both from the Washington Post, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 12, 2012]          Turning a Blind Eye to North Korea's `Hidden Gulag'                              (Editorial)       While attention focused on North Korea this week ahead of      Friday morning's missile launch, hundreds of Americans,      Koreans, Japanese and others gathered in Washington to      examine a different aspect of life in that communist nation:      its ``hidden gulag.''       That was the title of an unprecedented conference organized      by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK)      and the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of      Human Rights. The gulag is a network of labor camps that      houses 150,000 to 200,000 prisoners. They are generally      arrested for no crime, sent away with no trial, never again      allowed to communicate with anyone outside the camps, fed on      starvation rations and forced to work until they die. Other      than from one camp, according to South Korean expert Yoon      Yeo-sang, no one deported to North Korea's gulag is ever      released.       As noted by Blaine Harden, author of the recently published      book ``Escape from Camp 14,'' the North Korean gulag has      existed twice as long as did the Soviet network of labor      camps created by Lenin and Stalin, and 12 times as long as      Hitler's concentration camps. Yet, for the most part,      ``Americans don't know anything about these camps,'' Mr.      Harden said. ``They don't know they exist.''       This is not, the title of the conference notwithstanding,      because the gulag is all that hidden, although North Korea's      regime continues to deny its existence. In fact, as David      Hawk said, a great deal is known about the camps, both from      the testimony of those who have escaped and from satellite      imagery. Mr. Hawk has just published the second edition of      his definitive survey, also called ``The Hidden Gulag,''      which draws on horrifying testimony from 60 former prisoners.       The reason for the ignorance is mostly political. The      United States, with a goal of keeping the peace and depriving      North Korea of nuclear weapons, has not made human rights a      priority. In South Korea, the gulag has been a political      football between left-wing politicians favoring warmer ties      with the North and right-wing politicians pushing a harder      line. China, North Korea's neighbor to the north and west,      abuses the human rights of its own population and does not      believe any country's freedom to abuse its population in the      same way should be interfered with.       China, in fact, is complicit in North Korea's abuses, since      it sends many defectors who have made it across the Yalu      River back into North Korea, where they face punishment or,      if they are repeat escapees, execution. North Korean women      who have become pregnant in China often are forced to abort      their children. ``In cases where the pregnancy is too      advanced, guards beat the infants to death or bury them alive      after they are born,'' writes Roberta Cohen, the chair of      HRNK.       Inevitably, there remains much that is unknown. It's      impossible to be confident of a population count for the      gulag, Mr. Hawk said, because it's not clear whether deaths      are outpacing deportations.       Enough is known, however, for indifference to be      inexcusable. As a first step, the United Nations could      establish a commission of inquiry to investigate crimes      against humanity taking place inside the prison camps. As Ms.      Cohen said, ``It is not just nuclear weapons that have to be      dismantled but an entire system of political repression.''                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 25, 2012]North Korea's Dehumanizing Treatment of Its Citizens Is Hiding in Plain                                  Sight                            (By Fred Hiatt)       With President Obama in Korea this week, we will hear a lot      about the dangers of North Korea's nuclear aspirations.       We're unlikely to hear about a young man named Shin Dong-     hyuk, who was bred, like a farm animal, inside a North Korean      prison camp after guards ordered his prisoner-parents to      mate. But Shin arguably has as much to teach about Korea's      past and future as about the cycle of negotiation, bluster      and broken promises over the nuclear issue.       ``Shin was born a slave and raised behind a high-voltage      barbed-wire fence.''       So writes Blaine Harden, a former East Asia correspondent      for The Post, in a soon-to-be-published account of Shin's      life, ``Escape from Camp 14.''       Harden describes a closed world of unimaginable bleakness.      We often speak of someone so unfortunate as to grow up ``not      knowing love.'' Shin grew up literally not understanding      concepts such as love, trust or kindness. His life consisted      of beatings, hunger and labor. His only ethos was to obey      guards, snitch on fellow inmates and steal food when he      could. At age 14, he watched his mother and older brother      executed, a display that elicited in him no pity or regret.      He was raised to work until he died, probably around age 40.      He knew no contemporaries who had experienced life outside      Camp 14.       At 23, Shin escaped and managed, over the course of four      years, to make his way through a hungry North Korea--a      larger, more chaotic version of Camp 14--into China and,      eventually, the United States. He is, as far as is known, the      only person born in the North Korean gulag to escape to      freedom.       Improbably, his tale becomes even more gripping after his      unprecedented journey, after he realizes that he has been      raised as something less than human. He gradually,      haltingly--and, so far, with mixed success--sets out to      remake himself as a moral, feeling human being.       How is this tale even possible in the 21st century, the era      of ``Never Again,'' of the United Nations proudly (in 2005)      declaring that all nations have a ``responsibility to      protect'' civilian populations abused by their own      governments?       ``Fashioning a comprehensive policy to deal with North      Korea's nuclear programs, its human rights abuses, and its      failed economy is hardly child's play,'' explains Victor Cha,      a Georgetown University professor, in his forthcoming book,      ``The Impossible State.'' ``No administration thus far has      been successful at addressing one, let alone all three.''       Cha, who helped shape Korea policy on the National Security      Council under President George W. Bush, describes a nation      where schoolchildren learn grammatical conjugations by      reciting ``We killed Americans,'' ``We are killing      Americans,'' ``We will kill Americans.''       With 25 million people, it is a failed state in every way      but one, which is coddling the regime and a small elite that      resembles a criminal syndicate more than a traditional      bureaucracy. While cautioning that predictions are risky, Cha      argues that ``the end is near.'' The next U.S. presidential      term, he predicts, is likely to face ``a major crisis of the      state in North Korea, and potentially unification.''       When that happens, ``what is likely to be revealed is one      of the worst human rights disasters in modern times.''       Only, as both books make clear, it won't be much of a      revelation. Harden points out that North Korea's labor camps      ``have now existed twice as long as the Soviet gulag and      about twelve times longer than the Nazi concentration      camps.'' They are easily identified in satellite photographs.      One is larger than the city of Los Angeles. Altogether they      house about 200,000 people.       They are visible, in other words, but people do not want to      see them, and Shin's story helps explain why.       It's no surprise that China, with its own gulag      archipelago, objects to any suggestion that a government      can't abuse its citizens as it pleases.       But South Koreans, living in freedom, also fear a North      Korean collapse--not only for the potential financial cost      but also because they sense how different their erstwhile      countrymen have become. Not all North Koreans live as stunted      a life as Shin did inside Camp 14, but generations of      isolation, propaganda and warped morality take a toll. And 20      years of post-Soviet experience have taught us that civic      virtues can be far more difficult to rekindle than private      markets or democratic forms.       When he watched his teacher beat a six-year-old classmate      to death for stealing five grains of corn, Shin says he      ``didn't think much about it.''       ``I did not know about sympathy or sadness,'' he says.      ``Now that I am out, I am learning to be emotional. I have      learned to cry. I feel like I am becoming human.''       But seven years after his escape, Harden writes, Shin does      not believe he has reached that goal. ``I escaped      physically,'' he says. ``I haven't escaped psychologically.''                          ____________________
