Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 340) expressing the grave disapproval of the House of Representatives regarding the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of Kelo et al. v. City of New London et al. that nullifies the protections afforded private property owners in the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 340       Whereas the takings clause of the fifth amendment states      ``nor shall private property be taken for public use, without      just compensation'';       Whereas upon adoption, the 14th amendment extended the      application of the fifth amendment to each and every State      and local government;       Whereas the takings clause of the 5th amendment has      historically been interpreted and applied by the Supreme      Court to be conditioned upon the necessity that Government      assumption of private property through eminent domain must be      for the public use and requires just compensation;       Whereas the opinion of the majority in Kelo et al. v. City      of New London et al. renders the public use provision in the      Takings Clause of the fifth amendment without meaning;       Whereas the opinion of the majority in Kelo et al. v. City      of New London et al. justifies the forfeiture of a person's      private property through eminent domain for the sole benefit      of another private person;       Whereas the dissenting opinion upholds the historical      interpretation of the takings clause and affirms that ``the      public use requirement imposes a more basic limitation upon      government, circumscribing the very scope of the eminent      domain power: Government may compel an individual to forfeit      her property for the public's use, but not for the benefit of      another private person'';       Whereas the dissenting opinion in Kelo et al. v. City of      New London et al. holds that the ``standard this Court has      adopted for the Public Use Clause is therefore deeply      perverse'' and the beneficiaries of this decision are      ``likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence      and power in the political process, including large      corporations and development firms'' and ``the government now      has license to transfer property from those with fewer      resources to those with more''; and       Whereas all levels of government have a Constitutional      responsibility and a moral obligation to always defend the      property rights of individuals and to only execute its power      of eminent domain for the good of public use and contingent      upon the just compensation to the individual property owner:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) the House of Representatives--       (A) disagrees with the majority opinion in Kelo et al. v.      City of New London et al. and its holdings that effectively      negate the public use requirement of the takings clause; and       (B) agrees with the dissenting opinion in Kelo et al. v.      City of New London et al. in its upholding of the historical      interpretation of the takings clause and its deference to the      rights of individuals and their property; and       (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--       (A) State and local governments should only execute the      power of eminent domain for those purposes that serve the      public good in accordance with the fifth amendment;       (B) State and local governments must always justly      compensate those individuals whose property is assumed      through eminent domain in accordance with the fifth      amendment;       (C) any execution of eminent domain by State and local      government that does not comply with subparagraphs (A) and      (B) constitutes an abuse of government power and an      usurpation of the individual property rights as defined in      the fifth amendment;       (D) eminent domain should never be used to advantage one      private party over another;       (E) no State nor local government should construe the      holdings of Kelo et al. v. City of New London et al. as      justification to abuse the power of eminent domain; and       (F) Congress maintains the prerogative and reserves the      right to address through legislation any abuses of eminent      domain by State and local government in light of the ruling      in Kelo et al. v. City of New London et al.
