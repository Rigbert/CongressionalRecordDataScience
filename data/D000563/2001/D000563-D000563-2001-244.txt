President, if my colleagues followed the debate this evening, they know John Graham's views on science really are not in the mainstream by any stretch. He has made statements that pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables are not a public hazard. He has some theory described as irresponsible and inaccurate: Dioxin somehow cures cancer and does not cause cancer.  He questions whether or not DDT should have been banned, and this is the man who will be in charge of the agency which has the last word on rules and regulations for public health and safety and environmental protection.  We can do better in America. President Bush can do better. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Lieberman, Kerry, and myself in opposing this nomination.
