 President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others, as an original cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution 46.  Yesterday two suicide terrorist bombers blew themselves up in the Mahane Yehuda open-air marketplace in the center of Jerusalem. These bombs were clearly timed to do the maximum possible damage. They exploded seconds apart at about 1 p.m. local time, at the height of the lunchtime shopping hour. Initial reports indicate that at least 18 people were killed and over 100 were injured.  This was a despicable, bloodthirsty act, which all of us stand and condemn in one voice. It is not yet known exactly who perpetrated the bombing, but it bears great similarity to attacks conducted in the past by the Palestinian extremist groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Whoever bears guilt for this terrible crime is beneath contempt.  We join Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Weizman, and the Israeli people in mourning those who were murdered yesterday, and we offer our deepest condolences to their families. To the wounded, we offer our prayers and hopes for their full recovery.  Sadly, Israelis have become all too familiar with having their daily routines shattered by the sudden bloodshed and carnage of bombings in seemingly ordinary places--on a bus, in a marketplace, in park or a cafe. On top of all the other tragic aspects of these bombings, the way Israelis are forced to live with the knowledge that their world could be blown apart at any instant is a peculiar kind of torture.  President Clinton was exactly right when he said yesterday morning that this bomb was aimed not only at innocent Israeli civilians, but also at all those in the Middle East who genuinely desire peace. And I fear that this bombing, because of its timing and location, could be as damaging to prospects for peace as any that we have seen.  The timing could hardly have been worse. The President's Special Middle East Coordinator, Dennis Ross, was about to travel to Israel to try to breathe new life into the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been suspended for many months, but which were just beginning to show signs of resuming. In fact, there is good reason to believe that this attack was timed specifically to disrupt Mr. Ross's trip and the impending resumption of the peace talks. Now it may be weeks or months before these talks can resume and be productive. For the extremists, the greatest danger is that the talks could make progress, and they are obviously willing to do anything to prevent it.  This bombing also has ramifications for our work. On August 12, the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act will expire. This act provided the legislative framework for U.S. involvement in the peace process by giving the President the authority to provide assistance to the Palestinian Authority, allow thePLO to operate an office in Washington, and waive other restrictions on United States-Palestinian contacts, if he certifies that the Palestinian Authority is fulfilling its commitments.  I had hoped that the House and Senate leadership would work with those of us who care deeply about this issue to pass a short-term extension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, so that it does not expire while the Congress is in recess next month. There are many Members, myself included, who believe that the act needs to be reworked to establish a tougher standard of compliance, before it is extended for the long term. But a short-term extension of 60 or 90 days would give us the opportunity to negotiate a meaningful new version of the law, without this important legislation lapsing for a matter of weeks, or even months.  Now, under these circumstances, I do not think it will be possible to pass to a short-term extension in the short time remaining before the August recess. I hope that we will be able to negotiate an appropriate replacement for the current Middle East Peace Facilitation Act shortly after the recess in September.  The location of this bombing also makes it deeply resonant. The Mahane Yehuda marketplace is in the heart of downtown Jerusalem. It is a place where every Israeli has spent time, and many Jerusalemites visit or pass through it daily. It will be difficult to recover from an attack in such a central and symbolic place, and the Israeli Government will find it difficult to engage in peace talks while this memory is fresh.  What will it take to recover from this bombing? Before anything else can take place, it will take action by the Palestinian Authority. First and foremost, the Palestinian Authority should resume security cooperation with the Israeli government to the full extent that they had cooperated before. At one time, in 1995 and part of 1996, Israeli an Palestinian security cooperation reached unprecedented levels. This cooperation reflected a mutual understanding in the shared stake both sides had in preventing acts of terrorism by extremists bent on destroying the peace process.  That shared stake still exists today, but the Palestinian leadership must recognize it and act upon it. Even if the Palestinians are angered by some Israeli actions, that does not change the mutual interest they have in preventing terrorism. Because if anything will stop the peace process from achieving the aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis, terrorism will.  Second, the Palestinian Authority must reinvigorate its efforts to root out terrorist groups in the areas under its control. This effort has been spotty, at best, and Palestinian officials, including Chairman Arafat, have been rightly criticized for giving less than clear signals that terrorism will not be tolerated under any circumstances. This is not acceptable. An unequivocal red light against terrorism and the operations of terrorist groups--a no-tolerance policy--is the only thing that is acceptable.  Chairman Arafat called Prime Minister Netanyahu shortly after the bombing to condemn the attack, which is the right thing for him to have done. But he must not and cannot stop there. He should condemn publicly in the strongest possible language--in English and Arabic--these bombings and all other acts of terrorism. He should instruct his security forces to dismantle the infrastructure of the terrorist groups, arresting those who are complicit in the conduct of terrorist attacks. He should use his bully pulpit to insist that Palestinian society rejects the elements who believe their aspirations--or martyrdom--can be attained by killing Israelis. If he fails to take these steps, there can be no peace process, and Palestinian aspirations will never be realized.  Finally, when the security situation is more stabilized, both sides must resume peace talks with a view toward meeting only their own needs, but the needs of the other side as well. If these talks are seen in purely zero-sum terms, they will go nowhere. Both sides must make their demands--on Israel's further redeployments in the West Bank, and on final status issues like Jerusalem, settlements, refugees, and sovereignty--with the understanding that if the other side has no stake in the process, there will be no final status agreement that brings about a lasting peace.  Clearly the peace process cannot coexist with terrorism. But despite yesterday's tragic and criminal bombing, the logic of this peace process, and the fundamental need for peace between Israelis and Palestinians has not changed. To give up on this effort would condemn future generations of Israelis to controlling a hostile population of over 2 million, to the detriment of Israel's long-term security and well-being. It would also bury Palestinian dreams of self-determination.  To turn away now from the search for peace would be to reward the extremists for their acts of violence and terrorism. It would be a victory for the barbaric suicide bombers of Mahane Yehuda. It would say to them: ``You were right. You win. There cannot and shall not be peace between Israelis and Palestinians.''  Neither Israelis nor Palestinians--nor the United States--can afford for that to happen.                          ____________________
