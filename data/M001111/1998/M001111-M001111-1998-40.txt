 None of us wants that to happen.  The Childsafe Internet bill is the right way to go. It allows local schools districts to make important decisions about Internet content. It is a common sense solution. We have provided this Internet access through the E-rate. Now we must finish the job by providing our teachers and parents with the right tools to help educate our children.  Most parents would not send a child to a playground in their local community unsupervised. We cannot allow our young children to be in the Internet unsupervised.  Lets give our teachers and librarians some help, our parents some control, and truly pass legislation that will protect America's next generation.  I yield the floor.
