 President, I rise today to address a recent trade dispute which threatens tens of thousands of American jobs and hundreds of millions in American exports.  On February 19, the Russian Government notified us that it will soon stop importing poultry products if its complaints about American food safety standards are not met. On top of this, what little will enter Russia these next few weeks will be subject to a sharp increase in their taxes on imported poultry.  American poultry exports to Russia--our largest poultry export customer--total more than $700 million a year and represent over 20 percent of all American exports to Russia.  Mr. President, the Delmarva Peninsula is home to 21,000 poultry workers, produces more than 600 million birds per year, and is a major supplier to the Russian poultry market. Last summer, for example, Allen's Family Food, of Seaford, DE, exported 1,300 tons of frozen poultry to Russia.  At one time or another, I have probably met with every poultry grower and processor in my State of Delaware. I've seen every step in the process, from the poultry house to the packaging plant to the freezers at the Port of Wilmington. I'll put the Delaware poultry industry up against any foreign or domestic challenger in terms of sanitary standards, particularly any Russian plant.   But teams of Russian inspectors have come into our country, into our poultry processing facilities--including plants such as Manor Farms and Allen's Foods in my own State of Delaware--and have failed each and every operation. Literally a 100 percent failure rate.  I find this simply unbelievable. This tells me that their real agenda is not health and safety. We demand the same standards for the poultry we ship to Russia as we do for poultry which shows up in American supermarkets and on our kitchen tables every day.  That's why in recent years, Russia's consumers, particularly in the great urban centers such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, have bought more and more poultry products from America. They recognize a good value when they see it. We can produce better tasting, more nutritious, less expensive poultry in America, and ship it to Russia, for a lower price than the current Russian poultry industry can. They are still struggling to get out from under the inefficiencies of the old economic system.  If this ban goes into effect, Mr. President, the Russian people will lose a major high-quality supplier for a popular staple of their diet, and their food bills will go up.  The last thing that the Russian economy needs now is an increase in the price of an important food commodity. It is largely because of inflation that the ruble, and with it the Russian economy, is in so much trouble already.  And if this ban goes into effect, Mr. President, American poultry growers and processors, in Delaware and in the rest of the country, will be denied access to an important market. They have earned their place on the shelves of Russian stores through their hard work, know-how, and efficiency. They should not be shut out by some bureaucrats' arbitrary ruling.  Now, Mr. President, I understand that there are a lot of things going on behind the decision to ban American poultry exports. There is the still powerful pull of the old bureaucratic ways--old habits are hard to break, especially when it comes to protecting domestic industries from the new experience of foreign competition.  Here is a good example of how our domestic industry, which has grown up in a highly competitive environment, can do well in international markets. It's no wonder the Russian domestic poultry industry wants some protection, even if it means higher costs and lower quality for Russian consumers.  Mr. President, here in the United States, arguably the freest market in the world, we are in the midst of a heated national debate on international trade and competition. Just imagine what they are going through in the states of the former Soviet Union, where competition on the basis of quality and price is a new concept.  And this is a Presidential election year over there, too. I know that I don't have to explain how the elimination of a major foreign competitor could fit into an election year agricultural policy.  But that is no excuse for the Russian Government's action against American poultry producers. We cannot allow this decision to stand.  I have spoken to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman directly, and I applaud the effort he and his negotiating team have made to resolve this dispute.  The Russian Government must be made to understand that these steps against the United States poultry industry are steps away from the international economic community they tell us they are eager to join.  The IMF has just announced another loan to Russia, worth $10.2 billion. This money is intended to smooth the transition from the old Communist command economy to a more efficient, open, market economy. The terms of the loan include requirements that the Russians continue to reform their economy.  And as the Russians are well aware, the terms of the loan provide for monthly installments over those 3 years. Evidence of backsliding, of reneging on commitments to open the Russian economy, could be grounds for terminating the loan at any point.  Russia tells us that they want to join the World Trade Organization and America has supported their application to join the WTO. As a matter of fact, right now the United States has a representative on the WTO working group that must approve Russia's trade practices.  Our representative must make crystal clear to the Russians that actions like the bogus ban on American poultry imports violates the spirit and the letter of international agreements, such as the WTO.  I can't imagine they would want this stain on their record when they come to argue that they are ready to undertake the responsibilities of full participation in the international trading system.  But, because this review process could take up to a year, I am asking President Clinton to appoint an interagency working group to investigate immediate retaliatory trade actions against the Russians.  I sincerely hope that before any such retaliation becomes necessary, we can convince the Russian Government to turn back from the course that they have announced.                          ____________________
