Now the gentleman may have more information than I have, but if that is the fact, I don't have that information. At this point in time, I was not aware of any such problem.  The only problem I was aware of, as I informed the gentleman, we can either do this by asking for unanimous consent to effect the process of taking the Senate bill, substituting the House bill, and then requesting the conference and appointing conferees by unanimous consent. Or, failing to get unanimous consent, we have to do that by rule. We did not get unanimous consent. The Rules Committee met today. We will consider that rule and the bill itself on Monday late afternoon, early evening.
