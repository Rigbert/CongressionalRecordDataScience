We asked for unanimous consent so we could continue to work on this amendment. I only addressed the cash on hand.  I agree completely with the Senator from Connecticut when it comes to the increased hard money contribution. I hope to address that in my technical amendment, if not in conference. I agree with him completely on the point. We have not had the time this morning to include that.  Mr. McCONNELL. If ever that were a faulty excuse, this is the time. This was the first amendment adopted 2 weeks ago and the Senator from Illinois is here at the last minute trying to unravel an amendment that got 70 votes. A Domenici amendment was passed 70-30 2 weeks ago and here at the last minute we are trying to unravel it.  It is no surprise that there is some confusion about what is going on. My conclusion is that a vote that got 70 Members of the Senate maybe ought to stand. I think the Durbin amendment should be opposed.                     Amendment No. 164, as Modified
