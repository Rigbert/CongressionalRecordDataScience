 President, today we are introducing the Tax Administration Good Government Act.  The legislation contains five major components. First, it provides additional safeguards for taxpayers. Second, the legislation significantly simplifies the current interest and penalty regimes. Third, the Act also includes the proposals passed out of the Finance Committee on April 2, 2003 and included in a bill introduced by Senators Hatch and Breaux to modernize the United States Tax Court.  Fourth, our legislation also includes several provisions, some of which were requested by the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation, to strike an appropriate balance in protecting taxpayer confidentiality through disclosure reforms. Finally, the legislation takes a small, but important step toward simplification of the tax code through the elimination of obsolete provisions.  We have worked closely with the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the National Taxpayer Advocate and the Joint Committee on Taxation to develop this package of proposals to promote good government in the administration of our tax code.  Congress's responsibility for the tax system does not stop after we pass tax law changes. We have an oversight responsibility to ensure that taxpayer rights are protected, that our tax laws are not administered counter to Congressional intent, that the judicialbody with primary jurisdiction over the tax laws has the tools necessary to provide independent review of controversies between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service, and to take steps to simplify the tax code whenever possible.  It is our intention to pass a package of tax administration good government proposals out of the Finance Committee in the coming months. We urge our colleagues to support this important legislation.  We also submit for the Record a more detailed description of the specific provisions included in the Tax Administration Good Government Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the description be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 882       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The IRS imposes a $43 user fee on      taxpayers entering into an installment agreement. The      proposal would waive the user fee if the taxpayer agrees to      automated withdrawal of installment payments from a bank      account. This proposal will help facilitate collection      through automated withdrawals.       Authorize partial pay installment agreements. The proposal      restores authority that the IRS had prior to 1998 to allow      IRS to enter into installment agreements with taxpayers that      want to resolve their tax liability but cannot afford to make      payments large enough to fully pay the liability at the end      of the term of the installment agreement. The proposal would      permit the collection of taxes from cases that are otherwise      placed in the currently not collectible inventory.       Terminate installment agreements for failure to file      returns and failure to make tax deposits. The proposal would      stop the downward spiral where taxpayers owe more and the      Government collects less. Although a significant number of      taxpayers violate the terms of their installment agreements      by failing to timely file their tax returns or make required      Federal tax deposits, the IRS is not permitted to terminate      installment agreements for these reasons.       Remove $50,000 threshold requirement for office of chief      counsel review of offers in compromise--IRC section 7122(b).      The proposal would remove the dollar threshold and give IRS      discretion in determining when a Chief Counsel opinion is      necessary. IRS attorneys are presently required to review      offers where the tax assessed, including penalties and      interest, exceeds $50,000. As a practical matter, IRS lawyer      offer little in the way of review and often contribute to the      delay in processing OICs.       Seven-day threshold on tolling of statute of limitations      during National Taxpayer Advocate review. The proposal      provides additional time, without tolling the statute of      limitations, for review by the National Taxpayer Advocate for      taxpayer assistance orders.       Increase Penalty for Bad Checks. Proposal would increase      penalty for bad checks to $20 or 2 % of amount over $1,000.       Allow the Financial Management Service to Retain      Transaction Fees from Levied Amounts. Proposal would allow      FMS to retain directly a portion of the levied funds as      payment of FMS fees. A delinquent taxpayer, however, would      receive full credit for the amount levied upon (i.e., the      amount credited to a taxpayer's account would not be reduced      by FMS's fee). The IRS pays FMS fees out of its own      appropriations. The proposal would alter internal government      accounting and allow the use of appropriated funds to      administer the tax system.       Elimination or Restriction on Offsetting Refunds from      former residents. The proposal would allow States to offset      Federal tax refunds owed by former residents. In 1998,      Congress authorized the state refund offset program. However,      the provision did not authorize states to offset Federal tax      refunds for State tax debts owed by former residents who had      subsequently moved to another State. Former residents have      the same safeguards as residents in these situations and      there is strong precedence that clearly gives States      authority to impose and collect taxes on former residents.     Processing and Personnel       Explanation of Statute of Limitations and Consequences of      Failure to Timely File. The proposal would require the IRS to      provide taxpayers with an explanation of the consequences of      failing to timely file refund claims.       Disclosure of tax information to facilitate combined      employment tax reporting. The proposal would expand and make      permanent the disclosure authority of the IRS to permit      disclosures of name, address, taxpayer identification number,      and signature to any State entity for purposes of carrying      out a combined federal and state employment tax reporting      program. Under current law, no tax information may be      furnished by the Internal Revenue Service to another agency      except as permitted under section 6103 which requires the      other agency to establish procedural safeguards satisfactory      to the IRS. A pilot program was established in 1997 in the      State of Montana to assess the feasibility and desirability      of expanding combined reporting. Reports from Montana were      very positive about the program.       Expansion of declaratory judgment remedy to tax-exempt      organizations. The proposal would extend declaratory judgment      procedures similar to those currently available only to      charities under section 7428 to other section 501(c)      determinations. The proposal would limit jurisdiction over      controversies involving such determinations to the United      States Tax Court. In addition, the proposal would modify the      present-law declaratory judgment procedures to provide that      an organization is deemed to have exhausted its      administrative remedies under the declaratory judgment      procedures at the expiration of (1) 270 days after the date      on which the request for a determination was made, or (2) in      the case of a failure by any office of the IRS to make a      determination (other than the office responsible for initial      determinations with respect to the issue), 450 days after the      date on which the request for a determination was made.      The proposal would also require the organization to take,      in a timely manner, all reasonable steps to secure such      determination.       Amendment to Treasury auction reforms. The proposal would      permit earlier disclosure upon the release by the Secretary      of the minutes of the meeting. Under current law, members of      the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee are prohibited from      disclosing anything relating to the securities to be      auctioned in a midquarter refunding by the Secretary until      the Secretary makes a public announcement of the refunding.       Revisions relating to termination of employment of IRS      employee misconduct. Proposal would modify section 1203 by      removing the late filing of refund returns from the list of      violations and removing employee versus employee acts (i.e.      for violation of an employee's rather than a taxpayer's      Constitutional or civil rights) from the list of violations.       IRS Oversight Board approval of use of critical pay      authority. The proposal would require IRS Oversight Board      review and approve the use of critical pay authority.      Critical pay allows the IRS to hire employees critical to the      mission of the IRS as well as allow the IRS to hire up to 40      individuals for four year terms under streamlined procedures.       Low-income taxpayer clinics. The proposal would increase      the authorization for low-income taxpayer controversy clinics      to $10 million and authorize a similar grant program for low-     income taxpayer preparation clinics for $10 million. The      proposal would specify that grants may not be used for any      purpose other than those specified in the Code (this      restriction would be inapplicable to funds from other      sources). The proposal would also authorize the IRS to      promote the benefits and encourage the use of low-income      taxpayer clinics.       Enrolled agents. The proposal would add a new section to      the Code permitting the Secretary to prescribe regulations to      regulate the conduct of enrolled agents in regard to their      practice before the IRS and to permit enrolled agents meeting      the Secretary's qualifications to use the credentials or      designation ``enrolled agent'', ``EA'', or ``E.A.''.       Establishment of disaster response team. Proposal would      require the IRS to establish a permanent Disaster Response      Team which, in coordination with the Federal Emergency      Management Agency, is to assist taxpayers in clarifying and      resolving tax matters associated with a Presidentially      declared disaster or a terroristic or military action. The      Team is to be staffed by IRS employees with a relevant      knowledge and experience, including a representative from the      Office of the Taxpayer Advocate.       Accelerated tax refunds. Proposal would require the      Secretary of Treasury to study and report to the tax writing      committees on options to accelerate tax refunds for taxpayers      who maintain the same filing characteristics and elect the      direct option for any refund.       Study on clarifying record-keeping responsibilities. The      proposal would require the Secretary of the Treasury to study      the scope of records required to be maintained by taxpayers,      the utility of requiring taxpayers to maintain records      indefinitely, the taxpayer burden incurred by such      requirement given the necessity to upgrade technological      storage for outdated records, the number of negotiated      records retention agreements requested by taxpayers and the      number entered into by the IRS, and proposals regarding      taxpayer record-keeping. Under current law, every person      liable for any tax imposed by the Code, or for any collection      thereof, shall keep such records as the Secretary of the      Treasury may from time to time prescribe.       Streamline National Taxpayer Advocate Annual Reports. Each      year, the National Taxpayer Advocate is required to issue two      reports to Congress: (1) an annual report on     objectives of the Advocate for the year due June 30 and (2)      an annual report on the Advocate's activities including the      20 most serious problems confronting taxpayers. The      Advocate's office spends an enormous amount of time and      effort preparing these reports. The proposal would streamline      the reporting process by requiring the Advocate to issue only      one report each year.       Penalty on failure to report interests in foreign financial      accounts. The proposal would establish a $5,000 penalty for      non-willful failure to report interest in foreign bank      accounts. Under present law there is only a penalty of      $25,000 for willful failures.       Repeal of personal holding company tax. The proposal would      repeal the personal holding company (PHC) tax. Subsequent      changes in the tax code resulted in the provisions      ineffectiveness as originally intended.           II. Simplification of Interest and Penalty Regimes       Individual estimated tax. The proposal simplifies the      individual estmated tax penalty including, increase the      penalty threshold for individuals to $2,000 from $1,000;      apply one interest rate per estimated tax underpayment; and      adopt 365-day year.       Corporate estimated tax. The proposal simplifies the      corporate estimated tax penalty by increasing the exception      for small amount of tax shown on the return from less than      $500 to less than $1,000.       Increase in large corporation threshold for estimated tax      payments. The proposal simplifies the corporate estimated tax      by expanding the safe harbor exception used by small      corporations by increasing the threshold from $1 million to      $1.5 million of taxable income.       Expansion of interest abatement. The proposal would: (1)      expand the circumstances in which interest may be abated to      include periods attributable to any unreasonable IRS error or      delay and (2) allow the abatement of interest to the extent      interest is attributable to the taxpayer's reliance on      written statement by the IRS.       Deposits made to stop the running of interest. Proposal      would permit deposits to be made to an interest bearing      account within Treasury to cover tax underpayments related to      issues potentially subject to dispute with the IRS.       Freeze provision regarding suspension of interest where      Secretary fails to contact taxpayer. The proposal would      repeal current law which requires the suspension of interest      on taxes owed until 21 days after the IRS sends a notice of      deficiency. The suspension is triggered if the IRS fails to      contact the taxpayer within 1 year for taxable years after      January 1, 2004 or 18 months for taxable years before January      1, 2004. The proposal is unnecessary with expanded interest      abatement.       Expansion of interest netting. Applies interest netting      rules without regard to the 45-day period in which the      Secretary may refund an overpayment of tax without the      payment of interest.       Clarification of application of Federal tax deposit      penalty. The proposal would clarify that the 10 percent      penalty rate only applies in cases where the failure to      deposit extends for more than 15 days.       Frivolous tax submissions. The proposal would increase the      penalty for frivolous tax returns from $500 to $5,000. In      addition, the proposal would permit the IRS to dismiss      requests for Collection Due Process hearings, installment      agreements, offers-in-compromise, and taxpayer assistance      orders if they are based on frivolous arguments or are      intended to delay or impede tax administration. Individuals      submitting such requests are subject to a $5,000 penalty for      repeat behavior or failure to withdraw the request after      being given the opportunity to do so.                   iii. u.s. tax court modernization       Jurisdiction of Tax Court over collection due process      cases. Currently, if a taxpayer's underlying tax liability      does not relate to income taxes or a type of tax over which      the Tax Court normally has deficiency jurisdiction, there is      no opportunity for Tax Court review and the taxpayer must      file in a District Court to obtain review. This provision      consolidates judicial review of collection due process      activity in the Tax Court.       Authority for special trial judges to hear and decide      certain employment status cases. This provision clarifies      that the Tax Court may authorize its special trial judges to      enter decisions in employment status cases that are subject      to small case proceedings under section 7436(c).       Confirmation of authority of Tax Court to apply doctrine of      equitable recoupment. The common-law principle of equitable      recoupment permits a party to asset an otherwise time-barred      claim to reduce or defeat an opponent's claim if both claims      arise from the same transaction. This provision confirms      statutorily that the Tax Court may apply equitable recoupment      principles to the same extent as District Court and the Court      of Federal Claims.       Tax Court filing fee in all cases commenced by filing      petition. This provision clarifies, in keeping with current      Tax Court procedure, that the Tax Court is authorized to      impose a $60 filing fee for all cases commenced by petition.      The proposal would eliminate the need to amend section 7451      each time the Tax Court is granted new jurisdiction.       Amendments to appoint employees. Currently, the Tax Court      has to go to the executive branch, the Office of Personnel      Management, to change a position. It is inappropriate to      require the Tax Court to seek permission from the executive      since that branch is a party (Commissioner of Internal      Revenue) before the Tax Court. This change would allow the      Tax Court to be independent in fact and perception from the      Executive Branch while ensuring that basic employee rights,      protections, and remedies are retained or required in an      appropriate way (e.g., whistleblower protection, civil      rights, merit system principles, etc.).       Expanded use of Tax Court practice fee for pro se      taxpayers. The Tax Court is authorized to charge      practitioners a fee of up to $30 per year and to use these      fees to pursue disciplinary matters. The provision expands      use of these fees to provide services to pro se taxpayers.      Fees could be used for education programs for pro se      taxpayers.       Annuities for survivors of Tax Court judges who are      assassinated. The reality is that many people do not like to      pay taxes. there is as much risk of a Tax Court judge being      assassinated as any other Federal judge. The proposal would      conform the treatment of Tax Court judges to District Court      judges.       Cost-of-living adjustments for Tax Court judicial survivor      annuities. All Federal employees have this provision except      the Tax Court. Survivors of Tax Court judges are subject to      an obsolete method of indexing.       Life insurance coverage for Tax Court judges. This simply      codifies current Office of Personnel Management      interpretation, as was previously done for District Court      judges.       Cost of life insurance coverage for Tax Court judges age 65      or over. Congress established the Tax Court in 1969 and      required that Tax Court judges receive the same compensation      as District Court judges. The District Court judges were      given this benefit to ensure that there was no diminution of      their compensation (as required by the Constitution). This      provision is in keeping with the original intent of Congress.       Modification of timing of lump-sum payment of judge's      accrued annual leave. District Court judges are allowed to      receive a lump-sum payment due to the life-time tenure of      Article III judges. Tax Court judges, while they have a 15      year term, effectively have a life-time term because they are      always subject to recall.       Participation of Tax Court judges in the Thrift Savings      Plan. The proposal would allow Tax Court judges to      participate in Thrift Savings Plan. Currently, only 19      federal government employees are left out of the Thrift      Savings Plan (i.e., Tax Court judges).       Exemption of teaching compensation of retired judges for      limitation on outside earned income. After retirement, Tax      Court judges should have the same ability to teach as      District Court judges.       General provisions relating to magistrate judges of the Tax      Court. ``Magistrate'' is more recognizable to the American      public because it is the term used by Article III courts. The      provision changes the term ``Special Trial Judge'' to      ``Magistrate Judge of the United States Tax Court'' and      provides for alignment of term of office and removal      applicable to District Court magistrate judges.       Annuities to surviving spouses and dependent children of      magistrate judges of the Tax Court. This section gives      Magistrates/Special Trial Judges the same advantages as Tax      Court judges, thus ensuring a greater pool of participants in      the fund.       Retirement and annuity program for magistrate judges. A      retirement and annuity program more aligned with District      Court Magistrates and the Tax Court judges is key for      attracting and retaining qualified judges.       Incumbent magistrate judges of the Tax Court. The provision      provides transition rules similar to those given to the      District Court magistrate judges.       Provisions for recall. Article III judges are ``self-     recalling'' (i.e., they decide for themselves whether they      are recalled or not). In contrast, Tax Court judges are      subject to provisions that authorize mandatory recall by the      Chief Judge. These provisions authorize the recall of      Magistrates/Special Trial judges in a manner similar to those      now applicable to the regular judges of the Court.               iv. confidentiality and disclosure reforms       Clarification of definition of church tax inquiry. The      proposal would clarify that the present-law church tax      inquiry procedures do not apply to contacts made by the IRS      for the purpose of educating churches with respect to the law      governing tax-exempt organizations. For example, the proposal      clarifies that the IRS does not violate the church tax      inquiry procedures when written materials are provided to a      church or churches for the purpose of educating such church      or churches with respect to the types of activities that are      not permissible under section 501(c)(3).       Collection activities with respect to joint return      disclosable to either spouse based on oral request. The      proposal would eliminate the requirement for former spouses      to make a written request for disclosure of collection      activities with respect to a joint return. Under present law,      section 6103(e)(7) permits the IRS to disclose return      information to the same persons who may have access to a      return under the other provisions of section 6103(e), thus      either spouse may obtain return information regarding a joint      return upon oral request.       Taxpayer representatives not subject to examination on sole      basis of representation of taxpayers. The proposal would      clarify that     an IRS employee conducting an examination of a taxpayer is      not authorized to inspect a taxpayer representative's return      or return information solely on the basis of the      representative relationship to the taxpayer. Under the      proposal, the supervisor of the IRS employee would be      required to approve such inspection after making a      determination that other grounds justified such an      inspection. The proposal would not affect the ability of      employees of the IRS Director of Professional Responsibility,      or other employees whose assigned duties concern the      regulation of practice before the IRS, to access returns and      return information of a representative.       Prohibition of disclosure of taxpayer identifying number      with respect to disclosure of accepted offers-in-compromise.      The proposal would prohibit the disclosure of the taxpayer      identification number as part of the publicly available      summaries of accepted offers in compromise.       Compliance by contractors with confidentiality safeguards.      The proposal would require that a State or Federal agency      conduct on-site reviews of all of its contractors receiving      Federal returns and return information every three years.      This review is intended to cover secure storage, restricting      access, computer security, and other safeguards deemed      appropriate by the Secretary. Under the proposal, the State      or Federal agency would be required to submit a report of its      findings to the IRS and certify annually that all contractors      are in compliance with the requirements to safeguard the      confidentiality of Federal returns and return information.       Higher standards for requests for and consents to      disclosure. The proposal would render invalid a consent that      does not designate a recipient or is not dated at the time of      execution. The person submitting the consent to the IRS would      be required to verify under penalties of perjury that the      form was complete and dated at the time it was signed by the      taxpayer. Inspection or disclosure of a return or return      information pursuant to an invalid consent would be      unauthorized under section 6103. Thus, a person making such      unauthorized disclosure or inspection could be liable for      civil damages under section 7431, and criminal penalties      under section 7213 or 7213A for willful unauthorized      disclosure or inspection.       Civil damages for unauthorized inspection or disclosure.      The proposal would require the IRS to notify a taxpayer at      the point of proposed administrative action as to      disciplinary or adverse action against an employee arising      from the unauthorized inspection or disclosure of the      taxpayer's return or return information.       Expanded disclosure in emergency circumstances. The      proposal would permit disclosure to local law enforcement      authorities emergency situations including suicide threats.       Disclosure of taxpayer identity for tax refund purposes.--     On April 15, 2002, about 1.7 million people who did not file      their 1998 income tax return who lose more than $2.3 billion      in tax refunds. When the IRS is unable to find a taxpayer due      a refund, present law provides that it may use ``the press or      other media'' to notify the taxpayer of the refund. The IRS      believes the current statutory framework in Section 6103(m)      does not permit disclosure via the Internet. The proposal      would allow the IRS to use any means of ``mass      communicating,'' including the Internet to notify a taxpayer      of an undelivered refund.       Disclosure to State officials of proposed actions related      to section 501(c) organizations. The proposal provides that      upon written request by an appropriate State officer, the      Secretary may disclose: (1) a notice of proposed refusal to      recognize an organization as a section 501(c)(3)      organization; (2) a notice of proposed revocation of tax-     exemption of a section 501(c)(3) organization; (3) the      issuance of a proposed deficiency of tax imposed under      section 507, chapter 41, or chapter 42; (4) the names,      addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of      organizations that have applied for recognition as section      501(c)(3) organizations; and (5) returns and return      information of organizations with respect to which      information has been disclosed under (1) through (4) above.      Disclosure or inspection is permitted for the purpose of, and      only to the extent necessary in, the administration of State      laws regulating section 501(c)(3) organizations, such as laws      regulating tax-exempt status, charitable trusts, charitable      solicitation, and fraud.       Treatment of public records. The proposal clarifies that      public record data (e.g., press releases re criminal cases)      does not retain 6103 protections in the files of the IRS.       Investigative disclosures. The proposal permits the IRS      Criminal Investigation agents to identify themselves,      organizational affiliation, and criminal nature of      investigation when contacting third parties in writing or in      person.       TIN matching. The proposal permits taxpayer identification      number (TIN) verification by persons required to provide the      information to the IRS (limited to whether information      matches) to permit early error resolution and enhance      compliance. Under present law, over 30 million information      returns are received by the IRS from payors that contain      missing or incorrect name and TIN information. However, the      IRS is only permitted to disclose the error to the payor at      the point at which the payment is subject to backup      withholding.       Form 8300 disclosures. The proposal ensures that the Form      8300 (for reporting transactions in excess of $10,000) can be      disclosed to law enforcement in the same manner as financial      reporting documents required under the Bank Secrecy Act      (under Title 31).    V. SIMPLIFICATION THROUGH ELIMINATION OF INOPERATIVE PROVISIONS       1. Adjustments in tax tables so that inflation will not      result in tax increases. Paragraph (7) of section 1(f) is      amended to read as follows: ``(7) Special rule for certain      brackets--In prescribing tables under paragraph (1) which      apply to taxable years beginning in a calendar year after      1994, the cost-of-living adjustment used in making      adjustments to the dollar amounts at which the 36 percent      bracket begins or at which the 39.6 rate bracket begins shall      be determined under paragraph (3) by substituting `1993' for      `1992'.''       2. Reduced capital gain rates for qualified 5-year gain.      Paragraph (2) of section 1(h) is amended by striking ``In the      case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000,      the'' and inserting ``The''.       3. Credit for producing fuel from nonconventional source.      Section 29 is amended by striking subsection (e).       4. Earned income credit. Paragraph (1) of section 32(b) is      amended by striking subparagraphs (B) and (C) and by striking      ``(A) In General. In the case of taxable years beginning      after 1995:''.       5.

Section 39      is amended by striking subsection (d).       7. Adjustments based on adjusted current earnings. Clause      (ii) of section 56(g)(4)(F) is amended by striking ``In the      case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1992,      clause'' and inserting ``Clause''.       8. Items of tax preference; Depletion. Paragraph (1) of      section 57(a) is amended by striking ``Effective with respect      to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992, this''      and inserting ``This''.       9. Intangible drilling costs. Clause (i) of section      57(a)(E) is amended by striking ``In the case of any taxable      year beginning after December 31, 1992, this'' and inserting      ``This''. Clause (ii) of section 57(a)(2)(E) is amended by      striking ``(30 percent in the case of taxable years beginning      in 1993''.       10. Annuities; certain proceeds of endowment and life      insurance contracts. Paragraph (4) of section 72(c) is      amended by striking ``under the contract'' and all that      follows and inserting'' under the contract.'' Paragraph (3)      of section 72(g) is amended by striking ``January 1, 1954,      or''.       11. Accident and health plans. Section 105(f) is amended by      striking ``or (d)''.       12. Flexible spending arrangements. Section 106(c)(1) is      amended by striking ``Effective on and after January 1, 1997,      gross'' and inserting ``Gross''.       13. Certain combat zone compensation of members of the      Armed Forces.

Principal residence. Section 121(b)(3) is amended by      striking subparagraph (B).       15. Certain reduced uniformed services retirement pay.      Section 112(b)(1) is amended by striking ``after December 31,      1965,''.       16. Great plains conservation program. Section 126(a) is      amended by striking paragraph (6).       17. Mortgage revenue bonds--Federal disaster area      modifications. Eliminate special qualified mortgage bond      rules or residences located in Federal disaster areas.      (utility expired January 1, 1999).       18. Interim authority for governors regarding allocation of      private activity bond volume limits. Eliminate temporary      gubernatorial authority to allocate the volume limit.       19. Treble damage payments under the antitrust law. Section      162(g) is amended by striking the last sentence.       20. State legislators' travel expenses away from home.      Paragraph (4) of section 162(h) is amended by striking ``For      taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, this'' and      inserting ``This''.       21. Interest. Section 163 is amended by striking paragraph      (6) of subsection (d) and paragraph (5) of subsection (h).      Section 56(b)(1)(C) is amended by striking clause (ii) and by      redesignating clauses (iii) and (iv) as clauses (ii) and      (iii) respectively.       22. Charitable, etc., contributions and gifts. Section 170      is amended by striking subsection (k).       23. Amortizable bond premium. Subparagraph (B) of section      171(b)(1) is amended to read as follows:       ``(B)(i) in the case of a bond described in subsection      (a)(2), with reference to the amount payable on maturity or      earlier call date, and       ``(ii) in the case of a bond described in subsection      (a)(1), with reference to the amount payable on maturity (or      if it results in a smaller amortizable bond premium      attributable to the period to earlier call date, with      reference to the amount payable on earlier call date), and''       24. Net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers. Section      172 is amended by striking subparagraph (D) of subsection      (b)(1), subsection (g), and subparagraph (F) of the paragraph      (h)(2).       25. Research and experimental expenditures. Subparagraph      (A) of section 174(a)(2) is amended to read as follows: ``(A)      Without     consent.--A taxpayer may, without the consent of the      Secretary, adopt the method provided in this subsection for      his first taxable year for which expenditures described in      paragraph (l) are paid or incurred.''       26. Amortization of certain research and experimental      expenditures. Paragraph (2) of section 174(b)(2) is amended      by striking ``beginning after December 31, 1953''.       27. Soil and water conservation expenditures. Paragraph (1)      of section 175(d) is amended to read as follows: ``(1)      Without consent.--A taxpayer may, without the consent of the      Secretary, adopt the method provided in this section for his      first taxable year for which expenditures described in      subsection (a) are paid or incurred.''       28. Activities not engaged in for profit. Section 183(e)(1)      is amended by striking the last sentence.       29. Dividends received on certain preferred stock; and      Dividends paid on certain preferred stock of public      utilities. Sections 244 and 247 are repealed. Paragraph (5)      of section 172(d) is amended to read as follows:       ``(5) Computation of deduction for dividends received. The      deductions allowed by section 243 and 245 shall be computed      without regard to section 246(b) (relating to limitation on      aggregate amount of deductions).''       Paragraph (1) of section 243(c) is amended to read as      follows:       ``(1) In General.--In the case of any dividend received      from a 20-percent owned corporation, subsection (a)(1) shall      be applied by substituting `80 percent' for `70 percent'.''       Section 243(d) is amended by striking paragraph (4).
