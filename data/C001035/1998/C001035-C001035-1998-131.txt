President, it was Samuel Johnson who said in 1777 that the knowledge that you will be hanged in a fortnight does wonders to concentrate your mind. In 1998, former Senate Majority Leader and Maine Senator George Mitchell proved the truth of this aphorism by giving the Northern Ireland peace talks a deadline, placing upon these negotiations the equivalent, if you will, of a ``sunset'' provision that left the parties no alternative but finally to come up with a real solution.  This deadline accomplished its purpose: it concentrated their minds wonderfully, and this led directly to the historic Stormont Agreement. Some years ago it scarcely seemed possible to imagine a Northern Ireland in which children could grow up without fear of sectarian violence and bloodshed. Today, however, this brighter future is not only imaginable--it is very nearly here.  That Senator Mitchell should possess such statesmanship and political acumen is, of course, no surprise in my home state of Maine. Senator Micthell is greatly admired in this country for his work on behalf of Maine and on behalf of all Americans. Today, however, the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland--and peace-loving people everywhere--also owe Senator Mitchell a great debt for helping steer these talks to their successful conclusion.  It is my great hope that with his statesmanship and steady hand, Senator Mitchell has now made it possible to achieve a real reconciliation in Northern Ireland--and for the Irish people to go about building their future together, in cooperation rather than in conflict.  And I am very pleased that the Senate tonight will pass legislation expressing our support for the Irish peace process and the brighter future represented by the Stormont Agreement.
