Madam Speaker, I support extending authority for the issuance of qualified green building and sustainable design project bonds. I fought for the inclusion of this extension in this bill because of its importance to Atlanta. I fought for this extension because I believe the use of these bonds helps finance cutting-edge, environmentally conscious redevelopment projects like the Atlantic Station project in Georgia. Over and over again businesses and developers are seeing that going green improves their bottom line. Projects like Atlantic Station and green initiatives must be commonplace in the future.  The authority to issue qualified green building and sustainable design project bonds was set to expire in 2009. Unfortunately bond applications were not even approved until 16 months after the legislation creating the authority to issue these bonds passed in 2004. The delay caused setbacks because the technology and engineering behind these projects are groundbreaking. To make up for that lost time, this bill extends the authority to issue qualified green bonds through September 30, 2012. In addition, this legislation clarifies that amounts in a reserve account may be released to the project five years after the date of issuance of the last bond issue issued with respect to the project. This will make sure that all funding can be made available to these projects in a more timely and efficient manner. While this legislation makes small but important changes, it does so without altering any other aspect of this enormous program, such as the tax-exempt status of these bonds.  I am proud to support this effort and the good work occurring right in the 5th District of Georgia. The Atlantic Station project has been good for Atlanta. It is in the national spotlight. Major efforts like this are necessary to show cities across America there is a better way forward for our environment and our communities. I appreciate the work of my colleagues and the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Rangel, for helping make sure these projects are given the opportunity to succeed. I look forward to continuing to work with him on this and welcoming him toAtlanta to witness firsthand the result of this investment.                          ____________________
