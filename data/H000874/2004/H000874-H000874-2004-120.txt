Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would hope that during the consideration of the child tax credit, assuming the conference is going to meet, that our conferees be included in that conference. As the gentleman knows, we feel pretty strongly about the fact that if conferences are held, those Democratic conferees that have been appointed by the Speaker need to be invited and to be able to participate in those. So I would urge that to occur when and if that conference is convened.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield.
