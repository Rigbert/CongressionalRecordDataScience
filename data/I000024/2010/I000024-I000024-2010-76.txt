President, let me conclude and say I will come back and talk about this at a later time. I do believe President Obama's pollster has some ideas that became public. I will share this last point.  Joe Benenson, the President's campaign pollster, did a survey for somewhat of an extremist environmental group, and, among other things, he found that based on his interpretation of the survey result, pushing for cap and trade and tying opposition to it to big oil is a potent political weapon for Democrats against Republicans this fall.  I think that says it all. People are using the tragedy in the gulf for political purposes. This is something we want people to understand.  With that, I yield the floor.
