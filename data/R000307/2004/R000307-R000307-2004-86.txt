President, this morning following morning business, the Senate resumes consideration of S. 1072, the highway bill. As the majority leader announced last night, it is hoped we will be able to work through those amendments early in the day so we can proceed to additional amendments. Senators should expect votes today as the Senate continues to make progress on the highway bill. Senators will be notified as votes are scheduled.                          ____________________
