President, very briefly, we were going back and forth. I agreed to let the Senator from Arizona go out of order. I see the Senator from Iowa waiting, and he will also be out of order. I know the Senator from California is coming to the Chamber. Will the Senator from Iowa give me some idea how much time he wants? I have no objection to him going out of order.
