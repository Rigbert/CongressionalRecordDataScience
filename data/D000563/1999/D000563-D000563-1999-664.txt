President, I rise today to introduce a private bill for the relief of Corina Dechalup of France. My bill would grant permanent resident status to Corina, affording her the legal security she needs to rebuild her life in this country.  Corina Dechalup first arrived in the United States from France in February 1990. She was admitted under the visa waiver pilot program after her then-fiancee Marin Turcinovic of Croatia was injured. Admitted on an H-1 visa in January 1990, Marin was hit by a car in Fairview, New Jersey in February 1990. Both of his legs were shattered. His spinal cord was severed, leaving him paralyzed below the neck. He will probably never walk again. Both Marin and Corina have been in the United States since their initial entries.  Corina and Marin married in February 1996, six years after his accident. Corina is an essential part of Marin's life. She has been with Marin throughout his ordeal and has been instrumental in coordinating his medical care. She has directly provided care for Marin, and he could never have reached the degree of recovery he now enjoys without her support.  Marin requires 24-hour medical care for his survival. An insurance settlement from litigation filed after the accident provides Marin with lifetime medical and rehabilitative care. Marin and Corina currently live in a specially modified house located in the Beverly community of Chicago. According to Marin's lawyers, the insurance settlement that provides for Marin's lifetime shelter and medical care would not cover him at another location.  Marin was granted permanent resident status on September 30, 1998, pursuant to former section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Though he can now file a petition requesting permanent resident status for Corina, she will still face a four to five year wait. Because she entered the U.S. under the visa waiver pilot program, she was subject to an order of deportation, without the right to an administrative hearing, once she overstayed her 90-day authorized admission in February 1990. Since 1994, she has received a stay of deportation in one year increments. She cannot currently travel to see her family in France, and she has no assurance that her stay will be renewed from one year to the next.  Before arriving in the U.S., Corina, a university graduate, worked as a tour guide for a Yugoslavian tourist agency. Although her days are primarily devoted to Marin, she has the skills and desire to find part-time employment and would like to obtain authorization to work.  Mr. President, nine years ago, fate tragically changed forever the lives of Corina Dechalup of France and her husband Marin Turcinovic of Croatia. A terrible accident in the United States left Marin permanently injured, making his return home impossible. Fortunately for Marin, he had the love and support of Corina, who left her home and her family to devote her life to him. Given the tremendous adversity that she faces on a day-to-day basis, I believe it appropriate for Congress to grant her permanent resident status. Such status would clear up much of the uncertainty that currently clouds her future, and would allow Corina and her husband to rebuild their lives in our country with confidence.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 828       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      Corina Dechalup shall be held and considered to have been      lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent      residence as of the date of the enactment of this Act upon      payment of the required visa fees.     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Corina      Dechalup, as provided in this Act, the Secretary of State      shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by the      appropriate number during the current fiscal year the total      number of immigrant visas available to natives of the country      of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).                                 ______                                       By
