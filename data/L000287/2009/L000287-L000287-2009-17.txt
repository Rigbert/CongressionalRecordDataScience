Mr. Speaker, we are at a historic moment in our Nation's history.  After a half century of debate, the time has come to make health care a reality for every single American. We must make health care a right and not a privilege. People are dying without health care. This week we must say, No more. No more.  People are losing their homes because they are without health insurance. This week we say, No more.  The American people cannot wait a moment longer. Every day that we wait, 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance.  We have a good bill before us. We have resolved our differences. We have been struck in the paralysis of analysis, and this must end and end now. Now is the time to act. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.''  We must not perpetuate this injustice. The spirit of history is upon us. We have been called to lead. Now is the time for the Congress to act.                          ____________________
