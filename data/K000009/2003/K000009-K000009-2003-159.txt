Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to announce to our colleagues that Mieasha Hicks, 18, a member of Boys & Girls Clubs of Toledo, Ohio, was named National Youth of the Year by Boys & Girls Clubs of America at its annual Congressional Breakfast held today in Washington, D.C. As noted by the Boys & Girls Clubs of America national office, sponsored by the Reader's Digest Foundation, the Youth of the Year program recognizes outstanding contributions to a member's family, school, community and Club, as well as personal challenges and obstacles overcome. She competed against four other regional finalists, Kewanna Daniels (Gulfport, Miss.), Ambrosia Hafen-Hayes (Las Vegas), Yamarie Negron (Mt. Kisco, N.Y.) and Luis Vasquez (Greeley, Colo.).  In their announcement of this award, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America describe Mieasha Hicks, as a survivor. Her parents were 13 and 15 years old when she was born. Periodically, she was shuffled between households as the family grew. Being the oldest of seven children, Mieasha had no choice but to mature quickly.  Today, she helps her brothers and sisters with their homework and prepares them for tests. She often takes them to the library, the movies, shopping and out to dinner. Thanks to Mieasha, all of her younger siblings have become honor students.  Her father died when she was 12 and her mother left the state when she was 11. Despite these traumatic occurrences, Mieasha's visits to the East Toledo Boys & Girls Clubs gave her a reason to stay positive.  For the last 10 years, the Club has given her a place to belong. There she served as vice president of the Keystone Club, a group which gave her the opportunity to lead community service projects. She has also learned marketing and sales skills while organizing bake sales and candy sales as fundraisers. Among other activities, Hicks assists with Power Hour, her Boys & Girls Club's after-school homework help program.  Mieasha Hicks was an academic standout at Central Catholic High School, where she has been a member of the National Honor Society and the school choir, a cheerleader, and student council representative. She is also actively involved with the African-American Culture Club.  She began attending Bowling Green University this fall where she will study medicine and science.  Mr. Speaker, it is truly a pleasure to commemorate this accomplishment by one of the first leaders of tomorrow's generation. For the next year she will have the opportunity to represent the Boys and Girls Clubs of America throughout the nation, and be an inspiration to thousands of young people who will see proof that success is possible when young people are willing to commit themselves to life's important goals. Congratulations, Miesha!                          ____________________
