President, pending before the Senate is an amendment to the housing bill, which I offered earlier and on which I have asked the Republican side to consider a unanimous consent request so that we can debate and vote on it still this morning. I hope they will consider that in a timely manner. I am prepared to offer an equal amount of time to both sides of the aisle on the substance of this amendment and then accept a vote at 12:15.  We have proffered this unanimous consent request, and I hope, in the interest of time and fairness, that the Republican minority will accede to this request, or if they wish to modify it, let us know as quickly as possible.  Here is what this amendment is all about. We have 2 million people about to lose their homes.
