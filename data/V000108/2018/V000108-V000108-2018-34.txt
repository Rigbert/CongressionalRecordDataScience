Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I recognize the Asian American Medical Association, which will host its 42nd Annual Gala on Saturday, November 10, 2018, at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. Each year, the Asian American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award.  The Asian American Medical Association has been a tremendous asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have dedicated themselves to providing quality medical services to the residents of Northwest Indiana and have served their communities through many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's Annual Gala, the Asian American Medical Association will present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Ms. Janice Ryba, JD, MJ, MHA. Janice has worked for over thirty years in the healthcare field in Northwest Indiana, primarily within the Community Healthcare System. In 2007, her extensive experience and exemplary leadership led to her being named Chief Executive Officer of Saint Mary Medical Center in Hobart, Indiana. Under Ms. Ryba's direction, Saint Mary Medical Center has seen immense success and been recognized for its innovation. Recently, Saint Mary's incorporated a brand new surgical pavilion, intensive care unit, and a six-story patient tower that features private patient rooms with the most up-to-date technology. Additionally, Saint Mary's has expanded services in Porter County with the new Valparaiso Health Center. Under Ms. Ryba's leadership, providing compassionate care with the finest technology is the goal of the organization, and she and the talented staff at Saint Mary's continue to go above and beyond. For her lifetime of service, she is truly worthy of the prestigious honor bestowed upon her.  Ms. Ryba has also given much of her time and efforts to numerous organizations in Northwest Indiana and throughout the state including the Quality of Life Council, American Red Cross of Northwest Indiana, and the Indiana Hospital Association Council on Hospital Governance, to name a few.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the members of the Asian American Medical Association as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Ms. Janice Ryba. For her dedication to her outstanding career in the medical field and her remarkable service to the community of Northwest Indiana, Janice Ryba is worthy of the highest praise                          ____________________
