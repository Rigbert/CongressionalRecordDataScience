President, first of all, let me say I agree with the statement made by the chairman of the committee, Senator Boxer. She is right, we have had differences in the past. But I can say this: Working on infrastructure, whether it is the Transportation reauthorization bill or the WRDA bill, we work things out. I think we do it the responsible way. We have criteria. We make sure every project out there has a report and meets the criteria. Sometimes it doesn't end up that way in conference. We are going to do our very best to have a bill as close to what we have now, when we get to conference, when we get out of conference.  Let's keep in mind, it has been 7 years since we have had one of these. While some of the numbers look high to people, if we were to discipline ourselves, which we should--and I think we will work toward that end from now on and have these every 2 years--then that will be a much better way to get things done.  I guess we are into our time, now, aren't we?
