Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1084, the Volunteer Pilot Organization Protection Act of 2004. I would like to thank the bill's sponsors, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Schrock), and also the other gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes), for their work in bringing this legislation before us.  The bill provides limited liability relief for volunteer pilot and volunteer pilot organizations that do some of the most invaluable and unappreciated volunteer work in the Nation. The legislation is intended to promote the publicly beneficial activities of volunteer pilot organizations and their employees and members by exempting them from liability when flying volunteer missions in furtherance of the purpose of such organizations.  Volunteer pilot organizations and the pilots who fly for them are involved in a range of activities constituting what generally may be called public benefit aviation. The activities of public benefit aviation include environmental observation, wilderness rescue, delivery of medical supplies and organs, and transporting medical patients. In the area of medical patient transport alone, volunteer pilot organizations provided long-distance transportation for free to over 40,000 patients and their escorts in 2003.  Since the activities of volunteer pilot organizations are not protected from liability by the Volunteer Protection Act, they are exposed to significant liability risks leading many insurers to drop coverage for those pilots and organizations. In addition, hospitals and other medical establishments are leery of referring patients to volunteer pilot medical transport services because of their own fear of liability exposure based upon the simple act of recommendation.  The legislation limits liability exposure for volunteer pilots and organizations by bringing them within the scope of coverage of the Volunteer Protection Act. This legislation will not confer blanket immunity. Liability will still attach for gross negligence or reckless misconduct. The bill would also have an added benefit of allowing hospitals, clinics, and other organizations to refer needy patients for no-cost medical transport with less fear of their own liability exposure.  The bill is supported by a wide array of charitable organizations, including the National Association of Hospital Hospitality Houses, the Children's Organ Transplant Association, the Health and Medical Research Charities of America, the National Organization For Rare Disorders, the National Foundations For Transplant, the Independent Charities of America, the Air Care Alliance, and others.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1084 will end the cycle of litigation that has stifled the efforts of the brave and public-minded volunteer pilots who risk their own lives by flying patients so the patients they serve might have a chance to live. I urge support of the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1145
