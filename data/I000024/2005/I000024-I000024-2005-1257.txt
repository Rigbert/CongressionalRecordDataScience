President, I rise today to proudly introduce legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 123 W. 7th Street in Holdenville, OK, as the ``Boone Pickens Post Office''.  Thomas Boone Pickens, Jr. emulates the Oklahoma spirit of hard work, entrepreneurship and philanthropy. He is an excellent example of the potential to achieve success in our American free enterprise system. I honor, I proudly seek to name the post office in his hometown of Holdenville, OK, where he was born in 1928.  As the son of a landman, Pickens quickly appreciated the business potential of oil exploration. Oklahoma State University awarded Pickens a bachelor of science in geology in 1951. He grew frustrated with the bureaucracy of working for a large company and decided to start his own in 1956. This company was the basis for what became one of the leading oil and gas exploration and production firms in the nation, Mesa Petroleum Company.  Not only did Pickens lead in the energy industry itself, he possessed the unique ability to recognize and acquire undervalued companies. Repeatedly, markets eventually realized the worth of these companies, and shareholder profits soared.  His innovative thinking and business skills amassed the fortune and wisdom he unselfishly shares with others. Oklahoma State University has benefited from his generous investment in academics and athletics. He is also a dedicated supporter of a wide range of medical research initiatives. He is an energetic advocate for the causes he believes in, devoting his time to serve on numerous boards and receiving recognition through countless awards.  He often said, ``Be willing to make decisions. That's the most important quality in a good leader. Don't fall victim to what I call the ready-aim-aim-aim-aim syndrome.  You must be willing to fire.'' That is exactly the Oklahoma mentality of leadership, the ability to make tough decisions and stick to them.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation as we commemorate an outstanding citizen so that future generations will be challenged by his example, just as we have been.                                 ______                                       By
