President, I would like to respond to the statements made by the Senator from Arkansas in terms of the pending business before the Senate. We are close to reaching agreement to bring the underlying bill--the criminal justice reform bill--for a vote this evening. It is a bill that has been literally years in the making. I believe we have discussed it at great length, and we are prepared to make a decision in the Senate.
