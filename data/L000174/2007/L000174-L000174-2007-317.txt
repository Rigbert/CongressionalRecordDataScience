President, the distinguished majority leader wishes to be on the Senate floor, and I ask the Senator from Kentucky if he will yield for a brief quorum call so that the distinguished majority leader can be on the floor.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will be happy to accommodate that request. It was my understanding thatthe majority leader was on the way, and I thought I would get started. But I will be happy to wait until he walks through the door, if that is the request of my good friend from Vermont.
