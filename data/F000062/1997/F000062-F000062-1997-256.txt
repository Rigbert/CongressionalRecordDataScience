 President, I ask unanimous consent that the State Department's statement of explanation on certification be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                Washington, DC, February 28, 1997.                 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE     Subject: Certification for major narcotics producing and          transit countries.       By virtue of the authority vested in me by section      490(b)(1)(A) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as      amended, (``the Act''), I hereby determine and certify that      the following major drug producing and/or major drug transit      countries/dependent territories have cooperated fully with      the United States, or taken adequate steps on their own, to      achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives of the      1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in      Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances: Aruba, The      Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Dominican      Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India,      Jamaica, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,      Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.       By virtue of the authority vested in me by section      490(b)(1)(B) of the Act, I hereby determine that it is in the      vital national interests of the United States to certify the      following major illicit drug producing and/or transit      countries: Belize, Lebanon, and Pakistan.       Analysis of the relevant U.S. vital national interests, as      required under section 490(b)(3) of the Act, is attached. I      have determined that the following major illicit drug      producing and/or major transit countries do not meet the      standards set forth in section 490(b) for certification:      Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria, and Syria.       In making these determinations, I have considered the      factors set forth in section 490 of the Act, based on the      information contained in the International Narcotics Control      Strategy Report of 1997. Because the performance of each of      these countries/dependent territories has differed, I have      attached an explanatory statement for each of the countries/     dependent territories subject to this determination.       You are hereby authorized and directed to report this      determination to the Congress immediately and to published it      in the Federal Register.                                               William J. Clinton.               State Department Statement of Explanation                                 mexico       The Government of Mexico's (GOM) 1996 counter-drug effort      produced encouraging resulting and notable progress in      bilateral cooperation. President Zedillo has declared the      major drug trafficking organizations, and the corruption they      foster within governmental structures, to be Mexico's      principal national security threat. He has intensified the      country's counter-drug effort, in keeping with international      human rights norms, both through legal reforms and      operationally, through the expanded participation of the      nation's military services.       Drug seizures and arrests increased in 1996. Mexican      authorities seized 23.8 mt of cocaine, 383 kgs of heroin,      1015 mt of marijuana, 171.7 kgs of methamphetamine and 6.7 mt      of ephedrine (its chemical precursor), and destroyed 20 drug      labs. Police arrested 11,283 suspects on drug-related      charges. Authorities arrested several major traffickers: Juan      Garcia Abrego, Gulf cartel leader and one of the FBI's ``Ten      Most Wanted'' fugitives; Jose Luis Pereira Salas, linked to      the Cali and Juarez cartels; and Manuel Rodriguez Lopez,      linked to the Castrillon maritime smuggling organization.       The Mexican Congress passed two critical pieces of      legislation which have armed the GOM with a whole new arsenal      of weapons to use to combat money laundering, chemical      diversion and organized crime. The GOM established organized      crime task forces in key locations in northern and western      Mexico in cooperation with U.S. law enforcement. In an effort      to confront widespread corruption within the nation's law      enforcement agencies, former Attorney General Lozano      dismissed over 1250 federal police officers and technical      personnel for corruption or incompetence, although some have      been rehired, and the GOM indicated two former senior GOM      officials and a current Undersecretary of Tourism. He also      sought to expand cooperation with the United States and other      governments.       The United States and Mexico established the High-Level      Contact Group on Narcotics Control (HLCG) to explore joint      solutions to the shared drug threat and to coordinate      bilateral anti-drug efforts. The HLCG met three times during      1996 and its technical working groups met throughout the      year. Under the aegis of the HLCG, the two governments      developed a joint assessment of the narcotics threat posed to      both countries which will be used as the basis for a joint      counter-drug strategy.       U.S.-Mexican bilateral cooperation on drug law enforcement      continued to improve in 1996, particularly in the areas of      money laundering, mutual legal assistance, and criminal      investigations. The USG provided training, technical, and      material support to personnel of the Office of the Mexican      Attorney General (PGR), the National Institute to Combat      Drugs (INCD), the Mexican Treasury, and the Mexican armed      forces. The Government of Mexico established the important      precedent of extraditing Mexican nationals to the United      States under the provision of Mexico's extradition law      permitting this in ``exceptional circumstances.'' This paves      the way for further advances in bringing fugitives to      justice. Both governments returned record numbers of      fugitives in 1996.       Even with positive results, and good cooperation with the      U.S. and other governments, the problems which Mexico faces      remain daunting. The Zedillo Administration has taken      important beginning steps against the major drug cartels in      Mexico, and towards more effective cooperation with the      United States and other international partners, but the      strongest groups, such as the Juarez and Tijuana cartels,      have yet to be effectively confronted. The level of narcotics      corruption is very serious, reaching into the very senior      levels of Mexico's drug law enforcement forces, as witnessed      by the February 1997 arrest of the recently-appointed      national counternarcotics coordinator. President Zedillo      acted courageously to remove him as soon as the internal      Mexican investigation revealed the problem, but this has been      a set-back for Mexico's anti-drug effort, and for bilateral      cooperation.       Mexican police, military personnel, prosecutors, and the      courts need additional resources, training and other support      to perform the important and dangerous tasks ahead of them.      Progress in establishing controls on money laundering and      chemical diversion must be further enhanced and implemented.      New capabilities need to be institutionalized. Above all, the      GOM will have to take system-wide action against corruption      and other abuses of official authority through enhanced      screening of personnel in sensitive positions and putting      into place ongoing integrity controls.       While there are still serious problems, and a number of      areas in which the USG would like to see further progress,      the two governments have agreed on the parameters of a joint      approach to combat the narcotics threat, and are at work on      developing this strategy. The drug issue will remain one of      the top issues in the bilateral agenda and will be one of the      main issues discussed during President Clinton's planned      visit to Mexico in April.
