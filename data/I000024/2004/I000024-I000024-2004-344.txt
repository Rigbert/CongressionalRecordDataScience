 I would say, in terms of who the villain is in the deficit we are facing right now, there are two big villains. One is the war, and then the economy. As we started losing economic ground, a downturn back in March of 2000, people didn't realize for every 1 percent change in economic activity it translated into $45 billion in revenue. In other words, as the economy is rebounding now, the revenue is coming back up. Even continuing in the effort, the war effort--which I am afraid is going to last for quite a while--we are going to be facing end strength problems and that will have to go on.  I believe the best thing we can do is do it through the economy. At the same time there are certain things that have to happen in America. We have to do something about roads in America. I probably have as many townhall meetings as anyone. I suggest the Senator from Florida does, too. I can't remember one I have had where they haven't said something about roads.  In Oklahoma what they say is, we can always tell when we are around Thanksgiving time, when we have family coming in, we have friends coming in, we can always know when we get to Oklahoma because of the roads. I add to the Presiding Officer, when they come from Texas they make that comment about Oklahoma roads. So we do have a very serious problem. It seems to be more serious in my State.  Part of that is due to the donor status we have had for quite some time. Of course, we have not had the money with which to do it. I feel an obligation, and believe it is very appropriate for conservatives, to get out and vote in favor of this type of an infrastructure program. This translates directly into jobs, translates directly into the economy, translates directly into increasing economic activity and additional revenue that will come into Government.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
