President, the Korean war was known as ``the Forgotten War'' to some because it followed so closely on the heels of World War II, and because it was in many ways overshadowed by the divisive Vietnam conflict. I never liked that expression, because I know too many people whose lives were forever changed by Korea. I prefer to think that the Korean war not as a forgotten war, but as an unremembered war. For too many years we ignored the great sacrifice made by millions of Americans in a rugged land far away from our shores. As of today, the Korean war is unremembered no longer.  This afternoon I was honored to attend the dedication of the new Korean War Memorial, and it is a worthy addition to our Nation's Capital. The memorial is centered around 19 haunting statues created by Vermont sculptor Frank Gaylord. His depiction of tired American soldiers marching in a loose formation toward a common goal manages to capture perfectly the heroic qualities of our soldiers without glorifying war.  While I was moved by the memorial and the ceremony today, the moments I will treasure most occurred this morning at a breakfast I hosted for Vermont veterans and Mr. Gaylord. These Vermonters came from all parts of the State. They came by airplane, they came by car, and they came by 14-hour train ride. One group came after driving all night long. They came with their families, their foxhole buddies, and by themselves. Most of these Vermonters served in different units, and many had not met before today. They came to Washington to stand for hours in the terrible summer heat, all to pay tribute to events that happened over 40 years ago.  I realized this morning, as these veterans gathered in my office, that any inconvenience suffered by travel or weather meant nothing to them. Their sense of duty to comrades past and present brought them to Washington, and as long as there was life in their bodies they would come. The history books tell us that 46,246 Americans died in the Korean war, that 103,284 were wounded, and that millions more served. All of them are finally being recognized today. It is with humility that I offer my profound gratitude to those who answered the call and gave so much to preserve freedom.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that recent Washington Post articles about the Korean War Memorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 1995] A March to Remember, Moving Monument to Korea Veterans Surpasses the                      Tortured History of Its Design                          (By Benjamin Forgey)       When the Korean War Veterans Memorial is dedicated next      Thursday--the 42nd anniversary of the armistice ending the      war--veterans and their families will be celebrating an honor      long overdue.       They can also celebrate a work of beauty and power. Given      the tortured history of the memorial's design, this seems      almost a miracle. But there it is. Situated on proud symbolic      turf southeast of the monument to Lincoln, in equipoise with      the Vietnam Veterans memorial to Lincoln's north, the Korean      memorial is a worthy addition to the national Mall.       Despite some big flaws, our newest memorial is incredibly      moving. And what could have been its most glaring weakness--a      column of realistically sculpted soldiers in combat      formation--turned out to be its major strength. Unheralded      sculptor Frank Gaylord of Barre, Vt., created 19 figures that      are convincing individually and as a group.       It is a case of art rendering argument superfluous. There      were obvious dangers in the concept of a memorial featuring a      column of battle-ready soldiers. If excessively realistic,      they could be off-putting. If strung out in too orderly a      row, they could be deadeningly static. And yet, if      inordinately animated, they could be seen as glorifying war.      Indeed, in one of Gaylord's early versions, they came      perilously close to doing just that.       But in the end, none of this happened. Placed dynamically      on a triangular field of low juniper shrubs and cast in      stainless steel at a scale slightly larger than life, these      gray, wary troopers unself-consciously invite the empathy of      all viewers, veteran and non-veteran alike.       The sculptures and triangular ``field of service'' are one      of three major elements in the memorial. With an American      flag at its point, the field gently ascends to a shallow,      circular ``pool of remembrance'' framed by a double row of      braided linden trees. There also is a ``memorial wall.''      Made of huge slabs of polished black granite, each etched      with shadowy faces of support troops--nurses, chaplains,      supply clerks, truck drivers and so on--the 164-foot wall      forms a subtly dramatic background for the statues. High      on the eastern end of the wall, where it juts into the      pool of water, is a terse inscription: Freedom is not      free.       The memorial was designed by Cooper-Lecky Architects of      Washington--although, in an important sense, the firm acted      like the leader of a collaborative team, Important      contributions were made by Gaylord and Louis Nelson, the New      York graphic designer of the memorial wall, and also by the      Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board and the reviewing      agencies, especially the Commission of Fine Arts.       Not to forgotten are the four architects from Pennsylvania      State University who won the design competition back in the      spring of 1989--John Paul Lucas, Veronica, Burns Lucas, Don      Alvaro Leon and Eliza Pennypacker Oberholtzer. This team      dropped out after it became apparent that its original design      would have to be altered significantly to pass muster with      the advisory board, reviewing agencies and others. The team      sued, and lost, in federal court.       Key elements of the competition design remain in the final      product--particularly the central idea of a column of      soldiers moving toward a goal. But the finished product is a      big improvement over the initial scheme. It's smaller and      more accommodating--not only was the number of soldiers cut      in half (the original called for 38 figures), but also a vast      open plaza was eliminated in favor of the contemplative,      shaded pool. It's easier to get into and out of--the clarity      of its circulation pattern is outstanding. Its landscaping is      more natural--among other things, the original called for a      grove of plane trees to be clipped ``torturously,'' as a      symbol of war. The symbolism of the memorial is now simple      and clear.       Still, Cooper-Lecky and the advisory board went through      many versions, and many heartbreaks, on the way to getting a      design approved--and the finished memorial shows the strain      of the long, contentious process. It cannot be said that this      memorial possesses the artistic grandeur and solemnity of the      Lincoln Memorial. It does not have the aesthetic unity of      Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans wall. It is not quite so      compelling a combination of the noble and the everyday as      Henry Merwin Shrady's Grant Memorial at the other end of the      Mall. But this is to put the new memorial in elevated      company--together with the Washington Monument, these are our      finest expressions of memorial art. To say that the Korean      War memorial even comes close is a tribute.       Without question, its worst feature is a sequence of      parallel strips of polished black granite in the ``field of      service.'' Unattractive and unneeded, they threaten to reduce      the soldiers' advance to the metaphorical level of a football      game. And on one side of the field, they end in obtrusive,      triangular blocks of granite, put there to discourage      visitors from walking onto the granite ribbons. The junipers      may in time cover the strips--at least, one can hope--but      these bumps, unfortunately, will remain bumps.       The wall gets a mixed review. A clever if somewhat      shameless adaptation of Maya Lin's idea--with faces rather      than names etched in--it honors support troops, who always      outnumber those on the front lines. It      is beautifully made. The heads are real ones from photographs in Korean      War archives, digitally altered so that the light source is      always coming from the direction of the flag. The etching is      wonderfully subtle: The faces seem to float in a reflective      gray mist. The wall tugs the heartstrings, for sure, but it's      also a bit obvious, a bit much. It has the feel of a      superfluous theatrical trick.       Fortunately, the wall does not interfere too much with the      sculpture, which from the beginning has been the primary      focus of this memorial. It was      an extraordinary challenge, one of the great figurative      commissions of the late 20th century, and Gaylord came      through. To walk down from the Lincoln Memorial and catch      a first, apparitional glimpse of the soldiers, as they      stalk from under the tree cover, is quite a thrill. Even      from a distance and from the back, the gray figures are      compelling.       And, as choreographed on that field, they become more      compelling the closer you get until, with a certain shock,      you find yourself standing almost within touching distance of      the first figure; a soldier who involves you in the movement      of the patrol by turning his head sharply and signaling--     Beware!--with the palm of his left hand. He is a startling,      daring figure and, with his taut face and that universal      gesture of caution, he announces the beginning of a tense      drama.       It is an old device, familiar in baroque painting and      sculpture, to involve the viewer directly in the action by      posture, gesture, facial expression, Gaylord adapted it      masterfully here: The figures look through you or over your      shoulders, enveloping the space beyond the memorial with      their eyes. The air fairly crackles with the vitality of      danger. The soldiers communicate tersely among themselves,      too--in shouted commands or entreaties, and subtly connected      gestures and glances.       The most critical contact, though, may be that first one,      between the visitor and that initial soldier. His mouth is      open--you can almost hear him hissing an urgent command. You      slow down, and then you behold the field before you. There is      fatigue and alertness everywhere you look. Each figure and      each face is as charged as the next. Appropriately, the gray      metal surfaces are not polished and shined. Gaylord's rough      treatment of the matte surfaces adds to the nervous intensity      of the piece.       It is quite a feat to give such figures such a feeling of      movement--they're only walking, after all, and they're      carrying heavy burdens. But Gaylord performed that feat, 19      times--he proved himself a master of contrapposto, and other      time-honored sculptural technique. Underneath the gray      ponchos and the weight of the stuff on their backs, these      figures twist from hip to shoulder and neck. Some shift      dramatically, some just enough, so that the ensemble takes on      an extraordinary animation. Every gesture seems perfectly      calculated to reinforce the irony. These ghostly soldiers in      their windblown ponchos seem intensely real.       Dedicated to the concepts of service, duty and patriotism,      the new memorial stands in sharp contrast to its companion      across the Reflecting Pool. But the Korean and Vietnam      memorials make a complementary, not a contradictory, pair. In      honoring the sacrifices of soldiers in Vietnan, Lin's great      V-shaped wall invokes a cycle of life and death, and      physically reaches out to the Mall's symbols of union and      democracy.       The Korean War Veterans Memorial is more straightforward,      and speaks directly of a specific time and place. Yet it      attains an unmistakable universality of its own. Gaylord's      soldiers (and Marines and airmen) served in Korea, yes. But      they also stand unpretentiously for the common soldiers of      all wars.               [From the Washington Post, July 23, 1995]   Out of History, Onto The Mall, Korean War Memorial To Be Dedicated                  (By Anthony Faiola and Lena H. Sun)       In the nation's capital, the forgotten war is forgotten no      more.       The $18 million Korean War Veterans Memorial opens Thursday      on the National Mall, honoring the men and women who fought      in an international conflict many Americans still view as an      afterthought, lost between the scope of World War II and the      upheaval of Vietnam.       The stoic arrangement of stainless-steel statues, a mural      wall and a circular reflecting pool officially takes its      place as the fifth major memorial on the Mall, southeast of      the Lincoln Memorial and across from the Vietnam Veterans      Memorial. It arrives after seven stormy years of lawsuits and      conceptual bickering that almost doomed the project.       ``This is not a graveyard or a glorification of war,''      retired Col. William Weber, 69, said as he surveyed the 19      statues of white, black, Korean and American Indian soldiers      that make up the core of the memorial. When reflected in the      black granite mural wall, their numbers double to 38--     symoblizing the 38th parallel established as the border      between North And South Korea in 1945.       ``It is a remembrance of a group of veterans who have      fallen into their twilight years and who are still tragically      forgotten by too many people'' in this country, said Weber,      who lost his right arm and leg to a hand grenade in Korea and      is among those veterans who doggedly lobbied for the      memorial.       More than four decades after the war ended, organizers of      the memorial are trying to make up for the lack of public      recognition. There will be six days of ceremonies and events,      beginning tomorrow, to honor America's 5.7 million Korean      War-era veterans and those from the 21 other countries who      served under the banner of the United Nations command in      Korea.       The three-year Korean War was an inconclusive, bloody      conflict, the first modern war in which the United States had      to accept a compromise solution in the form of an armistice      agreement. The conflict intensified the Cold War mentality,      destroyed Korea and solidified the divisions between North      and South Korea.       More than 54,000 U.S. military personnel and more than      58,000 South Korean military personnel      died in the war, according to the U.S. Army Center for      Military History. Millions of Korean civilians perished;      virtually every Korean family was affected.       For many ordinary Americans, the conflict is best known      because of the adventures of Hawkeye and Hot Lips in the      popular movie and television series ``M*A*S*H'' two decades      later. But during the war, there was little front-page      coverage. When the soldiers returned home, they slipped back      into society. There were no parades, no celebrations.       ``I came back on a Friday, and I started back up at work      the following Monday,'' said Raymond Donnelly, 67, of      Arlington, a machine-gunner with the 24th Infantry Division      who spent 10 months on the front line before returning to a      printing apprenticeship in Massachusetts.       President Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young Sam,      who is arriving on a state visit Tuesday, will preside over      the dedication of the memorial Thursday, the 42nd anniversary      of the armistice. Officials are expecting a crowd of about      100,000 many of them Korean War veterans and their families,      as well as representatives of the countries that fought under      the U.N. command, Retired Gen. Chang Pae Wan, who commanded      the defense of Seoul during the war, will lead the South      Korean delegation, which will include about 400 veterans.       Among the other highlights of the week's events is a troop      muster of war veterans--only the second such mass gathering      of troops in U.S. history--that will be addressed by the      Joint Chiefs of Staff.       In the Korean American community have criticized South      Korean participation in the memorial, however. Of the $18      million raised in private money, nearly $3 million came from      U.S. subsidiaries of South Korea's largest companies,      including $1 million each from Samsung and Hyundai.       Richard Nahm, an interpreter who writes for Korean-language      newspapers published in the United States, said the South      Korean government should pay more attention to domestic      problems, such as polluted drinking water and the recent      collapse of a Seoul department store that killed 450 people,      instead of encouraging companies to contribute to a memorial      that primarily honors U.S. war dead.       A spokesman for the South Korean Embassy dismissed the      criticism. South Korea had considered canceling Kim's trip to      Washington because of the department store collapse but      decided to proceed because the visit had been long planned,      he said.       The memorial reflects the primary role of U.S. ground      troops, featuring seven-foot statues of combat-ready soldiers      as one of its key elements. The soldiers are spread over a      field of juniper bushes. Behind them is a 164-foot wall with      the faces of nurses, cooks, chaplains, other support troops      and even the canine corps. The photographic images were      culled from Korean War archives and sandblasted onto the      black granite.       Opposite the mural are the names of all the countries that      served under      the U.N. command. The field slopes up to a circular ``pool      of remembrance.''       The Korean War Veterans Memorial didn't come easily.       Its creation was rooted in the frustrations of a group of      Korean War veterans, including members of the 25th Infantry      Division, that in 1985 made a pilgrimage to Seoul to confront      their ghosts, said Dick Adams, past president and a board      member of the Korean War Veterans Association Inc., which was      founded in 1985.       ``We were not like the vets of Vietnam,'' Adams said. ``We      were the forgotten people of a forgotten war, and we weren't      ready to let ourselves go down in history in that way.''       The group was further stirred to action a year later when      the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated. On Oct. 28,      1986, their efforts paid off: President Ronald Reagan      approved a resolution authorizing the American Battle      Monuments Commission to erect a Korean War Veterans Memorial      on the Mall.       The generosity of the private sector in donating money was      challenged by setbacks, however.       An initial design contest was won in 1989 by four      professors from Pennsylvania State University. They sued the      federal government and lost after the design was altered by      D.C.-based Cooper & Lecky Architects, the architects of the      Vietnam memorial.       The memorial was reconfigured. The number of statues was      cut from 38 to 19. Instead of lining up in a single file, for      easy visitor access, the larger-than-life statues were placed      in a field of juniper bushes to create the air of rough      terrain and to remove them from the public's reach.       The memorial will be open to the public at 4 p.m. Thursday      and will remain open 24 hours a day. Organizers say the wait      will be      long for those who wish to visit the memorial immediately because of      the large crowd expected at the dedication.       By last week, the advisory board was receiving about 2,000      telephone calls an hour because of overwhelming interest in      the memorial and related events, a spokesman said.       For local veterans, such as Donnelly, the memorial will be      a final resting place for his memories. Besides the fear and      the fighting, there is the food that Donnelly will always      associate with the war: the Spam, Babe Ruth candy bars, black      olives and saltine crackers he and other soldiers devoured      when they were not on the front line.       His most enduring the memory is of the bone-chilling winter      cold, when temperatures often plunged well below zero.       ``That's why I say the first miserable rotten night we have      here, when it's cold and rainy and snowy,'' Donnelly said,      ``I want to go down [to the Mall] and walk through those      statues, because that's what it was like.''
