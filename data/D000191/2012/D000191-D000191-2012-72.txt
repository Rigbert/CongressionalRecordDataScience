Speaker, on behalf of the entire Oregon congressional delegation, I'm pleased to introduce a fellow Oregon Duck, Italian American,and the newest member of our delegation, Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, from the First Congressional District of Oregon.  Suzanne is a former Oregon State legislator, an attorney who has worked on consumer and small business issues with a distinguished record of accomplishments and service for the people of Oregon.
