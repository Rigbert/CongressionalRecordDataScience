Speaker, it is my distinct honor to rise today to once again commend the efforts of the Northwest Indiana Hispanic Coordinating Council for their numerous contributions to Northwest Indiana.  On November 18, 1995, the Coordinating Council will conduct its Seventh Annual Conference on Hispanic Issues. The theme of this year's conference is ``Citizenship: Our Rights and Responsibilities.''  Recognizing the importance of citizenship, the Hispanic Coordinating Council has dedicated its conference to focus on topics that will help the residents of Northwest Indiana become better citizens of this great Nation.  In order to make this event as successful as possible, the Hispanic Coordinating Council has called on various community leaders to address issues pertaining to this year's theme. I would like to recognize the following distinguished individuals, who will lend their expertise and help make this conference a memorable occasion: Dr. James Yackel, chancellor of Purdue University Calumet; Juan Andrade, Jr., president and executive director of the Midwest Northeast Voters Registration and Education Project; Dr. Samuel Betances, senior consultant, Souder, Betances and Associates; Victor DeMeyer, manager of NIPSCO's Corporate Consumer and Community Affairs Department; Louis Lopez, assistant State director for Senator Richard Lugar; Joseph Mark, chief executive officer, St. Catherine's Hospital; Philip Meyer, telecommunications specialist, Ameritech; Erin Austin Krasik, project director, Students for an Educated Democracy; Ruth Dorochoff, U.S. Department of Justice's Immigration and Naturalization Service; Joseph Medellin, manager human resources, Inland Steel Company; and William (Bill) Luna, president of William Luna and Associates Management Consultants.  Since the focus of this year's conference is citizenship, the Hispanic Coordinating Council is concluding the conference with the swearing-in of 135 new citizens. The swearing-in ceremony will be conducted by the Honorable Rudy Lozano, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana, and Brian Perryman, Deputy District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  I commend the efforts of all of those individuals who were involved in making this annual event a reality. It is because of their dedication that this conference is possible.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in applauding the participants of the Hispanic Coordinating Council's Conference on Hispanic Issues, as well as those distinguished individuals who will receive one of our Nation's greatest gifts, citizenship.                          ____________________
