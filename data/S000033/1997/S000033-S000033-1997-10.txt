 The answer is no, obviously not. The question is a confusing one. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kucinich] and I are opposed to nuclear power. The question is, however, not to debate now the future of nuclear power, but what do we do when we have nuclear waste that is low level?  The implication of the argument of the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kucinich] is a very simple one. That is, basically, because this is a clear amendment, if we cannot transport the low-level waste, then we have to get rid of it in our own backyard. The problem with that argument is, there are some backyards in the country in which it would be an environmental disaster to place low-level nuclear waste; that that waste would then seep into the water table, it would go all over the area, and people would be drinking it.  So in my view, what the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kucinich] is arguing is bad environmental policy. Obviously, I would ask the gentleman from Ohio if he has researched the issue, and in fact, if he believes that it would be possible, and the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Hall] made this point, if it would be conceivable that waste could be taken from Vermont or Maine to Texas without going through a community of 25,000. My guess is it would be impossible.  All the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kucinich] is saying is let us kill it; you cannot move it, let us kill it. But the whole thrust of a compact, the concept of a compact, is that there are some communities, and nobody wants low-level nuclear waste, we can agree on that, but we could also agree that environmentalists and geologists do tell us that there are some areas for geological reasons that can better accept the waste than other areas.  If the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kucinich] were to pass, essentially what he would be saying is that every community has to get rid of the waste within that area, despite the fact that some areas from an environmental point of view would see enormous damage.
