 President. I rise today to introduce the ``Drug-Free America Act of 2001.'' As many of my colleagues know, drug use by the children in our country continues to be a serious concern of mine. The ``Drug-Free America Act'' offers a series of initiatives that I believe will support efforts across the board to discourage drug use at all levels in America.  Mr. President, I've said it before, but it bears repeating. Somewhere along the way, we lost the clear, consistent message that the only proper response to drugs is to say an emphatic ``no.'' We're supposed to be more sophisticated. More tolerant. More willing to listen to notions of making dangerous drugs more available. What all of this ``more'' has meant is that we have more young people using more drugs at younger ages. Today we are competing with a drug culture that tells our children ``drugs are cool,'' that ``drug are safe.'' Drugs are being more aggressively marketed, and are presented as being ``user friendly''.  We cannot remain silent. I look forward with working with President Bush in providing the resources and message necessary to let everyone know that drugs are bad, that drugs will damage your brain and your body, and that drug use will hurt you, your friends, your family, your community, and your future.  The drug problem confronting our country is not static. Methamphetamine, Ecstasy, and other new drugs pose different challenges and require different solutions than the heroin and cocaine epidemics. Treatment, education, prevention, and law enforcement efforts must all be strengthened and updated. The National Institutes of Health have some exciting research efforts underway that could really make a difference as we try to reclaim the lives of our fellow citizens who have been seduced by the false pleasures of drug use. There are several education and prevention initiatives that we can strengthen to support the educators, counselors, community activists, and parents who work hard every day to keep our children and our communities drug free. We should support ongoing efforts by the National Guard Counterdrug Directorate, and re-authorize the U.S. Customs Service, our Nation's oldest law enforcement agency. We need to believe in our future. I believe that by working together, we can, we will make a difference. I hope my colleagues will join me in working to address this important problem before it becomes any worse.  Left unanswered, we will see another generation of young lives blighted. We will see families torn up by a widening circle of hurt from drug use. We saw what a similar wave of drug use did to us and to a generation of young people in the 1960s and 1970s. We are smarter now, we have better tools and better knowledge. We cannot afford to go through this again. I hope we can begin today to renew our commitment to a drug free future for our young people. I have said this in numerous town meetings, and I now say it here, ``working together, we can make a difference.''  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Drug-Free America Act, and look forward to working with my colleagues on these important initiatives.  Mr. President, I send this bill to the desk, and request that it be printed in the appropriate place in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 89       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Illegal drugs cost America more than $70,000,000,000      annually. These costs include lost productivity, as well as      money spent for drug treatment, illnesses related to drug      use, crime prevention and enforcement, and welfare.       (2) Federal, State, and local governments spend more than      $30,000,000,000 annually to combat illegal drugs and the      consequences of illegal drugs.       (3) The estimated total expenditure by Americans on illicit      drugs in 1993 was $48,700,000,000. The vast majority of these      illegal drugs are produced overseas and then smuggled into      the United States by major criminal organizations.       (4) The estimated worldwide potential of coca net      production in 1996 was 303,600 metric tons, and in the same      year, the worldwide coca cultivation was 209,700 hectares.       (5) The production of opium has also been increasing for at      least the past 10 years, and reached a new high in 1996 of      4,212 metric tons. Production throughout the world has led to      an increase in the heroin addict population of the United      States, bringing it to a new high of more than 600,000      people.       (6) Money laundering constitutes a serious challenge to the      maintenance of law and order throughout the hemisphere and      poses a threat to stability, reliability, and the integrity      of governments, financial systems, and commerce.       (7) Money laundering of illegal drug profits is an integral      part of the drug trafficking process, creating an obstacle in      fighting drugs. It is estimated that $100,000,000,000 to      $300,000,000,000 in United States currency is laundered each      year.       (8) Certification pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of      1961 is an essential tool in United States foreign policy.      Through the certification process there has been improvement      in cooperation levels that demonstrates the importance of      holding countries responsible for being major producing,      transit, and money laundering countries.       (9) The major criminal organizations that traffic in      illegal narcotics are international in scope and extremely      flexible in their activities, and are becoming increasingly      sophisticated in their methods of operation. Their influence      reaches to the highest levels of some foreign governments.       (10) The threat of corruption at all levels of government      remains a significant concern when dealing with many nations.      Explosive corruption in a number of countries is undermining      domestic processes and the rule of law. United States      assistance and the pressure of decertification have      encouraged many countries to take corruption seriously.       (11) The production and trafficking of illegal narcotics      presents a threat to United States interests, both domestic      and foreign. Drugs are a corrosive influence on our children,      our values, and our Government.                   TITLE I--DOMESTIC DEMAND REDUCTION     SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

CORE COMPETENCIES.       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       ``(1) According to a 1999 Monitoring the Future Report,      heroin use doubled among youth in the United States between      1991 and 1995. Since that time, such heroin use among such      youth has remained at the high level reached in 1995.       ``(2) The sharp increase in heroin use during the 1990's      may be a result of the introduction into the market of heroin      of a higher purity.       ``(3) According to the National Center on Addiction and      Substance Abuse, 29.9 percent of the population living in      rural areas, 32.4 percent of the population living in small      cities, and 30.2 percent of the population living in big      cities found heroin very easy or fairly easy to procure.       ``(4) Studies show a high correlation between drug use,      availability of drugs, and violence.       ``(5) A March 2000 report by the Office of National Drug      Control Policy reported that in 1999 persons using illegal      drugs were 16 times more likely than nonusers to be arrested      for larceny or theft, at least 14 times more likely to be      arrested for driving under the influence, drunkenness, and      liquor law violations, and at least 9 times more likely to be      arrested for assault.       ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is--       ``(1) to educate, train, motivate, and engage key      professionals to identify and intervene with children in      families affected by substance abuse and to refer members of      such families to appropriate programs and services in the      communities of such families;       ``(2) to encourage professionals to collaborate with key      professional organizations representing the targeted      professional groups, such as groups of educators, social      workers, faith community members, and probation officers, for      the purposes of developing and implementing relevant core      competencies; and       ``(3) to encourage professionals to develop networks to      coordinate local substance abuse prevention coalitions.       ``(c) Program Authorized.--The Secretary shall award grants      to leading nongovernmental organizations with an expertise in      aiding children of substance abusing parents or experience      with community antidrug coalitions to help professionals      participate in such coalitions and identify and help youth      affected by familial substance abuse.       ``(d) Duration of Grants.--No organization shall receive a      grant under subsection (c) for more than 5 consecutive years.       ``(e) Application.--Any organization desiring a grant under      subsection (c) shall prepare and submit an application to the      Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing such      information as the Secretary may require, including a plan      for the evaluation of the project involved, including both      process and outcome evaluation, and the submission of the      evaluation at the end of the project period.       ``(f) Use of Funds.--Grants awarded under subsection (c)      shall be used to--       ``(1) develop core competencies with various professional      groups that the professionals can use in identifying and      referring children affected by substance abuse;       ``(2) widely disseminate the competencies to professionals      and professional organizations through publications and      journals that are widely read and respected;       ``(3) develop training modules around the competencies; and       ``(4) develop training modules for community coalition      leaders to enable such leaders to engage professionals from      identified groups at the local level in community-wide      prevention and intervention efforts.       ``(g) Definition.--In this section, the term `professional'      includes a physician, student assistance professional, social      worker, youth and family social service agency counselor,      Head Start teacher, clergy, elementary and secondary school      teacher, school counselor, juvenile justice worker, child      care provider, or a member of any other professional group in      which the members provide services to or interact with      children, youth, or families.       ``(h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are      authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section,      $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and such sums as may be      necessary for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2006.''.       (c) National Institute on Drug Abuse.--Subpart 15 of part C      of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285o      et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 464Q.

PRACTICE/RESEARCH COLLABORATIVES.       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall award grants,      cooperative agreements, or contracts to public or private      nonprofit entities for the purpose of assisting local      communities and regions within States in improving the      quality of substance abuse treatment and clinical preventive      services provided in such communities and regions by      increasing interaction and knowledge exchange among key      community-based stakeholders, including substance abuse      treatment providers, community-based organizations that      provide support services to substance abusers, researchers,      and policymakers including managed care plan managers and      purchasers of substance abuse treatment services.       ``(b) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant,      contract, or cooperative agreement under this section an      entity shall--       ``(1) be a public or private nonprofit entity;       ``(2) prepare and submit to the Secretary an application,      at such time, in such manner, and containing such information      as the Secretary may require; and       ``(3) demonstrate that the entity has developed a full      partnership among--       ``(A) community-based treatment and prevention service      providers that provide treatment services representing a      variety of modalities and including both for profit and      nonprofit private entities and programs that serve diverse      populations;       ``(B) researchers on substance abuse prevention and      treatment issues;       ``(C) government officials from the community involved in      the grant application;       ``(D) State officials involved in the funding of substance      abuse prevention and treatment services;       ``(E) service organizations that serve substance abusers      including organizations providing health and mental health      services, child welfare, law enforcement, social services,      education, and other such services; and       ``(F) policymakers.       ``(c) Use of Funds.--Amounts awarded under a grant,      contract, or cooperative agreement under subsection (a) may      be used to--       ``(1) develop ongoing communications for the entities      described in subsection (b)(3) to support the establishment      of an infrastructure for community-based studies and      knowledge transfer;       ``(2) share evaluation and applied research results in      seminars and publications;       ``(3) identify areas of particularly local concern for      further study;       ``(4) determine, in consultation with appropriate agencies      (including the National Institutes of Health), public policy      issues of interest to be included in an applied research      agenda;       ``(5) identify and describe existing prevention and      intervention strategies;       ``(6) improve methods for evaluating prevention and      treatment strategies;       ``(7) recruit or retain substance abuse educators and      practitioners to participate in specialized training programs      to improve knowledge exchange and transfer;       ``(8) provide for the implementation of training programs      to sustain the adoption of community-based treatment study      findings; and       ``(9) provide public policymakers and State officials with      appropriate information.       ``(d) Conditions.--The Secretary shall ensure that awards      made under subsection (a) are distributed among urban and      rural areas and address the needs of vulnerable populations      including ethnic and racial minorities, women of childbearing      age, individuals with sexually transmitted diseases or HIV.       ``(e) Duration of Awards.--With respect to grants,      cooperative agreements, or contracts awarded under this      section, the period during which payments under such awards      are made to the recipient may not exceed 5 years.       ``(f) Report.--A recipient of a grant, contract, or      cooperative agreement under this section shall prepare and      submit to the Secretary a report for each year under the      grant, contract, or cooperative agreement of the grant a      report that details the activities of the recipient under the      grant, contract, or cooperative agreement, and makes      recommendations for a research agenda for future years based      on the information received from those assisted under the      grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.       ``(g) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall evaluate each      project carried out under subsection (a) and shall      disseminate the findings with respect to each such evaluation      to appropriate public and private entities.       ``(h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized      to be appropriated to carry out this section, $20,000,000 for      fiscal year 2002, and such sums as may be necessary for each      of fiscal years 2003 and 2004.''.     SEC. 113. ADOLESCENT THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY TREATMENT                    PROGRAMS.       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the      ``Adolescent Therapeutic Community Treatment Programs Act''.       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Of the adolescents that currently need substance abuse      treatment services, only 20 percent of such adolescents are      receiving such services.       (2) Providing alcohol and drug treatment services reduces      health care, welfare, and criminal justice costs.       (3) Studies have found that completion of substance abuse      treatment services produces sustained reductions in drug use,      welfare dependency, crime, and unemployment.       (4) The National Institute of Justice Arrestee Drug Abuse      Monitoring drug testing program found that more than half of      juvenile male arrestees tested positive for at least 1 drug      in 1998.       (5) The 1999 Monitoring the Future study showed that more      than half of the teenagers in the United States have tried an      illicit drug by the time such teenagers finish high school,      and more than 28 percent of such teenagers have tried an      illicit drug by the time such teenagers are in eighth grade.       (6) According to the 1999 National Household Survey on Drug      Abuse, the average age of new heroin users has dropped from      26.0 years of age in 1992 to 21.3 years of age in 1998.       (7) Studies have shown that intervention at an early stage      of addiction is essential in stopping an increasingly      frequent drug user from becoming an addict. Whether      voluntarily or through legal or parental pressure, the sooner      a drug user enters into a well-designed treatment program,      the more likely such treatment is to be effective. Voluntary      participation in substance abuse programs is not necessary in      order to successfully treat a drug user.       (c) Program Authorized.--The Secretary shall award      competitive grants to treatment providers who administer      treatment programs to enable such providers to establish      adolescent residential substance abuse treatment programs      that provide services for individuals who are between the      ages of 14 and 21.       (d) Preference.--In awarding grants under subsection (c),      the Secretary shall consider the geographic location of each      treatment provider and give preference to such treatment      providers that are geographically located in such a manner as      to provide services to addicts from non-metropolitan areas.       (e) Duration of Grants.--For awards made under subsection      (c), the period during which payments are made may not exceed      5 years.       (f) Restrictions.--A treatment provider receiving a grant      under subsection (c) shall not use any amount of the grant      under this section for land acquisition or a construction      project.       (g) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be      construed to preclude qualifying faith-based treatment      providers from receiving a grant under subsection (c).       (h) Application.--A treatment provider that desires a grant      under subsection (c) shall submit an application to the      Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing such      information as the Secretary may require.       (i) Use of Funds.--A treatment provider that receives a      grant under subsection (c) shall use funds received under      such grant to provide substance abuse services for      adolescents, including--       (1) a thorough psychosocial assessment;       (2) individual treatment planning;       (3) a strong education component integral to the treatment      regimen;       (4) life skills training;       (5) individual and group counseling;       (6) family services;       (7) daily work responsibilities; and       (8) community-based aftercare, providing 6 months of      treatment following discharge from a residential facility.       (j) Treatment Type.--The Therapeutic Community model shall      be used as a basis for all adolescent residential substance      abuse treatment programs established under this section,      which shall be characterized by--       (1) the self-help dynamic, requiring youth to participate      actively in their own treatment;       (2) the role of mutual support and the therapeutic      importance of the peer therapy group;       (3) a strong focus on family involvement and family      strengthening;       (4) a clearly articulated value system emphasizing both      individual responsibility and responsibility for the      community; and       (5) an emphasis on development of positive social skills.

SEC. 114. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM IN FEDERAL PRISONS.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In April 2000, there were more than 140,000 inmates in      the Federal prison system.       (2) In April 2000, nearly 30 percent of Federal inmates      were serving sentences ranging between 5 and 10 years, and      just over 58 percent of such inmates, or 61,547 persons, were      serving time for a drug related offense.       (3) A March 2000 report by the Office of National Drug      Control Policy reported that in 1999 illicit drug users--       (A) were 16 times more likely than non-users to be arrested      and booked for larceny or theft;       (B) were more than 14 times more likely to be arrested and      booked for driving under the influence, drunkenness, and      liquor law violations; and       (C) were more than 9 times more likely to be arrested and      booked for assault.       (4) According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's      Uniform Crime Reports, drugs     are one of the main factors leading to the total number of      all homicides.       (5) In a 1999 study, the Bureau of Prisons reported that--       (A) offenders who completed a residential drug abuse      treatment program and had been released for a minimum of 6      months were less likely to be arrested and use illegal drugs      than inmates who did not participate in such program; and       (B) only 3.3 percent of such offenders who completed such      program were likely to be arrested within the first 6 months      that such offenders were in the community.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase      residential drug abuse treatment units in Federal prisons to      reduce the number of criminal offenders who are rearrested or      who use illegal drugs after release from prison.       (c) Program Authorized.--The Director of the Federal Bureau      of Prisons shall use funds made available under this section      to establish residential drug abuse treatment units in      Federal prisons.       (d) Requirements.--A residential drug abuse treatment unit      that receives funds under this section shall--       (1) maintain not less than 1,000 hours of activities during      a 1-year period;       (2) maintain a staff of such unit in which there is not      more than 1 staff member per 12 inmates;       (3) provide intensive treatment activities for all inmates      in the residential drug treatment program, including      individual and group therapy, specialty seminars, self      improvement group counseling, and education, work skills      training, and other programs; and       (4) have frequent, regular, and random drug testing for      inmates and staff.       (e) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized      to be appropriated to carry out this section $2,500,000 for      each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003.     SEC. 115. COUNTER-DRUG TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT CENTER.

(2) Basis for study.--The study under paragraph (1) shall      be based on the study entitled ``A Plan for Estimated the      Number of `Hardcore' Drug Users in the United States''.       (b) Counter-Drug Technology Initiatives.--Using amounts      appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations      in subsection (c)(2), the Counter-Drug Technology Assessment      Center of the Office of National Drug Control Policy shall--       (1) conduct outreach for purposes of reducing duplication      of activities among Federal, State, and local entities      regarding counterdrug technologies;       (2) develop and implement mechanisms for monitoring and      coordinating such activities; and       (3) assist in the transfer of such technologies to State      and local law enforcement agencies under the Technology      Transfer Program.       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is hereby      authorized to be appropriated for the Counter-Drug Technology      Assessment Center of the Office of National Drug Control      Policy for fiscal year 2002 the following:       (1) $15,000,000 for purposes of the study required by      subsection (a).       (2) $15,000,000 for purposes of activities under subsection      (b).     SEC. 116. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RESEARCH BY THE NATIONAL                    INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.       It is the sense of Congress that the National Institutes of      Health should work with or collaborate with experts from      private industry to promote research regarding      pharmacological options that may be employed to support drug      treatment efforts.                   Subtitle B--Drug-Free Communities     SEC. 121. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) A child that has a positive relationship with both      parents is less likely to use illegal drugs.       (2) Family activities, such as eating dinners together and      spending quality time together, can reduce the risk that a      child engaged by such activities will use illegal drugs.       (3) Most parents today work and have little opportunity to      spend quality time with their children.       (4) Many families are headed by single parents who work all      day and do not have enough time to spend with their children.       (5) The 1999 Parent's Resource Institute for Drug Education      study (referred to in this section as the ``PRIDE study'')      reported that more than 4,000,000 students who are between      the ages 11 and 18 used drugs regularly, and more than      1,000,000 of such students used an illegal drug every day.       (6) The PRIDE study found that students with parents who      talked to them about drug use had a 37 percent lower drug use      rate than students with parents who did not talk to them      about drug use.       (7) The 1999 Monitoring the Future study found that nearly      55 percent of high school seniors in the United States had      used an illicit drug in the past month.       (8) A 1999 Mellman Group study found that--       (A) 56 percent of the population in the United States      believed that drug use was increasing in 1999;       (B) 92 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use as      a serious problem in the United States; and       (C) 73 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use as      a serious problem in their communities.

(c) Modification of Eligibility Criteria or Amount for      Grant Renewals.--Section 1032 of that Act (21 U.S.C. 1532) is      amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(c) Modification of Eligibility Criteria or Amount for      Grant Renewals.--The Administrator may not implement any      modification in the criteria for eligibility for the renewal      of a grant under this section, or any modification in grant      amount upon renewal of a grant under this section, until one      year after the date on which the Administrator notifies the      recipient of the grant concerned of such modification.''.       (d) Source of Funds for Evaluation of Program by      Administrator.--Section 1033(b) of that Act (21 U.S.C.      1533(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new      paragraph:       ``(3) Source of funds for evaluation of program.--Amounts      for activities under paragraph (2)(B) shall be derived from      amounts under section 1024(a) that are available under      section 1024(b) for administrative costs.''.                     Subtitle C--Drug-Free Families     SEC. 131. SHORT TITLE.       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Drug-Free Families Act      of 2001''.     SEC. 132. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that in      1962, less than 1 percent of the nation's adolescents had      ever tried an illicit drug. By 1979, drug use among young      people had escalated to the highest levels in history: 34      percent of adolescents (ages 12-17), 65 percent of high      school seniors (age 18), and 70 percent of young adults (ages      18-25) had used an illicit drug in their lifetime.       (2) Drug use among young people was not confined to initial      trials. By 1979, 16 percent of adolescents, 39 percent of      high school seniors, and 38 percent of young adults had used      an illicit drug in the past month. Moreover, 1 in 9 high      school seniors used marijuana daily.       (3) In 1979, the year the largest number of seniors used      marijuana, their belief that marijuana could hurt them was at      its lowest (35 percent) since surveys have tracked these      measures.       (4) Three forces appeared to be driving this escalation in      drug use among children and young adults. Between 1972 and      1978, a nationwide political campaign conducted by drug      legalization advocates persuaded 11 State legislatures to      ``decriminalize'' marijuana. (Many of those States have      subsequently ``recriminalized'' the drug.) Such legislative      action reinforced advocates' assertion that marijuana was      ``relatively harmless.''       (5) The decriminalization effort gave rise to the emergence      of ``head shops'' (shops for ``heads,'' or drug users--``coke      heads,'' ``pot heads,'' ``acid heads,'' etc.) which sold drug      paraphernalia--an array of toys, implements, and      instructional pamphlets and booklets to enhance the use of      illicit drugs. Some 30,000 such shops were estimated to be      doing business throughout the nation by 1978.       (6) In the absence of Federal funding for drug education      then, most of the drug education materials that were      available proclaimed that few illicit drugs were addictive      and most were ``less harmful'' than alcohol and tobacco and      therefore taught young people how to use marijuana, cocaine,      and other illicit drugs ``responsibly''.       (7) Between 1977 and 1980, 3 national parent drug-     prevention organizations--National Families in Action, PRIDE,      and the National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth      (now called the National Family Partnership)--emerged to help      concerned parents form some 4,000 local parent prevention      groups across the nation to reverse all of these trends in      order to prevent children from using drugs. Their work      created what has come to be known as the parent drug-     prevention movement, or more simply, the parent movement.      This movement set 3 goals: to prevent the use of any illegal      drug, to persuade those who had started using drugs to stop,      and to obtain treatment for     those who had become addicted so that they could return to      drug-free lives.       (8) The parent movement pursued a number of objectives to      achieve these goals. First, it helped parents educate      themselves about the harmful effects of drugs, teach that      information to their children, communicate that they expected      their children not to use drugs, and establish consequences      if children failed to meet that expectation. Second, it      helped parents form groups with other parents to set common      age-appropriate social and behavioral guidelines to protect      their children from exposure to drugs. Third, it encouraged      parents to insist that their communities reinforce parents'      commitment to protect children from drug use.       (9) The parent movement stopped further efforts to      decriminalize marijuana, both in the States and at the      Federal level.       (10) The parent movement worked for laws to ban the sale of      drug paraphernalia. If drugs were illegal, it made no sense      to condone the sale of toys and implements to enhance the use      of illegal drugs, particularly when those products targeted      children. As town, cities, counties, and States passed anti-     paraphernalia laws, drug legalization organizations      challenged their Constitutionality in Federal courts until      the early 1980's, when the United States Supreme Court upheld      Nebraska's law and established the right of communities to      ban the sale of drug paraphernalia.       (11) The parent movement insisted that drug-education      materials convey a strong no-use message in compliance with      both the law and with medical and scientific information that      demonstrates that drugs are harmful, particularly to young      people.       (12) The parent movement encouraged others in society to      join the drug prevention effort and many did, from First Lady      Nancy Reagan to the entertainment industry, the business      community, the media, the medical community, the educational      community, the criminal justice community, the faith      community, and local, State, and national political leaders.       (13) The parent movement helped to cause drug use among      young people to peak in 1979. As its efforts continued      throughout the next decade, and as others joined parents to      expand the drug-prevention movement, between 1979 and 1992      these collaborative prevention efforts contributed to      reducing monthly illicit drug use by two-thirds among      adolescents and young adults and reduced daily marijuana use      among high-school seniors from 10.7 percent to 1.9 percent.      Concurrently, both the parent movement and the larger      prevention movement that evolved throughout the 1980's,      working together, increased high school seniors' belief that      marijuana could hurt them, from 35 percent in 1979 to 79      percent in 1991.       (14) Unfortunately, as drug use declined, most of the 4,000      volunteer parents groups that contributed to the reduction in      drug use disbanded, having accomplished the job they set out      to do. But the absence of active parent groups left a vacuum      that was soon filled by a revitalized drug-legalization      movement. Proponents began advocating for the legalization of      marijuana for medicine, the legalization of all Schedule I      drugs for medicine, the legalization of hemp for medicinal,      industrial and recreational use, and a variety of other      proposals, all designed to ultimately attack, weaken, and      eventually repeal the nation's drug laws.       (15) Furthermore, legalization proponents are also      beginning to advocate for treatment that maintains addicts on      the drugs to which they are addicted (heroin maintenance for      heroin addicts, controlled drinking for alcoholics, etc.),      for teaching school children to use drugs ``responsibly,''      and for other measures similar to those that produced the      drug epidemic among young people in the 1970's.       (16) During the 1990's, the message embodied in all of this      activity has once again driven down young people's belief      that drugs can hurt them. As a result, the reductions in drug      use that occurred over 13 years reversed in 1992, and      adolescent drug use has more than doubled.       (17) In 1970, 40.5 percent of women in the workforce were      married. By 1997, that percentage has climbed to 61.6      percent, meaning fewer parents have time to volunteer. Many      families are headed by single parents. In some families no      parents are available, and grandparents, aunts, uncles, or      foster parents are raising the family's children.       (18) Recognizing that these challenges make it much more      difficult to reach parents today, several national parent and      family drug-prevention organizations have formed the Parent      Collaboration to address these issues in order to build a new      parent and family movement to prevent drug use among      children.       (19) Motivating parents and parent groups to coordinate      with local community anti-drug coalitions is a key goal of      the Parent Collaboration, as well as coordinating parent and      family drug-prevention efforts with Federal, State, and local      governmental and private agencies and political, business,      medical and scientific, educational, criminal justice,      religious, and media and entertainment industry leaders.

MINIMUM NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD ON                    DUTY TO PERFORM DRUG INTERDICTION OR COUNTER-                   DRUG ACTIVITIES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings      regarding members of the National Guard who participate in      drug interdiction and counter-drug activities of the National      Guard:       (1) Such members have significantly higher rates of      attendance at inactive duty training and annual training than      members of the National Guard who do not participate in such      activities.       (2) Such members attend significantly more military      training than members of the National Guard who do not      participate in such activities, thereby putting such members      at a higher state of military readiness.       (3) Such members attend significantly more non-military      training designed to enhance support of law enforcement and      community-based agencies than members of the National Guard      who do not participate in such activities.       (4) Such members are above-average soldiers and airmen who      maintain a high level of individual combat readiness.       (5) This high level of individual combat readiness has a      positive effect on individual combat readiness in the      National Guard as a whole and contributes to the success of      unit training and evaluations and unit readiness.       (6) Such members evoke positive comments regarding their      qualifications and performance in the National Guard.       (b) Minimum Number of Members on Duty.--Section 112(f) of      title 32, United States Code, is amended--       (1) by striking ``End Strength Limitation.--(1) Except as      provided in paragraph (2), at the end of a fiscal year there      may not be more than 4000 members'' and inserting ``Minimum      Number of Members on Duty Performing Activities.--(1) At the      end of a fiscal year there may not be less than 4,000      members'';       (2) by striking paragraph (2); and       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph (2):       ``(2) The President may waive the minimum in paragraph (1)      in the event that the armed forces are involved in      hostilities or that imminent involvement by the armed forces      in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.''.       (c) Applicability.--The amendments made by subsection (b)      shall take effect on October 1, 2001, and shall apply with      respect to fiscal years ending after that date.     SEC. 202.

TETHERED AEROSTAT RADAR SYSTEM.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Drug traffickers exploit openings in the United States      detection and monitoring network. Tethered Aerostat Radar      Systems (TARS) are a critical element in closing potential      routes for drug smuggling.       (2) The Tethered Aerostat Radar System, a network of 11      radar sites, serves as an important component of the      counterdrug mission of the United States by providing low      altitude radar surveillance, detection, and monitoring      capabilities to military and law enforcement entities.      Failure to operate the TARS system results in a degraded      counterdrug capability for the United States.       (3) Most of the illicit drugs consumed in the United States      enter the country over the Southwest, Gulf of Mexico, or      Florida borders. The United States will not have complete      coastal radar coverage to combat counterdrug threats unless      the entire Tethered Aerostat Radar System network is      standardized and maintained, including the Tethered Aerostat      Radar System sites in Matagorda, Texas, Morgan City,      Louisiana, and Horseshoe Beach, Florida.       (4) The Department of Defense, the lead Federal agency for      detection and monitoring, is responsible for fulfilling the      surveillance, detection, and monitoring mission in support of      counterdrug operations.       (5) The Department of Defense's current budget allocation      for the Tethered Aerostat Radar System is inadequate. At      present, 3 sites are not in operation because of the      expiration of their life cycle.       (b) Responsibility for Tethered Aerostat Radar System.--The      Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary actions to      ensure that the 11 sites that comprise the Tethered Aerostat      Radar System network are placed under the policy direction of      the Drug Enforcement Policy and Support office of the      Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low      Intensity Conflict.       (c) Limitation on Transfer.--The Secretary shall cease all      activities relating to the transfer of responsibility for the      Tethered Aerostat Radar System program to any entity outside      the Department of Defense.       (d) Report on Status.--(1) The Secretary shall annually      submit to the congressional defense committees and the United      States Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control a      report on the status of the Tethered Aerostat Radar System      network.       (2) In this subsection, the term ``congressional defense      committees'' means the following:       (A) The Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of      the Senate.       (B) The Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of      the House of Representatives.       (e) Authorization.--There is hereby authorized to be      appropriated for the requirements of the 11-site network of      the Tethered Aerostat Radar System, including standardization      of the sites located along the Gulf of Mexico of the United      States, amounts as follows:       (1) For fiscal year 2002, $76,000,000.       (2) For fiscal year 2003, $48,500,000.       (2) For fiscal year 2004, $40,500,000.       (3) For fiscal year 2005, $44,700,000.                                 ______                                       By
