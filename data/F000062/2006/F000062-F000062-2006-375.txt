 President, I rise today in recognition of the first day designated to the conservation of the world's endangered species. I would like to take a moment to thank my Senate colleagues for unanimously designating this special day, and especially to my Senate cosponsors for helping to make this day possible.  Let me also commend my constituent Mr. David Robinson for suggesting the establishment of Endangered Species Day. I appreciate his hard work and dedication. Today's designation shows that individuals like Mr. Robinson do make a difference.  I am encouraged to learn that today many fine institutions across our country will use the opportunity of Endangered Species Day to bolster public awareness about the threats facing endangered species worldwide. From lectures at local zoos to birding trips with regional Audubon chapters, events are being held nationwide to commemorate this day. My hope is that Endangered Species Day will spark the wonder and interest among young people, students, and the general public about how they can become more involved in these conservation efforts.  In fact, I am proud to note that in my State of California, conservation and management efforts have helped significantly to restore California condor, winter run chinook salmon, and California gray whale populations. It is remarkable that even species once believed to have been extinct, such as the mount diablo buckwheat and the ventura marsh milk vetch, have been newly found in our State. The dedicated conservation efforts of volunteers, organizations, businesses, private landowners, and government agencies have proved effective in rehabilitating many endangered species populations.  We can be encouraged by these developments. These instances demonstrate that with responsible management we can halt endangered species from continuing down the path towards extinction.  Such success stories also show that more needs to be done to ensure the survival of these species. There are more than 1,000 species in the U.S. and abroad that are designated as ``at risk'' of extinction. With awareness comes responsibility, and it is my hope that Endangered Species Day will inspire continued action in response to the precarious circumstances of endangered species.  Mr. President, I hope that communities across the country take advantage of this special day to discuss ways that they can participate in conservation efforts for endangered species in their State, throughout the country, and around the world.                          ____________________[Pages S4466-S4467]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH
