 Mr. Speaker, inaction is not an option for this Congress. We must have this legislation as well as some other essential legislation before we leave town. I feel strongly about that. I felt more strongly, or as strongly, a year ago when what was previously the largest fire in recent Western history burned between my district and the district of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the Biscuit Fire. We entered into discussions last fall and came very close to bringing a bill forward into the House. Unfortunately, the clock ran out because of the elections. This year we are not operating under the imperative of pending elections. We can stay here as long as we need, and we should, to get this legislation done.  The Senate bill is not a perfect bill. It is not the bill that I would have written, but it is, in my opinion, in a number of areas, which I will touch on briefly, far superior to the House bill; and it does have a statement of support from the administration. So we know that if we were to just take up that bill and pass it from the desk, which is no longer an option having gone to conference, that we could enact it into law. So hopefully there lie the seeds of an agreement here.  Why do I feel that the Senate bill is superior? What I say briefly, and it is hard to quantify things around here a lot, but the Senate bill is 760 million times better than the House bill. Someone may say, how did you come up with that number? The Senate bill included a $760 million annual authorization to do the fuels treatment. Why is that important? This is something that cannot be done for nothing. The House bill omitted any new funding for fuels treatment. The national fire plan, which is supposed to deal with these fuels issues, is chronically underfunded as the gentleman from California mentioned previously. So is firefighting. So every year the Forest Service is confronted with major fires; they then freeze and begin to borrow from other accounts and almost every year they borrow from the national fire plan fuel treatment accounts.  So instead of acting to prevent future fires, we borrow the money to pay for current firefighting because we always start the year underfunded on firefighting. This year was no exception. And despite the actions last week on other legislation, the Forest Service is still going to have to eat $300 million of those fire costs out of its budget, which means reductions in recreation and in fuel reduction and other programs that are already underfunded. So we need a substantial sum of dedicated funds to deal with this problem.  The only good study out there was done at the Northwest Research Station in Oregon. They said, looking at the Klamath forest, which is fairly typical of a lot of the intermountain forests, dry, not a lot of commercial value in there but a tremendous amount of fuel accumulation, that after backing out the commercial value of anything removed, it would still cost $1,684 an acre to do the work.                              {time}  1100  If they say there is 20 million acres that are critical and need work, that would be $34 billion. So the Senate bill, at $760 million a year, does not get all the way there, but it gets us down the road. It would provide for a big boost in rural communities for jobs to get people out there and do the work, because it would not pretend that we can do this for nothing.  Further, even more instructive, the President was to go to the Metolius basin to hold a press conference regarding the fuel reduction legislation this year. He could not because of a fire. But that Metolius thinning project was to be conducted of large trees of substantial commercial value in an area that is already eroded and virtually flat. But even given all that and given the fact there was going to be 20 million board feet of high-value commercial timber taken out of that fuel reduction, it was still going to cost a net of $400 an acre for the Forest Service. So that just underlines the point that even in the areas where there is viable commercial timber to be removed, unless they remove it all, which would not make a lot of sense in terms of protecting the values of the forest and the old fire-resistant trees, they are not going to be able to do it without paying for the work. That would cost $400 an acre. So inclusion for an authorization for funding hopefully at the Senate level, maybe even higher, would be absolutely essential to pass a bill that is going to get the job done.  Two other issues. I do not totally trust the government to always do what is right, no matter who is sitting in the White House. I did not trust the Clinton Administration to always do what was right. I do not trust this administration to always do what is right. And removing any right of meaningful appeal or judicial review is not an option, as far as I am concerned, in actions that affect public resources and the public generally, and the Senate bill does a much better job of preserving people's right to appeal and to go to court, but limits it so that there will not be frivolous appeals. It requires meaningful participation. And I believe if we adopted something like the Senate bill that there would be few, if any, appeals. And very few, if this is done right, successful appeals that would delay projects.  So the bottom line here is we do have the possibility of getting a bill done this year, and I believe we must get a bill done this year. It must include robust funding. That will not only begin to move us forward in dealing with this huge backlog of fuels accumulation and doing it the right way, leaving the large, old fire-resistant trees, returning the forests to more of a presettlement condition, a natural condition, but it will also put rural communities to work, and it will avoid sometime down the road, and unfortunately not immediately, some of these absolutely massive fires and massive costs that are incurred with the fires because after these forests are treated, fires can become more of a natural regime, and we will not have to fight them as aggressively. They will not present the threats to life and property that they do today.  So I am supporting this resolution with the hope that before this Congress leaves that we will have a viable bill that can be passed by both Houses by a large bipartisan majority and signed by the President of the United States, so we can begin this absolutely vital work before the next fire season.  I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his indulgence.
