I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), who is a member of the Navy Reserve and who serves on the House Armed Services Committee; the Veterans' Affairs Committee; and the Space, Science, and Technology Committee. He is championing the Patients First Act to prioritize ethical stem cell research that will help patients and do no harm to the youngest members of the human family.
