Speaker, we have been able to talk to participants that have participated in the program across the country. Whether it is Nebraska or Michigan or South Carolina, just about every State, and California is the one that does not participate, but the other 49 States do. In almost every single State we have testimonials from students that have participated that have said thank you. For those that did involve themselves with sex before, they are sorry. They talk about it in a number of testimonials that we have. It is important, and it is that type of peer pressure that works that we build upon as we see this program work in State after State after State.
