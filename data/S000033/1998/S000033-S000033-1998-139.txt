 Speaker, I rise in opposition to this Congress voting 1 penny of future funding for the IMF, let alone the $18 billion requested unless a number of conditions are met:  First, the taxpayers of this country should not be forced to bail out the large multibillion-dollar banks like Chase Manhattan, Citibank, and Bank America, who have made billions of dollars investing in Asia, but now that their loans have gone sour, they are running to the United States Congress and the taxpayers of this country to be bailed out. That is wrong.  Further, we should not be bailing out people like General Suharto, the dictator of Indonesia, whose family is worth $30 billion. The taxpayers of this country should not be bailing him out.  Further, I believe that we need a study to determine how effective the IMF has been in developing the global economy. My impression is that the middle class of this country is shrinking, unemployment is too high in Europe, poverty is increasing in LatinAmerica, the economy remains dismal in Africa, and now we are seeing an economic collapse in Asia. I think we need to question the whole concept of the centralized global economy and the role that the IMF is playing.                          ____________________
