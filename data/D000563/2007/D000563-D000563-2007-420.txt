I am not picking on my colleague and friend from Texas, but I only object for the purpose of raising that rule so we can start enforcing it. I think it is only fair that both sides see the amendment before the debate begins.  I withdraw my objection because I do not want to prejudice my friend from Texas at this point. But in the future, I hope we can all live by that rule.
