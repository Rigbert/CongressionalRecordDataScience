President, I want to take this opportunity to commend Senator Campbell for his efforts to protect consumers from con artists who try to cheat Americans using deceptive mailings. I am pleased to join in support of his legislation.  Senator Campbell's bill would require a disclosure on mailings to inform individuals that they have not automatically won a prize and that a purchase is not necessary to participate in a sweepstakes contest. New civil penalties could be imposed on violations of the provisions against sending deceptive mail.  Senator Campbell has been a strong leader and forceful advocate for curtailing abuses by sweepstakes firms who send misleading mailings that suggest that people have won hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars. Such deceptive mailings have caused people across the country to buy unnecessary products or to send money in the hope of winning a large prize. One scam even prompted some individuals to fly to Florida thinking they had won the grand prize in a major sweepstakes.  Millions of Americans have received sweepstakes letters that use deceptive marketing ploys to encourage the purchase of magazines and other products. A common tactic is a promise of winnings printed in large type, such as: ``You Were Declared One of Our Latest Sweepstakes Winners And You're About to Be Paid $833,337 in Cash!'' Of course, the recipient isn't really a winner, as the fine print said the money is won only ``If you have and return the grand prize winning number in time.''  Another problem is what I call ``government look-alike mailings,'' which look deceptively like mailings from Federal agencies. An example of such a deceptive mailing was sent to be by a woman from Machiasport, Maine. The letter was marked ``Urgent Delivery, A Special Notification of Cash Currently Being Held by the U.S. Government is ready for shipment to you.'' A postcard asks the consumer to send $9.97 to learn how to receive this cash. Of course, this was not a legitimate mailing from the Federal Government, but simply a ploy used by an unscrupulous individual to trick an unsuspecting consumer into sending money.  The experience of my constituents, as well as testimony presented by Senator Campbell and others at the hearing chaired by our colleague, Senator Cochran, convinced me that Congress must pass strong legislation to stop sweepstakes fraud and deceptive mailings.  As Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have focused our agenda on a number of consumer frauds, and I will be working with Senator Cochran to further examine the issue of deceptive mailings in the coming months. I commend Senator Campbell for his leadership and look forward to working with him on this issue next year.                          ____________________
