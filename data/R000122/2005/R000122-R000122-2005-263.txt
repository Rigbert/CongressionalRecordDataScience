President, I rise in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 3, which will reauthorize our Nation's surface transportation laws and provided significant and needed resources to maintain and improve our nation's roads, bridges, and transit systems.  For Rhode Island, this legislation is welcome news and will bring tremendous resources to address a number of high-priority highway and transit projects.  This conference report is the product of hard work and bipartisan cooperation, and I was pleased and proud to be named as a conferee on the transit title of this conference report. I believe the transit title of this bill continues the trend of TEA-21 of investing more in transit systems to the benefit of our economy and our environment.  I want to thank Chairman Shelby and Sherry Little, Rich Steinman, and John East of his staff for their hard work and bipartisan spirit. I also want to commend my ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, who has fought for transit since the first day he took office, as well as his staff, Sarah Kline and Aaron Klein, for their tireless work in helping my office and others. Lastly, I want to thank my subcommittee chairman, Senator Allard, and his able staff, Tewana Wilkerson, for their work on balancing the needs of old and new transit systems.
