 President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding Kentucky educator who retired just this last week as a teacher at an award-winning high school in Louisville. Through 32 years of dedicated service to Trinity High School, Maurice ``Woody'' Woods has impacted the lives of thousands of young men.  Now, a familiar face will be absent in the classrooms of this nationally recognized school of excellence. However, you can be sure that Mr. Woods will remain an important part of the Trinity family. As a teacher of U.S. and world history, government, and business classes, he has instilled in his students a sense of pride in the American governmental system. He has also taught his students the importance of being prepared to face the challenges of the business world.  ``Woody is a true gentleman, in the purest sense of the word,'' says a fellow Trinity teacher. And indeed, Mr. Woods has served as a source of goodness and kindness for as long as most around Trinity can remember.  A former student said, ``Mr. Woods epitomizes the ideal teacher. In fact, he is one of the few teachers who really knows, loves, and has experienced the lessons he passes on to his students. Woody is history.''  Mr. Woods has also been very active outside the classroom as an author and a volunteer in his school and his community. He has always taught his students the value of serving the community. This is evident in the fact that several of his former students have gone on to themselves teach at Trinity and other institutions throughout Kentucky.  As an author, his book on Kentucky history was written only after visiting each and every county seat in the Commonwealth. Mr. Woods has shown a tremendous interest in sharing Kentucky's history with young and old alike. His book about Kentucky landmarks is also a favorite of scholars throughout my State.  As a volunteer, Mr. Woods has again sparked his students' interest in American Government, serving as moderator to both the Young Republicans, as well as the Young Democrats. His care for his students is certainly visible, as Mr. Woods is often found late in the day tutoring or just talking to his students about a wide variety of subjects.  So Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career of this outstanding Kentucky teacher, Mr. Maurice Woods. He is a man that other teachers can look to as a model for caring, compassion, and dedication. And although he will no longer teach in the classroom, his years of service will most definitely live on through his students of the past 32 years.                          ____________________
