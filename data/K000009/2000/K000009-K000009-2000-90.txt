Chairman, perhaps the officials from the Food and Drug Administration are listening to this debate. If there is any doubt in their minds as to the net effect of this amendment as we move towards conference, we can tighten up the language to make sure that we do nothing to lessen the food, drug, and safety laws of the country, which are the strongest in the world, to protect the health of our people.  I know that neither gentlemen would want to undermine that. Obviously, they would want to improve it. Maybe there is some way that FDA could indicate on the boxes that it is from an FDA-approved facility. I think we want to give consumers ultimate confidence that the purchase they are making will not harm them.
