 President, let me echo the remarks of my good friend, the majority leader. We have had an opportunity over the last couple of days to have some very constructive exchanges of views about how to move forward. Those discussions continue, and I share his optimism that we are going to get a result that will be acceptable to both sides.                       Reservation of Leader Time
