Speaker, today I was joined by the other nine members of the Indiana House delegation in introducing legislation to name a post office in East Chicago, Indiana, after a true hero of my congressional district, Marine Corps Lance Corporal Harold Gomez. Lance Corporal Gomez was the first citizen of Northwest Indiana to give his life for his country during the Vietnam War. My colleagues and I firmly believe that the time has come to honor him in a way that will value his memory and his sacrifice. To name a post office after Lance Corporal Gomez, a place that is synonymous in our country with the center of a community's life, is an appropriate way to accomplish this worthy goal.  Lance Corporal Gomez was born in East Chicago in 1946 and graduated from East Chicago's Washington High School in June 1965. After working briefly at Inland Steel Company, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and was ordered to Vietnam in 1966. A fire team leader in a rifle company of the Third Marine Division, a land mine killed Lance Corporal Gomez on February 21, 1967, while on duty in South Vietnam. For his valiant leadership and bravery during that day's combat, the Marine Corps posthumously awarded him the Silver Star Medal. Lance Corporal Gomez was also awarded the Purple Heart Medal, a Combat Action Ribbon, a Presidential Unit Citation, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Rifle Sharpshooters Badge.  In Harold Gomez's all-too-brief life, he touched many lives and was admired by friends and comrades alike. I consider it a privilege to take this opportunity to honor a true hero who still serves us now as a source of inspiration to the citizens of East Chicago and the whole of Northwest Indiana. On behalf of those citizens from my district who answered their country's call, those who made it home and those who did not, I am proud to introduce this legislation to name an East Chicago post office in honor of Lance Corporal Harold Gomez.                          ____________________
