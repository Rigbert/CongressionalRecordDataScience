Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Calvert County Board of Commissioners. The Calvert County Board of Commissioners received a 2003 Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Grant to makeover exhibits at a Gateways Network regional information center.  The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which includes more than 120 museums, state parks, wildlife refugees and other sites in five States and the District of Columbia, was created to enhance the experience of visitors to the Chesapeake Bay and its many roads, rivers and trails. Authorized by the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998, the Gateways Network is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program.  During the past four years, Gateways Network Grants have funded new maps, improved signs, and expanded trails that have made visits to parks, wildlife refuges and water trails even more exciting and enjoyable than they had previously been. These grants help enhance the public's ability to learn and enjoy the Chesapeake's stories and significance, explore its natural and cultural resources, and become involved in helping conserve and restore the Bay and its watershed. Through these projects and other Gateways Network efforts more and more people recognize the Chesapeake as a true national treasure.  In 2003, the National Park Service is awarding $1,387,309 in grant funding, matched by over $2 million in partner contributions. Thirty-two grants are being made to Gateways throughout the Bay watershed in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The Calvert County Board of Commissioners is receiving a grant of $24,520 and $32,289 in partner contributions.  The project proposed by the Calvert County Board of Commissioners will bring about a complete makeover of exhibits at the Solomons Island Visitor Center, a Gateways Network regional information center. Calvert County will design, produce and install a series of interpretive displays on both the inside and outside of the building. Presently the building presents basic information on visitor sites in Southern Maryland. The new elements will enable the center to orient people to particular Gateway sites in the region and introduce visitors to Bay themes and resources in Southern Maryland. Calvert County will contribute labor and funding to match the Gateways grant.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the assistance and vision of organizations such as the Calvert County Board of Commissioners that the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region has become the treasure that we know it to be today. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Calvert County Board of Commissioners on receiving this grant and wishing them the best of luck in completing their project.                          ____________________
