President, today I proudly rise to introduce the ``Fort Reno Mineral Leasing Act''.  Fort Reno was established as a frontier cavalry post in 1874, and it played a key role in the settlement of the west. It is a historic site of National significance and it is listed on the National Register of Historic places. Over 9,000 visitors view the fort each year.  In 1948 the U.S. Army turned its lands and buildings, at Fort Reno, over to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Today, the original site remains intact as a complete frontier post. Dozens of buildings constructed by the military, as early as the 1880's, still stand around the Historic District.  The Agricultural Research Service administers the fort site which includes the Grazinglands Research Facility, the Fort Reno Historic District, and the Fort Reno Science Park.  Many of the historic buildings are in desperate need of restoration. A small agency like the Agricultural Research Service is not financially able to keep up with the continued costs of maintenance of so much aged infrastructure. Independent studies show that over $18 million is now needed to restore the most important of the many old officers' quarters and other key buildings.  I have been an active supporter of Fort Reno and its facilities. For instance, several years ago I helped secure a Save America's Treasures Grant of $300,000 to assist a local historical organization with the costs of stabilization of exteriors on those deteriorating buildings that are most in need of renovation. In fiscal year 2004, I arranged for an appropriation of $2.1 million for construction of two greenhouses for use in research on forage grasses that is conducted by the Agricultural Research Service at the Fort Reno site.  The legislation I am introducing today will provide a revenue-neutral, non-appropriated source of funding which will be adequate to restore the historical buildings of Fort Reno, so that they will be here for future generations.  In addition, this bill authorizes the development of the oil and gas that lies beneath Fort Reno's 6,737 acres and places those funds in a special account in the U.S. Treasury that will be utilized for restoration and maintenance of those facilities. These funds will also be used to assist with handling visitors to the fort, historic interpretation and related activities. The remaining funds will be used to pay down the national debt.  The Fort Reno Mineral Leasing Act is fully supported by State legislators, local municipalities, the Chamber of Commerce, farm groups, the USDA, and the ARS Administrator at Fort Reno.  I look forward to seeing this Oklahoma-specific legislation enacted and am proud to have Senator Coburn as my original cosponsor.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              City of El Reno,                                  El Reno, OK, September 29, 2005.     Hon. James Inhofe,     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: As you know, the citizens of the City of El      Reno and others from across Oklahoma have long maintained a      strong interest in restoring the military buildings and other      historic features at Fort Reno. Fort Reno serves as a focal      point for many of this community's cultural and historical      events, and it is visited by thousands of tourists each year.       As vital as Fort Reno is to our community and the State of      Oklahoma, it has much more potential as a national historic      site. That potential cannot be realized until the historic      buildings are restored. Cost to restore this site will be      considerable. Not restoring this site will cause Americans to      lose a significant piece of our nation's history. When you      consider the importance of saving this site for generations      to come, the cost is insignificant by comparison.       The citizens of El Reno are thankful that you have      graciously agreed to consider drafting legislation that would      provide financial support for restoration and maintenance of      Fort Reno's aged buildings. You are to be commended for      acknowledging it is our responsibility to preserve our past      for future generations. I sincerely appreciate your respect      for our past and vision for our future.           Sincerely,                                                  Debbie Harrison,     Vice Mayor, City of El Reno.                                  ____                                                  City of El Reno,                                   Office of the City Manager,                                  El Reno, OK, September 29, 2005.     Hon. Jim Inhofe,     Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: The purpose of this letter is to express my      appreciation for your efforts on behalf of the citizens of      the City of El Reno, particularly as relates to restoration      of historic buildings at Fort Reno. We are grateful that you      assisted with the Save America's Treasures grant that      recently allowed work to begin on restoration of one of the      Fort's officers quarters, built before 1890. Fort Reno is one      of our city's most important resources, and we have long      looked forward to seeing it restored to its former glory.       We understand that you intend to introduce legislation that      could allow more progress to be made toward complete      restoration and future maintenance of the Fort's buildings      and other historical assets. I urge you to do so. The      benefits will be considerable, not only for the people of      this city, but for the state of Oklahoma and the Nation.           Sincerely,                                                Douglas D. Henley,     City Manager.                                  ____                                        Oklahoma State Senate,                            Oklahoma City, OK, September 29, 2005.     Hon. James Inhofe,     Russel1 Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe. On behalf of my constituents and all      citizens of Oklahoma, I wish to thank you for assisting with      efforts to obtain funding for restoration of historic      buildings at Fort Reno. When they learn of it, many people in      my district will be grateful for your support. I and others      in the Legislature have worked hard to assist those who      operate the Fort Reno Visitors Center, but the level of      funding required to rescue and maintain these old structures      and other historical resources at the Fort is beyond our      abilities.       Restoration and continued maintenance of the Fort's      buildings are of critical importance to all Oklahomans. Fort      Reno is a primary historic site in our area, and it attracts      over 9,000 visitors annually. It has great potential for      tourism and economic development, and that potential cannot      be realized until it is properly restored. I admire and      appreciate your willingness to introduce legislation that      will insure that Fort Reno's historic buildings are preserved      and maintained for future generations of Oklahomans.       Please let me know if I can assist with this important      effort in any way.           Sincerely,                                                     Mike Johnson,     Oklahoma State Senate, District 22.                                  ____                                       El Reno Chamber of Commerce                                        and Development Corp.,                                  El Reno, OK, September 29, 2005.     Hon. James Inhofe,     Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the members and Board of      Directors of the El Reno Chamber of Commerce, I wish to      express our gratitude to you for assisting the citizens of      this city and the State of Oklahoma to restore one of our      most cherished historical assets, the buildings of Fort Reno.      New sources of funding to restore and maintain the Fort's      buildings are of critical importance to us. Fort Reno is the      principle historic site in our area and it attracts almost      10,000 visitors to our city annually; however, it is badly in      need of repair and maintenance.       As you know, the costs required to complete a restoration      project of this magnitude far exceeds the capabilities of any      state, local organization or entity. We appreciate your      willingness to assist us with legislation that will insure      that Fort Reno's historic buildings are preserved and      maintained, and made available for the benefit of both      Oklahomans and our out-of-state visitors.       Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help      with this effort by calling (405) 262-1188.           Sincerely,                                                        Karen Nix,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                         Oklahoma Farm Bureau,                               Oklahoma City, OK, October 4, 2005.     Hon. Jim Inhofe,     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: We appreciate your ongoing support for      the Ft. Reno Agricultural Research Service Station. As you      know, at one time the physical ARS facility had suffered from      neglect and the reorganization of ARS. Now the physical      facility is much improved, and the research staff are doing      great work. It is truly an operation in which many of us take      great pride.       I appreciate that you have an interest in helping the      citizens of Oklahoma to preserve the historical buildings of      Fort Reno. Funding is badly needed to restore and maintain      these buildings, many of which were built as early as the      1880s. I understand you are willing to introduce legislation      that will ensure that these historic buildings are not lost,      but are preserved and maintained and made available for      viewing and use by future generations of Oklahomans.       I understand the historic area of the Fort has a lot of      local support from the community, and that you support a      revenue-neutral approach to financing the restoration of Fort      Reno without increasing our tax burden. Our much missed state      board member, Henry Jo VonTungeln, was an active proponent of      using a revenue-neutral approach to funding the restoration      of the Fort.       Your willingness to carry legislation to implement this      approach is greatly appreciated. The success of the      legislation will mean a great deal to Oklahomans and      Americans, as well as the thousands of people who visit Fort      Reno each year.       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.           Sincerely,                                                    Steve Kouplen,     President.                                  ____                                       Oklahoma Farmers Union,                            Oklahoma City, OK, September 30, 2005.     Hon. James Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of Oklahoma Farmers Union      and the 100,000 family     farmers, ranchers and rural citizens our organization      represents, we appreciate your dedication to Oklahoma and      your current efforts to preserve, restore and maintain Fort      Reno here in the heart of our great state. This historical      location and buildings, built in the 1800s, remains an      attraction to thousands of Oklahomans and out-of-state      tourists each year.       Thank you for your interest, and more importantly, your      efforts to ensure much needed funding for this project. The      legislation you are currently working on in regards to Fort      Reno will ensure these buildings and this historic site will      not be lost, but instead will be available for generations to      come. We sincerely appreciate the revenue-neutral approach to      financing the restoration of Fort Reno, without increasing      our tax burden.       Again, thank you for your active role in preservation of      Fort Reno and all your efforts on behalf of our great state.           Sincerely,                                                      Ray L. Wulf,                                                  President & CEO.                                 ______                                       By
