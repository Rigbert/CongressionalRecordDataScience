Speaker, Bloomberg News reported today, and I read the quote, ``CAFTA,'' the expansion of NAFTA to all of Latin America, ``will fail in Congress.'' And Peter Morici, a University of Maryland professor and former chief economist for the International Trade Commission, comments: ``CAFTA is in trouble because of frustration with Bush administration inaction on the trade deficit and the Chinese yuan,'' which means that we are not dealing with the difficulties of the exchange rate between not just China and the United States but several other nations.  One and a half years ago, a 7-member Congressional delegation traveled to Mexico to examine the modern template for all of these trade agreements that is called NAFTA, the North American, I like to call it ``failed'' Trade Agreement, and the impact it has had on working families and farmers on both sides of that border.                              {time}  2100  The delegation included the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Solis), the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland), and myself. Our delegation produced a final report entitled ``NAFTA at Ten: Journey to Mexico.'' It is included on the Web site, www.kaptur.house.gov.  Mr. Speaker, at the end of my Special Order, I include for the Record a summary of recommendations that our delegation made to fix NAFTA. In that vein, during our trip we met other parliamentarians, including the Honorable Victor Suarez Carrera of Mexico, during that journey. Representative Victor Suarez Carrera is currently serving as a federal representative for the 16th District of Mexico City in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies, so he would be our counterpart.  He made an eloquent speech saying, I plead with you, Congress of the United States, we the people of Mexico want good trade, not just free trade. He expressed a deep desire to visit our country to tell the American people how NAFTA was not just negatively impacting the people of our country but also the people of Mexico.  And so as this Congress considers an expansion of NAFTA to Central America, the CAFTA agreement, to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, we are honored to welcome Deputy Suarez to the United States. He will be arriving tomorrow with his delegation of Mexican parliamentarians. They will be here Wednesday and Thursday and participate in extensive talks here in Congress on U.S.-Canadian and Mexico Interparliamentary cooperation on NAFTA and CAFTA. They will also travel to other places in the United States.  I want to put up a chart to show the difficulty from the United States standpoint. Every single year since NAFTA was signed, rather than the job creation we were promised, the United States has exacted larger and larger trade deficits with both Mexico and Canada. Those numbers were supposed to be exactly the reverse.  In Mexico, wages have been lowered. And Mr. Suarez comes from an area called Scala in Mexico, the southeastern region of Mexico, and we were literally in these fields with him talking to the farmers who have been displaced from their land in the nation of Mexico. It was so tragic to hear their stories. The American people need to hear the stories from the people of Mexico. It is not just our workers and farmers that are being hurt; they are being hurt as well.  Mr. Suarez is currently president of the Committee for the Center for Studies of Sustainable Rural Development and Food Sovereignty within the Chamber of Deputies. It is important to note he has been a leader and promoter of a movement in Mexico called The Countryside Cannot Take It Any More. He is also active in international peasant movements and in an inner-American network called Agriculture and Democracy.  The objectives of our trinational meeting among parliamentarians are to create an intercontinental space for reflection, exchange of ideas and collaboration related to alternative forms of economic integration and trinational development that helps people better their lives rather than reduce their livelihoods and looks ahead to what happens next after NAFTA as we stop CAFTA in its tracks.  Our effort is to foster dialogue and exchange between legislators and civil society organizations to further develop ideas for alternatives to the current framework surrounding the flawed free-trade model and to find better ways to achieve trinational development.  Another goal is to identify some of the more critical impacts of the 11 years of NAFTA, focusing on an analysis of both national level and sector-specific effects. And finally, we seek consensus among our parliaments on possible future actions that could be taken trinationally among legislators and between organizations and civil society to directly address some of the critical impacts of NAFTA and lookahead to negotiation of a NAFTA-plus agreement.  One of the border towns that we visited, and I put up this particular picture, was of women and men living in these tiny shacks who have been displaced from the countryside.  Mr. Speaker, we welcome Mr. Suarez Carrera with his colleagues and look forward to the launching of a continental effort to speak out on behalf of farmers and working people of the Americas.                    NAFTA at Ten: Journey To Mexico [From the Report of the U.S. Congressional Delegation, Nov. 14, 2003]        executive summary: nafta and the future of global trade       The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is now ten      years old. At its heart, it embodies the new heroic struggle      of working men and women to gain a foothold in the rough and      tumble global economy dominated by multinational corporate      giants. Unfortunately, it pits local workers and farmers      against global investors. It pits Neustro Maiz, a peasant      tortilla co-op in southern Mexico, against ADM, the US grain      trade giant. It pits Norma McFadden of Sandusky, Ohio, who      lost her middle class job with benefits at Dixon Ticonderoga,      against Ana Luisa Cruz of Cuidad Juarez, who earns $7 a day      with no benefits. For NAFTA to be credible as a model for      future trade agreements, it must be amended. People should be      more important than goods. A human face to trade must be      negotiated. Without it, the global divide between poverty and      wealth will exacerbate. More popular unrest will result from      unfair trade, and the social compact so necessary for global      cooperation will be shattered.       NAFTA is important because it serves as the major template      for a new global economic order integrating rich and poor      nations through trade and investment. Mexico, Canada and the      U.S. were to integrate their economies and, as a result, be      better positioned to compete globally. It was touted as the      neo-liberal model that would lift the economic condition of      all people. All ships, no matter how small, were to be      brought forward. But NAFTA worked exactly in the reverse.      Affected workers in all three nations saw their wages and      working conditions lowered. As capital moved across borders      with no social policies in place, NAFTA has triggered an      international race to the bottom as even Mexico has lost      218,000 jobs to China, a lower wage environment with a      notorious record of human rights abuses.       Capital and wealth have become more concentrated in all      three nations. The middle class in the U.S. is experiencing a      growing squeeze on benefits and job quality. In Mexico, an      endless supply of ``starvation wage'' workers was unleashed.      Now the Bush Administration is trying to spread the same      model to Central America using Central American Free Trade      Agreement (CAFTA), and throughout the rest of the Western      Hemisphere with the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).      If these agreements are passed, it is clear that only the      same can be expected, that is, expanding job washout,      underemployment, and trade deficits in the U.S. without      improved living standards in the poor countries with whom it      trades.       A reformed trade model among trading nations is needed that      yields rising standards of living for workers and farmers.      This must be based on transparent and enforceable rules of      law concerning labor, environment and business. Continental      sustainable wage and labor standards should be adopted. Trade      accords must also incorporate industrial and agricultural      adjustment provisions, and currency alignment. An      infrastructure investment plan should be negotiated as a core      provision of any trade agreement. Complementary systems for      education and safe, reliable medical care for all citizens,      including the over 9 million immigrants traveling as      itinerant labor to the U.S. every year, must be addressed as      central concerns of integrated economies.                            recommendations       Policy reforms are essential to amend NAFTA and other trade      agreements that have yielded such huge U.S. trade deficits,      job washout, and lowered standards of living.  A continental assessment of NAFTA should be launched to address its                               shortcomings       An intracontinental parliamentary Working Group on Trade      and Working Life in America, comprised of U.S., Mexican, and      Canadian members, should be established with the goal of      amending NAFTA to address its shortcomings. Such a working      group should analyze the results of NAFTA and its impact on      workers, farmers, and communities. The Working Group should      defIne a sustainable wage standard for workers in each      country and a continental labor registration system along      with enforceable labor and environmental standards. It would      identify the massive continental labor displacements that are      occurring, often with no social safety net in place. It would      explore options to deal with divergence in education and      health as well as currency fluctuations and impact of trade      on infrastructure, investment, and migration. It would      harmonize inequitable tax systems and augment credit systems      for the safe and non-usurious continental transfer of      remittances by mobile workers. It would also propose funds in      the form of adjustment assistance to cushion continental      economic integration. The organization would include as a key      component an intracontinental Agricultural Working Committee      to address the hardships faced by farmers and farm labor in      all three countries.              Trade agreements should yield trade balances       If NAFTA were working in the interest of the U.S., there      would be a trade surplus with Canada and Mexico, as the U.S.      exported more than it imported. Exactly the reverse is true.      In 2003 the NAFTA trade gap equaled 100 billion--$42 billion      with Mexico and $85 billion with Canada. This represents a      serious drag on U.S. gross domestic product and a loss of      wealth. Indeed the U.S.-NAFTA trade balance with low-wage      Mexico as well as Canada has turned decidedly more negative,      and worsened each year, contrary to NAFTA's stated aims. When      a trade agreement yields major and growing deficits for more      than three years, it ought to be renegotiated.               DEVELOP AN ALTERNATE TRADE BLOCK PARADIGM       Trade agreements must be structured to achieve rising      standards of living for a broad middle class not just the      capital class. The current NAFTA model fails to address the      root causes of market dysfunction and growing U.S. trade      deficits i.e., the managed market and regulated trade      approaches being employed by its European and Asian      competitors. With NAFTA, the U.S. chose a low wage strategy      to meet this real competition from trading counterparts that      were gaining global edge. The U.S. must counter the managed      market and regulated trade approaches of its major      competitors.                 HARMONIZE QUALITY OF LIFE UP, NOT DOWN       Rather than allowing transnational companies to set the      rules of engagement, democratic nations first should forge      international trade agreements with the world's developed      democracies and then invite in developing nations to      participate in this ''free world'' Global Trade Organization.      Such an effort holds the potential to transition these      nations upward to the same democratic, legal, and      environmental systems of the free world. Instead, the trade      relationships that have been forged link the economic systems      of first world democratic nations to Third World,      undemocratic, non-transparent systems. Social concerns like      education, environment, infrastructure, labor conditions, and      health have been ignored. The downward ``race to the bottom''      push of NAFTA continues to be felt in the U.S. as well as      Mexico and Canada.  TRADE ACCORDS SHOULD PRODUCE LIVING WAGE JOBS, LESS POVERTY AND AN                           IMPROVED ENVIRONMENT       If NAFTA were working, more good U.S. jobs would be      created, outnumbering job losses. In Mexico, workers would      experience a rising standard of living. Exactly the opposite      is true. Conservative estimates indicate the U.S. has lost      880,000 jobs due to NAFTA. These jobs are largely in U.S.      companies that merely relocate to Mexico paying ``hunger      wages.'' Wages in Mexico have been cut by a third. If NAFTA      were working in the interest of Mexicans, there would be a      reduction in poverty, a growing middle class, and      environmental improvement. Instead there is a rollback in      wages, deplorable working conditions, and growing economic      concentration of wealth in a few hands, forcing huge social      dislocation.       As U.S. jobs are sucked into Mexico, not only do more      people vanish from the middle class but also U.S. schools      lose property taxes. In a state like Ohio that has lost      nearly 200,000 jobs to Mexico, the economic decline is      visible. Ohio's income growth is declining. In 1999,      according to Ohio Department of Development statistics,      citizens in Ohio lost $30.7 billion in total income compared      to the past year. The state itself lost $15 billion. As a      result, college tuition has increased with average student      undergraduate debt rising to record levels of $18,900.      Nursing homes are understaffed with low paid workers, and the      ranks of uninsured Ohioans has risen to 1.3 million. The      State is raising taxes on everything from sales, to gas      and to property to try to fill the gap of a fleeing      private sector. Quality of life is sliding backwards.      NAFTA-related environmental enforcement remains largely      nonexistent. If NAFTA were working, environmental      improvement in Mexico would be upgrading; it is sliding      backward.TRANSITION U.S./CANADIAN DISPLACED WORKERS TO COMPARABLE EMPLOYMENT AND  MEXICO'S WORKERS AND PEASANTS TO LAND HOLDING AND LIVING WAGE STANDARD       NAFTA--displaced workers in the U.S. largely have been      abandoned in their efforts to reposition to new employment.      Unemployment benefits expire, training is inadequate, and      health benefits expire or are unaffordable. Experienced      workers rarely find jobs with comparable payor benefits.      Mexico's vast underclass, underpaid, and exploited, lacks a      living wage, affordable elementary education, basic health      care, and systems to gain property ownership and affordable      credit even for basic purchases. In order to move forward      with any future trade agreements, NAFTA must acknowledge its      human toll and respond accordingly. NAFTA provisions have led      to the displacement of thousands of small business,      industrial and agricultural workers throughout the U.S.,      Mexico and Canada. Little provision has been made to assist      these workers, farmers, and communities with any transitional      adjustment assistance. In Mexico, this has     caused masses of people to stream toward the border and the      maquiladora zones in search for jobs.       The North American Development Bank, which was established      to help local communities build their human and physical      infrastructures, has been an abject failure. It should      promote economic investment in those regions of Mexico and      the United States where jobs have been hollowed out due to      NAFTA, or infrastructure is needed. Bank assets could be      enhanced by financial contributions that flow from trade-     related transactions.  CREATE NEW CONTINENTAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BODY TO COMBAT GROWING CRIME  ALONG U.S.-MEXICO BORDER REGION RELATED TO BORDER WORKERS, DRUGS, AND              UNSOLVED MURDERS OF HUNDREDS OF MEXICAN WOMEN       The United States Departments of Labor and Homeland      Security should be tasked not only with stopping the      trafficking of bonded laborers but devising a continental      labor identification card. Along with mass migration, the      border has seen an explosion in the illicit drug trade. Law      enforcement officers on both sides of the border must battle      smuggling in narcotics and persons. A continental working      group should be directed to recommend a new solution for      combating crimes that result from the illegal drug and bonded      worker trade that spans the border.                        NAFTA AT TEN (1993-2003)       Congress narrowly passed the North American Free Trade      Agreement (NAFTA) in November 1993, after an emotional and      protracted political struggle that engaged the entire nation.      (Final Vote: 234-200--Republican: 132 ayes; 43 noes.      Democrats: 102 ayes; 156 noes. Independent: 1 no)       Wall Street confronted Main Street. The full weight of the      legislative battle was best reflected in House deliberations      (http://thomas.loc.gov). Never had a trade fight garnered      this type of attention from the general public. Multinational      corporations, many displaying their products on the White      House lawn and using offices in the U.S. Capitol itself,      lobbied hard to change the laws and relationships that govern      wages and working conditions for the majority of America's      workers.       The workers and people of U.S., Canada, and Mexico all      would be affected in major ways. Their livelihoods,      communities, and the standard of living on the continent were      at stake. Congress became the only venue in which their      concerns were given some voice.       The evaluation of America's ten-year experience with this      agreement is crucial. In 2004, debates loom over expansion of      NAFTA into other poor and middle-income countries in Latin      America through the Central American Free Trade Agreement      (CAFTA) and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).       Is the ``NAFTA trade model'' worthy of expansion? Or does      it need to be fixed?       NAFTA was a precedent-setting economic agreement. At the      time of its passage ``free trade'' was relatively a new      concept. It had been employed in rare circumstances, only      recently in U.S. history, just since 1985, when the U.S.      signed a ``Free Trade'' agreement with Israel to eliminate      all duties on trade between the two countries over a six year      period. Certain non-tariff barriers remained for agricultural      products. But Israel was a small country with a middle class      population of six million. Its integration with the U.S.      market of over 250 million consumers at the time was      accomplished with minimal disruption. Unfortunately, NAFTA's      flawed, untested architecture has served as the ``model'' for      successive trade agreements negotiated by the U.S. with      developing nations which have huge impoverished populations,      such as China. As a result, the U.S. has amassed trade      deficits with most nations in the world and, a loss of U.S.      jobs and growing stress on middle class living standards.       The NAFTA ``agreement'' should actually have been      negotiated as a ``treaty'' due to its wide-ranging impact--     socially, economically, environmentally, and politically.      Yet, its authors cagily used the legislative vehicle of an      ``agreement'' to stifle debate since Congress cannot amend      trade agreements. A ``treaty'' would have allowed much closer      scrutiny allowing time for amendment and full debate. A      treaty would have been a more appropriate approach in view of      the collateral damage NAFTA has caused especially to poor and      working people across our continent. NAFTA is very imperfect      legal basis on which to forge the terms of engagement for the      people of the American continent.                  reforming the trading block paradigm       One of NAFTA's central aims was to stimulate a North      American trading bloc that could compete with anticipated      competition from a unified European Union. As well, Japanese-     Asian integration had been already eating into global market      share the U.S. had dominated, particularly automotive      production. But rather than addressing root causes of market      dysfunction and growing U.S. trade deficits--the managed      market and regulated trade approaches being employed by      European and Asian competitors to gain global edge--with      NAFTA, the U.S. chose a low wage strategy. This has had real      consequences.       Mexico's workers have been dispossessed by a global      economic system that preys on their weakness rather than      securing for them the rights and opportunities won by first      world workers over the last two centuries. There has been no      improvement in economic conditions for the vast majority of      workers of Mexico since NAFTA. Moreover, U.S. workers      continue to lose middle class jobs. A similar plight afflicts      the European Union as it struggles to integrate the      corruption-ridden, emerging states of the former Soviet      Union. In Asia, Japan--the second largest market in the      world--remains a closed and a formidable economic powerhouse      having surpassed the U.S. in 1985 as the world's premier auto      producer. Its protected internal market and bold      manipulation of Chinese, Korean, and other Asian labor-     intensive operations has allowed it to gain growing market      strength. It secures its internal production, exploits      cheap labor elsewhere, and exports those goods to first      world markets or invests in them.       NAFTA aimed at continental ``free trade'', i.e., tariff      elimination, between U.S., Mexico and Canada. Yet by the      early 1990's, most tariffs already had been reduced between      the three nations, with an effective overall tariff rate of      about two percent. Indeed, NAFTA concerned something else.      Its unstated aim was to provide a government sanctioned      insurance scheme for rising investments by transnational      corporations in low wage nations starting with Mexico, which      was close to the U.S. market, and where subsistence labor was      plentiful. NAFTA accelerated the shipping out of U.S. jobs.      For unlike tiny Israel, the populations of Mexico and Canada      totaled over 125 million persons: Mexico's largely poor      population equals over 100 million and its workers fearful      about organizing trade unions to gain living wages. The low      wage pull was irresistible.       By the early 1990's, the U.S. was already falling behind      Europe and Asia as its global trade deficit in goods rose      with each passing year. With NAFTA's passage, the export of      U.S. jobs to Mexico exploded. Mexico started to import vast      quantities of Chinese products that then backdoored their way      into the U.S. The U.S. job market began to shift millions of      jobs to third world environments as reflected in rising      global trade deficits. Outsourcing of production and      services, even of American icon products like Amana, Brach's,      Hoover, and the PT Cruiser, became commonplace and      accelerated.                          ____________________
