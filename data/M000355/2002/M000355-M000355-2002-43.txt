 Twenty-six minutes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this amendment is related to the crisis of medical malpractice that we have across our country due to the failure to impose accountability and responsibility on big, powerful trial lawyers who are running roughshod over doctors and taking advantage of their clients. That is what this debate is about.  Senator Hatch is here and I yield him 2 minutes. After Senator Hatch, Senator Frist would like 3 minutes.
