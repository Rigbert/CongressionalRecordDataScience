  It is my understanding it has been cleared on the other side of the aisle for there to be a vote on the Smith amendment at 2 o'clock. It is my understanding, based upon a previous agreement, that would also trigger a vote on final passage on the energy and water appropriations bill.  Therefore, if I am correct about that, I ask unanimous consent that a vote on the Smith amendment occur at 2 p.m.
