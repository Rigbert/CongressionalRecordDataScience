Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Commuter Choice Act, legislation that would help the environment while giving commuters greater choices in how they get to work.  Too often, our tax code subsidizes commuting by cars at the expense of other forms of transportation. Under current law, an employer can provide its employees free parking valued at up to $170/month. The employee does not include this benefit as income, and the employer may deduct the cost of providing the parking when computing its own taxes. However, if the employer provides its employees subsidized transit passes, the employee must include the benefit as income if it exceeds $65/month. In other words, if you commute by car, you can receive the equivalent of $170/month tax free. If you commute by bus or subway, you can only receive the equivalent of $65/month tax free.  The code discriminates even more against those who walk, car pool or commute by bicycle. Suppose that, in addition to parking and mass transit, an employer wants to give its employees the choice of receiving a commuting stipend. In other words, an employee could choose between a parking space, a transit pass or $20/month to cover other commuting expenses. Current tax law dictates that the cash stipend by included as income and taxed. In addition, if the employer offers employees the OPTION of a commuting stipend, then all employees must include the value of the cash stipend as income. In other words, the employees would have to pay taxes on the value of the cash stipend, even if they chose a parking space or transit pass. This tax treatment provides a huge disincentive for employers to offer a commuting stipend in lieu of a parking space.  My legislation would level the playing field among commuting choices. First, it would increase the value of transit subsidies that an employee could receive tax free to $170/month, the same value as the parking space. In addition, it would allow employers to offer employees the choice of a commuting stipend. Finally, it would require employers to offer employees the option of a cash stipend of at least $15/month. The result is that all commuting benefits are treated more equally.  This bill can help reduce congestion and combat air pollution, and it does so without raising taxes or creating new environmental regulations. It simply gives commuters a choice.                          ____________________
