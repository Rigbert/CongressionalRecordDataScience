 President, I rise today in memory of former Hazard Police Chief Rod Maggard. Chief Maggard was a prominent member of the Perry County, KY, community, and he dedicated his life to serving his country, State, and city.  A native of the southeastern Kentucky region, Chief Maggard was born on April 9, 1944, to Ivory and Margaret Maggard. After graduating from Cumberland High School, he attended Southeast Community College. Shortly thereafter, Chief Maggard received his draft notice for the Vietnam War. Initially, he was stationed in Biloxi, MI, where he worked as a Morse radio intercept operator, and he ultimately served a 14-month tour in DaNang, Vietnam.  Chief Maggard became a State trooper in 1967 when he returned home from the war. He was a decorated trooper and even received the Trooper of the Year Award for the Hazard KSP Post. In 1981, Maggard left public service and became director of Blue Diamond Coal's security. However, in 1991, he returned to public duty when he accepted the position of police chief for the City of Hazard.  His career was highly distinguished as he earned many different forms of recognition. Chief Maggard was invited to the White House to represent the Kentucky Chiefs of Police; he also served on the Kentucky Law Enforcement Council from 1995 to 2001; in 1997 he was appointed to the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center Advisory Council; and he was president of the Kentucky Association of Chiefs of Police from 1999 to 2000. In 2001, Chief Maggard retired from the police force and became the director of the Rural Law Enforcement Technology Center in Hazard.  Though a decorated police officer and public servant, the legacy Chief Rod Maggard hoped to leave was that of a good member of his community. Current Hazard police chief Minor Allen said that Chief Maggard was not just a mentor but more like a second father to him. It was his love of Hazard and Kentucky that set Maggard apart as a great police chief, and that is the reason why Rod will be dearly missed by those he knew and with whom he worked.  Today, I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate would join me in honoring Chief Rod Maggard. I extend my most sincere condolences to his wife, Beverly; their daughters, Lesley Buckner, Brandi Townsley, and Vali Dye; his sons-in-law; brother; grandchildren; and many more beloved family members and friends. The Hazard Herald, a publication from Hazard, KY, published an obituary that highlighted Chief Maggard's outstanding service to Kentucky. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Hazard Herald, June 20, 2012]                              Rod Maggard       Rodney Mitchell Maggard, 68, of Hazard, passed away on      Wednesday, June 13, at the hospice care center in Hazard. He      was the former director of the Rural Law Enforcement      Technology Center and former chief of police with the Hazard      Police Department.       He was the son of the late Ivory Mitchell Maggard and the      late Margaret McIntosh Maggard, and was also preceded in      death by his brother, James Charles Maggard.       He is survived by his wife, Beverly Maggard; daughters      Lesley Buckner and husband Jay, Brandi Townsley and husband      Jeff, and Vali Dye and husband Kevin; brother Tommy Wayne      Maggard; godson Anthony Bersaglia; grandchildren Ali      Townsley, Walker Townsley, Mitchell Buckner, Grayson Dye, and      Avery Dye; along with a host of family and friends.

Chris Fugate      officiating. Interment was at Charlie Maggard Cemetery at      Blair, Kentucky.                          ____________________
