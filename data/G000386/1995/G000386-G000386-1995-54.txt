 President, I want to make an announcement on behalf of our Republican leader.  We are asking unanimous consent that at 10:30 a.m. the Chair lay before the Senate a message from the House on S. 652, the telecommunications bill; that there be 2 hours of debate, with 1\1/2\ hours under the control of Senator Dorgan and Senator Kerrey and the remaining 30 minutes under the control of Senator Pressler.  Further, that immediately following the debate or yielding back of time, the Senate disagree with the House amendments and the Senate agree to the House request for a conference and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and that no other motion be in order during the pendency of this House message.
