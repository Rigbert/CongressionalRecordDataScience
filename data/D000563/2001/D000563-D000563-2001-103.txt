They write in part:       The position of the Council and Mayor is quite clear: we      adopted a proposed budget that contains no cap on attorneys      fees. Our objections to a fee cap include:       A cap makes it more difficult for children to obtain      special education to which they are entitled. It is a simple      fact: a cap on fees reduces the number of attorneys willing      to take such cases and, therefore, reduces access to counsel.       A cap discriminates against low income children.       The effect of the cap is to treat the children of the      District of Columbia differently--and less favorably--than      any other child in any other state in the nation.  I was a practicing attorney before I came to Congress, and there are some wonderful people who are involved in pro bono--free--legal work. They do great work. There are also some attorneys who can't find any other kind of work; they are not up to it. I don't think we should put the future and fate of these special ed kids in the hands of an attorney who may or may not be qualified to handle the case. That is exactly what we are doing.  This is discrimination against the special ed kids in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia school system should be ashamed that they have called on this Congress to perpetuate this injustice. I hope this Congress will think twice. If you voted proudly for IDEA, if you really stand for children with disabilities, then for goodness' sake give them the legal rights to pursue the right they have under law.  I yield the floor.
