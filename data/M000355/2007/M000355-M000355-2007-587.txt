  Campbellsville University was originally founded in 1906 as the Russell Creek Academy and has proven itself to be an outstanding institution of higher education over the last 100 years. It has had an immeasurable impact on thousands of young men and women and has helped add to the academic excellence of our fine Commonwealth.  In the beginning, the Russell Creek Academy began with training departments for teacher and pastor training. In 1907 the Russell Creek Academy provided classes in music, art, and a diploma program for an enrollment of 200 students. Campbellsville University has now grown to 2,300 students as of last fall, with 38 undergraduate programs and 9 graduate programs, all while encompassing 75 acres of beautiful land near Campbellsville, KY.  To make sure that the university will continue to grow and progress for the next 100 years as it has this past century, many improvements are being made across the campus to add to its beauty and improve life for students. For instance, great progress is being made on the 800-seat Ransdell Chapel and the new Heilman Student Center. With the new School of Nursing, new tennis courts and the 48-bed addition to the Resident Village, Campbellsville University is looking forward to many new projects to keep up the demand and growth of this institution.  Academically, the School of Nursing program began this year and is off to a great start. Campbellsville University has also expanded its master of business administration program, moving along with the technological revolution by offering the program online in addition to the traditional MBA classes that the University has offered and been so well-known for over the years.  The students enrolled at Campbellsville University are proudly preparing a time capsule to commemorate this centennial celebration that will be opened in another 100 years, in 2107. The capsule will enable students 100 years from now to look at a time before they became students at Campbellsville University and compare its first 100 years to the next.  According to Dr. Michael V. Carter, the school's president, ``at Campbellsville University, faculty encourage students to grow stronger spiritually and find their true purpose in life, which is the greatest discovery of all.'' I hope that the history and tradition of this great school, encapsulated in the time capsule that they are preparing, will aid in that discovery for the students of today and a century to come.  Madam President, I ask that the entire Senate join me in congratulating Campbellsville University on this auspicious occasion; with 100 years of excellence in education behind us, we look forward to the next 100 with high hopes and anticipation.                          ____________________
