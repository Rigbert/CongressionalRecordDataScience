 President, I rise to introduce legislation having to do with the quality of air in passenger cabins of commercial aircraft.  I want to begin for a moment by telling you how I got into this. Three years ago, obviously coming to the Senate, I began a whole series of flights from San Francisco and from Los Angeles to Washington, and I noticed something. I noticed when I rode a 747 I did not get a headache and the circulation in my hand did not cease. When I rode a 757 or a 767, I began to get rather severe headaches. If I fell asleep, the circulation in my hand ceased. This, then, promptly woke me up.  I began to look into it. What did I find? I looked at Federal clean air standards for enclosed spaces. I found that the Federal standard for fresh air in prison cells is 20 cubic feet per person per minute. The fresh air standard for an office building, for a theater lobby, for a restaurant, is the same. Then I found there were no fresh air standards for commercial aircraft.  So I asked, what are the existing levels? Let me tell you what I found. The average amount of fresh air circulation in a 757 is 9 cubic feet per person. The average amount of fresh air in a 767 is 9.1 cubic feet per person per minute. The new 737's, provide an average of 9.6 cubic feet per person per minute. Now, what is the significance? The significance is that it is less than one-half the fresh air that is required in a prison cell, an office or a restaurant. And then I began to ask flight attendants about the problems. What I learned is that stories documented of sore throats and headaches, of difficulty of breathing, of poor circulation in the body and swollen legs, of colds, flus, and airborne diseases, such as flu and tuberculosis are now beginning to spiral throughout the 1.4 million passengers per day that ride commercial airlines.  Well, today I want to introduce in the Senate an idea whose time has come, and that is an aviation clean air act. This is also being introduced in the House of Representatives at the same time. Essentially, what this bill would require is that commercial airlines provide ventilation systems that provide 20 cubic feet of fresh air per person per minute in the cabin. This is equal to what is provided today by older aircraft, namely, the 747. Many of the larger commercial aircraft, such as the 737's, 757's, or 767's, as I said, provide less than one-half of what is provided by a 747.  Second, the bill would ensure that air filters used in airplane cabin air recirculation systems are monitored and changed regularly.  Third, it would require that airlines monitor humidity and ozone levels.  Fourth, it would require the FAA to create a ``1-800'' number to receive reports of illnesses relating to air travel.  I also want to introduce into the Record directly following my statement a statement of Patricia Friend, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants; a statement of Andrew Parramore, a flight attendant; a statement of Joe Johnson, a member of the Association of Flight Attendants, and Janie Johnson, a member of the Association of Flight Attendants.  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:    Statement of Patricia Friend at an Aviation Clean Air Act Press                                Conference       On behalf of the 40,000 members of the Association of      Flight Attendants, I would like to thank Senator Dianne      Feinstein and Representative Jerrold Nadler for today      introducing legislation that will significantly air quality      in the airplane cabin.       This legislation seeks to establish a minimum ventilation      standard of 20 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person      in the cabin. In addition to the ventilation standard, the      proposed legislation would also require the monitoring of air      filters, ozone and humidity. The Aviation Clean Air Act of      1996 seeks to establish a toll-free telephone number at the      FAA for individuals to report cabin air quality incidents.      These are critical elements to achieving a healthy workplace      for flight attendants.       While frequent fliers often complain of headaches, nausea,      dizziness, consistently coming down with upper respiratory      viral infections after flying, and in some cases, passing out      during flight and having oxygen administered by the flight      attendants, the flight attendants themselves are at even      greater risk from poor cabin air quality.       Flight attendants are inflight safety professionals. In the      daily performance of our duties, we inhale a greater amount      of air, increasing our exposure to viruses and bacteria,      fumes from chemical solvents, and carbon monoxide from      incomplete combustion of fuel. Flight attendants who      routinely work in cabins with poor air quality complain of      respiratory problems and other health difficulties such as      dizziness, severe headaches, loss of balance and numbness in      the hands.       Our position on increased fresh air in the cabin is      supported by the FAA's recently introduced final rule. The      FAA determined that health and safety considerations justify      these standards, stating that cabin crew members must be able      to perform their duties without undue discomfort or fatigue.       Regrettably, their rule did not address air quality in      aircraft currently being operated but applies only to future      generation aircraft. After 7 years of pending rule-making,      the FAA's final rule is still unsatisfactory offering too      little, too late.       Recall the USAir Flight 1016 accident on a DC9-31 (with      100% fresh air), in which the flight attendants helped      passengers to escape from the aircraft. One of them, Rich      DeMary, repeatedly risked his life to single-handedly save      four persons from the burning wreckage. Imagine what might      have happened had these flight attendants been suffering loss      of balance, headaches, or numbness in their hands. Whether it      is reacting to severe turbulence, safely evacuating      passengers during an emergency or responding to an onboard      fire, flight attendants must be ready to respond at a      moment's notice.       AFA strongly supports the legislation to establish a      minimum standard of 20 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per      person in the cabin. Both Senator Feinstein and      Representative Nadler deserve the thanks of all flight      attendants and passengers, whose health and safety will      benefit from this legislation.                                                                    ____                     Statement of Andrew Parramore       On April 25, 1994, on an aircraft with recirculated air,      scheduled to fly from Los Angeles to the East coast, with 103      passengers and 7 flight attendants aboard, developed severe      air cabin quality problems. The result was an eventual      unscheduled landing in Chicago, where passengers and crew      were met by paramedics, and one flight attendant was      hospitalized with abnormally high carbon monoxide levels.      Four others went en route sick list, experiencing headache,      disorientation, motor skill impairment and respiratory      difficulties, symptoms, I was told by a physician, which are      consistent with prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide      poisoning and resultant oxygen deprivation.       Immediately upon takeoff the coach cabin filled with dense      white smoke, the flight attendants experienced eye      irritation, smells described as overheating metal and/or      electrical fire, and a bitter metallic taste. The cockpit was      notified, the cabin was searched for source of possible fire,      and the problem attributed to a deferred, inoperative air      pack which had been activated. Crewmembers noted an unusually      high percentage of coach passengers in a deep, heavy sleep;      the few conscious complained of dizziness, fatigue, headache,      nausea, and complained of the cabin air. Flight attendants      were unable to complete the beverage service without rotating      to the cockpit for supplementary oxygen.       At this point, one of the flight attendants described what      happened:       ``I tried to finish setting up two liquor carts. I had to      leave at least twice and go to the forward galley to warm up      and clear my head, but eventually I went to the cockpit for      oxygen as well. When I was in the cockpit, I again told the      pilots we were feeling ill and several passengers had      complained. [The pilots] hypothesized what the problem could      be but I definitely got the impression that they thought this      was a cosmetic problem (bad smell in the cabin) and our      illness was all in our heads. They asked why the first class      flight attendants were not feeling ill. I said the smoke and      fumes were primarily in the main cabin and not first class.''       I then came into the cockpit to take oxygen.       Our symptoms worsened, and individual oxygen bottles were      soon retrieved. The flight attendant crew experienced      increasing loss of motor skills and mental alertness, loss of      ability to judge time passage and elementary computations,      disorientation, headache, extreme fatigue. The lunch service      was canceled, passengers awakened with great difficulty and      relocated from coach to business class [which is designed to      provide a somewhat increased level of fresh air per person]      where effects seemed less severe. The flight attendants      responsible for the coach section of the aircraft spent the      last two hours of the flight seated, breathing from oxygen      bottles. Individual flight attendants intermittently lost      consciousness. Passengers were either completely ``out'',      often with flushed faces, or in an apathetic, non      communicative ``daze''. The airline safety official's ``best      guess'' is that the malfunctioning air pack combusted      superheated synthetic oil, flooding the coach cabin with      resulting fumes and particulate irritants and as a byproduct      created poisonous carbon monoxide.                                                                    ____                        Statement of Joe Johnson       I have been a flight attendant for about 16 years and      traveling by air for much longer than that. With the      relatively recent introduction of aircraft with recycled air      systems, I have experienced a reduction of air quality on      board. I have experienced fatigue, difficulty in breathing,      lightheadedness, and headaches on some flights. Passengers      often complain to me of the same. The first thought is that      this could be due to smoking on board flights. However, since      most flights have been nonsmoking for some time, I believe      this is just a contributing factor.       There is a marked difference in air quality when flying      older aircraft such as the 747-100 series, any 727 or 737-200      series. I am told by experts in the field this is due to 100      percent fresh air exchange on the older airplanes. On some      newer generation airplanes, we frequently ask the pilots to      turn off the recirculation fans, which I understand, allows      more fresh air into the cabin. This procedure, I am told by      our engineers, theoretically uses more fuel, however, it does      improve air quality. You can surmise in an era of cost      control that this practice is not popular among airline      management's.       Another area that contributes to poor air quality is the      lack of adequate maintenance of the filtration systems. I      have witnessed filters that are so black and clogged I don't      know how any air could have passed through. On a recent      flight from Los Angeles to Washington, a frequent flying      passenger repeatedly asked me to ask the pilots to improve      the air quality and air flow. He proclaimed to all who were      around that, ``I travel all the time and we are all going to      have black lungs from the air on board airplanes. These new      planes are terrible.'' I repeatedly relayed his requests to      the cockpit.       Due to design, it would appear, air quality continues to      deteriorate. This is a real problem for flights attendants as      well as the traveling public.                                                                    ____                       Statement of Janie Johnson       As a veteran flight attendant for 23 years, I believe the      air quality continues to deteriorate. A great number of      flight attendants experience headaches, have difficulty      breathing, suffer from upper respiratory problems and are      fatigued.       On August 24, 1994, I worked a flight from Washington, DC      to Anchorage International via Denver's Stapleton airport. It      was an aircraft with recirculating cabin air and was a non-     smoking flight. The air was stuffy. Many passengers requested      aspirin and I myself had a terrible headache, with sharp      pains between my eyes. I also had a difficult time breathing.      It was as if someone was standing on my chest.       We reported this to the pilots and they turned off a      recirculation fan to see if it would help and it did. Within      approximately 20 minutes I found it much easier to breath and      my headache was gone.       Upon our return flight from Anchorage to Dulles, via Denver      on a different aircraft of the same type, we experienced the      same symptoms and again the pilots turned off one of the      recirculation fans. The results were the same. We did notice      that the ceiling vents in both galleys were obstructed by      lint. We logged the problems with the air quality and upon      our arrival into Denver, mechanics removed the covers and      cleaned the filters. They were almost totally blanketed with      what appeared to be lint, and other debris.       I am not a doctor nor a mechanic but just a flight      attendant that makes a living of working on board airplanes.      Lack of good air quality is negatively impacting not only my      health but the health of my flying partners and passengers      who travel on board our airplanes every day. During a      conference call regarding air quality on one of the new      generation of aircraft with recirculated air, the maintenance      engineer commented, ``when I went to training for this      system, I was told it was a flying cold.''       Numerous incidents of poor air quality have been filed by      flight attendants, yet, over the years, conditions continue      to worsen. It would appear for the sake of some fuel savings,      air quality and our health and safety continue to suffer.                                 ______      By
