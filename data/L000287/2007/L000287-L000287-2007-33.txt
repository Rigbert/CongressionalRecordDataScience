I thank the chairman for yielding.  While the legislation has done a reasonably good job of protecting most passengers with disabilities, it has had limited success in influencing air carriers to accommodate the needs of disabled individuals who require supplemental oxygen.  Currently, as an example, air carriers have the authority to allow or disallow the use of portable oxygen systems aboard their planes even when the Department of Transportation and the FAA find that the systems are safe. This leaves the use of oxygen systems supplied by the carrier. Potential layovers and delays between flights are an additional health risk and barrier to access to air flight.  In September 2005, the Department of Transportation recognized this problem and issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to clarify this situation to assist the flying public who are in need of assisted breathing devices.  Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor to commend the Department of Transportation for recognizing the problem and for issuing this proposed rule. The final rule will provide uniform standards that will allow passengers to carrytheir FAA-approved devices onboard. I ask the chairman to work with me to encourage the FAA to issue a rule expeditiously.
