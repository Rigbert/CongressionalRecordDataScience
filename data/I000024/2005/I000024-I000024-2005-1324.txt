President, I rise today in recognition of the 80th Annual ``The Prince of Peace'' Easter Pageant that has been performed annually in the historic Holy City of the Wichitas since 1926. I am very proud of this truly outstanding Oklahoma tradition and would like to congratulate the dedicated performers and organizers both past and present who have kept it alive all these years.  The pageant was the brainchild of a young pastor, Reverend Anthony Mark Wallock, of the First Congregational Church in Lawton, OK. Eighty years ago, he gathered a few hardy souls from his church and Sunday school class on a mountain peak at Medicine Park, OK, where he conducted a short Easter morning service. That worship ceremony, which was carried out in word, song, and pantomime, eventually became the world-renowned Easter pageant, ``The Prince of Peace.''  Word about the pageant spread quickly, and began attracting a larger audience. As a result, the pageant was moved to the foot of Mount Roosevelt in the heart of the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge. The twenty-two buildings at the new site were completed and dedicated on March 31, 1935, and the first pageant there, performed on April 21, drew a crowd of 82,000 people.  In the 1940's, the pageant even drew the attention of Hollywood and in 1948 the film, ``The Lawton Story--The Prince of Peace'' was produced with the participation of many local citizens in Lawton and the surrounding area. Although Reverend Wallock passed away on December 26 of that year, the story of the pageant he founded lived on in the community that he loved.  Since then, hundreds upon thousands of volunteers have carried on the annual tradition of presenting this historic production. It has become the longest continuously running outdoor Easter pageant in America. Every Easter season, on Palm Sunday Eve and Easter Eve, starting at 9:00 in the evening, 300 costumed volunteer performers bring the pageant to life.  The voices of the characters come from the reading cast. Their timed speaking gives life to the pantomiming actors. Those in charge of music, sound effects, and the all-important lighting give realism to the story. The brilliant costumes, live animals, and surprise special effects all contribute to a rich and beautiful depiction of the life of Christ.  Mr. President, as the Easter season approaches and this storied pageant enters its 80th year, I extend my gratitude for all those who have committed to keep its flame burning. The message of hope and human redemption that is at the heart of this pageant is one that we sorely need today, and I hope that Reverend Wallock's inspiring legacy will live on for 80 more years and beyond.                          ____________________[Pages S2987-S2988]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]     RECOGNITION OF THE 80TH ANNUAL PRINCE OF PEACE EASTER PAGEANT
