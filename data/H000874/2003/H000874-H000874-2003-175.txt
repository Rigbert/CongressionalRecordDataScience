Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding to me, and I want to say that I agree with the gentleman's comments with respect to the Richmond courthouse.  I might add, however, and I think the chairman hopefully shares this view, that the Los Angeles courthouse and others are on the priority list. As the gentleman knows, this committee has followed not a political agenda with respect to the funding of courthouses, but the court's determination of the most-needed facilities, of which Richmond, as the gentleman pointed out, comes very high.  I would hope the gentleman would join in urging the administration and urging the Congress to again start funding courthouses. If we do not, we are going to see the administration of justice put at risk in many of the highest demand areas in the country. So I appreciate the gentleman's comments about Richmond, but it applies as well to many other jurisdictions.
