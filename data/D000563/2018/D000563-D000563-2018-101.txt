President, American jobs have changed dramatically in the last century, but the reasons Americans work have not changed.  Work is about more than a paycheck. A job is--or ought to be--a source of dignity. Men and women who work hard may not be able to live on Easy Street, but they ought to be able to walk down Main Street with their heads held high, knowing that they can provide for the basic needs of their families, and they ought to be able to retire with dignity and security.  Keith Kelleher understands this. He understands that treating workers--all workers--fairly is not an outdated idea; it is a requirement for a sound economy and solid future. He has devoted more than four decades of his life to improving the lives of some of the lowest paid workers in our economy, including nursing home workers and home health aides.  As founding president of SEIU Healthcare in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas, Keith Kelleher has helped secure the right to form and join a union for more than 91,000 traditionally low-paid healthcare workers and to negotiate for better wages and working conditions.  Not only that, like Walter Reuther and other great labor leaders of the last century, Keith Kelleher has championed broader causes of social justice. In 2014, Keith Kelleher and the members of SEIU Healthcare helped lead the fight in Illinois for marriage equality, a year before the U.S. Supreme Court made marriage equality the law of the land.  This week, Keith Kelleher is stepping down officially from the union he helped found. He is retiring after more than 30 years at the helm of SEIU Healthcare, and I want to thank him for his contributions to economic and social justice in Illinois and in our Nation.  Keith Kelleher moved to Chicago in the early 1980s from Detroit. He was working with a group called the United Labor Unions, an organization that trained people on how to organize and work together to advance their common good.  He lived as simply as the people he came to help. He focused on the home care industry because it had some of the lowest paid workers in the state. Private-sector workers hired by the State to provide services for seniors and people with disabilities earned an hourly rate of $3.35, with no benefits. They were a forgotten group, one largely ignored by traditional labor unions.  In 1983, Keith Kelleher gathered seven home health aides in the basement of the United Methodist Temple in downtown Chicago, and they voted to organize a union. That moment was the beginning of Union Local 880. Twenty-five years later, Local 880 had grown from 7 members to 68,000 members. All great things come from small beginnings.  Keith Kelleher built Local 880 from the ground up by going door-to-door in some of Chicago's poorest, most neglected neighborhoods. He helped convince thousands of workers to pay membership fees even before Local 880 could engage in collective bargaining. They won that right in 1984, when the National Labor Relations Board officially recognized Local 880.  He convinced people that they mattered and that they could change their own lives though collective action.  He found innovative ways to raise funds for the fledgling union, canvassing for donations, selling chicken dinners on payday, and holding tag sales. Keith and his wife even figured out how to turn their wedding into a union fundraiser.  In 1985, the independent Local 880 merged with SEIU, the Service Employees International Union.  In 2007 and 2008, Local 880 merged with two other SEIU local unions in Indiana, Local 20 and Local 4. In 2009, SEIU Healthcare Illinois/Indiana merged with the SEIU Healthcare local unions in Missouri and Kansas. Keith Kelleher was elected founding president of the new combined union.  For nearly 40 years, Keith Kelleher has helped forge new partnerships and fought new battles. He is as determined as they come. One battle took nearly 20 years to win, but SEIU Local 880 never gave up, and in 2005, Illinois' Governor finally signed an executive order recognizing unionized home care workers who work as contractors for State agencies as public employees. That victory gave 50,000 workers the legal right to bargain collectively for better wages and working conditions. They have since won a 35 percent wage increase over 4 years and other improvements in benefits.  Under Keith Kelleher's leadership, Local 880 has become a significant political force. You cannot miss SEIU Health members at public events. They are often known as ``the purple people'' because of the color of the t-shirts they wear.  Keith Kelleher has fought for justice for union members and for those who don't have the benefit of union membership.  In addition to marriage equality, he has fought for a higher minimum wage across the country.  Like Tom Joad in ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' wherever there are people in need of justice, Keith Kelleher seems to be there.  As he steps down officially this week from the union he helped create, I want to thank Keith personally and wish him, his wife Madeline, and his two daughters Ryan and Aileen well. He has made a real difference in the lives of tens of thousands of workers, and his life's work will continue to lift workers up for generations to come.                          ____________________
