President, the Senate boasts many persuasive voices, but there are few stronger than that of Senator Barbara Mikulski. To call her a trailblazer does not do justice to her long and storied career in Congress, representing the people of Maryland and advancing women's rights, civil rights, and justice for all Americans. This week, she becomes the Senate's longest serving woman Senator in U.S. history.  First elected to the House of Representatives in 1976, and to the Senate in 1986, Senator Mikulski has served the people of Maryland with honor and distinction. In Congress, she has remained committed to her roots in public service, which began as a social worker in Baltimore, helping at-risk children and helping seniors. After 5 years on the Baltimore City Council, Marylanders in the State's third congressional district sent Senator Mikulski to Congress, where she has continued her hard work and tireless advocacy for women and families.  Atop her list of priorities has been giving voice to issues concerning women's health. She worked to establish the National Institutes of Health Office of Women's Health and to implement standards to ensure that all women have access to quality mammography. She fought to expand access to maternity care. Most recently, through Senator Mikulski's leadership, the historic Affordable Care Act included strong antidiscrimination provisions to ensure that being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition.  In early 2009, Senator Mikulski further proved she is, in fact, a force to be reckoned with, when her tireless efforts to advance the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act resulted in that legislation being one of the first laws to be signed by President Obama. Since the Supreme Court's 2007 decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire, Senator Mikulski worked relentlessly to restore congressional intent and reverse the Court's decision to give employers blanket immunity for their discriminatory pay practices.
