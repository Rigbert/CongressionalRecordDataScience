 This is key. I am one who has gone to try and defend the constitutional prerogatives of the Congress several times in the last decade. But the courts will not act. We need to give standing so we need to provide for judicial review by conferring standing to bring suit upon Members of Congress in the event of presidential noncompliance and limiting the court's discretionary powers to dismiss such cases.  That would fix War Powers. That would reassert the war-making powers [[Page H5664]] of the United States Congress. But if we adopt this amendment to War Powers, not repeal, we will superimpose and put in place a mere shadow of the power of Congress. And, yes, some Members of Congress might be consulted if it is convenient for the president and then we will have a war. I do not believe that that is what the American people want.
