 President, I was glad to see yesterday's announcement of a budget conference agreement. That means Congress is now one step closer to passing a balanced budget that supports a healthy economy, funds national defense, strengthens Medicare, and begins to tackle our debt problems without taking more money from hard-working Americans.  It is a balanced budget that could help lead to more than 1 million additional jobs and boost our economy by nearly half a trillion dollars, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In short, it is a balanced budget that is all about the future. That is also why it provides a tool for the Senate majority to repeal a failed policy of the past--ObamaCare--so we can start over with real patient-centered health reform.  This is a good balanced budget every Senator should want to support, and I look forward to the Senate taking up the budget agreement next week.                          ____________________
