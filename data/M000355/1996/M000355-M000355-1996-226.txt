 President, I say to my friend from Georgia, special thanks for a superb presentation.  I just want to make one additional comment to follow on. The proponents of this kind of legislation have saidover the years they wanted to level the playing field. I would say to my friend from Georgia, he and I compete in the political arena in the South. In order to level the playing field in my State, not only would you have to get a number of the newspapers sold to different kinds of owners, you would also have to change the voter registration and history of the State in order to create a remotely level playing field upon which a person with the disability that the Senator from Georgia and I share, that disability of being registered Republicans, so we could compete on a truly level playing field.  In fact, even the attempt to create a level playing field is constitutionally impermissible. Buckley verus Valeo addressed that particular issue. So I thank my friend from Georgia for a remarkable contribution to this debate.
