But more importantly, the CBO Director, appointed by Republicans, said that in his report, which was, by the way, Mr. Speaker, given after, after it was considered in either one of thecommittees, either the Energy and Commerce Committee or the Ways and Means Committee.  They did not wait for the CBO report.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I ask if he would let me finish through.
