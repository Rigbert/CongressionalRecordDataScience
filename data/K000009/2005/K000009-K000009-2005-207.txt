Speaker, I rise tonight to honor the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) and their historic achievements.  For more than 35 years, FLOC has represented the guest workers who labor in our fields and farms bringing food to our tables. They are striving to achieve the American dream, a good-paying job in a safe workplace and the ability to provide for their families. Something that everyone in America can understand.  Under the leadership of FLOC's president, Baldemar Velasquez, the organization has achieved historic gains--including the first labor agreement in U.S. history to cover guest workers. Other significant achievements include increasing workers wages, improving worker housing, and protection against harmful pesticides. FLOC's actions will provide a safer working environment for its members and a better product for the consumer.  Today, FLOC will open an office in Monterrey, Mexico, it's first outside the U.S. The office will help oversee the recruitment and transportation of guest workers. All of us have heard the nightmarish stories of coyotes smuggling workers across the border only to have the workers trapped in de-facto indentured servitude or perish in the unsafe crossing. FLOC has worked to bring workers to the U.S. legally, informing them of their rights as guest workers.  Without FLOC's assistance, so many workers would fall through the cracks. Today I celebrate FLOC's accomplishments and success. Their legacy is greater than the agreements signed. Their legacy is a workforce that is paid a living wage and laboring in a safe environment. Their legacy is hope.                          ____________________
