President, during these troubled times, our need to connect and communicate with family and friends becomes all the more important. The tragic events of the last four months and questions about the security of mail may cause some hesitation about continuing long-held traditions in which we typically participate at this time of the year. But now more than ever, renewing and maintaining ties to others is vital.  One such holiday tradition is the mailing of seasonal greetings and gifts to friends and family far and wide. Did you know that the history of holiday greeting cards in America dates back as long ago as 1875 when Louis Prang, a German immigrant in Boston, produced the first line of printed Christmas cards? He even held contests across the country offering prizes for card designs, which helped popularize the practice.  The images and messages that have decorated cards typically reflect political trends and moods of the times. World War II era holiday cards depicted Santa Claus and Uncle Sam holding American flags with messages such as ``missing you'' for servicemen fighting overseas. This year, holiday cards not only convey sentiments of peace and happiness, but feelings of pride and patriotism in our Nation's heritage of faith and freedom.  It is not surprising to note that around 1880, the post office began urging to ``post early for Christmas.'' The first U.S. Christmas stamp, which portrayed wreaths and trees, debuted in 1962. Since then various designs have graced holiday envelopes. This year, the Postal Service offers a variety of holiday postage stamps, commemorating Hanukkah; Kwanzaa; Eid, for the two most important festivals in the Islamic calendar, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and Christmas, including stamps depicting old-fashioned Santas and traditional Madonna and Child artwork.  This holiday season the United States Postal Service and the greeting card industry have been working hard to assure customers that despite the recent anthrax scare printed cards are completely safe to send through the mail. The Postal Service has distributed information to every postal address and post offices around the country have implemented extra screening procedures. The more than 800,000 postal employees nationwide have received extensive training on proper mail handling. In recent speeches, Postmaster General Jack Potter has encouraged the sending of holiday cards, emphasizing that they would be ``especially meaningful this year.''  Written greetings are a special way of making and maintaining personal connections across the miles. Cards and letters with personal messages can be read and reread, shared and displayed, and preserved for posterity. I encourage you to take time to continue this holiday ritual by sending holiday cards to family and friends this season and by supporting the work of the United States Postal Service.                          ____________________
