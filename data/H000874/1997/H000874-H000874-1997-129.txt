Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by complimenting the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Kolbe], for the fine job he and his staff have done in producing this bill. This bill represents a measured and responsible effort to allocate sufficient funds to each of the agencies covered by the bill so that they can carry out the duties assigned to them in an effective way.  Very frankly, I believe this is the best bill that we have passed in last 3 years; and I congratulate the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Kolbe], and our famous staff and others for this accomplishment.  Overall, within the constraints of the Budget Act, our allocation in this bill includes a reduction of $596 million in budget authority from the 1998 requested sum.  Mr. Chairman, basically this bill deals adequately with the IRS. We have had problems with that. That is the biggest component of the bill. Unfortunately, it does not fund law enforcement quite as much as I would like to see done. That is because of the fiscal constraints that confront us. That is understandable.  With respect to other portions of the bill, the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Kolbe] has pointed out that there are no, I repeat, no GSA projects in this bill. That is unfortunate, I know, from the standpoint of many Members who know that there are needs in their districts. But again, the fiscal constraints that have confront us have compelled us to that objective.  Mr. Chairman, I simply want to restate that the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Kolbe] has done an outstandingjob.
