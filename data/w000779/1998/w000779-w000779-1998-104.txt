President, around this building now there is that army of high-priced tobacco lobbyists who are getting ready to celebrate tonight. It looks like the tobacco industry is going to win a big round in this fight. The children lose. The powerful will beat out the powerless.  But this fight is going to have other rounds. And to those who think that the Senators who are trying to protect the kids are going to give up today, I ask, ``What are you smoking?'' The health of millions of our kids is worth a long, hot summer of debate in this Capitol. Get ready for it, folks.
