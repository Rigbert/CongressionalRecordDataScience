 Madam speaker, I, too, would like to thank the staff that worked very hard to negotiate this bill to get the overwhelming bipartisan support that it receives.  Let me say that this is a work in progress, as was the DOJ reauthorization bill that the Congress passed and the President signed last Congress, which was the first Department of Justice reauthorization that had been done since 1979.  The gentleman from New York has a legitimate concern about the sale of fake law enforcement badges. Let me say that we had hoped to include some language relative to that issue in this bill, but the devil was in the details and we could not agree upon the details before the bill came to the floor.  That does not put the issue to bed forever. When we deal with this issue in conference, I am hopeful that we will be able to get some language inserted into the final bill that goes down to the White House that deals with fake badges, because this is a very legitimate issue and there ought to be additional penalties for those who use fake badges over and above the penalties for impersonating a police officer.  So I am hopeful that the other body will deal with this issue promptly.  It does make some very beneficial improvements to how the Department of Justice deals with its grant programs, particularly with relationship to law enforcement. It does reauthorize the bulletproof vest program. And the material that has been inserted in the bill that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews) talked about, about an extraterritorial application when crimes are committed against a United States citizen and the law enforcement of the host country will not deal with that issue, I think are vitally important.  So this bill is a tremendous step in the right direction. It is a good bill. It will be made better as we continue working on it, and I am hopeful that before this Congress adjourns that it will be signed into law. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
