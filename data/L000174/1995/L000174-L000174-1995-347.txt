President, I would like to submit for the Record the remarks of William Skylstad, the Roman Catholic bishop of Spokane, WA, on the subject of the 1995 farm bill. His remarks reflects the policies of the U.S. Catholic Conference, which represents the Nation's Roman Catholic bishops.  Bishop Skylstad's thoughtful remarks reflect the American bishops' desires to save the family farm, promote wise stewardship of the land, alleviate hunger here and abroad, and sustain rural economies--goal that I hope we all share. I urge each Senator to review carefully Bishop Skylstad's observations and recommendations.  The remarks follow:              Testimony by Most Reverend William Skylstad       I am William Skylstad, the Roman Catholic Bishop of      Spokane, Washington. I serve a diocese which is mostly rural,      and which has farms of all sizes and shapes. Formerly, I was      Bishop of the Diocese of Yakima, Washington. The farming      community there relied heavily on migrant labor for its fruit      and vegetable harvests. The smaller cities in which I have      served have experienced many of the same problems of hunger      and poverty that many of our nation's large cities face. So I      come today as a pastor with some knowledge of the rural and      urban dimensions that this omnibus food and agriculture bill      addresses.        My testimony also reflects the policies of the U.S.      Catholic Conference, the policy agency of the U.S. Bishops. I      also serve as Chairman of the National Catholic Rural Life      Conference Board of Directors. The NCRLC is a national      organization founded in 1923, that serves the rural church,      and rural people in their communities.       Through our many national and international organizations      including Catholic Charities, the Campaign for Human      Development and Catholic Relief Services, we experience first      hand the plight of the poor and as the farm bill covers      domestic and international food programs as well as food      marketing and distribution, we are in a position to bring our      experience to bear on this important debate.       I submit these comments therefore, on behalf of the USCC,      with the hope that Congress will produce farm policy that      will be fair, equitable and resourceful. In a time of budget      cutting, we urge the Agriculture Committee to pursue the      common good and target scarce dollars to those most in need.       Our perspective begins with our belief in the dignity of      all people as they are created in God's image. For people to      live a dignified life, they must have an adequate and safe      food supply. Food, for us, is not just another commodity in      the grand economic scheme. We all can live without our car or      our computer but cannot live without food. It is essential      for life itself. How food is produced is also important since      we need not only a bountiful harvest, but a safe one as well.      Care for the land is as important to us as what it produces.      The common good first requires a safe and affordable food      supply.       These underlying principles, then, are what drives our      policy analysis. The basic goal of the food system is to      ensure an adequate supply of nutritious food to meet domestic      and international need in an environmentally responsible way      and to ensure the social health of our rural communities. To      meet this goal, we believe four areas of the Farm Bill need      particular attention: 1) Agriculture, 2) Hunger, 3) Rural      Development and 4) Environment.                              AGRICULTURE       Our bishops' Conference believes that a just farm system is      one that supports the widespread ownership of farm land and      the viability of the family farm. We urge you to be guided by      a principle drawn from the Bishops' pastoral letter: Economic      Justice for All; 1986. That:       ``. . . moderate-sized farms operated by families on a      full-time basis should be preserved and their economic      viability protected. Similarly, small farms and part-time      farming, particularly in areas close to cities, should be      encouraged. There is genuine social and economic value in      maintaining a wide distribution in the ownership of      productive property. The democratization of decision making      and control of the land resulting from wide distribution of      farm ownership are protection against concentration of power      and a consequent possible loss of responsiveness to public      need in this crucial sector of the economy. Moreover, when      those who work in an enterprise also share in its ownership,      their active commitment to the purpose of the endeavor and      their participation in it are enhanced. Ownership provides      incentives for diligence and is a source of an increased      sense that the work being done is one's own. This is      particularly significant in a sector as vital to human well-     being as agriculture.''       Widespread ownership of farm land is not currently being      promoted by U.S. agriculture policy. In our judgement,      current policies have resulted in a concentration of farmland      ownership which is detrimental to the interests of farming      and to the vitality of rural communities. Current public      policy fosters an increasingly industrialized system of      agriculture that requires large amounts of capital and      rewards large farms far more than smaller and medium-sized      farms. This is a matter of policy choice, not economic      inevitability.       This concentration is a result of farm policy that rewards      high production. As incentives to produce grow, the desire to      use ever-increasing amounts of chemicals and petroleum for      inputs, harvesting, and transportation likewise increases.      Dependency on such a system could have serious results if,      for example, our supply of petroleum was ever curtailed for      any period of time. Another threat of the excess      concentration of farmland could be manipulation of markets      which can be very dangerous, especially where food is      concerned.       I also believe that the low prices paid for farm      commodities are in fact subsidies to the large grain traders      and large hog and cattle feedlot operations. Deficiency      payments and loan rates based on output create a drive to      produce more and more. This favors larger farms which can      afford high inputs: inputs which depend on the generous use      of chemicals. This policy also creates a drive to buy up land      thus accelerating concentration. In addition, the large grain      traders received over $2 billion in direct export subsidies      in 1993-94 through the Export Enhancement Program. In short,      our nation's ``cheap food policy'' is a cheap grain policy      which benefits these large agribusiness corporations at the      expense of family farmers and rural communities.       We recognize the definition of ``family farm'' has taken on      many meanings. Besides a definition based on gross sales, one      helpful definition may be that the goal of the family farmer      is to create resources to support a way of life. Typically, a      family farmer/owner devotes a good portion of his or her time      to the day-to-day management and operation of the farm. The      goal of a corporate farm, by way of contrast, would be to      make a profit to support its investors. Day-to-day management      and operation of the farm is not necessarily by the owners.       How can we change policy to address the issue of support      for family farms and begin to move away from increasing      concentration of farm land? Congress needs to take a serious      look at targeting farm program dollars to small and moderate-     sized farmers and away from the large food corporations. A      clear first step would be to close the payment limitation      loopholes so that the largest farms can no longer subdivide      into multiple legal entities to avoid payment limitations.       Another way to ensure broad-based ownership of land and to      support family farmers would be to raise the ``non-recourse''      loan rate. This is also a matter of economic justice. Farmers      cannot stay solvent when they are currently producing at,      slightly above or, in many cases, below the cost of      production. We must express alarm when we read that on the      whole, farm sector profitability averaged only 2% over the      past five years while the food industry profits averaged 18%      over that same period. Setting the loan rate higher would      decrease deficiency payments (which totaled $11 billion in      1994) and would result in more family farmers surviving to      spend more of their money in rural communities.       Even if federal farm policy were changed to give farmers a      fair price for their product, and to remove the disincentives      to sustainable agriculture, it would do no good if farmers      were not able to get loans to plant their crops. In March,      bankers urged the Senate Agriculture Committee to privatize      the servicing of USDA loans and replace direct lending with a      guaranteed loan program. In the face of increasing debt load      and decreasing cash flow among most farmers, bankers are      using guaranteed loans to promote contract livestock      operations and high equity loans that inhibit the      participation of family farmers. In addition, the      Consolidated Farm Services Agency currently has no credit      sales allocations, which means that land in inventory is not      being sold to priority purchasers. These developments are      detrimental to family farmers and rural communities. Farming      requires credit for the purchase of inputs and equipment. We      urge Congress to make credit accessible to family farmers      through USDA credit programs that have been proven effective      over time.       Another important concern of family farmers is the      increasing use of contract farming and the vertical      integration of some commodities. This phenomenon has been      seen most prevalently in the poultry industry--and      increasingly in the hog industry. Rarely can independent      poultry producers participate in this industry. Contracts      between farmers and integrators offer substantial protections      for integrators and very little for the heavily-invested      contract grower. These contracts are often extremely      unfavorable for the farmers, who have little legal recourse      to force the integrators to bargain contracts in good faith.      We urge you to support efforts that would result in good      faith bargaining for contract farming.       Also of concern to the bishops is the decreasing      opportunities for younger people to enter into farming.      Efforts such as the ``Farm Link'' program, sponsored by the      religious and public interest community, deserve more      attention and support by the federal government.      Additionally, current federal programs for beginning farmers,      especially those developed in 1990 and 1992, ought to be      continued and enhanced. The strategy of developing      partnerships between government, lenders and beginning      farmers is one we call on Congress to seriously consider as      vital to the interest of maintaining a family farm system.       Part of the patchwork of family farms are minority farmers.      Black farmers have lost land at an accelerating rate in      recent years. Since 1954, the number of African-American      owned farms has declined by over 95 percent and today their      average income is only 65 percent of white farm operators.      While many of these farms are small, they have been viable,      they provide a sense of identity for the farmer and      contribute to the economic security in the community. Special      public policy measures are needed in the Farm Bill to stem      the loss of these farms, as well as those among Hispanics and      Native Americans. We recommend new policy initiatives to      assist these farmers: increase outreach and enrollment of      minorities in decision making bodies such as county      committees; provide increased access to credit through      adequate funding and enforcement under the Agriculture Credit      Act of 1987 and the 1990 Farm Bill which provide for      targeting of FmHA Farm Ownership and Operating Loans and      sales of land in inventory to African American and other      minority farmers; and adequately fund outreach programs such      as was approved in Section 2501(a) of the 1990 Farm Bill.       Farm workers must receive more attention and protection in      farm policy. They continue to be among the poorest people in      our land yet they harvest so much of our table food. Opening      eligibility and including the work experience of farmworkers      for beginning and minority farmer programs would allow some      farmworkers to become self-sufficient. The enforcement of      existing labor laws and linking compliance with those laws to      a farmers participation in program benefits would help      ensure that farmworkers are protected. Additionally, providing      information to both farmers and farmworkers on alternative      pesticides and herbicides or on new health concerns for      existing chemicals is a matter of fairness and decency.                                 HUNGER       The system of food production is unlike any other system:      it produces what is essential for life. In a world where      there are hundreds of millions of starving and malnourished      people, our faith and our social teaching calls us to speak      on their behalf and recognize food is essential to a decent      and dignified human life.                            DOMESTIC HUNGER       In the area of domestic hunger, USCC's primary concerns are      in the continuation of the goals of existing food, nutrition      and anti-hunger programs to meet the nutrition needs of many      pregnant women, poor children, families and the elderly.      Food, nutrition and anti-hunger programs play a vital role in      ending poverty, especially among our children. Due to      declining overall incomes and the breakdown of the family,      the overall child poverty rate increased by 49 percent from      1973-1992. The largest growth, 76 percent, occurred in the      suburbs--the areas once considered most immune from the      poverty crisis. Recent reports indicate clearly that our      federal food and nutrition programs do make a difference      especially for poor children.       As the bishops said in ``Putting Children and Families      First'':       ``The continuing reality of hungry children in our midst is      a dismaying sign of failure. We see signs of this failure in      our food pantries, soup kitchens, parishes, and schools. New      investment and improvements are needed in basic nutritional      programs, such as food stamps, to ensure that no child goes      hungry in America. An urgent priority is the Women, Infant &      Children (WIC) program, that still does not reach all      expectant mothers, infants, and young children in need.''      (1991)       The USCC strongly recommends the continuation of Food      Stamps, Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Program      (WIC), The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), the      school lunch program and other child nutrition and elderly      food programs that assist those in need. The proposed cuts      appear to us to go too far and the nutritional safety net      could be in jeopardy. Additionally, we believe it would be a      mistake to pit farm programs against food and nutrition      programs in a time of limited budget resources. Both programs      are necessary and need support.       While not categorically opposed in principle to block      grants, the USCC believes that block granting essential      entitlement programs such as Food Stamps could be detrimental      to uniform nutritional standards and create unnecessary      hardship on children, families and individuals in times of      economic difficulties. These programs are often the beginning      point for people who wish to work themselves out of poverty.      The USCC envisions policies that will move people from      perpetual hunger and poverty to a more sustained system of      nutritional value and self dependency.       Linkages between urban hunger and the development of urban      edge agriculture should be fostered. Such linkages should be      seen as a form of community development and empowerment which      complements and extends the traditional approaches to      addressing food and hunger issues. I encourage Congress to      direct the USDA to adopt community food security as a mission      of the agency and establish a community food security      program. Support direct farmer-to-consumer marketing efforts      by expanding the Farmer's Market Nutrition Program and the      Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program. We encourage      further expansions of government purchases of local      agricultural products. These and other provisions are part of      the Community Food Security Empowerment Act of 1995 which I      urge you to support.                          INTERNATIONAL HUNGER       While hunger in our own country remains a serious problem,      we cannot turn our backs on the 800 million people all over      the world (and over half of them children), who do not have      enough to eat. Such hunger is shameful in a world where most      believe we can produce enough food for everyone.       We believe that special efforts must be made to see food as      more than just another commodity to be traded on the      international market and that it not be used as a bargaining      chip as the United States pursues its interest in various      parts of the globe. In addition, we believe that food trade      should be conducted with global food security and equity as      its primary goals, not with raw competition as its driving      engine. Finally, patterns of overproduction and      overconsumption on the part of first world countries has a      devastating impact on the development and sustainability of      our third world neighbors. The question is: will US food aid      help poor people in food deficient nations move toward food      security, or will it foster an unhealthy dependence?       The Food for Peace Program (PL-480) needs to be re-     authorized and expanded. But it also needs to have a clear      and primary goal alleviating hunger and only secondarily the      pursuit of commercial or strategic interests.       In the 1995 Farm Bill, the United States should reinforce      its commitment to help hungry people through international      food aid programs. Over the past two years, the total level      of international food assistance provided by the United      States has decreased by nearly 50 percent. Programs to assist      those who suffer from chronic hunger, as well as U.S.      commitments to provide assistance for disaster relief, have      been scaled back.       Food assistance is truly ``Food for Peace.'' When there is      significant hunger and poverty, a country cannot experience      internal stability and economic growth. It will not develop      into a U.S. trading partner until some of its food security      problems are remedied. Food aid is not the only response, but      it has saved millions of lives and helped to improve the      quality of life for millions more. And it has provided      markets for U.S. agricultural goods and built the foundation      for future trade relations.       The limited funds available for food aid should be targeted      to those whose need is greatest and where the food can be      used most effectively to alleviate hunger now and contribute      to long-term food security. More specifically, we recommend:       1. With the downsizing of government agencies, relying more      heavily on the experience, recommendations and capabilities      of private partners--PVOs and cooperatives--for developing      and implementing title II programs.       2. Strengthening the Title II program requirements so that      the minimal amount of food tonnage required for people-to-     people development programs (conducted by private voluntary      organizations (PVOs), cooperatives and the World Food      Program) is maintained. These programs assist countries with      chronic hunger. Raiding these programs to take care of      emergency needs only creates additional emergency needs. A      new mechanism to take care of emergency situations should be      established.       3. Establishing mechanisms which assure that the U.S. can      continue to play a leadership role in responding to emergency      needs by providing food in a timely manner. Allow the      Secretary of Agriculture to use the Commodity Credit      Corporation funds to make up to 1 metric ton of commodities      available each year for emergency needs abroad.                           RURAL DEVELOPMENT       In the area of rural development, policies should be      enacted to strengthen economic development, expansion of      employment opportunities, and education in rural communities.      The lack of farming opportunities, few quality jobs, and poor      infrastructure is forcing many of our young people out of      rural communities and into the cities. This creates a drain      of talent vitally needed by our rural towns.       Some modest rural empowerment and enterprise zones have      been enacted to address funding for housing and community      facilities, business development, water and waste systems.      However, some rural residents fear that business development      projects through enterprise ``zones'' are not long term and      many rural communities are left untouched by enterprise or      empowerment zones. Policy needs to be developed to ensure      that stability to rural communities can be assured through      permanent business development.       Much needed infrastructure improvements could generate      economic development opportunities that would enhance the      overall quality of many American rural communities. Far too      many rural communities still lack adequate housing, water      access, safe roads, and public transportation which restrict      rural residents from enjoying amenities that other      communities have.       But more than infrastructure improvements are necessary.      While many farmers are economically better off than the      national average, 20 percent remain in poverty. Part of the      problem is that money is flowing out of the rural community.      Dependence on one or two key employers will be lessened if      assistance in market diversification and in creating value-     added ventures in the local town were to become a reality.       We believe the government has a continuing role in      providing for the credit needs of farmers and especially      beginning and minority farmers. Direct lending (i.e., being      the ``lender of last resort''), and servicing loans should be      part of government services to protect and promote the      viability of family farms. The advantages of existing loan      programs ought to be promoted including direct CFSA loans.      Additionally, we urge support for both credit sales--so more      beginning and minority farmers can enter farming--and      education and outreach programs to minority farmers.                              ENVIRONMENT       Our traditional concern for the environment flows from our      teachings about creation and stewardship. In 1991, our      bishops' Conference noted that:       ``Sustainable economic policies, that is, practices that      reduce current stresses on natural systems and are consistent      with sound environmental policy in the long term, must be put      into effect. At the same time, the world economy must come to      include hundreds of millions of poor families who live at the      edge of survival.'' (Renewing the Earth, 1991)       In this area we focus primarily on sustainable agriculture      but also on the support for existing environmental and      conservation programs of the federal government.       We define sustainable agriculture generally as substituting      renewable resources generated on the farm for nonrenewable,      purchased resources. Sustainable agriculture relies on      modern, evolving and highly adaptable management technology.      According to      an extensive study by the Northwest Area Foundation (an organization      promoting economic revitalization for eight states--including      my own state of Washington) entitled, A Better Row to Hoe,      sustainable farmers are more diversified, plant less program      commodities, use less fertilizer, pesticides, and energy,      rotate crops, recycle plant nutrients and manure, plant more      soil-building crops, use more cover crops, strip crops,      contour grass waterways and field windbreaks than do      conventional farmers. All of these techniques are consistent      with our principles of careful stewardship of finite natural      resources. Additionally, the new techniques of sustainable      agriculture will increase small town business opportunities      as the local community responds to the different production      and market needs of these farmers. We see this as a positive      development which corresponds to our call to value and      support rural and small town life.       While the Northwest Area Foundation study concludes that      there is general support for the concepts of sustainable      agriculture, there is a great deal of reluctance on the part      of many farmers to fully enter into these farming techniques      because of the lack of governmental support. This is      especially true in the areas of commodity program payments,      research and extension services.       Environmental performance should be a hallmark of public      farm policy. We urge the removal of penalties for converting      to sustainable agriculture and an end to the discrimination      against sustainable farmers who plant soil-conserving crops      and have fewer acres in subsidized crops. Greater emphasis on      sustainable agriculture in research and educational programs      will strengthen the technology base and provide both      beginning farmers and farmers who want to convert to      sustainable agriculture with better technical support.       We support recent conservation legislation that would      consolidate current conservation programs into a single      entity; keep the current level of funding; extend the      Conservation and Wetlands Reserve Programs (CRP and WRP) and      focusing CRP on the most environmentally sensitive lands and      encourage partial field enrollments; encourage conservation      practices by giving priority to sustainable practices rather      than wholesale land retirements; and encourage support for      sustainable livestock management practices.       In addition to these proposals we would also recommend:      Providing incentive payments to encourage whole farm      planning; Encouraging local participation by farmers,      ranchers, nonprofit organizations as well as federal, state      and local natural resources staff in the new State      Conservation Committees; Considering a grant program where a      portion of federal conservation funds can draw down local      funds for special conservation projects.       Finally, it is critical that Conservation Compliance,      Sodbuster, and Swampbuster provisions be maintained. Though      they have not been perfect programs, they have significantly      slowed the wetland destruction, soil erosion and have      improved water quality. These provisions are conditions of      enrollment in a voluntary entitlement program and should not      be viewed as regulatory ``takings'' of private property      rights, as suggested in the House-passed ``Private Property      Protection Act of 1995.''                               CONCLUSION       I encourage you to continue to promote a broad-based      ownership of the land and the means of agricultural      production, to foster the family farm, support minority      farmers and farmworkers and uphold the place of the land as a      gift from God and for all generations.                               ____________________
