I take it then that if the Senate does not pass something over here, that we would have no thought that that would be on the schedule for next week?  Mr. DeLAY. If the minority on the Committee on Ways and Means wants to participate in the process, certainly in those tax provisions that are being worked on as we speak by the Committee on Ways and Means, they could certainly participate in that process, try to get their provision in, gather the votes to pass it, and bring it out here, and hopefully they would support a tax relief bill.
