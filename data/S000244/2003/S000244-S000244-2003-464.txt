Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, I think there is a little bit of confusion around about the noneconomic damage limit. There is a specific provision in H.R. 5 that says no provision of this act shall be construed to preempt any State law whether effective before, on, or after the date of enactment of this act that specifies a particular amount of compensatory or punitive damages or the total amount of damages in a health care lawsuit, regardless of whether or not such monetary amount is greater or lesser than that that is provided under this act.  Now, every one of the 50 States is free to adjust the $250,000 limit on noneconomic damages upwards or downwards by enactment of the State legislature. My State limits it at $350,000. This is not touched by the HEALTH Act whatsoever. So if anybody thinks that this act is a straitjacket, the legislature is free to change it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson).
