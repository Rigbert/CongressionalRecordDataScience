 Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is to provide $1.5 million in Federal funding for a revival of the National Agri-Tourism Initiative under the USDA Rural Community Advancement Program.  Mr. Chairman, I do not have to explain to anybody in this room that family farmers all over this country are in desperate condition. Commodity prices are extremely low, and we are seeing the loss of thousands and thousands of family farmers and the way of life that many rural communities in Vermont and throughout this country have known.  What this amendment does is pretty simple. What it says is that in many States like mine, people come to rural areas because they enjoy the beauty, the incredible beauty that farmers help create.
