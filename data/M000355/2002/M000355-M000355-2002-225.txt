 SCHUMER. Yes, I will yield to the Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator of New York think there would be hundreds of thousands of people, as I heard him say, who would not have one of the following--he keeps talking about a valid photo ID, but as I read the underlying bill, and the provisions by the Senator from Missouri, any one of the following would satisfy--and we are talking only about first-time registrants--photo ID, utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document. How many people in America could there be who would not have one of those things? Who in America would not have had one of the things the Senator from Missouri insists be part of the underlying bill?
