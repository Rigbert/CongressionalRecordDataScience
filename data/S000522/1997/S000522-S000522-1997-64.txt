Reclaiming my time, this is the problem. When the administration says that it does not know what it means, and we sent them a copy of the amendment exactly as it was proposed, it suggests to me that we are playing a game here that we will then act as if we are doing something when, frankly, my colleagues, we are doing absolutely nothing.  As my colleagues know, I have been in this body 17 years, and it galls me, and it should gall each of us, when we do not legislate with preciseness, and that is what our amendment does. It says there are three instances: rape, incest, and life of the mother; they are exceptions. But after that we are talking about no promotion of abortion.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth].
