 It is hoped the Senate will be able to yield back some of that time to allow us to complete action on that important conference report in a reasonable amount of time.  Senators can expect votes throughout the day and into the evening, and the Senate may also be asked to consider any other appropriation matters or conference reports that become available.                          ____________________
