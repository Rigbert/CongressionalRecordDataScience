Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of James P. Rausch who retired on July 3, 2003, after 32 years of public service. At the time of his retirement, Jim was the Chief of the Congressional Affairs Office, Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He was a part of the Chief of Engineers' executive staff and the Chief's principle advisor for all legislative and congressional activities.  Jim is a lifelong resident of Maryland where he attended Towson State University and later earned a Master's Degree from the University of Maryland. Jim started federal service in 1971 with the Baltimore District of the Army Corps of Engineers where he worked on the Corps Chesapeake Bay Study and provided floodplain management services to communities to help them develop plans for reducing flood damages. In 1982 Jim accepted the first of several positions at the Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. While at Headquarters, Jim served a one-year Congressional Fellowship here in the House of Representatives. In 1991, Jim was selected to head up the Legislative Initiatives Branch in the Planning Division. He served as the principal contact for civil works matters for coordination with House and Senate public works committees. Jim had the lead on the development and defense of the Army Civil Works Legislative Program, which traditionally becomes the starting point for Congress as it puts together the water resources development acts to authorize important water resources projects and policies for the Corps of Engineers. He moved to his last position in the Corps in 1998 where he helped design the functions and structure of that office.  Jim and his wife Diane, who is a recently retired school teacher, will enjoy a trip to Ireland this summer. After that, I am sure that they both will remain active in community and government affairs for many years to come.  Jim Rausch has been a valuable member of the Corps team. Working mostly behind the scenes, Jim has been a key factor for many years in putting the right face of the Corps of Engineers before the Congress. At the same time he has communicated back to the Corps leadership the interests of the Legislative Branch. His comrades at the Corps and thepeople of this country have been well served by this dedicated public servant. He will be greatly missed by his friends at both the Corps and on Capitol Hill. The understanding and appreciation of the Corps of Engineers here in Congress will remain strong thanks to his many years of faithful service to the Nation.                          ____________________
