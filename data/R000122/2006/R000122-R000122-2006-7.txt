President, I think the Senator from Florida has put his finger on a critical issue, perhaps the most critical. I believe Dr. Gates will give good, sound advice. He will listen. But the real question is, Will that advice be accepted by the President? And will the President be able to redefine policy in such a way that is realistic and achievable? And also, will he be able to articulate this policy and rally the support of the American public as we go forward--and not only the American public but the international community? But my sense, my hope is that Dr. Gates will take that first important step of speaking truth to power, even though it is unpopular truth.
