 I appreciate the difficulties faced by rural communities in gaining and maintaining access to adequate drinking water. I also know well the good work of the RCAPs in assisting those communities. As we move into conference on this legislation I look forward to working with my colleague to see if we can maintain funding for this important program.                          White Nose Syndrome
