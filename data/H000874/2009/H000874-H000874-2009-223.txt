 As the gentleman I think knows, because I think he got a preliminary schedule from my office which had us working the first week in August, I received comments from both sides of the aisle from a lot of Members who have young children, school-aged children. One of the realities is, we called aroundthe country, and a lot of the schools are going back into session anywhere between August 15 and August 25, some later, but a lot of the schools, and Members on both sides of the aisle were concerned that if we did not break on July 31 that they would be unable to have a vacation with their children during the summer months. As a result, we concluded that we would end our session on the 31st, a week before the Senate concluded. Originally, as I say, we were both scheduled to be in the first week of August. Obviously, as the gentleman knows, the good news is that because of our rules, we are able to get our work done more quickly than the Senate is able to get its work done. So we think that we can accomplish what we need to accomplish within the time frame available.
