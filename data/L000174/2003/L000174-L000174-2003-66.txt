President, this amendment is quite straightforward. We offered it to restore the conservation funding commitment Congress and the administration made to farmers and ranchers in the 2002 farm bill. I was one of the conferees in that farm bill. I remember we went all night long. We went weekend after weekend. The final bill was a very delicately put together compromise between Republicans and Democrats in both bodies and the administration, between those in the East, those in the West, those in the Midwest. It was a very delicate balance because of the amount of money involved and how it would be allocated.  It was especially important because in this bill there was concern when it was passed whether those in the East would vote for the bill. Our amendment addressed the problem that Senators, if not all Senators, have been hearing about.  Despite the historic conservation funding levels of the 2002 farm bill, the family farmers and ranchers trying to restore wetlands are offering to change the way they farm to improve air and water quality are rejected when they seek USDA help. Producers are turning away because of a Department of Agriculture decision earlier this year to divert $158.7 million from working lands conservation programs, to pay for the conservation reserve and wetlands reserve. It goes directly against the clear directive in the 2002 farm bill. That directed the USDA use mandatory funds for the Commodity Credit Corporation to pay for CRP and WRP technical assistance.  This may sound technical, but the fact is, by not following what the Congress voted for, Republicans and Democrats alike, we end up having the administration raid the farm bill, raid working lands programs.  This chart shows what happens: $57 million diverted from EQIP, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program; $18 million diverted from the Farmland and Rangeland Protection Program; $9.6 million diverted from the Grasslands Reserve Program; and $5.6 million from the WHIP, Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, to pay for technical assistance.  All these are included for different reasons. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program helps those who fish and hunt. They were part of the overall compromise. Their money is gone.  The language of the statute, a relevant colloquy, supports this interpretation, and the General Accounting Office concurred in a recent memo that we settled a very clear intent of the Congress how that money be spent. I ask unanimous consent that memo be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     United States                                    General accounting Office,                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2002.     Hon. Herb Kohl,     Chairman,     Hon. Thad Cochran,     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural          Development, & Related Agencies, Committee on          Appropriations, U.S. Senate.     Hon. Henry Bonilla,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA          & Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of          Representatives.       Funding for Technical Assistance for Conservation Programs      Enumerated in Section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill       This responds to your letters of August 30, 2002 (from      Chairman Bonilla) and September 16, 2002 (from Chairman Kohl      and Ranking Minority Member Cochran) requesting our opinion      on several issues relating to funding technical assistance      for the wetlands reserve program (WRP) and the farmland      protection program (FPP). You asked for our views on the      following issues:       (1) Does the annual limit on fund transfers imposed by 15      U.S.C. Sec. 714i (known as the section 11 cap) apply to      Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds used for technical      assistance provided the WRP and FPP as authorized by the Farm      Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Bill).       (2) Is the Department of Agriculture's Conservation      Operations appropriation available for technical assistance      for the WRP and the FPP? and       (3) Did the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) July      18, 2002, decision not to apportion funds for technical      assistance for the WRP and the FPP violate the Impoundment      Control Act.\1\       For the reasons given below, we conclude that:       (1) the section 11 cap does not apply to funds for      technical assistance provided for the conservation programs      enumerated in section 3841, title 16, U.S.C., as amended by      section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill;       (2) the Conservation Operations appropriation is not an      available funding source for the WRP and the FPP operations      and associated technical assistance; and       (3) OMB's failure to initially apportion WRP and FPP funds      was a programmatic delay and did not constitute an      impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. Further, since      OMB has approved recently submitted apportionments for these      two programs, and since budget authority for both the WRP and      the FPP was made available for obligation, there was no      impoundment of funds in fiscal year 2002.                               background       Section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill, Pub. L. No. 107-171,      116 Stat. 278, 279 (enacted on May 13, 2002) (codified at 16      U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3841 and 3842) amended section 1241 of the      Food Security Act of 1985, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841, to provide      that the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) shall use the      funds of the CCC to carry out seven conservation programs,      including the provision of technical assistance to, or on      behalf of, producers. The WRP and the FPP are among the      conservation programs named in the 2002 Farm Bill that are to      be funded with CCC funds.       In its June 19, 2002, apportionment request, the Department      of Agriculture (Agriculture) asked OMB to apportion a total      of $587,905,000 in CCC funds to the Natural Resources      Conservation Service (NRCS) for both financial and technical      assistance related to section 3841 conservation programs. SF      132, Apportionment and Reapportionment Schedule for Farms      Security and Rural Investment Programs, Account No. 1221004,      July 18, 2002. Of the amount requested, Agriculture      designated $68.7 million for technical assistance to be      provided under the conservation programs. In its July 18,      2002, apportionment, OMB apportioned all of the funds for      financial and technical assistance requested for the      conservation programs, except $22.7 million designated for      WRP and FPP technical assistance. Id. OMB reports that it      did not apportion funds for WRP and FPP technical      assistance at that time, because OMB believed that the      section 11 cap, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 714i, limited the amount of      funds that could be transferred from CCC to other      government agencies for technical assistance associated      with the section 3841 conservation programs, and that CCC      funding of WRP and FPP technical assistance would exceed      the section 11 cap. Letter from Philip J. Perry, General      Counsel, OMB, to Susan A. Poling, Managing Associate      General Counsel, GAO, September 16, 2002. In discussions      with Agriculture regarding the use of CCC funds in excess      of the section 11 cap for section 3841 technical      assistance, OMB indicated to Agriculture that either CCC      funds subject to the section 11 cap or Agriculture's      Conservation Operations appropriation could be used to      fund this technical assistance, Id.       OMB reports that Agriculture recently submitted a new      apportionment request for $5.95 million for WRP technical      assistance (as well as the Conservation Reserve Program)      which OMB approved on September 3,     2002. Id. OMB also reports that Agriculture submitted a new      apportionment request for an additional $2 million in FPP      financial assistance, which OMB approved on September 11,      2002, bringing the total apportionment for the FPP to the $50      million authorized by section 3841. Id.                               discussion     1. Section 11 Cap       The question whether the section 11 cap (15 U.S.C.      Sec. 714i) applies to technical assistance provided through      the conservation programs authorized by 16 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 3481, 3482, is one of statutory construction. It is      a well-established rule of statutory construction that      statutes should be construed harmoniously so as to give      maximum effect to both whenever possible. B-259975, Sept. 18,      1995, 96-1 CPD Sec. 124; B-258163, Sept. 29, 1994. Based upon      the language of the relevant statutes, we can read the      statutes in a harmonious manner, and, in doing so, we      conclude that the section 11 cap does not apply to technical      assistance provided under the section 3841 conservation      programs.       The section 11 cap is set fort in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 714i,      which states, in pertinent part:       ``The Corporation may, with the consent of the agency      concerned, accept and utilize, on a compensated or      uncompensated basis, the officers, employees, services,      facilities, and information of any agency of the Federal      Government, including any bureau, office, administration, or      other agency of the Department of Agriculture . . . . The      Corporation may allot to any bureau, office, administration,      or other agency of the Department of Agriculture or transfer      to such other agencies as it may request to assist it in the      conduct of its business any of the funds available to it for      administrative expenses  . . . After September 30, 1996, the      total amount of all allotments and fund transfers from the      Corporation under this section (including allotments and      transfers for automated data processing or information      resource management activities) for a fiscal year may not      exceed the total amount of the allotments and transfers made      under this section in fiscal year 1995.''     (Emphasis added.) We note that the section 11 funding      limitation applies only to funds transferred by the CCC to      other agencies under the authority of section 11.       The 2002 Farm Bill, which amended subsection (a) of section      3841, directs the Secretary to use CCC funds to carry out the      WRP and the FPP and five other conservation programs,      including the provision of technical assistance as part of      these programs. As amended, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841 provides, in      pertinent part, as follows:       ``For each of fiscal years 2002 through 2007, the Secretary      shall use the funds, facilities, and authorities of the      Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out the following      programs under subtitle D (including the provision of      technical assistance):                           *   *   *   *   *       (2) The wetlands reserve program under subchapter C of      chapter 1.                           *   *   *   *   *       (4) The farmland protection program under subchapter B of      chapter 2, using, to the maximum extent practicable--(A)      $50,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 * * *''     16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a) (emphasis added). Section 3841      provides independent authority for the provision of technical      services to these programs.       The 2002 Farm Bill also added a new subsection (b) to      section 3841. It is this provision that has generated the      current dilemma: ``Nothing in this section affects the limit      on expenditures for technical assistance imposed by section      11 of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C.      714i).'' 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(b). When read in the context of      section 11, section 3841(b) makes clear that the section 11      cap applies only to funds transferred under section 11.      Section 11 specifically imposes the cap on ``fund transfers .      . . under this section.'' Section 11 by its terms  clearly      does not apply to amounts transferred under other      authority, such as section 3841(a). And we read section      3841(b) to make plain that, while the section 11 cap      continues to apply to amounts transferred under section      11, it does not apply to amounts transferred by section      3841(a).        Accordingly, reading the above provisions harmoniously, we      conclude that: (1) the section 11 cap by its own terms      applies only to CCC funds transferred to other agencies under      section 11; (2) 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a) provides independent      authority for the Secretary to fund the seven conservation      programs named in that section out of CCC funds; and (3) 16      U.S.C. Sec. 3841(b) makes it clear that, while the section 11      cap still applies to funds transferred by the CCC to other      government agencies for work performed pursuant to the      authority of section 11, the section 11 cap does not apply to      the seven conservation programs that are funded with CCC      funds under the authority of 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a).        Our conclusion that the section 11 cap does not apply to      the seven conservation programs of section 3841(a) is      confirmed by a review of the legislative history of the 2002      Farm Bill, which shows that the Congress was attempting to      make clear that section 3841 technical assistance was not      affected by the section 11 cap. The legislative history to      the 2002 Farm bill unambiguously supports the view that the      Congress did not intend the section 11 cap to limit the      funding for technical assistance provided under the section      3841 conservation programs. In discussing the cap, the      Conference Committee stated: ``The Managers understand the      critical nature of providing adequate funding for technical      assistance. For that reason, technical assistance should come      from individual program funds.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 107-424      at 497 (May 1, 2002) (emphasis added). In discussing      administration and funding of these conservation programs,      the Conference Committee further explained that:        ``The Managers provide that funds for technical assistance      shall come directly from the mandatory money provided for      conservation programs under Subtitle D, (Section 2701).        In order to ensure implementation, the Managers believe      that technical assistance must be an integral part of all      conservation programs authorized for mandatory funding.      Accordingly, the Managers have provided for the payment of      technical assistance from program accounts. The Managers      expect technical assistance for all conservation programs to      follow the model currently used for the EQIP whereby the      Secretary determines, on an annual basis, the amount of      funding for technical assistance. Furthermore, the Managers      intend that the funding will cover costs associated with      technical assistance, such as administrative and overhead      costs.''     H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 107-424 at 498-499 (2002) (Emphasis      added).        The ``EQIP model'' that the conferees referred to was      established in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform      Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-127, Subtitle E, 341, 110 Stat.      888, 1007 (1996) (1996 Farm Bill). For fiscal years 1996      through 2002, the Secretary was to use CCC funds to carry out      the CRP, WRP and the Environmental Quality Incentives      programs (EQIP). (Former 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841 (a)). More      specifically, the 1996 Farm bill authorized the Secretary to      use CCC funds for technical assistance (as well as cost-share      payments, incentive payments, and education) under the EQIP      program. 16 U.S.C. 3841(b). While the 1996 Farm Bill      authorized the use of CCC funds to carry out the CRP and WRP      programs, it did not specifically authorize the funding of      technical assistance out of program funds as it did for EQIP.        Importantly, five days before enactment of the 2002 Farm      Bill when the Senate was considering the Conference Report on      the Farm Bill, a colloquy among Senators Harkin, Chairman,      Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Lugar,      its Ranking Republican Member, and Cochran, an Agriculture      Committee member, makes it unmistakably clear that the      section 11 cap was not meant to apply to the provision of      technical assistance with respect to any of the conservation      programs named in 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a):        ``
