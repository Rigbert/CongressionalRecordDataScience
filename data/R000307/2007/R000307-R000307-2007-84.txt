He has been absolutely tenacious, as described by the Senator from Wyoming.  I can remember, it was about, what, 5, 6, 7 years ago, that we all were over, on a cold day, at the childcare center that is offered for employees on Capitol Hill over by the Hart building. We had a press conference. Senator Kennedy was there, I was there, Senator Dodd was there, I think Senator Jeffords was there at that time. That was 4 or 5 years ago.  So we should be moving on these things. I pledge my support to see what we can do down the road.  I rise to call up Senate amendment 102.
