Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, let me say that many years ago in the now receding past, I was privileged to be the sponsor in the Colorado legislature of one of the first omnibus domestic violence bills in the country, and in fact that bill was passed in 1995 in Colorado.  The thing we learned at that time was that one of the biggest barriers to preventing and stopping domestic violence is a lack of awareness by everybody around the country. This is a problem that is faced nationwide, which is why Congress passed the Violence against Women Act and why the Violence Against Women Office was set up in 1995.  However, if we are going to have a strong and effective Violence Against Women Office, it must be permanent, it must be independent, and it must be prepared to do much more than just simply administer grants. It needs to do outreach and education, and it needs to have the kind of stature within the Justice Department on a continuing basis that it did when it was once instituted. So, for those reasons, it is essential that we pass this motion to instruct and that we instruct the conferees both to adopt the Senate provisions that establish the office and also the House provisions that delineate the duties of the office.
