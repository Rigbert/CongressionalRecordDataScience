Speaker, of course the Voting Rights Act, obviously, and the Motor Voter Act provides for the removal of people who have died or are not otherwise eligible.  On the other hand, the gentlewoman raises an absolutely critical issue. The committee and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and I were very concerned about that. There are a number of provisions in this bill that deal with that issue. First of all, while we provide under Motor Voter removal of voters who are ineligible under State law, we have a provision that says that the States must take care not to remove persons who are in fact eligible.  Number two, there is a provision in the bill which provides for the adoption of a state-wide registration system so that we have a uniform system of keeping people on the roll and/or removing them. Obviously, some smaller jurisdictions have great difficulty having the technological capability to keep current, and they make mistakes. We hope to move them in that direction.  The third critical provision included in our bill and the Senate bill is the providing of an opportunity for a provisional balloting. That is a critical provision so when someone goes into the polling place, as happens in every voting jurisdiction in America, and their name does not appear, but they say to the election official, we should be registered, we are supposed to be registered, the election official will provide them with a provisional ballot that they will fill out. It will be kept separate and apart, and then in the succeeding days they will check to see whether that person is an eligible voter. If so, they will count that vote.  In all of those different ways we are trying to deal with that, but the gentlewoman raises an area of great concern to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), to myself, and to the Senate conferees as well. I thank the gentlewoman for focusing on that point.
