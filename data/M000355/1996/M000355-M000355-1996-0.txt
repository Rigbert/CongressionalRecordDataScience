 President, over the weekend, more than 500 Burmese citizens were arrested--more than double the number picked up in an outrageous sweep back in May.  And, their crime, Mr. President? Their crime was an effort to participate in a conference on the future of democracy called by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's legitimately elected leader.  Just as discouraging as the arrests is the action taken against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The street to her home has been cut off by armed guards, and I understand over 100 troops have been deployed in and around her compound.  Her weekly addresses to supporters have been cut off.  Her movements are completely restricted.  In fact, when I asked if anyone from our embassy had direct contact with her, I was told the phone lines have been cut along with access to her home.  So, at this moment, as I speak, there is no certainty as to her physical well-being--we have no idea what condition Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is in--we have no idea what SLORC goons may be doing within her home, now, a prison.  But, I want to remind my colleagues of something terribly important that this courageous woman has repeatedly emphasized--she is not the issue--she is only a symbol, a champion for her nation's freedom.  Her cause, her call to us is to restore democracy to her beleaguered homeland, Burma.  Mr. President, I have come to the floor today, once again, to call upon the administration to take decisive action to assist Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters.  This time, the circumstances are different.  On Monday, when the President signed the omnibus appropriations bill, the foreign operations section included provisions setting a new policy course for Burma.  Although many of my colleagues agreed with language I had included in the bill which imposed immediate sanctions, the Senate and the foreign operations conferees agreed to a weaker position offered by my colleague from Maine and endorsed by the adminstration.  This language, which the administration supported, required a ban on new investment under specific conditions.  The administration agreed to move forward ``if the Burmese government has physically harmed, rearrested for political acts or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or has committed large-scale repression of or violence against the Democratic opposition.''  That's exactly what the law requires.  Ironically, in the case of defining repression, every official I spoke with suggested sanction would be invoked if SLORC took action similar to the May offensive--I might add, no one actually believed SLORC would be so ruthless to repeat so sweeping and offensive an attack on peaceful democratic activists.  Mr. President, in the past this administration has issued ultimatums to SLORC.  In 1994, Tom Hubbard, then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs traveled to Rangoon and warned SLORC that if we did not see improvements in human rights, democracy, and drug trafficking, the United States would take appropriate punitive action.  SLORC immediately challenged the demarche and launched a massive military attack against ethnic groups generating more than 80,000 refugees. Attacks in the countryside were matched by rounding up democracy advocates in Rangoon.  America's response? The administration looked the other way.  The next year, Ambassador Albright traveled to Rangoon and repeated the message and saw virtually the same results--massive detentions, torture, and arrests--a complete rejection of our concerns and interests.  Now, we are faced with the worst deterioration of the internal situation since the stolen elections in 1990.  SLORC has accused Aung San Suu Kyi of collaborating with outside groups and foreign embassies against the interests of Burma. Senior officials have denounced the legislation just signed into law--there is no question the recent events reflect SLORC's decision to directly challenge America's commitment to democracy and its champions so obviously under siege.  This time, SLORC is challenging more than an ultimatum issued in a meeting of State Department officials--this time the junta is challenging American law.  There are few countries I can identify these days with regimes so repugnant, unjust, and ruthless as SLORC.  They represent a direct and dangerous threat not only to their own citizens but ours as well.  A few weeks ago, I was sent photographs of senior SLORC military intelligence officers enjoying a meal with Khun Sa, the region's most notorious opium warlord.  These pictures would convince even the most singleminded SLORC business crony that doing business with SLORC is subsidizing and doing business with drug traffickers--and even oil companies with so much on the line in Burma, have to recognize that those kind of relationships are not in America's interests.  Mr. President, I understand the NSC will convene a deputies meeting today at 3 to review options for Burma.  No doubt one of the options will be a ban on visas. Let me make clear to anyone in the administration listening--such a step is not enough.  When we were in conference on the foreign operations bill, the administration pledged to issue a Presidential order banning visas to SLORC officials if we would agree to modify our language making such an action mandatory. We did and we expect the administration to live up to this commitment which was made long before the actions taken this weekend.  Nothing short of fulfilling the additional obligations spelled out in law will meet the test our Nation and our credibility face today in Burma.  Democracy is under siege--meaningful support and time are running out--lives are on the line. I urge the President to take swift action to save a nation, its people, and American honor.                          ____________________
