President, I say to my good friend, Senator Jeffords, we are not political equals in philosophy; yet I, as a conservative, agree with everything the Senator has said in terms of the need for roads and the need for infrastructure.  Senator Jeffords talked about some of the deficiencies we have, but I have to say in my State of Oklahoma the FAWA goes out and they rate roads and bridges. Oklahoma is dead last in bridges. This is a life-and-death situation. We lose lives every year.  A lot of my friends say: Well, you did not want to have a robust, expensive highway bill. I say to them: That is what we are supposed to be doing here.  I am a conservative.
