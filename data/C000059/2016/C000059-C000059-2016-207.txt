Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to Riverside County, California, are exceptional. On June 22nd, Sue McKee will be retiring from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) after nearly 25 years of dedicated service.  Sue is the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Governmental and Community Relations at UCR and she has worked tirelessly in that role as an advocate for UCR at the local, state, and federal levels. Her more recent accomplishments include securing funding for the first public medical school in California in over 40 years and relocating the California Air Resources Board (CARB) air pollution lab to the UCR campus. This new CARB facility, combined with UCR's existing related expertise through its Center for Environmental Research and Technology, will make Riverside the world's center for transportation and air quality research--and, in large part, this achievement is thanks to Sue McKee.  Sue is a wife, a mother, and an amazing champion for the Inland Empire. In addition to serving UCR, she has served her community by advocating for those less fortunate and mentoring the next generation of Inland Empire leaders and advocates. Sue serves as the Chair of the Riverside County's Community Action Partnership and is a former Program Chair for Leadership Riverside through the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce. Sue also has donated her time to the Childhood Cancer Foundation of Southern California, the Raincross Group, and the Regional Advisory Board of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Inland Empire.  I have had the privilege of knowing Sue McKee for nearly 20 years. During that time, I have found her to be the best kind of advocate through her compassion, intellect, sense of humor, and her commitment to UCR's mission to serve its students and the region. I applaud Sue's service and I will truly miss working with her upon her retirement. However, her service and her achievements will have a longstanding and truly positive impact on our community.                          ____________________
