 President, I rise in remembrance of a brave Iowan who has left his countrymen to join the ranks of those who have paid the highest price in the defense of freedom. Sergeant Thomas Eugene Houser was a native of Council Bluffs, IA and was killed on January 3, 2005, in action against enemy forces in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq. He was twenty-two years old.  An active young man, SGT Houser participated in football, wrestling, and track while attending St. Albert's Catholic High School and is remembered by his family and friends as a compassionate soul who, as his mother says, could ``talk to anyone.'' As a boy, he dreamed of following in the tradition of military service set by his father and grandfather, a dream which he fulfilled courageously as a member of the 1st Marine Division.  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Iowans in remembering SGT Houser. My prayers go out to his family and friends who feel his loss so deeply. Such men as Thomas Houser inspire us to hold in ever higher esteem the ideals of freedom and service. His valor shall certainly not be forgotten.                   Private First Class Gunnar Becker
