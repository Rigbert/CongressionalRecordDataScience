 President, our borders are our Nation's first line of defense. They are the key to our homeland, and ensuring their integrity is vital to our national security.  But there are some who seek to create a means of entering our country illegally. For years, they've tried to go around the border checkpoints. Now they are trying to go under them through sophisticated border tunnels.  In fact, there have been 40 border tunnels financed and constructed since 9/11--to move humans, drugs, and weapons under the border. Twenty-one of these were on the California-Mexico border--eight since January of this year.  This is a serious issue not just for San Diego and California, but for the entire country.  Surprisingly, there is no law on the books now that makes it a crime to construct, finance, build, or use a tunnel into the United States.  Last week, I toured a recently discovered tunnel in San Diego with San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, Police Chief Bill Lansdowne, Sheriff Bill Kolender and various Federal Government officials from the Department of Homeland Security.  This tunnel is the largest, most sophisticated underground passageway ever discovered; approximately half a mile long (8 football fields); at its deepest point, more than nine stories below ground; equipped with a drainage system, cement flooring for traction, lighting, and a pulley system; disguised as a produce distribution company known as ``V & F Distributors, LLC''; and accessible only through a small office inside this warehouse, covered by four square tiles.  The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement began investigating the case two years ago, and raided the tunnel last month from the Mexican side not knowing if or where an opening on the U.S. would be found. They discovered over 2,000 pounds of marijuana on the Mexican side of the border and approximately 300 on the U.S. side.  The legislation which I am introducing today--joined by Senator Kyl as the Republican lead, as well as Senators Frist, Cantwell, Boxer, Hutchison, McCain, Bingaman and Domenici--throws the book at those who build these tunnels and subterranean passageways into the United States.  It would: criminalize the construction or financing of an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an international border into the United States with a term of imprisonment up to 20 years; punish those who recklessly permit others to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel on their land with a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years; punish those who use a tunnel to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or illegal goods by doubling the sentence for the underlying offense; in addition to imprisonment, ensure that assets involved in the offense, or any property traceable to the offense, may be subject to forfeiture; and instruct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to promulgate or amend sentencing guidelines to provide for criminal penalties for persons convicted under this bill, and to take into account the gravity of this crime when considering the base offense levels.  The legislation is critical. We must secure every aspect of our borders.  Since 9/11: forty border tunnels have been discovered in the United States; all but one have been on the southern border; twenty-one of the tunnels were along the California-Mexico border; eight of the tunnels were discovered in San Diego since the beginning of the year; these tunnels range in complexity from simple ``gopher holes'' a few feet long at the border to massive drug-cartel built mega-tunnels, costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to construct.  The need for this legislation is urgent. We must secure every aspect of our borders, including those we can't always see. And it is in our national security interest that we find these tunnels and prosecute those who construct, finance or recklessly permit the use of these tunnels on their land or property to the fullest extent of the law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2355       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
