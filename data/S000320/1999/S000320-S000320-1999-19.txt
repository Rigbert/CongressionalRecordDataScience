 John was a good and honorable man who served his state and his country with distinction. A devoted public servant and Member of this body for 23 years, Senator Chafee's influence extended beyond the aisles and transcended partisan rhetoric. His accomplishments as a lawmaker and his unquestionable influence among his peers stand as a testament to his ability.  Senator Chafee will long be admired and remembered for his devotion to this country both as a soldier and public servant. His distinguished service in the military, including serving in the Marines at Guadalcanal and commanding a rifle company in Korea, were indicative of the man who would never shy away from duty or responsibility. His record as a legislator, governor, and senator in Rhode Island indicate the amount of trust the people of Rhode Island put in John.  Although political views may vary from person to person, it is easy to put these differences aside and to recognize men of strong character and integrity. These are qualities which were abundant in John, and his steadying influence in the United States Senate will be truly missed. My thoughts and prayers extend to his family and all those whose lives Senator Chafee touched.                          ____________________
