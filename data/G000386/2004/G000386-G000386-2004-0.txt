 President, I rise today to honor CWO David H. Gardner Jr., an Iowa native who was killed when his UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter went down near Fort Hood in Texas. A 1991 graduate of Mason City High School in Mason City, IA, David Gardner served as a helicopter pilot assigned to the 4th Infantry Division's A Company, 2nd Battalion, 4th Aviation Regiment. He had previously served in the Iowa National Guard before going on active duty in the 1990s. From October of 2003 until the following April, Chief Warrant Officer Gardner served his country in Iraq.  I ask my colleagues in the Senate and all Americans to join me today in paying tribute to Chief Warrant Officer Gardner. My deepest sympathy goes out to his friends and family, and particularly the 7-year-old daughter he leaves behind. It is my hope that she grows up knowing of the tremendous sacrifice her father made for his country and the deep appreciation America has for him. Chief Warrant Officer Gardner will always be honored as a hero who gave his life for his country, and he will be greatly missed.
