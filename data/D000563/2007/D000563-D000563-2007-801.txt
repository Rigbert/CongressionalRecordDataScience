President, today I am pleased that, S. Res. 231, a resolution recognizing historic Juneteenth Independence Day, has passed the Senate.  June 19 is an ordinary day for many Americans, is a significant day for those who know its history. Juneteenth Independence Day celebrates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers led by MG Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, TX, with news that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free.  Americans across the United States continue the tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as inspiration and encouragement for future generations.  The legislation recognizes the significance of Juneteenth Independence Day and supports its continued celebration as an opportunity for the people of the United States to learn more about the past and to understand more fully the experiences that have shaped our nation.  As Americans, we must remember the lessons learned from slavery. Juneteenth is a day that all Americans, of all races, creeds, and ethnic backgrounds, can celebrate freedom and the end of slavery in the United States.  I am pleased to recognize historic Juneteenth Independence Day and proud that the Senate has passed this important resolution.
