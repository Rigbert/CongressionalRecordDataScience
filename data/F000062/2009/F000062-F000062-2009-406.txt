 Rick Warren,      pastor of the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, CA, to      provide the invocation.       Pastor WARREN. Let us pray.       Almighty God, our Father, everything we see and everything      we can't see exists because of You alone. It all comes from      You. It all belongs to You. It all exists for Your glory.      History is Your story.
