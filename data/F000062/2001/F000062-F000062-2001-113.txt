 President, today I am pleased to join my colleague from Idaho to introduce legislation that provides fair compensation to producers and other landowners who maintain open spaces for plants and animals to thrive.  This bill creates a voluntary program authorizing the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, to obtain either 30-year or permanent easements from landowners in exchange for a cash payment. Easements allow for grazing while maintaining the viability of native grass species. Moreover, these uses must only occur upon the conclusion of the local bird nesting season.  Vast amounts of grassland are being lost to urban development every year in large part because of economic pressures faced by ranchers, livestock producers, and other grassland owners.  Currently, there are no long-term programs to protect grasslands on a national scale.
