 President, I understand why the Senator from Minnesota has offered this amendment. To him, the ARC is a program that benefits only Appalachian States. I might share his views if I didn't see first-hand the impact this program has had on an area that is burdened by high levels of unemployment and economic dislocation.  The ARC is very important not only to Kentucky, but also to a great number of other States. This program has proven to be effective in providing targeted assistance to those who need it most without wasting millions of dollars on administrative expenses.  Although the ARC has made a significant impact in improving the economic opportunities and quality of life for people living in Appalachia, there continues to be a real need for assistance in this region. Poverty, outmigration, and high levels of unemployment are especially prevalent in central Appalachia, which includes some of the poorest counties in the Nation.  The ARC serves parts of 13 States, totaling 399 counties from New York to Mississippi. This is a region that lags behind the Nation in most, if not all, major economic measures. Chronically higher unemployment levels, substantially lower income levels, and perniciously high poverty rates plague most of Appalachia. In eastern Kentucky, for example, the poverty rate stood at 29 percent in 1990--16 percent higher than the national average.  Of the 399 counties served by ARC, 115 of the counties are considered distressed. This means that these counties suffer from unemployment levels and poverty rates that are 150 percent of the national average and have per capita incomes that are only two-thirds the national average.  The ARC was designed to specifically address the unique problems of this region--which has been afflicted by over a century of exploitation, neglect, geographic barriers, and economic distress. These are not problems born of cyclical economic fluctuation, but are the result of years of unremitting underdevelopment, isolation, and outmigration.  The good news is that the ARC has worked hand-in-hand with each of the 13 States in its jurisdiction to develop flexible and effective programs, tailored to the specific needs of each community or region.  And there's more good news. The ARC is unusually lean, as Federal agencies go, with respect to administrative and personnel expenses. Total overhead accounts for less than 4 percent of all expenditures. This is largely achieved through close cooperation with the individual States.  State Governors contribute 50 percent of the administrative costs as well as the full cost of their own regional ARC offices. In fact, I would urge my colleagues to look to the ARC as a model of efficiency, cost sharing, and State cooperation for other Federal programs.  The ARC is not a traditional poverty program, but an economic development program, with a lot of work still ahead of it. The fact is, that Appalachia receives 14 percent less per capita spending from the Federal Government than the rest of the country--and that includes funding received through ARC. While this may not seem like a lot, this amounts to $12 billion less for the Appalachian region annually.  Like many of my colleagues, we are all taking a close look at each and every program to find areas where we can eliminate wasteful spending. I worked with the ARC to ensure that this program was reduced to its most essential function--economic development.  The best way we can achieve this is quite simple. First, we start with a 35-percent reduction from the current funding level for ARC. There's no question that this is a considerable cut, and it will have an impact on the ARC's ability to fully serve its target areas. But I think it underscores how serious we are about preserving the vital purposes of this agency.  The 35-percent cut in the first year is just a start. If the reforms I have proposed are implemented, funding levels will continue to decline through 2002. Overall, if we use, as a baseline, a hard freeze at 1995 funding levels, my proposal would achieve a 47-percent reduction in spending. This amounts to $925 million in savings over 7 years.  With regard to my colleague's concerns regarding the difference between the House and Senate spending levels for ARC, I suggest that the Senate has already spoken on this matter and endorsed this funding level on two occasions. Once as an amendment that passed the Senate on May 24, and the second when this body approved the budget resolution. I would also point out that this spending level was also included in the chairman's mark of the budget resolution for fiscal year 1996.  I might also point out to my colleague, that the reconciliation of these spending differences should be worked out in conference.  Mr. President, I have worked hard to develop a reform plan that is responsible both to the people of eastern Kentucky, and the taxpayers of this Nation. If my colleagues believe that eliminating the ARC will save money, they are sadly mistaken. The poverty and economic distress of central Appalachia will only deepen, imposing higher cost on other Federal programs. On the other hand, if we keep ARC alive, we can help this region to help itself, and save a lot more money in the long run.  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and maintain this level of funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission.                               Exhibit 1
