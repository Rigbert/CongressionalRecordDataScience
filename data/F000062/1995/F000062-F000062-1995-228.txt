 President, the enfranchisement of women 75 years ago contributed to remarkable changes in the lives and well being, not just of women in our society, but of our Nation as a whole.  On August 26 our Nation will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the 19th amendment to the Constitution. With the passage of this amendment, over a century after ratification of the U.S. Constitution, the right to vote was extended to women.  This occasion is a time to reflect upon the many contributions made by women as a result of being enfranchised to vote, and I am proud to say that I am both a beneficiary of this historic amendment and a product of its legacy.  In seeking the right to vote, the women who preceded me in political arena sought more than mere representation at the polls. Gaining the right to vote was the first critical step toward women becoming full and equal partners in every aspect of American society.  The 19th amendment, in addition to enfranchising women, was a tacit declaration of a woman's right to hold office. In the first elections held after the ratification of the 19th amendment, women won public office in 23 States.  The impact of women voting was felt even before the 19th amendment was ratified. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson, embroiled in a hotly contested reelection campaign, faced the first known gender-gap in a Presidential election. At the time, there were 12 States which allowed women to vote, and the newly formed Women's Party had mounted an aggressive campaign in those States to defeat Wilson because of his stiff opposition to women's suffrage. In Illinois, the only State where votes were tallied by sex, women voted against Wilson by a ratio of 2 to 1. And, in California, another equal suffrage State, Wilson won by only .3 percent of the vote. The women's vote nearly cost Woodrow Wilson the election.  Although the Women's Party could not deny President Wilson a second term, an important goal had been accomplished--women were noticed as a significant force at the polls. Democrats put out as much campaign literature on women's suffrage that year as they did on peace.  Today, although still grossly under-represented in numbers, women hold office in all levels of government. Fifty-five women serve in Congress today, including 7 in the U.S. Senate. Women hold the office of mayor in 178 cities with populations larger than 30,000. And, since 1925, 13 women have served as Governor of their State.  In the past 75 years numerous women have broken the glass ceiling with many firsts. Janet Reno as the first woman Attorney General; Hazel O'Leary as the first woman Secretary of Energy; Jeane Kirkpatrick as the first woman Ambassador to the United Nations; Sandra Day O'Conner as the first woman Supreme Court Justice. I look forward to the day, however, when women no longer make news for being the first appointed, but for what they do. Then our Nation can say we have attained the level of equality the voters of 75 years ago began working toward.  As a Member of the U.S. Senate, I stand before you as a direct descendant of the tireless efforts of Alice Paul, Lucy Burns and Dorothy Day--women who went to prison for picketing for the right to vote. These trailblazers, and many others whose names have escaped the history books, devoted their lives to make women full and equal partners in American society.  I know that with every vote I cast as a Member of this body, I honor their legacy. It is in recognition of those women, and the progress made over the last 75 years, that we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the 19th amendment to the U.S Constitution.                          ____________________
