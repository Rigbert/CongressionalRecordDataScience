Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, if I could.  I understand the point that the chairman is making, and I am very appreciative of it.  The bill, as you know, was slushed with an awful lot of money above and beyond what we anticipated. Before we got the last $3 billion we had a fine bill. It strikes me that as we were slushing, we might have put some money in this category if we were so concerned about it.  But in the meantime, there is little doubt that because of the need for consistency here, if we are going to be striking language in the fashion that I saw as I was sitting in my office, selectively, then it seems to me we ought to try to at least raise the flag of consistency, and it is my intention to do that here.                             Point of Order
