Chairman, I rise today in support of work and education as fundamental to real welfare reform--endorse the Deal substitute--and oppose H.R. 4. Unlike H.R. 4, the Deal substitute provides meaningful work opportunities immediately by moving individuals off of welfare and into work. The Deal substitute requires that a job search begin immediately. H.R. 4 does not even require people to read the want ads.  We all agree the current welfare system simply does not work. The current system does not result in the very values we wish to encourage--work, family and responsibility--that are the underpinning of a productive society.  For welfare reform to work, the American people first must have job opportunities that pay enough for them to be self-supporting. Half the people on welfare in my community work, but at wages too low to afford the basic necessities. Half of our welfare caseload remains on welfare just to get the health benefit that their private sector job does not provide.  If we are to be successful, our goal must be rooted in a strong economy that produces good-paying jobs. We must require parents to assume responsibility for themselves and their families. Any reform effort must move people toward literacy and skills advancement to get them off welfare and ultimately into jobs that pay a living wage. There's something wrong with an economy that produces more rent-a-workers than factory jobs.  Welfare must be structured as a system that offers a helping hand in time of need, while also providing the path to self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. States should be given the flexibility to make the system work for them, but in turn we must demand that job-readiness and living wage jobs are the end result. Job training, child care, transportation, and education can go a long way in moving people off the rolls. It will be the States responsibility to address these needs. We must make sure that uniform standards apply to all States. Furthermore, it will be the recipients responsibility to use these services to move off welfare rolls into real jobs.  In February, I brought together community leaders in my District for a forum on welfare reform. I brought together welfare recipients with elected officials, human service workers with human service directors. Together we came to a consensus on what is truly needed to reform welfare and in my judgment the Deal proposal comes closest to those recommendations.                     northwest ohio recommendations  I would like to outline for my colleagues the recommendations made by my community on welfare reform. To be successful, welfare reform must begin on the frontlines with recipients and case workers who know what works and what does not, on an individualized basis. We must emphasize individualized contracts with a local case manager who is allowed to work with a family on its specific needs regarding work, education, skills training opportunities and building whole families. The current system perpetuates people being on service programs, not getting them off. We must focus our attention on incentives to help the working poor and working families move up and out of poverty.  Case managers should be professional social workers trained in strength-based assessments, not needs-based assessment. We must change our focus from providing overly bureaucratic eligibility determinations to one of partnership and coordination of services. This can be done by using an Individualized Family Service Plan, in which the family picks its strengths and weaknesses, goals and objectives, and the case manager finds the services in the community to meet those needs. This approach empowers the family and gives them the tools to get off and stay off welfare.                   intergovernmental responsibilities                           federal standards  At a minimum, the Federal Government should provide a national framework which outlines the categorical eligibility criteria and minimum benefits standards to ensure that the poorest citizens receive equitable treatment. Local agencies should not have to devote precious time to determining and redetermining eligibility of recipients and administering the programs. Initial determination of eligibility should be a federal responsibility set up like local Social Security offices. Local governments could then devote their efforts toward training and work activities, and employment and related supportive services such as child care. The Federal Government should establish a person's eligibility like Social Security does, and develop and monitor performance standards so that States programs can be measured. Federal standards are critical. When the Federal Government has failed to do so in the past, what resulted was the ``Mississippi Syndrome''--great inequity among States. Without Federal standards and performance measures, States will not comply, as has been demonstrated historically. Federal regulations on confidentiality prohibit local agencies--Head Start, welfare offices, WIC, Department of Agriculture, PCI--from sharing necessary information about clients. Since  [[Page H3679]] these agencies, along with many others, service the same populations, the Federal Government should permit cross referencing at the local level.        State Partnership, Simplification and Local Empowerment  Federal block grants to the States must not permit States to forgo their fair contribution to alleviating poverty. States must be encouraged to ``earn'' Federal payments. Flexibility is essential. What happens if there is not enough money in a given year to finish that year? People would be completely cut off until the next year. States must be allowed to carry over funds and not be penalized for good management of money.  Human service regulations in my home State of Ohio are some of the most complicated in the Nation. The application is 37 pages long. We should not assume that if the Federal Government cashes programs out to the States, the system in Ohio or any other State will be streamlined. The Federal Government must force States to streamline regulations.  It should further be required that, as a condition of receiving Federal funds, States be required to sign contractual arrangements with the local human service administering agency that places each on an equal plane. Counties, or any other local administering entity, should be given equal status with the State government to administer programs through contractual arrangements.                             simplification  The ideal system should encourage a team approach with a case manager--as opposed to a caseworker--determining what services are needed for a specific family, then bringing together a team at a location which is easily accessible and user friendly. Computer linkage at the local level is needed to ensure the success of a team approach. Interagency contracts must be established within each case management situation to avoid limits between agencies because of confidentiality requirements, and these contracts must be filtered down to the staff level.  A common intake form should be designed by the Federal Government, along with similar eligibility criteria for all human service programs: Medicaid, AFDC, food stamps. Definition of eligibility relative to poverty guidelines varies across Federal programs; it should be simplified and made the same for all of them. Local welfare personnel complain they spend incredible hours of time--an average of 2 hours per client--ascertaining a client's eligibility. They are required to answer over 700 different questions about that client.                education, training and health insurance  Two areas of policy that must be a part of Federal welfare reform are education and job training.  Fifty thousand adults in northwest Ohio are illiterate, many of them on welfare. I am sure many other Districts across our Nation face the same situation. Welfare reform must address this problem. Skills training and education must be incorporated into welfare reform. The Federal Government must assure educational institutions--such as some proprietary schools--will not rip off clients and deprive them of their futures. Vocational and proprietary schools must be held to uniform accreditation standards. Further, they must be required to give labor market statistics about each of their courses of study on a regular basis. For example, northwest Ohio has a glut of nurses, yet schools continually market nursing as an excellent field with plenty of job opportunities available.  Half of welfare recipients in northwest Ohio remain on the program to receive health insurance, therefore, welfare must be reformed to offer people health insurance in private sector entry level jobs. Perhaps there could be a partnership formed at the local level between potential employers, human service agencies, and clients. For example, perhaps Federal health insurance such as Medicaid could be used to transition citizens for a period into private sector employment. Any person receiving welfare should be able to keep health insurance coverage after employment at least until his or her wages rise above the poverty level. If States receive incentives for performance, they will address health insurance.                         other recommendations  Emphasis must be placed on paternity orders, with identification of absent fathers being key to the receipt of benefits. The IRS should be the primary collector of child support payments. Stronger, swifter, and more certain sanctions for failure to cooperate in the order establishment are needed. Any proposed work plan must include a provision for at least minimal child support payments. The reporting of nonsupport should be rewarded. Workers currently have no incentive to follow up on leads provided by custodial parent, so they don't do anything.                                  ssi  We should anticipate the trend toward increased SSI benefits when work is made mandatory. SSI benefits to drug and alcohol dependent persons, many of whom are mentally ill, should, therefore, not be cut off automatically; rather, cases should be assessed individually and funds should be channeled to local substance abuse treatment agencies to work with the client in his or her interest.                         keep families together  Low-income families must be allowed to remain together without being penalized monetarily. Accounts of mothers and fathers are currently separate and based on eligible work quarters. Families should be treated as families.                       developmental programming  Mandatory classes in budgeting, parenting, and nutrition, and registration of children in Head Start or other quality preschool programs should be required of recipients.                              food stamps  The Food Stamp Program where possible should be cashed out and the money used for regular benefits, health insurance, or education associated with moving people off the program. We must accord people respect enough to assume they will spend the cash on food, after giving them nutrition counseling and education.                                utility  Assistance plans--like PIP--must be reformed. They leave the recipient with a debt which must be paid before utilities can be turned on in one's name at another residence.                                housing  Finally, incentives should be provided for people to leave public housing. If one has no income, one pays no rent. The safety of knowing one can always stay even if not paying anything prevents people from trying to get out of the system.
