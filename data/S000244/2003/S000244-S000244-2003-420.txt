Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to clear the confusion that has just arisen. There are several provisions of H.R. 975 which are crucial to the collection of child support during bankruptcy which will fail if this bill goes down.  First, it prioritizes the collection and payment of spousal and child support. The legislation gives spousal and child support the highest priority under bankruptcy law. Current law give these claimants only a seventh-level payment priority. Spousal and child support will remain at seventh level if this bill goes down.  H.R. 975 requires important guidance and information be supplied to child support payments and a notification to State child support agency of a deadbeat parent's bankruptcy filing. That will not happen if this bill goes down.  H.R. 975 protects the name of the debtor's minor child from public disclosure in a bankruptcy case. That is public record if this bill goes down.                              {time}  1445  H.R. 975 permits enforcement actions to continue or to be commenced notwithstanding the deadbeat's bankruptcy filing. With the automatic stay under the current law, there cannot be an enforcement action for back child support, and any pending enforcement action is stayed. If this bill goes down, that means enforcement actions will come to a screeching halt.  Finally, H.R. 975 permits child custody and domestic violence proceedings to continue notwithstanding the debtor's filing for bankruptcy protection. Those actions will be stayed if this bill goes down.  This bill does protect women and children and should be passed.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).
