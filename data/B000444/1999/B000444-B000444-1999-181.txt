 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Delaware's top police officer--the Superintendent of the Delaware State Police, Colonel Alan D. Ellingsworth.  After one of the most distinguished careers in Delaware law enforcement history, Colonel Ellingsworth has retired following 24 years of service with the Delaware State Police. His life as a police officer began on August 1, 1975, when he was assigned as a road trooper at Troop 6 in Prices Corner. Moving up the ranks quickly, he worked in every major unit, including criminal investigations, as the officer-in-charge of the homicide unit and as a Troop Commander.  In May, 1994, he was promoted to Superintendent, where he has been a true leader for the citizens of Delaware, and a true partner and friend to me.  Mr. President, I want to mention something very near and dear to my heart, the 1994 Crime Law that I authored--it became a reality in Delaware thanks to Colonel Alan Ellingsworth. Under his leadership, the ranks of the Delaware State Police increased 10 percent, with a force of 525 officers today. With funding from the Crime Law, he not only put 60 more police officers on our streets--he established effective ``Community Policing'' units in Delaware's toughest neighborhoods. He personally tackled the drug problem in rural parts of Sussex and Kent Counties, creating new units to go into these poorer areas so that adult residents and their children knew the Delaware State Police were their friends and partners in ``taking back their neighborhoods.'' And he sent a strong message to drug dealers and criminals--get out and stay out. His officers arrested the drug dealers and users, and helped direct the neighborhood kids to Boys and Girls Clubs and other constructive, supervised activities. I've seen these officers at work in these communities--it is remarkable how residents trust them. Equally impressive are the results.  His strategy has worked. Crime in Delaware is down 12 percent.  But there's much more to his story. In another of his initiatives, he used Crime Law grants to put non-uniform police in every high school as Youth Resource Officers. Again, students get the message that, one, violence, bullying, drugs, gangs and guns will not be tolerated; and second, police are role models, coaches and mentors.  Under Colonel Ellingsworth, the Delaware State Police have established Community Police sub-stations in shopping malls, local communities--even in a converted laundry room in an apartment complex in Georgetown, Delaware. The goal and message are simple: police need to be on the beat to help prevent and readily respond to crime.  Colonel Ellingsworth's legacy to the Delaware State Police is even deeper than his accomplishments in reducing crime. The Delaware Crime Statistical Center is now state-of-the-art. The State's crime data is linked with the National Crime Information Center. Delaware's Sex Offender Registry was created under his watch and with his persistent doggedness that Delaware get this system implemented efficiently and effectively.  During his tenure, Colonel Ellingsworth presided over the memorable 75th Anniversary of the Delaware State Police and successfully pursued the fund-raising, building and dedication of the new Delaware State Police Museum.  During his career, Colonel Ellingsworth has received numerous awards and commendations, including Trooper of the Year in 1979 and 1985-- In the history of the Delaware State Police, he is the only officer who has been named Trooper of the Year twice. He also has received three Superintendent's Citations, and he was selected as the Crime Stoppers' Detective of the Year.  He is a 1988 graduate of the FBI's National Academy, and a 1987 graduate of the Pennsylvania State University Police Executive Development Institute.  As we like to say in Delaware, Colonel Ellingsworth is ``home grown.'' He was born in Sussex County, a 1972 graduate of Sussex Central High School, received his bachelor and master's degrees from Wilmington College, and now lives in Bear with his wife Ann Marie and their three daughters, Amanda, Lauren and Megan.  Mr. President, it is my great privilege to honor Colonel Ellingsworth on his career as Delaware's top police officer. His officers are the first to say he has served as a real ``trooper's trooper.'' He has been an officer who is tough as nails when solving a heinous crime, yet he always could be counted on as a sensitive shoulder of support to families of officers killed or injured in the line of duty. I will miss his counsel and advice, and I wish him and his family Godspeed, good health and good fortune in the years ahead.                          ____________________
