Chairman, the gentleman stood up earlier this afternoon and was trying to cut from really essential accounts. And I accept his desire to try to balance the budget.  When his party shut down the government and threw the wrench of shutdown into every program that the Nation depends upon, it created quite a bit of chaos around here and around the country. Money was wasted on furloughs. The military was trying to decide how they were going to rotate different operations and so forth. It was a terrible period that we lived through. And we are still taking and gluing our programs back together after all of that.  Some of the work of the authorizing committees, under your leadership, were not able to clear their bills on time. So the gentleman's solution is to say, well, you know, none of that happened. So I am just going to take this opportunity to go after the Energy and Water bill and kind of take this and this and this and propose this amendment.  And I think that the gentleman's goal of fiscal responsibility is one that I share, but this isn't the way to do it. This isn't the way to kind of pick some programs, and we don't even know what impact it will have across the country.                              {time}  1815  I would rather have a much more thoughtful presentation that would come before us. What programs is he talking about? The same ones this afternoon he was trying to cut, the renewable energy program--he is talking about cutting nuclear and fossil energy.  He really doesn't like the Department of Energy. I bet, if you ask the gentleman, he doesn't even want the Department of Energy to exist for our country. If you look around the world, I am probably not wrong on that bet, so this is just another way to try to cause havoc over at the Department of Energy.  As I have said earlier today, I view what is happening in that Department as one of the most important strategic sets of investments that this country has to make.  Why create more havoc over there? We have had difficulties in trying to balance our energy accounts over the years. Imported petroleum still constitutes 40 percent of what Americans are paying for. The average family, every year, $2,800 comes out of their pocket for gasoline.  Mr. Chairman, we need to modernize our fleet. There is a lot of natural gas conversions going on in the country for our truck fleets. We need not throw a wrench into that. We need to hasten it, to move America to a new day.  We need a modernized grid, whatever that is going to look like. We need tobe able to dispose of our nuclear waste. We need to make sure that our energy policy plays on all keys, not just a few.  I don't think this is a time to create more havoc, following on the havoc that has been created in the past, which I am sure the gentleman supported, and to pick on the Department of Energy--we need a much more coherent strategy in order to balance our budget, and the most important strategy we can have is to put people back to work and, through innovation in this country and the balancing of our trade deficit, begin to reinvest those dollars back here at home.  Mr. Chairman, I mentioned earlier today that we have about, oh, I think $34 billion in this entire bill. Our energy trade deficit with the world this year is a little over $210 billion. Maybe it is a little higher than that.  The deficit--the hole this year alone is eight times bigger than our bill. So if you look at what you are trying to do here, it is counterproductive, and we need to be looking at modernizing our energy system here in this country, not picking it apart, and not creating more havoc at the Department, but actually investing in America's future.  So I ask my colleagues to oppose the gentleman's amendment, and let's get on with the regular order here. Let's get this bill cleared. Let's go to conference with the Senate and do for America what she needs, and that is restoring her energy security in order that our liberty not be threatened in this generation and the future.
