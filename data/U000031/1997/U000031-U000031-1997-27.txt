Chairman, I might just say in response to the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton], that in these cases where we have seen abuses, I would be delighted, and I am a supporter of this amendment and will speak a little bit later, but I would be delighted to work with the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] and the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Ramstad] and others, particularly those on the Committee on the Judiciary, to work on, whether it be legislation or a directive to the Justice Department, to make sure that they stick to the law.
