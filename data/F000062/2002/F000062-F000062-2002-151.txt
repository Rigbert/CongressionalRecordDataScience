 President, I think what the Senator has said is very important. I hope Members of the Senate will listen because what she pointed out was the central flaw in this safe harbor provision.  As I understand it, what the Senator is pointing out is that the safe harbor provision eliminates the one cause of action anyone has that is able to be successful, and that relates to a defective product. So this bill eliminates any cause of action which is brought around the product being defective.  Let me give an example, if I understand this. If it is shown--as I believe it can be shown--that ethanol breaks down gasoline to allow its component parts to plume into the air, spread into the ground, and then it enables benzene to move faster and longer and harder, no one can sue under a defective product liability cause of action; is that right?
