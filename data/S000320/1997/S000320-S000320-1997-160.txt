 President, these allegations about Ms. Kanchanalak, coupled with her interactions with the National Security Council, are very troubling to me and other members of the Committee. We must fully understand what part, if any, Mr. Lake played.  And while Mr. Lake has said that the NSC involvement with the individuals in question was ``from a foreign policy rather than a domestic political point of view,'' the material he provided to the committee gives some indications otherwise.  For example, Mr. Lake advised the President against a meeting with Chinese nationals set up by Charlie (Tree) Trie, a major DNC fundraiser, based on the recommendation of his staff that it not take place for political reasons.  And when asked about providing photos of the President with Chinese nationals identified as major DNC contributors, a member of Mr. Lake's staff commented on balancing foreign policy considerations against domestic politics. He did not seem to be bothered by the fact that Chinese nationals were identified as major DNC contributors. Clearly, this is an indication of possible illegal activity.  Before questioning Mr. Lake about his leadership in these areas, we intend to question his staff further as to the role the NSC played in interactions with and vetting of these DNC contributors and foreign nationals.  Senator Kerrey, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and I have requested that the NSC staff be available for the interviews on the record prior to the formal hearings, which will begin, as I have said earlier, next Tuesday. We reserve the right to call NSC staff members to testify under oath, if we deem that in order.  The use of intelligence is another area.  One of the key responsibilities of the Director of Central Intelligence is to provide unbiased intelligence to the President and to the Congress. Thus, it is very critical that we examine Mr. Lake's record as a consumer of such intelligence.  How did he translate intelligence into policy at the NSC? Did he ignore intelligence estimates, spin them to fit administration policy, or raise the standards of evidence?  We have concluded our investigation surrounding the administration's use of intelligence in shaping policy toward China, and there are some serious inconsistencies. We are prepared to discuss these with Mr. Lake in the closed session of the committee.  Mr. President, given the allegations mentioned in every newspaper about Chinese involvement in DNC fundraising, this is an area for some serious questioning about potential influences on policy, and it should be.  For example, there are still documents we wish to review as to the role intelligence played in our policy toward the Government of Haiti. The administration has consistently refused to transmit this information to Congress. Senator Kerrey and I have requested these documents, and we are still awaiting the National Security Council's response.  We are also reviewing United States knowledge and assessment of recent events in Iraq and their impact on our policy there and how Mr. Lake used this knowledge in formulating that policy. We are pursuing similar questions in areas relating to Cuba, Somalia, Bosnia, and Pakistan.  Ethics violations is another area we are pursuing.  While the Justice Department has reached a settlement with Mr. Lake regarding his failure to sell energy stocks that were deemed to create a conflict of interest for him, resulting in a payment of a $5,000 fine by Mr. Lake, the Committee on Intelligence has been investigating this matter further.  Although Mr. Lake claims that the failure to sell stocks was a simple oversight, Justice Department investigators interviewed by the committee documented 14 occasions over a 2-year period on which Mr. Lake was reminded that he still owned the stocks. It was only after a White House ethics officer discovered the stocks on his financial disclosure form for a third time that Mr. Lake did divest himself of the investments. Thus, a key question is whether this violation represents financial mismanagement on the part of Mr. Lake or a complete disregard for the seriousness of the ethics standards applied to all Federal employees.  Additionally, what example does this set for the intelligence community professionals who must be held to the highest standards of personal conduct?  The Intelligence Committee is also investigating the thoroughness of the Justice Department's investigation into Mr. Lake's stocks, particularly those energy-related stocks which created a conflict of interest and subsequent fine. Given that Mr. Lake garnered a profit of over $25,000 on these investments, I have trouble, as other members of the committee do, understanding the Justice Department's arbitrary fine of $5,000, which is the maximum allowed, I understand, for a potential misdemeanor offense.  If the case, on the other hand, had been referred to the Justice Department's civil division, a much greater fine of up to $50,000 per offense could have been imposed. Why wasn't this course taken? We do not know, but we will pursue it.  Iran-Bosnia and the ``no instructions'' policy.  A key criterion for a Director of Central Intelligence is the extent to which he or she can gain the confidence of the Congress in keeping Members fully and currently informed of intelligence community actions. Mr. Lake's role in the execution of the secret ``no instructions'' policy toward Croatia allowing Iranian arms to flow into Bosnia and the decision, Mr. President, not to inform Congress of this action has called into question Mr. Lake's ability to be forthright with the Congress.  The distinguished former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, my colleague and an expert in the area, Senator Specter, has raised serious questions regarding this matter which we intend to explore fully during our hearings.  While Mr. Lake has admitted that it was wrong not to inform Congress of the ``no instructions'' policy, there remains a number of inconsistencies in testimony before both Houses of Congress as to the extent of the policy decision and its implementation. The Intelligence Committee is working with other congressional committees to review pertinent testimony and decide on an appropriate panel of witnesses to pursue this matter during Mr. Lake's confirmation hearings. The Senate confirmation hearings will represent the first time that Mr. Lake will testify under oath on his role in the development and execution of this policy.  As to the FBI background investigation, there has been no resolution regarding requests made by me and a large number of my colleagues to review Mr. Lake's complete FBI background file. Negotiations between White House Counsel Charles Ruff, Senator Kerrey, and I are continuing.  A significant number of my colleagues have written the distinguished majority leader stating that they need to review the complete background investigation before they would be prepared to vote on this nomination. Our thorough review of Mr. Lake's background investigation, I believe, is key to a fundamental understanding of Mr. Lake's character and integrity, as it would be for anyone else.  Finally, the committee is reviewing information provided by Mr. Lake in response to questions propounded by the committee earlier. We require some clarifications to Mr. Lake's answers, and therefore additional questions have been put forward that must be addressed.  There are some areas where we are requesting additional supporting documentation to Mr. Lake's answers, such as his financial disclosures and issues associated with a potential conflict of interest, and we will request for the committee a review of material that was redacted for various reasons.  I thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to provide the Senate with a status of the Lake confirmation process and an opportunity for me to lay out some of the concerns that I and some of my colleagues have about this nomination. We intend to work through each of these issues in a fair and a thorough manner and look forward to questioning Mr. Lake and others beginning next Tuesday, March 11.                          ____________________
