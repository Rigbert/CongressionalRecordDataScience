Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to rise today and commend my good friend, the chairman of our Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for his leadership in helping put this bill together, and all the members of our subcommittee who have worked so very, very hard over the last several months.  There are other provisions in this bill that we also need to acknowledge many of our members. We want to thank the Committee on Rules for allowing several provisions to be included in the base bill that are self-executing concerning the civil rights provisions as well as lifting the sanctions in terms of food for Pakistan. We want to thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Nethercutt) in that regard, as well as the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), who worked so very hard along with the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) York on the civil rights provisions in the bill, along with the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton) and the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney). We are grateful to all these members and so many more who helped us craft a good bill.  I want to state that without question this particular measure helps keep our Nation at the leading edge for food, fiber, fuel and forest production as well as research, trade and food safety. The jurisdiction of this subcommittee is very broad. There is no question that agriculture is America's leading industry and that our farmers and our agricultural industries remain the most productive in the world, and they well understand, as we do, how difficult it is to maintain our nation's commitment to excellence in agriculture in these tight budgetary times.  Our bill contains $56.1 billion for 1999 in total budget authority, of which $13.6 billion is for discretionary programs and $42.5 billion is in mandatory programs which we have very little ability to influence. Our bill is $2.2 billion below the administration's budget request, and in fact over two-thirds of our bill's spending is directed in the mandatory area, largely the nutrition programs like our school lunch and breakfast programs as well as the Food Stamp Program. Those comprise nearly two-thirds, 70 percent, of what is in this bill.  We believe this bill is as balanced a bill as we could get to try to accommodate our farmers, the needs of food and drug safety, the needs of rural development in communities across this country as well as protecting the safety of consumers and those in our population who are most nutritionally and medically at risk.                              {time}  1200  Our committee has fashioned a bill that is the best possible bill within theallocation it has been dealt, and I want to thank our chairman, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) for being gracious and treating both sides of the aisle evenhandedly. I appreciate his bipartisanship and his sensitivity to balancing the burden of these tight funding levels between various constituencies served by this bill.  I would be remiss if I did not point out, however, that the funding levels are simply inadequate for several of our most critically important programs in the bill, beginning with food safety, but also including WIC, the Women, Infants and Children's feeding program, all of our rural conservation programs, our youth tobacco prevention initiative and our rural water and sewer, as well as the temporary emergency feeding programs serving so many of our food kitchens and food banks. Without an additional allocation of resources, we continue to betray our commitment to American farmers, and to all consumers who benefit from the bounty that they produce.  For example, let us go through some of these shortcomings. As hard as we tried, we were unable to fully accommodate the requests for food safety in this bill, which provides only $15 million of the additional funds requested by the President, who asked for $95 million additional funds for the food safety initiative.  In the WIC program, so important to pregnant women and children across this country, the funding level is frozen in the bill at the 1998 level of $3.9 billion, which is $157 million below the President's budget request. This freeze level could mean the reduction of up to a few hundred thousand additional women, infants and children who will not be able to be served by WIC.  In the youth tobacco prevention area, the bill includes $34 million for the President's tobacco initiative. However, the President had requested $100 million over that level, a level of $134 million for the Food and Drug Administration. We could not accommodate that full request.  On the important conservation programs for our farmers, the primary source of technical assistance to producers and landowners are funded at $784.4 million, but this is $5 million below last year's level and $51.9 million below the President's budget request.  This bill makes further reductions in critical mandatory conservation programs such as the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentive Program, which is called EQIP, and the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program.  In addition, this bill includes no funding for the farmland protection program, because it has not been authorized. These lands are absolutely irreplaceable as a world resource, and it is really sad that in this measure we cannot include continuation of appropriations in that program because the authorizers have not brought that bill forward.  In terms of TEFAP, the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program, there is a $10 million reduction in this mandatory program compared to last year. It is under this program that we distribute commodities to individuals greatly in need of assistance. Demand for food assistance at our food banks and soup kitchens is increasing due to the implementation of welfare reform, and I would hope as we move toward conference, that we might be able to find a way at least to keep this program at last year's level, fully aware that the increased demand is occurring in food banks across this country.  In terms of rural water and sewer, while we appreciate the increase of $39.5 million for direct water and sewer loans, we are concerned that this amount simply is not enough. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has told us that over $2.5 billion in backlog remains in the water and sewer program, and we must be able in future years to find additional funding to meet these critical needs for affordable water and sewer necessary to improve the life in our rural areas.  Mr. Chairman, those who serve farmers and work with agriculture are taught over and over again that there is a big difference between money and wealth. Our job on this Committee on Agriculture is to help create the wealth of America through the investments we make in food, fiber, new fuels and forestry production, all essential components.  Market-oriented farm policy means farming for the market and not the government, and requires investments in research and conservation and sustainability, in education and technology transfer, which will keep our agriculture competitive as we move into the new century.  Traditional farm programs under this bill and in the past continue to receive a decreasing portion of Federal support and, in my view, we should be targeting our scarce agricultural dollars to family farmers, especially those who are smaller, to assure competition in an industry now dominated by megagiants.  In recent decades, we have slowly eroded the historic base of American agriculture, the family farmer, moving more in the direction of giant corporate farms. It is kind of interesting to look at the numbers in the area of agriculture trade. We have to work hard to keep our edge in the international marketplace.  As American agricultural exports grow and weather the volatile global markets, foreign agricultural exports are being shipped to the United States in greater magnitude. Since the early 1980s, U.S. agricultural exports initially declined from a level of about $43 billion to a low of $26 billion in 1986, and then hit a record level of $60 billion in exports in 1996. While that looks great in terms of overall dollar value, the fact is that the price per bushel to the average farmer has not really gone up, but in fact they are having to sell greater volumes and try to farm greater acreage in order just to meet the income levels they were able to achieve in the past. In many cases, products that our own farmers grow and process are being replaced by imports coming into our shores.  Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to express my appreciation again to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) for putting together the best bill that we could under the circumstances that we were dealt.  Let me remind our colleagues that the agriculture portion of Federal spending has taken more than its fair share of cuts in these past several years. Discretionary funding for this coming year is $130 million below comparable spending of last year, but total amounts provided under this bill, both in the mandatory and discretionary accounts, have declined by almost 30 percent, by one-third, since 1994. It is clear that agriculture, rural development and nutritional programs continue to bear more than their fair share of overall budget reductions.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
