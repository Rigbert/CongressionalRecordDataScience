STABENOW. Absolutely. The Senator from Illinois has hit what I think is the most critical point, and the reason there is such opposition, certainly from the pharmaceutical industry, to what we are trying to do through Medicare.

They would like to divide seniors up in lots of different insurance plans and not give them the leverage to bring prices down.
