Speaker, I am pleased that the House of Representatives is considering H.R. 2679, as amended by the Senate. By clearing this measure for President Clinton's signature, Congress is taking an important step toward protecting the environmental treasures of Rhode Island.  H.R. 2679 expands the Pettaquamscutt Cove National Wildlife Refuge to include the vulnerable coastal wetlands that have been identified as vital habitat for a range of species. For example, our State's declining black duck population relies heavily on these areas.  H.R. 2679 also illustrates the great potential of cooperation between government and private citizens. Among the lands that this bill adds to the refuge are 100 acres known as Foddering Farms. The owners of this property are interested in donating a portion of its value to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, helping Congress to advance critical environmental interests at a reasonable cost.  In addition, H.R. 2679 allows the Fish and Wildlife Service to expand the refuge as other important habitats become available. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill and send it to President Clinton, who is committed to preserving our environment.
