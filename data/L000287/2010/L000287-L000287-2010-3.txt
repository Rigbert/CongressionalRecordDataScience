Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I have just two words for you, my colleagues: Vote ``yes.'' Vote ``yes'' to end Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Vote ``yes'' for equality. Vote ``yes'' because discrimination is wrong. Vote ``yes'' because you believe in the beloved community. Vote ``yes'' because every American deserves the right to serve their country. Vote ``yes'' because the survey results are in, and the military leaders say the troops are ready. Vote ``yes'' because, on the battlefield, it does not matter who you love only the flag that you serve. Whatever your reason, I urge you, each of you, each of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' today, to stand up and vote ``yes.'' Vote ``yes'' because it is the right thing to do.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks), a member of the House Armed Services Committee.
