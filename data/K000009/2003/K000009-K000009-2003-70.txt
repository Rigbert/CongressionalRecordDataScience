Speaker, for many of the plans that exist around the country today, one of the real threats of the Republican plan is that employers who are offering drug plans today would choose to close those down and try to put their retired employees in this flawed plan that the Republicans have proposed. So it is actually a disincentive for private employers to continue offering the kind of coverage that they have traditionally. And there are many, many retirees who receive prescription drug coverage through their employer, but this plan really provides a way for them to cash out those better plans into a lesser plan, and we have already seen with the Federal employees that they were very worried about that. So Members of Congress very craftily made sure that they were covered, but they left seniors in America behind. They took care of a few thousand people, including themselves, but then they left 40 million Americans behind in the bill that has come out of this House.  Very interesting. That is not really what we are elected to do. We are supposed to be here to represent the 280 million Americans who sent us here, not to feather-bed here first and take care of our own first and ignore everybody else that is out there. But that is literally what happened here this week.  And for the Federal employees we should have a plan for all seniors that are as good as what they get, not the reverse.
