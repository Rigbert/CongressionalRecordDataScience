 President, it is my understanding that the tobacco provisions of this bill, will provide an additional $328,000,000 in funds for farmers who produce the major cigarette tobaccos--burley and flue-cured tobacco. It is those farmers who have been the most affected by recent developments with respect to the manufacture and use of cigarettes. It is those farmers also who are the subject of the recent ``Phase II Settlement'' in which moneys are being made available to burley and flue-cured tobacco growers through the use of State trusts. It is also my understanding that the bill's reference to those farms who receive ``quotas'' under the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938, is intentional, and does limit the relief, to burley and flue-cured tobacco. The reference to ``quotas'' is to poundage quotas and burley and flue-cured tobacco are the only tobaccos under the current regulatory scheme that receive poundage ``quotas'' as opposed to acreage allotments. This limitation to burley and flue-cured tobaccos is intentional and reflects recent developments.
