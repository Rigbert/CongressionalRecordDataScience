As I said earlier, I appreciate the fact the distinguished majority leader moved to it. This is actually a very important bill. At a time when it seems so much good legislation is being stalled, it would be a shame if this was, too.  I know since January of last year Senate Democrats have tried to bridge the gap and make bipartisan progress on campaign finance reform, corporate accountability, and a real Patients' Bill of Rights, and a number of bipartisan anticrime, antidrug, antiterrorism bills. We worked with the administration after September 11 on the USA Patriot Act; we passed that in record time. We created the September 11 victims' trust fund and we enhanced border security.  We tried to work as supportive partners in the effort against terrorism. Throughout that effort in the Judiciary Committee, we rose above the bitterness and partisanship that had been exhibited by my predecessors during the last 6 years of the previous administration. We have held more hearings on more judicial nominees and held more committee votes on them and confirmed more judges in 15 months than the Republicans were willing to confirm in the last 30 months when they controlled the Senate.  I emphasize that for the 30 months prior to the change in the control of the Senate, the Republicans controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee during both the time of President Clinton and President Bush. In the 15 months we have been in control--it has been only with President Bush--we have put through twice as many judges in 15 months. We put through more judges in 15 months than they did in 30 months.  I mention this because some at the White House, who should know better, talk about the holdup on judges but do not like it when they are reminded that we have done more under President Bush than they did for both President Bush and President Clinton during a period twice as long. It is an interesting point.  I remember Adlai Stevenson once said to some of his Republican friends: If you promise to stop talking lies about us, I will stop talking the truth about you. But I find the statements and statistics continue, so I thought I would throw a little truth on the matter.  I mention this because we have tried to go more than halfway. As I said, during 15 months, we moved more judges than the Republicans did during 30 months. We have reached out in order to pass legislation from our committee--and the distinguished Presiding Officer is a valued member of that committee--and passed out piece after piece either unanimously or by a strong bipartisan majority. We passed intellectual property legislation, consumer legislation, anticrime legislation, antidrug legislation, but then mysterious Republican holds came up and stopped them.  Here are some of the bills we passed out of the committee that have been held up on the Republican side: the Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act; the Hatch-Leahy Drug Abuse Education Prevention and Treatment Act; the DREAM Act, championed by Senators Durbin and Hatch; a charter amendment to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, something totally without partisanship. We passed it unanimously, as the distinguished Senator from Washington State knows. We passed out a charter amendment to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, a nonpartisan request. We cannot get it through the Senate because it is being held up on the Republican side of the aisle.  We passed out a charter amendment for AMVETS, a wonderful veterans organization. The distinguished Presiding Officer and I voted for it and it was voted unanimously out of our committee. It is being held up on the Republican side of the aisle.  We passed out a charter amendment for the American Legion. Every Democrat voted for that. Every Democrat has agreed: Move that through the Senate. It is being held up on the Republican side.  Now we find there is a Republican hold on the Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. This is the first one in 21 years. It passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 400 to 4. The chief sponsor is a leading Republican Member of the House.  We strengthen our Justice Department, increase our preparedness against terrorist attacks, prevent crime and drug abuse, improve our intellectual property and antitrust laws, strengthen our judiciary, and offer our children a safe place to go after school. It is a product of years of work.  I commend Senator Daschle for bringing this up for a vote. Let me show my colleagues some charts. This is not a hodgepodge where one might go in and look as to whether you wear a green tie or paisley tie or drive a blue car or a black car; this is something that really affects Americans.  It was passed by the House of Representatives. If it is allowed to come to a vote, it could pass easily in this body: border security, domestic preparedness, suppression of financing terrorism treaty.  Let me mention the last part. We worked this out with the Bush administration. They said there is a difficulty in following the money used by terrorists around the world. We know how quickly President Bush and Secretary O'Neill moved after September 11 last year to freeze the assets of some of these terrorist groups, and I commend the President for that action; I praise the President for doing that. But I wish the President now would tell his own party that we have the legislative tools that President Bush has asked for to go after the money of terrorists, and it is being blocked on the Senate floor by a Republican hold.  Let's pass this. Let's do what we all know has to be done. This is not partisan--grabbing the money of terrorist organizations that are after the United States. That is not a Democratic or Republican issue. But when every single Democrat said they will vote to go after that money, it is time for the anonymous Republican who has a hold to let us go forward.  Let me show a few other items that are in the bill. We improve law enforcement. We have FBI reform and FBI agent danger pay. Some of these FBI agents are working in some of the most dangerous places, especially overseas. Sometimes their mere presence targets them for assassination. This is agent danger pay. We ought to be doing that.  The Body Armor Act is something every law enforcement agency from which I have heard wants to protect police officers from those who would attack them. I cannot understand why this is being held up on the other side. We ought to go forward with this bill. We ought to pass it. We ought to tell our law enforcement officers that we will help them.  Senator Carnahan's Law Enforcement Tribute Act is in this legislation. It authorizes grants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for memorials to honor killed or disabled officers while serving as law enforcement safety officers. How can anybody oppose that without looking terribly political? Senator Carnahan deserves credit for this bill.  Senator Feinstein and Senator Sessions joined in a bipartisan effort on the Body Armor Act. That should be allowed to go through.  Then we have some ways to stop crime from happening in the first place. We reached a bipartisan agreement to give the Boys and Girls Clubs the funds they need for 1,200 additional clubs across the Nation. Next to motherhood and apple pie, I cannot imagine anything that should have more support than helping the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. We have an excellent one in Burlington, VT. I know it very well. It just celebrated its 40th birthday.  I remember that Boys and Girls Club back in the days when I was State's attorney. I know those kids who went there had a place to go, had a place to learn, had a place to gather, had a place to constructively work, and were not the kids who got in trouble. They were not the ones I saw in juvenile court. They were not the ones who made our crime list. They were the ones who made the star list in our community.  I mention this because Senator Hatch and I went to the Boys and Girls Club congressional breakfast honoring the regional youth of the year. We also honored Senator Thurmond. I heard, and I know they were sincere, Republican Senator after Republican Senator come forward and say we have to authorize and expand the Boys and Girls Clubs. All right. Let's do it.  Last week, we offered to pass this bill on a voice vote to zip it through. We polled every single member of this side of the aisle. They were all in support of that Boys and Girls Club authorization, as they were the Body Armor Act and the help for law enforcement. Every single Democrat was ready to vote for it. We were willing to have it go by on a voice vote. An anonymous objection came from the Republican side.  I know in an election year some politics gets played, but not with the Boys and Girls Clubs and not with the Violence Against Women Office. We want to increase Federal focus on this tragic and recurring problem. Preventing domestic violence is not a partisan issue.  I remember going into the emergency rooms of our hospitals at 3:00 in the morning when I was in law enforcement. I saw the results of domestic violence. I saw women beaten so badly that even though we had an idea who may have beaten them, they could not even tell us through a broken jaw, swollen lips, and bloody faces. I saw that. I saw domestic violence even in a bucolic State like mine, but the amount of domestic violence is the same in every State.  It was not just those battered individuals I saw in the emergency room--at least we had hopes they would be brought back to health. We at least had hopes that medical care would return them to their ability to function--I still have nightmares sometimes of some of the others I saw, but I didn't see them in the emergency room. I saw them one floor up in the morgue.  This happens in every single State, and I never heard a police officer say: I wonder if this victim is Republican or Democrat. The police officer said: Why don't we do something to stop it?  Here is a chance to do something. Let's vote for it.  The Crime Free Rural States Grants, we have crime in our cities, but we also have crimes in our rural areas. The distinguished Presiding Officer was Governor in one of our finest States, a State that is a part of the American heartland, a State I have had the pleasure of visiting.  In fact, there were Leahys who moved out to Nebraska in the 1850s when my great-grandfather and his brothers came over from Ireland, some staying in Vermont, some staying in New York and others going to Nebraska. I know how beautiful a State it is, and I know there are both cities and rural areas. I know how hard the distinguished Presiding Officer as Governor fought against crime in both areas. He knows, as I do, that crime is a fact of life in rural areas. It is sometimes more difficult to fight because there are not all the needed resources available. It might be a small sheriff's department. The chief of police may be the whole police force.  We can help. This legislation authorizes programs that will reduce drug abuse and recidivism, mandatory, to increased funding for drug treatment in prisons, to funding for police training in South and Central Asia. These proposals are not Republican or Democrat; these are bipartisan. Most of them were in the Hatch-Leahy Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act.  Drug courts, drug-free prisons, reauthorizing the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act--one of the saddest things is going to juvenile court and seeing 12- or 13-year-old boys and girls who are already recidivists, people who have committed crimes that one would think a child that age would not even know about.  In going back through the reports, there are steps that could have been taken 2, 3, or 4 years before that might have prevented that. Now these boys and girls are people who are probably going to end up in an adult jail somewhere, lost to society and lost to themselves. We should have stopped it. That help is in here.  That is one of the reasons the House of Representatives, facing some of the same kind of partisan divisions that we face in this great body, passed it 400 to 4. I do not need to tell the distinguished Presiding Officer the need for these kinds of investments. He has had the experience both as a Governor, a Senator, and a parent. He knows what we have to do, just as I do. Let's go ahead and do it. Let's set aside the partisanship for a while and let's do something.  There are intellectual property provisions in this bill. We are in the United States seeing an enormous loss of jobs. In the last 2 years, we have had the biggest drop in jobs that I can remember, the largest number of layoffs we have seen in years. The economy is in a tailspin. The stock market has had a greater drop than at any time since the Presidency of Herbert Hoover. If anything, we should be helping American innovators and businesses, both big and small. We want these businesses to prosper. We want these businesses to be able to compete on a worldwide scale. We want these businesses to hire the people of Nebraska, Vermont, South Dakota, New York, California, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, and all our other States. So we put in the Leahy-Hatch Madrid Protocol Implementation Act.  What this does is the sort of thing that the President and all the people around him say we need, something to simplify life for businesses. We would implement a treaty to allow American businesses to have one stop for international trademark registration which they can do only to countries that sign on to the protocol.  American businesses and companies that need to protect their trademarks if they sell their goods and services in international markets, especially over the Internet, would be helped by this legislation. Every single business leader I have heard of, regardless of their political background--from chambers of commerce, to business leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike--say pass this bill.  I checked on this side of the aisle. Every single Democrat is ready to vote for it right now. It has been held up for over a year by a Republican hold. I say to some of the businesses, talk to the Members of the Republican Party. The Democrats are ready to pass it.  We have another provision in the TEACH Act, an exemption that allows educators to use the same rich material of distance learning over the Internet as in face-to-face classrooms. Let me state why that is important. In rural areas--such as Nebraska or Vermont--there may be a number of small schools that cannot each support a library and sometimes cannot afford a teacher in a specialized area such as science, history, or math. Together they can, but you have to link them. So copyright laws apply. We worked that out. This is a no-brainer. It will help the kids. It should be a no-brainer for the Senate to pass.  We reauthorize and modernize the Patent and Trademark Office and give them funds they need. When I hear the baloney that comes out of the political people in the Attorney General's office and the White House about judges, this would be the one they should want. There are 20 new judges included to be appointed by President Bush. For a little bit of history, this is more than were created during the 6-plus years that the Republican Party controlled the Senate. The Clinton administration wanted to create these judgeships. They wanted to create new Federal judicial positions, and they were blocked by the Republicans. I believed the judicial positions were needed when President Clinton was President. I thought it was wrong that the Republicans stopped us from doing that. I did not want to do the same thing to President Bush that they did to President Clinton. Two wrongs do not make a right. So it was included. These are Federal judges in States we know are Republican and will be chosen by Republican Senators--in Arizona, Alabama, Texas. We include them just the same.  Why did that not pass last week? One may wonder, finally, having blocked itfor 6 years during the Clinton administration, now they have 20 judges President Bush may appoint--one may wonder why it has not been passed by a Democratic-controlled Senate. The Democratic-controlled Senate wanted to. But I will tell you the secret: A Republican Senator held it up. That is what happened. I hope no one comes down and says, We need more judges. We have 20 judgeships included, mostly in Republican States.  There are a lot of other provisions, including the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. A lot of western Senators want that. We get into immigration matters. I talked a lot about rural areas.  Let me talk about the rural underserved medical areas. Every Senator has rural areas in their State. My State happens to be predominantly rural. But even the States of New York, California, Texas, and Illinois have large rural areas. It is very hard sometimes to get doctors into those areas. If you have someone injured in a farming accident, there may not be a doctor. That injured person may die for want of needed medical treatment. You may have a woman in a difficult childbirth. She may die or her baby may die for want of medical care. There may be an elderly person who just needs a certain amount of preventive care to lead a happy, productive life. We have worked on the visa provisions of INS to allow doctors from outside this country to serve in rural areas: Extend their visa providing they will stay in rural areas and help where there is a need. It allows grandparents to apply for citizenship on behalf of orphaned children, grandparents who saw their grandchildren orphaned in the tragedy of last September 11. These are some items included.  This is as much a bipartisan piece of legislation as I have seen in 28 years. The people supporting this legislation are wide ranging. By golly, I just happen to have a chart. Let's see who is in favor of this: Boys and Girls Clubs of America; the Coalition for Juvenile Justice; the Fraternal Order of Police; Family Violence Prevention Fund; National Automobile Dealers Association; National Association of Counties; National Association of Police Organizations; National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; National Mental Health Association; National Network to End Domestic Violence; Presbyterian Church, Washington office; Volunteers of America; U.S. Council for International Business; National Association of Manufacturers; the International Trademark Association; American Intellectual Property Law Association; U.S. Copyright Office; the American Library Association; Association of American Universities; American Research Libraries; Intellectual Property Owners Association; American Intellectual Property Law Association; Avon Products; Nintendo; Warner Brothers; IBM--I could go on. That is about as broad a cross section supporting this as we will see in the Senate.  I am not sure what game is being played. I urge my good friends on the other side of the aisle to come forward, belly up to the bar, pay the price, pass the bill.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of letters of support.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:         Boys and Girls Clubs of America,                                Rockville, MD, September 27, 2002.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to you today in regard to      H.R. 2215, the 21st Century Department of Justice      Appropriations Authorization Act. As you know, in addition to      the many other critical components of the bill, H.R. 2215      authorizes continued funding to Boys & Girls Clubs of      America, so that we may continue our aggressive growth      efforts in disadvantaged communities throughout the country.       Today, thanks in large part to Congress, Boys & Girls Clubs      of America is serving more than 3,300,000 youth in more than      3,200 Clubs. We are located in all 50 states, and now have      more than 420 Clubs in public housing and 120 Clubs on Native      American lands. We are located in inner-city, and rural      communities throughout America playing a vital role in the      development of our children.       During the past 5 years, we have grown by more than 1,000      Clubs and 1,000,000 new youth served. The Congressional      funding that we have received is matched at least dollar for      dollar nationally, brining true public-private partnerships      to communities all over America.       Senator, we thank you for your strong support of Boys &      Girls Clubs of America, and ask that you move quickly and      decisively in passing the 21st Century Department of Justice      Appropriations Authorization Act.           Sincerely,                                              Mr. Robbie Callaway,     Senior Vice President.                                  ____         National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; National            Network to End Domestic Violence; Family Violence            Prevention Fund; Now Legal Defense and Education Fund,                                               September 26, 2002.       Dear Senator: As national organizations working to address      the varied needs of victims of domestic and sexual violence      and the service providers in the field, we urge you to      support the Violence Against Women Office in the Department      of Justice by voting in favor of the Conference Report of      H.R. 2215, the 21st Century Department of Justice (DOJ)      Appropriations Authorization Act.       As you know, the Violence Against Women Office (VAWO) was      created in 1995 to implement the Violence Against Women Act      of 1994 and to lead the national effort to stop domestic      violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Because ending      violence against women is an on-going struggle, it is      imperative to statutorily authorize the Violence Against      Women Office in order to institutionalize policy development,      observe trends, raise awareness, serve as a crucial resource      for the Attorney General, prosecutors, police and other      community agencies, and provide technical assistance. In      addition, the Office ensures federal dollars under the      Violence Against Women Act of 2000, passed by Congress with      overwhelming bi-partisan support, are administered in the      most effective manner possible to best serve victims and end      violence.       With strong bi-partisan support, both the House and the      Senate have passed H.R. 2215, which would statutorily      establish a strong VAWO. On behalf of all victims of domestic      and sexual violence and the service providers who help them,      we thank Congress for this strong statement from our federal      government that violence against women will not to tolerated.      As you know, it is critical that the statutory creation of      the Violence Against Women Office reflect the essential      components of the office. Currently, VAWO is part of the      Office of Justice Programs--the grant-making body of the      Department of Justice. However, VAWO cannot serve as the      leader in promoting the changes needed to effectively serve      victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and      trafficking if it is merely a grant-making office. VAWO needs      the authority to create policy regarding violence against      women and needs to have a Presidentially-appointed, Senate-     confirmed Director, in order to ensure that these issues      continue to have a high profile on local, state, federal and      international levels.       The Conference Report of H.R. 2215 accomplishes this and      creates a separate and independent Violence Against Women      Office in the Department of Justice, under the general      authority of the Attorney General. We urge you to lead the      way for a safer nation for women and children by voting in      favor of the Conference Report of H.R. 2215, the 21st Century      Department of Justice (DOJ) Appropriations Authorization Act.       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to      contact us at the numbers listed below.           Sincerely,     Juley Fulcher,       Public Policy Director, National Coalition Against Domestic      Violence;     Lisa Maatz,       Vice President of Government Relations NOW Legal Defense      and Education Fund;     Lynn Rosenthal,       Executive Director, National Network to End Domestic      Violence;     Kiersten Stewart,       Director of Public Policy, Family Violence Prevention Fund.                                  ____                                   Business Software Alliance,                                               September 30, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: I am writing to support Senate passage      of H.R. 2215, the Department of Justice Reauthorization Act.      The members of the Business Software Alliance work with a      variety of Justice departments to reduce software piracy and      to ensure a safe and legal online world in this heightened      cybersecurity environment.       The legislation strengthens our nation's criminal justice      system and increases the frequency and quality of reports to      Congress. Effective criminal enforcement requires both      initiatives by prosecutors and timely action by the courts.      BSA is particularly supportive of funding for the enforcement      of our nation's intellectual property laws in Section 101 and      the related reporting requirement contained in Section 206.      The robustness of our nation's tech sector depends in part      upon     the strength of the laws that govern intellectual property as      well as the enforcement of such laws. Until recently, there      have been few criminal copyright cases brought by the      Department. Simply put, there is nowhere else to turn if the      federal government does not enforce our nation's intellectual      property laws.       We appreciate the longstanding efforts of Congress to      strengthen our nation's criminal laws and make our nation's      intellectual property laws a catalyst for growth.           Sincerely,                                          Robert W. Holleyman, II,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                               September 27, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to express our support of      the inclusion of the modified versions of H.R. 1900 and H.R.      863 in the conference report on H.R. 2215, legislation to      reauthorize the Department of Justice. The undersigned      members of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention      Coalition appreciate your efforts to approve a      reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency      Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974 that retains the      rehabilitative principles of our juvenile justice system.       In particular, we appreciate your efforts to preserve      current law in several key areas that has been working well      for more than 25 years to ensure that youth in the juvenile      justice system are protected from abuse and assault by adults      in adult jails. The modified version of H.R. 1900 codifies      the separation protection for youth, which requires that      states prevent all contact between juvenile and adult      inmates, including any `sight or sound' contact. The proposal      also drops a harmful provision that would have permitted      children to be placed in adult facilities with parental      consent. This provision represented a radical change from      current law and would have resulted in children being      unnecessarily placed in adult jails.       The revised version of H.R. 1900 also includes an      appropriate concentration on prevention through the      restoration of the Title V Local Delinquency Prevention Grant      program. In order to ensure that children stay out of trouble      and on the right track, a significant investment in and      emphasis on prevention, particularly primary prevention, is      crucial. The Title V program is an effective model of      community collaboration in which community stakeholders--     including locally elected officials, law enforcement, school      officials, public recreation, private nonprofit      organizations, and youth workers--come together to develop a      plan for juvenile delinquency prevention. Working in more      than 1,000 communities nationwide, Title V is currently the      only federal program providing delinquency prevention funding      to communities through a flexible, local prevention block      grant approach to help communities reduce juvenile      delinquency and related problems and enable young people to      transition successfully into adulthood.       Finally, we are pleased that H.R. 863, legislation to      authorize the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JAIBG),      has also been included in the conference report. Never      authorized, the JAIBG was created in the FY98 Commerce      Justice State Appropriations bill to provide states and units      of local government with funds to develop programs to promote      greater accountability in the juvenile justice system. Under      H.R. 863, the program purpose areas are expanded      significantly to provide additional services and treatment      for troubled youth. By supporting these additional purposes,      JAIBG will provide needed resources to proven strategies for      rehabilitating adjudicated youth and families as well as      reducing juvenile re-offense rates.       We appreciate your continued efforts on behalf of children      and youth and look forward to final approval of H.R. 2215.           Sincerely,         American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry;            American Civil Liberties Union, Washington National            Office; American Probation and Parole Association;            American Psychological Association; Bazelon Center for            Mental Health Law; Child Welfare League of America;            Children & Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity            Disorder (CHADD); Children's Defense Fund; Coalition            for Juvenile Justice; Education Fund to Stop Gun            Violence; Justice Policy Institute; National            Association for the Advancement of Colored People            (NAACP); National Association of Counties; National            Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers; National            Education Association; National Mental Health            Association; National Network for Youth; National            Recreation and Park Association; Presbyterian Church            (USA), Washington Office; Volunteers of America; Women            of Reform Judaism; Youth Law Center.
