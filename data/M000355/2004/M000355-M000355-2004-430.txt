 President, I want to take a very brief moment to speak to an article entitled ``U.S. Aid Goes to Terrorism Backers'' that appeared in today's edition of the Washington Times.  The allegation that American foreign assistance dollars in the West Bank and Gaza are going to Palestinian groups ``working with or fostering terrorist-supporting organizations'' is a serious one. The United States Agency for International Development, USAID, and the U.S. Department of State must immediately clarify these troubling reports, and I urge them to do so in an expeditious and public manner.  My colleagues should note that we already require the Secretary of State to ensure that no assistance for the West Bank and Gaza goes to, or through, individuals or entities ``the Secretary knows or has reason to believe advocates, plans, sponsors, engages in, or has engaged in, terrorist activities.''  I will have more to say on this issue once USAID and the State Department clarify this matter.                          ____________________
