Speaker, first of all we need a clean continuing resolution. We ought to have one similar to the one that was passed about 1\1/2\ months ago, without all the bells and whistles on it, that brings us below last year's level of spending, but without all these riders and everything else they have been trying to stick on.  I think also we should go back to regular order. And I have to say to the former Speaker, Jim Wright, if he is listening tonight, thank you for being a great Speaker. Thank you for clearing your bills on time. We should be doing the same with the appropriation bills.  I would say to President Clinton that I hope he keeps on his balanced budget target and hangs strong on Medicare.
