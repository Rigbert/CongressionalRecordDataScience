 President, in listening to the Senator from Tennessee, I am reminded that he and I were here in those days as young staffers. I was working for the Senator from Kentucky when Margaret Chase Smith was still here. She had already made her reputation by being the first Member of the U.S. Senate to take on Joseph McCarthy and his tactics. It took the Senate a couple of years to finally develop the courage to stand up to this demagogue and the tactics he employed.  Those of us who are in the Chamber today have had a unique opportunity to listen to a great statesman from Maine once again talk about this institution and how it ought to treat matters like this and to think about how we can rise above the depths to which we have sunk during this process.  I want to thank the Senator from Maine. I have not heard a better speech in my time here, and I have been here a while. It was absolutely inspirational.
