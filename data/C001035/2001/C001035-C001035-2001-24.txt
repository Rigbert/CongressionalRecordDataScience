As does the Senator from Georgia, I view this matter as one of national importance, deriving from the policies of the Department of Defense, which fall within the oversight of our Committee. I also share his concerns because, as does he and many of our colleagues, I have constituents who depend on the forest products industry for their livelihood.  I am also pleased that we have agreed to this colloquy as a bipartisan expression of our mutual concern over the current Department of Defense release authority for sebacic acid. Having taken this measured step this year, I will monitor the impact of Department of Defense sebacic acid release on the market, and will be ready to join my colleagues in taking legislative action as required.  The fact that an additional amount of acid is being released now, due to the acknowledged contracting miscues on the part of Department of Defense officials last year, is a further indication that we must be prepared to act in our oversight role to restrict future releases of sebacic acid. The horrible acts of terrorism that befell us on September 11 have had an effect on our economy. I believe the Department must take current economic conditions into account as it implements its releases of sebacic acid over the coming year.
