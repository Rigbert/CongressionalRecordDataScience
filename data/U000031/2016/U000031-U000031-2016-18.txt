Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.  I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts' statement. He is a very valuable player as we move this legislation on all fronts forward. I look very forward to working with the gentleman and with every Member of this body to make sure that the funding is there as we have laid out in this bill and to work with our colleagues in the Senate to make sure that it happens.  Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?
