 President, I rise today to remember a woman whose life, to a remarkable degree, traced the very arc of the American dream. Ruth Mulan Chu Chao returned home to the Lord on August 2, 2007, and today is the Seventh Seventh Day of her departure, an important day in Chinese tradition.  The story of her struggle to bring hope and opportunity to a family that had verged on losing both is an inspiration to all who knew her. On August 11, 2007, I had the honor of retelling my mother-in-law's life story at a private celebration of life and thanksgiving service in New York City that was attended by her many family, friends, admirers, and acquaintances.  It is my hope that by preserving my tribute, along with that of my wife, Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao, that the memory of this remarkable woman will live on not only for the benefit of those who knew her but for all who cherish the promise of America. May its placement in the Congressional Record serve as a lasting tribute to the millions of men and women who, like Ruth Mulan Chu Chao, struggled to see that promise fulfilled. Ruth's story is the story of America. It deserves to be heard.  I ask unanimous consent that my tribute and that of Secretary Elaine Chao be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      Tribute by Senator McConnell       Sophocles said that ``One must wait until the evening to      see how splendid the day has been.'' And we could say the      same thing about the modest woman we mourn today. Ruth Chao      put the lives of others ahead of her own for as long as      anyone could remember. And, in the end, we all knew that this      was the secret of her truly remarkable life.       As a young girl, she was torn from the beauty of her native      home by an invading army, then secretly returned at great      risk to herself to retrieve the family's belongings. As a      young wife and mother, she was separated from her husband for      three years, but consoled him with letters of encouragement,      optimism, and hope. And as a loving mother of six daughters,      she would diligently devote the rest of her years to them.       She had been at sea for more than a month in the summer of      1961 when she leaned over the rail toward the giant woman in      New York harbor, and prayed that her family would be safe in      this new and foreign place. There was no guarantee that the      journey would end well. But in the years to come, Ruth Chao      would quietly do all she could to ensure that her family      lived up to the promise of America.       The cultural divide was as wide as the ocean that brought      them here. One early shock came at the end of October, when a      group of children showed up at the front door with masks on      their faces. The neighbors knew it was Halloween. The Chao      family thought they were being robbed. Most of the cultural      difficulties were harder to bear. But they made it through.      They had their anchor. It was Ruth.       In time, the family would learn the language and the      culture. The daughters would go on to the best universities      in the country, and anyone who visited the house in Harrison      would learn the wisdom of the Chinese Proverb which says that      ``Those who plant melons grow melons; those who plant beans      produce beans.'' Ruth's devotion to her husband and her      daughters was complete and total. And it showed.       She was never more herself than when she fell ill. She said      that if someone in the family had to be sick, better that it      be her. She had fewer responsibilities than the others, she      said. It was an astonishing thing to hear. But it didn't      surprise anyone who knew her. From the shadow of the Purple      Mountain of Nanjing, to the bitterness of exile, to the      uncertainty of a new life in a strange place, to the      heartbreak of a long illness, she put herself last so that      others might be first.       The Scriptures that she loved tell us that ``Unless a grain      of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains itself      alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.'' Ruth Chao made      this promise her own. She left this life as she lived it,      giving of herself, even at the end, for others. And all of us      are grateful for the harvest that she reaped.                       Tribute by Secretary Chao       My father, Dr. James S. C. Chao; sisters: Jeanette, May,      Christine, Grace, Angela; the rest of our family, and I want      to thank you so much--especially those who have traveled so      far--for coming and helping us celebrate the life and legacy      of our beloved mother, Ruth Mulan Chu Chao.       My mother is a modest and humble person who never wanted to      trouble anyone. We did not notify many people formally but      the volume of condolence wishes have been so spontaneous,      heartfelt, and overwhelming. We are very touched.       Mother went home to the Lord a week ago last Thursday,      after a heroic seven-year battle with lymphoma. In fact, her      initial diagnosis came on the same day that the President      announced my nomination as the Secretary of Labor. Our mother      confronted this struggle as she did every challenge in her      life--with courage, selfless concern for others, and a      serenity that came from the belief that God had a purpose for      her in life.       She and my father are part of a generation that experienced      much suffering, but achieved great things. Mother and Father,      like so many Chinese in the 20th century, endured the terror      of foreign invasions, the chaos of domestic turmoil, and the      heartbreak of dislocations in their native land. Despite all      the terrible things they saw, they refused to be defeated by      them and remained positive and optimistic their entire life.       Mother's courage in the face of great suffering was the      product of a strong faith, rooted in a deep love for the      Lord, her husband and her family. It gave her the strength to      be a pioneer for women of her generation, and to leave a      legacy that extends far beyond her immediate family.       Mother was ahead of her time even as a young woman, when      she saw the promise of her future husband, James S. C. Chao,      long before others, and pledged her love and her life to him      unconditionally. Her American name, Ruth, which was given to      her by a missionary, is very appropriate because--as the      Biblical Ruth promised in Chapter 1:16--``whither thou goest,      I will go.''       For my father's part, her graceful bearing, dignity,      cultured upbringing and beauty ensured that his heart was      hers forever. As Proverbs 31:10-12 say, ``When one finds a      worthy wife, her value is far beyond pearls. Her husband,      entrusting his heart to her, has an unfailing prize. She      brings him good . . . all the days of her life.''       Mother's virtuous character was the foundation of our      family and all that we have been able to achieve. Her loving,      steady leadership at home alleviated all of Father's worries      and enabled him to travel far and wide to seek opportunities      to better life for the family. Mother was seven months      pregnant with my sister, May, when Father left to go to      America. During their three long years of separation, they      were faithful to one another, to God and to every promise      that they made.       Three years later, Mother risked everything, leaving her      family and all that was familiar behind to join him, taking      another great leap of faith. Moving to America may seem more      commonplace now, but back then it was a courageous and bold      step, especially because America was not nearly as ethnically      diverse as it is today. Mother was a pioneer who led the way      for those who came afterwards, and their contributions helped      our country grow in the diversity and strength that makes it      the envy of the world today.       Resettled in America, Mother paved the way for her      daughters' successes by nurturing us physically and imbuing      us with thinking and attitudes that were, again, ahead of      their time. Mother always believed that women could be just      as valued and accomplished as men. She also believed that the      most important adornments for a woman were virtue, intellect      and achievement. In fact, at the age of 51, she went back to      school to St. John's University to earn a master's degree in      Asian literature and history. She taught us to lead virtuous      lives by her own example of being virtuous in everything she      did and said. She is our model of dignity, propriety and      purity of heart.       Mother gave expression to her strong faith and love not      only through the example she set for us, but in giving      herself wholeheartedly to her church and to her community.      She touched the lives of many outside our family through her      volunteer work in the church and in the community, often done      quietly and without fanfare.       Mother's life spanned two worlds--Asia and America--and she      played a role in building bridges of understanding between      them. She never forgot where she came from, establishing      several charitable foundations with Father that are helping      young people in Asia and America access higher education and      opportunity. She has planted thousands of seeds throughout      her life that will blossom over time and produce many      improvements in our world in the future.       As Mother faced the final challenge of her life, she never      complained even though the ravages of the illness ensured      that she was never without pain. Her only thoughts and words      were always expressions of concern for others. When I would      accompany her in the hospital, she would look quizzically at      me and ask, ``Shouldn't you be at work? The people and the      country are depending on you.''       During her illness, my parents switched roles. Mother had      taken care of Father throughout her life. Now, he took care      of     her, ferociously and protectively monitoring every detail of      her care at every stage. So much so that one of the doctors      joked that my father was practicing medicine without a      license. Throughout this difficult time, the devotion of my      parents to one another was like a shining beacon, drawing      everyone to them with its intensity and warmth.       Nearly half a century ago, Father came to America to      prepare a place for his young wife and their children. Now,      Mother has gone to prepare a place for him and for us--an      everlasting home with the Lord that will never end and where      every tear will be wiped away. We are consoled by the      knowledge that we will see Mother again with her usual smile,      healthy and strong.       Until then, Mother is with us every day in our hearts and      in our lives as an enduring inspiration, spurring us forward      to contribute to society and make a difference in this world.                               ____________________
