 President, I rise today to discuss an issue that has troubled me for many months, and that is the disappearance of an Alabama teenager, Natalee Holloway, from the island of Aruba. Most people have heard about this. It has been in the news for months.  More than 5 months ago, on the early morning of May 30, Natalee Holloway disappeared from the island of Aruba. Since the start of the investigation into Natalee's disappearance, I, along with others, have been deeply troubled by the process that has taken place in Aruba. From the outset, there has been miscommunication and misinformation from the Aruban Government. The investigation has been plagued by inconsistencies and conflicting information, calling the integrity of the investigation itself into question. Since Natalee's disappearance, a number of suspects have been arrested, detained, and released without the benefit of any substantive information regarding her disappearance.  I have made no secret of my concern regarding the handling of this case and the careless and inappropriate manner in which it appears the evidence has been handled. Nevertheless, I continue to believe that without the will of Natalee Holloway's mother, Beth Twitty, Natalee's disappearance would not have received the level of scrutiny in Aruba and around the world we have witnessed.  It is disturbing that so many months have passed with no clear answers regarding the circumstances surrounding Natalee's disappearance. To that end, I joined Alabama GOV Bob Riley and others yesterday to call for a boycott of Aruba. Today, I call upon my colleagues to join me in that call.  I understand this is a drastic measure, but I believe that we as Americans, along with others around the world, should carefully weigh our travel options until the Government of Aruba exhibits a good-faith effort to solve this case.  For the safety, security, and well-being of our citizens, I do not believe we can trust that we will be protected while in Aruba. Quite frankly, if this can happen to Natalee Holloway, a teenager from my home State of Alabama, it could happen to any of us. That is why I believe a boycott is the answer. I hope the American people, when they think of traveling to the Caribbean this winter, will look at other options.                          ____________________
