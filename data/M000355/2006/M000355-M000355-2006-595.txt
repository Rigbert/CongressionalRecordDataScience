 President, we now have an agreement for a couple of votes in the morning relative to the minimum wage amendments which have been discussed this afternoon. Tomorrow we will also proceed to debate the Iraq-related amendments offered by Senator Levin and Senator Kerry.  Mr. President, at this point, on behalf of the leader, I am prepared to send a cloture motion to the desk, but I do want to make the following point before sending the cloture motion to the desk. This does not--I repeat, does not--preclude us from working toward further agreement to set up votes on these amendments prior to cloture. In fact, we anticipate having votes on both of those amendments prior to cloture. We are looking forward to the debate on both amendments.  Almost everyone on this side is interested in speaking to the appropriateness of adopting those amendments, and, as I said, we do not intend for cloture to shut out in any way votes on the Kerry and Levin amendments.                             Cloture Motion  Having said that, Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.
