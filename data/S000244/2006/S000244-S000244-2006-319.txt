Speaker, I make a point of order against the motion to recommit for the same reason that I made a point of order against the gentleman from Illinois' previous motion to recommit.  Clause 7 of rule XVI precludes amendments on a subject different from that under consideration.                              {time}  1515  H.R. 6095 reaffirms the inherent authority of State and local law enforcement to voluntarily investigate, identify, apprehend, arrest, detain or transfer to Federal custody aliens in the United States in order to assist in the enforcement of immigration laws, and clarifies guidelines for the prosecution of smuggling offenses. It also ends the practice of catch and release by DHS to ensure that immigration laws are enforced in the manner in which they were intended.  This motion to recommit pertains to a subject matter different from the legislation under consideration. It is the same motion to recommit that the gentleman from Illinois made to the previous bill by increasing the number of U.S. marshals by 250, which is on page 2, line 15 of the motion to recommit.  The U.S. marshals do not have a role in enforcing the immigration law. Thus, the motion to recommit expands the scope of the bill and is nongermane, and it fails the test of germaneness contained in clause 7 of rule XVI.
