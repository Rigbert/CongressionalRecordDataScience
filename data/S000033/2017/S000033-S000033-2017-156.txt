 President, this amendment should be aptly called the Orwellian amendment because it says one thing and does something very much the opposite. It talks about strengthening Social Security, affordable coverage for all Americans. What is really going on is a desire to cut Social Security benefits and throw 20 million Americans off of health insurance.  I urge the defeat of this amendment.
