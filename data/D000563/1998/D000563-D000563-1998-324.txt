President, let me rise and first thank the Appropriations Committee for the work on this bill.  I will not be able to vote for it for two reasons. First, I find it interesting that after a week of debate in this Chamber and a lengthy discussion about America's role in world leadership, we follow this historic vote on the enlargement of NATO with an appropriations bill which fails to appropriate funds for our Nation's obligation to the United Nations. It is a source of embarrassment to our Nation that Congress continues to fail to meet its responsibility to the United Nations. A great nation should pay its bills.  Let me also add to what the Senator from California said. If you look at this bill on page 69, section 3009, you will find a provision that has never been in a House bill and never been in a Senate bill that comes in here at the last minute on an emergency spending bill. It is a rider which will give to oil companies some $65 million in breaks for oil and gas that they are taking off of public lands--lands owned by taxpayers.  Last year, we passed a budget agreement with a provision in it for a $50 billion tax break for tobacco companies. We went back home and were embarrassed by it, came back and rescinded it. I'm afraid we are returning home to face more embarrassment for this provision which, unfortunately, provides a break to oil companies at the expense of taxpayers.  For the fiscal conservative listening, this money is not set off by any cuts in spending. This gives to the oil companies, pure and simple, $65 million out of the Treasury, at taxpayers' expense.  I yield back the remainder of my time.
