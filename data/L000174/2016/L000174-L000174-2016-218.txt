President, the Senator may well recall--he was here when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001 during President Bush's administration, the ranking member was then Senator Hatch--we put together an agreement about how the committee would consider Supreme Court nominees. We wrote: The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the committee has completed its consideration. This has been true even in cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed by a majority of the Judiciary Committee.  Does the Senator recall that at that time the Republican leader of the Senate, Senator Lott, even read that letter into the Record to say that this is the way the Senate should operate?
