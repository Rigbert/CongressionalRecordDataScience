 President, it is my great pleasure to recognize Bellevue Police Department Officer Bob Oliver for his selection as Washington State D.A.R.E. Officer of the Year.  Our children are our greatest resource and our future prosperity depends on them becoming contributing members of the community. Giving them the skills to success is no easy task, yet it is our responsibility as adults to ensure that our children have the best chance possible to succeed. The D.A.R.E. Program gives them that chance. D.A.R.E. equips each participant with the skills to just say no to peer pressure when confronted with the temptation to use drugs. It reinforces the importance of self-esteem and the consequences of one's actions, lessons which will help the children confront problems of any sort their entire lives.  Through his active participation in the D.A.R.E. Program, Officer Oliver has demonstrated his special commitment to these children. As a police officer, Officer Oliver has dedicated his career to making his community a safer place to live. Through his participation in the D.A.R.E. Program and with his focus on prevention, his work not only makes a difference today, but will have a lasting impact.  Some take measure of a good police officer by the numbers of arrests made or traffic violations ticketed. Officer Oliver can measure his success by the many children whose lives he has touched and positively influenced through the D.A.R.E. Program and the high esteem in which he is held in the community.  As his family and colleagues gather to recognize him for this achievement, I want to wish him continued success. Officer Bob Oliver is truly an asset to our community, and we all congratulate him on a job well done.                          ____________________
