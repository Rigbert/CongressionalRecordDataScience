 President, I'd like to take a few moments to address a health issue of critical importance to Americans, especially older women. Osteoporosis affects 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women. Nearly one in every two women and one in every eight men over age 50 will experience an osteoporotic fracture in his or her lifetime. This disease measurably impact the ability of many older Americans to maintain the independence and mobility so integral to mental well-being.  Osteoporosis is estimated to cost the United States care system $14 billion annually. In my home state of Iowa, it is estimated that $2.9 billion will be spent over the next 20 years as a result of hip, wrist and vetebral fractures. Annual costs are expected to increase from $76 million in 1995 to more than $229 million in 2015.  According to the Iowa Department of Elder Affairs, Iowa is the state with the highest proportion of people considered to be the ``oldest old'' in the country. Twenty percent are 80 years of age and over. The people in this age segment are more frequently women. They are usually living alone; and they are probably the persons with the lowest incomes.  One of the most sobering facts is that osteoporosis is largely preventable. Prevention is a key element in fighting the disease, because while there are numerous treatments for osteoporosis, there is no cure. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, there are four ways an individual can prevent osteoporosis. First, maintain a balanced daily diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. Participate in weight-bearing exercise. Do not smoke or drink excessively. And finally, when appropriate, have your bone density tested and take any physician-prescribed medications. All this to say, osteoporosis is a disease which we in the Senate cannot afford to take lightly.  The National Osteoporosis Foundation has declared May to be National Osteoporosis Prevention Month. In my capacity as an honorary member of the foundation's board of trustees, I am glad to have the opportunity to come to the floor to raise the issue of osteoporosis and speak on the need for continued vigilance in battling this disease.  In addition to being National Osteoporosis Prevention Month, May also marks a one-year anniversary for a special group in Iowa. In May 1999, a group of Newton, Iowa, residents formed the Newton Support Group under the leadership of Peg Bovenkamp and with the help of Skiff Medical Center. The Newton group is the first Iowa support network affiliated with the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Today, the members of the Newton Support Group are participating in Newton's Senior Citizen's Health Fair. I wish them success as they provide information to older Iowans about osteoporosis prevention and treatment. It is my sincere hope that in coming years we will see similar groups form in other parts of my great state and throughout the region.  Throughout my years in Congress, I have championed effort to increase awareness and research funding for osteoporosis. In the 102nd Congress, I introduced legislation to increase research at the Arthritis Institute, form a research center on osteoporosis, and create a Health and Human Services interagency council to set priorities for osteoporosis research.  More recently, I cosponsored legislation which passed as part of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. The Bone Mass Measurement Coverage Standardization Act, as included in the BBA, provides Medicare reimbursement for bone mass density tests for vulnerable beneficiaries. This benefit took effect July 1, 1998. And, yesterday I sent a letter to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) requesting information and the most recent data possible on program utilization.  Osteoporosis deeply affects the lives of older Americans, mostly women. And, it is preventable if healthy lifestyle choices are made at a young age. As we recognize National Osteoporosis Prevention Month, I would commend the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Strong Women Inside and Out coalition, Peg Bovenkamp and the Newton Support Group, and all those working to raise awareness of the disease. It is my sincere hope that someday in the not too distant future, I can again come to the floor with news of a cure for osteoporosis. Until that time, I will continue supporting efforts to eradicate this devastating disease.                          ____________________
