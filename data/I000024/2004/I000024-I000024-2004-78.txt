President, earlier today, my State of Oklahoma, as well as the Nation, lost a true friend of education.  Ed Hennessee, a longtime resident of Lawton, OK died doing what he loved best--advocating for children attending federally connected school districts.  Ed served the Lawton Public Schools in a variety of capacities for many years retiring as assistant superintendent for business in 1995.  While in that capacity he fought for a program that I have come to champion--Impact Aid.  The program's origin was rooted in Oklahoma in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when Oscar Rose, superintendent of the Mid-Del Schools and others convinced Congress that the Federal Government had a responsibility and an obligation to provide assistance to school districts serving children whose parents were employed by the Federal Government or the military. Ed Hennessee continued that legacy right up to the time of his death this morning.  During his long education career, Ed received many honors, including being named the State of Oklahoma Teacher of the Year.  However, he was most proud of the fact that he was helping children.  He truly understood that education is about giving children an opportunity to be successful. One of his most frequent statements was ``Teach a child to love to learn, then you will be successful teaching them any school subject.'' Ed was a success because he loved learning.  He also loved helping others have the opportunity to learn, and, thankfully, he taught many the importance of using their gifts and talents to help our children. Although he retired from the Lawton Public Schools in the mid-1990s, he continued serving federally connected schools. As executive director of the National Council of Impacted Schools, he continued to work for both Oklahoma federally connected schools, along with other schools throughout the nation.  He visited my office at least twice a year to talk about ways to improve the program. He was an expert on the intricacies of the often complex and confusing details of Impact Aid and freely offered that expertise. When my staff or I needed information about how schools in Oklahoma and around the country would be affected by the level of funding appropriated for Impact Aid, Ed knew the answers. He was an innovator for Impact Aid.  For example, S. 777 was a bill I developed from one of his ideas. Ed was in Washington this weekend to advocate for the Impact Aid program when he became ill. He was doing what he had been doing for more than a quarter of a century--- asking Congress to fulfill its obligation to school districts all across this country that are impacted by a federal presence.  Prior to Ed's retirement, he served on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools and served as its President from 1991 to 1993. He never stopped putting the needs of federally connected students at the top of his priority list. His presence will indeed be missed--not only by those who knew him well, such as his dear wife Edna who was always by his side--but also by those who enjoy the fruits of his labor.                          ____________________
