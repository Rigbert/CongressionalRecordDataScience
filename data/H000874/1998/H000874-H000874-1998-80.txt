Speaker, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) said what the Democrats know. Let me tell my colleagues what the Democrats know. When people commit wrongs, they do not want to be held accountable, and the Republicans are making sure that is true.  I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4250, the bill that my friends on the other side of the aisle claim reforms managed care. The previous speaker, the chairman of their conference, said what the Republican Congress had brought as it pertains to a balanced budget. We will argue that some other time. The fact is, this Congress has not brought hardly anything to the American public.                              {time}  1015  It is the do-nothing Congress.  This bill is on the floor today because a discharge petition was signed by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Ganske) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and about 190 others of us, and says, we want a health care reform bill on this floor. That is the reason it is here and the only reason we are here today.  I rise in strong support of the substitute offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Ganske), a Republican and a doctor, and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), the former Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, now Ranking Member, and the next Chairman of the Committee on Commerce.  The Republicans have chosen to support H.R. 4250, the so-called ``Patient Protection Act.'' They bring this bill to the floor today with no hearings, no mark-ups, and no CBO estimate. In other words, they were so panicked by the discharge petition, that they brought it to the floor without the regular process.  Mr. Speaker, the American public wants access to health care. The American public wants decisions made by their doctors and by themselves, not by, as all of us have said, insurance companies. They are right. But the American public will not be fooled as to which alternative gives them protection, as to which bill gives them access, and as to which bill allows them to hold accountable those who undercut their health care protection.  My colleagues, I ask you to support the Democratic substitute, the Republican substitute, supported by Members on the other side of the aisle, the Ganske-Dingell substitute, supported by Members on the other side of the aisle, which does in fact do what everybody says they want to do.
