President, as I said earlier, I do not question the patriotism or the intent to stop terrorists of either those who vote for or those who vote against cloture. I hope others would not. If we wanted to make this a partisan thing, we could have brought out the fact that even under the laws that existed before 9/11, it was this administration's Department of Justice that ignored clear warnings and evidence that they had, which the 9/11 Commission and others have pointed out might well have prevented the terrorist attacks. That could have been done with or without the PATRIOT Act.  All of us rallied behind the administration, even though the attack occurred during this administration and the attack occurred even though this administration's Department of Justice had information which might have stopped the attack.  I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.
