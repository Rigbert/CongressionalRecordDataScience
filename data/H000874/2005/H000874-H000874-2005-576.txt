Speaker, I thank the Leader.  Reclaiming my time. Lastly, Mr. Leader, there has been some discussion about having bipartisan support for the legislation, some of the legislation that is going through this body. We have had bipartisan support for some of those pieces of legislation.  There is a bipartisan bill, the Castle-DeGette bill, on stem cell research. I know it is a controversial piece of legislation, but it does have bipartisan support and broad support I might say.  Can the Leader tell us when the gentleman might contemplate that bill coming to the floor?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLAY).  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  There is a good chance that the House will consider changes in the President's research policies between now and the August recess. The form and timing of this debate has yet to be determined. There is still a lot of discussion going on.  I could inform the gentleman that probably the timing for the floor, the best I could tell you is that timing for the floor would be sooner than later.
