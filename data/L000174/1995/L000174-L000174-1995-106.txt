President, I was deeply disappointed that the conferees dropped the provision that would have let States invest limited amounts of highway funds for intercity passenger rail service. This reasonable amendment would have given States like Vermont some flexibility to start or continue Amtrak service.  Last December, Amtrak made the painful decision to terminate the Montrealer, Vermont's only passenger rail service. Over the ensuing months, a unique partnership developed between the State of Vermont and Amtrak that resulted in an improved, cost-effective train, the Vermonter. The Vermonter has become a success story for Vermont and for Amtrak. Ridership has dramatically increased since its inception, a new baggage car has made the train more attractive to skiers and bicyclists, and the train operates at less than half the cost of the Montrealer.  The Vermonter's existence is largely due to the State of Vermont, which agreed last spring to pay up to $750,000 to subsidize the route for 1 year. This subsidy represents a heavy commitment for my small State. As the Congress continues to cut Amtrak's budget, reallocated Amtrak costs are going to be passed on to Vermont in the form of a higher subsidy, which could well make the Vermonter unaffordable for Vermont.  This is why this amendment was so important for Vermont and other States. We subsidize highway construction with billions of taxpayer dollars every year. This modest provision would have allowed States some flexibility to use a small portion of those funds for Amtrak service. I am disappointed that the Senate conferees allowed this provision to be dropped in conference.
