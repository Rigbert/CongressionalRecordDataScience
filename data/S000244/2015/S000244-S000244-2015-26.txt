Chairman, 8 days ago Members of this House said the following:       I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the      Constitution of the United States against all enemies,      foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and      allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely,      without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and      that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the      office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.  This is a question of whether this House and its Members fulfill that oath. We have a choice here. We can either agree with what the President did or defend the Constitution. Vote ``aye.''
