 President, I have spoken in the past about my commitment to continuing the production and distribution of clean, reliable hydropower through Federal Power Marketing Administrations. Today, I reaffirm this commitment.  The Federal power program has served well both the taxpaying public and energy consumers. It serves the taxpaying public by paying its own way--and paying interest on its debt. It also serves the general public by providing navigation, flood control, recreation, fish and wildlife conservation, and irrigation. Few Federal programs can claim such far-reaching benefits at such a low cost.  Mr. President, if we sell our PMA's, we cannot be assured that the general public will continue to reap these many benefits. While the sale of PMA's would product short-term revenue, the sale will do little to solve the long-term problem of our Nation's debt. In fact, the permanent loss of these productive assets will result in foregoing future revenues likely to be in the billions of dollars.  At this time, the Bonneville Power Administration is not immediately threatened with sale. Several months ago, however, officials within the administration suggested to the President that he sell BPA to finance a tax cut. Fortunately, after hearing from Senators and Representatives from the Pacific Northwest, President Clinton elected to decline that advice. Recognizing the special attributes of BPA, he has said he does not intend to offer it for sale. So, my constituents appear to be safe for now.  I speak in opposition to the sale of the other PMA's because I believe their sale is not in the best interest of either the taxpaying public or the tens of millions of consumers who will certainly be saddled with higher electricity bills. Let us reject this short-term solution to our deficit and protect our Federal assets for the next generations of Americans.              Sale of the Power Marketing Administrations
