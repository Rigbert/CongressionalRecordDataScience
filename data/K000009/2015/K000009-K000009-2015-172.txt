Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ukrainian-American and Northern Ohioan Adrian Karmazyn on the announcement of his retirement as Voice of America's (VOA) Ukrainian Service Chief. Mr. Karmazyn is a native of Parma, Ohio and is respected around the world as a veteran journalist covering Ukraine and Ukrainian-American communities in the United States.  During his career, Mr. Karmazyn has contributed immensely to keeping the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, even during some of her darkest hours. He is a freedom fighter. His mindful voice has been an essential component on the arduous path to a more open, democratic society following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the harrowing but steady progress of Ukraine to become part of the European community of nations.  Mr. Karmazyn attended Ohio State University, receiving a B.A. in History. He then joined Voice of America in 1988 as an international radio broadcaster in VOA's Ukrainian Service, serving as a writer, producer, reporter, translator, announcer, and eventually as a correspondent in Kyiv. While there, he recruited a team of radio and video journalists in Kyiv and in other regional cities, helping to establish VOA's reporting presence throughout Ukraine.  He continued to distinguish himself and in 1999 was named Program Manager of VOA's Ukrainian Service. Mr. Karmazyn directed the reorganization of the weekly Ukrainian Service TV magazine program Vikno v America, or Window on America. Over the next several years, the Ukrainian Service significantly expanded its network of reporters in Ukraine.  In 2004, Mr. Karmazyn was assigned leadership over VOA's Ukrainian television programming. Later that year, during Ukraine's Orange Revolution, Karmazyn oversaw the launch of the daily Chas-Time television program. He was appointed Chief of VOA's Ukrainian Service in 2006 and served as one of the most reliable and valuable sources of information during the Euromaidan protests and Revolution of Dignity in 2013. This was vital as freedom of the press was under threat in the region.  I have known and worked with Adrian Karmazyn for many years. Please allow me to extend my heartfelt appreciation for his years of exemplary and passionate service and his commitment to telling the stories of Ukraine, from Kyiv to Cleveland. His labor has brought the American people and the people of Ukraine closer for decades, with his regular presence and positive influence at VOA for the cause of liberty. His has been a voice of freedom and he will be missed.                          ____________________
