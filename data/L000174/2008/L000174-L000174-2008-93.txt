 Mr. President, I said on the Senate floor yesterday that I support the Free Flow of Information Act, S. 2035. Senator Specter, the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, was exactly right when he said in his remarks last night that ``this bill is long past due.'' After months and months of needless delay by the Senate minority, I hope we will finally be permitted to consider this important legislative effort this morning. This is legislation that passed overwhelmingly in the other body. If the Republicans would allow it, it would pass overwhelmingly in this body.
