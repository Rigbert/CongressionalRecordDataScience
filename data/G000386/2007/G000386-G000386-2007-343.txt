 President, I am pleased today to have the fortunate opportunity to recognize and congratulate a fellow Iowan on a magnificent achievement. On Sunday, 31-year-old Zach Johnson won the prestigious Masters golf tournament at the famed Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, GA. I am joined by my colleague, Senator Harkin, in submitting a Senate resolution congratulating Zach for his victory.  Zach not only won one of the most difficult golf tournaments in the world, he also won quite possibly one of the most difficult of all the Masters' tournaments in history. Gusting winds and bitterly cold weather combined with the traditional challenges of the golf course to create one of the toughest tournaments. His winning score of one-over-par 289 tied the highest winning score in Masters history. In the process, he beat fellow golf champions Tiger Woods and Retief Goosen by two-strokes.  Zach was born in Iowa City and grew up in Cedar Rapids, playing golf at Elmcrest Country Club in Cedar Rapids. He went on to play golf at Drake University in Des Moines, graduating in 1998. To continue his pursuits as a professional golfer, Zach counted on the support of family and friends in Cedar Rapids who believed in him. His success didn't happen overnight; his dedication to the game and his hard work ethic helped him earn the prized green jacket.  Even in the aftermath of winning one of golf's highest achievements, he remained humble in his acceptance. He attributed much of his success to his perseverance and patience. He recognized his family and friends who believed in him even when he wasn't so sure himself, and as a man of faith he knew there was another power guiding him.  Through it all, he continued to insist that he's just a normal guy from Cedar Rapids, IA. I am proud of Zach Johnson for his brilliant win, and I am proud of him as an Iowan. I know Iowans are honored and blessed to have a person like Zach Johnson representing us in the world of professional golf. So I congratulate him on his outstanding victory, and I wish him and his family all the best.                          ____________________
