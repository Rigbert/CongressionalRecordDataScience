Just so that colleagues will understand what is happening here, the amendment that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] and I have sent to the desk is an amendment on the one amendment in disagreement. We resolved 192 out of the 193 amendments in the committee of conference. This is the one so-called Mexico City policy of the 1980's, one in disagreement.  After having been reported, it is open to second-degree amendment, which I understand the Senator from Arizona is going to make on an entirely different issue. But for those who have been asking me about the Mexico City policy, my understanding is what we would then do is debate the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, there would be a vote on that, and then we would begin the debate on the Mexico City amendment.                Amendment No. 3042 to Amendment No. 3041(Purpose: To permit the continued provision of assistance to Burma only                   if certain conditions are satisfied)  Mr. McCAIN. I have a second degree perfecting amendment, which I send to the desk.
