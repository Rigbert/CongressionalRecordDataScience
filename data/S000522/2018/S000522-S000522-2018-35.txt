Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close.  Mr. Speaker, I include these letters of support in the Record. I call attention to the membership an excellent letter written by human rights and diaspora groups, six groups in all. It is entitled, ``Ethiopia: Joint Letter About U.S. House Resolution 128'', in support of it. They make a number of very important points.          Ethiopia: Joint Letter About US House Resolution 128 Democracy, Human Rights and Diaspora Groups Urge Congress to Pass H.                           Res. 128 on Ethiopia       Ethiopia is at a crossroads. On Monday, April 2, a new      Prime Minister, selected from within the ruling coalition,      delivered a speech about planned reforms while the country      was under another State of Emergency. At such a juncture,      amid mounting pressures, the role of the US, Ethiopia's      longstanding international ally to encourage critically-     needed reforms and human rights protections, should not be      underestimated in urging the country toward a new era of      stability.       The undersigned human rights and diaspora groups fully      support the passage of House Resolution 128 for the positive      contribution it can make toward respecting basic human rights      and encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia. The      resolution has strong bipartisan support and more than 100      co-sponsors. In addition, H. Res. 128 has significant      grassroots support among constituents across the US who have      ties to Ethiopia. It calls on the government of Ethiopia to      open up civic space, ensure accountability for human rights      abuses and promote inclusive governance.       For the past three years, Ethiopia has faced largely      peaceful and sustained protests in the Oromia and Amhara      regions of the country. These protests were led by youth      seeking opportunity, political reform and more participatory      development strategies. The government responded with      excessive force. More than a thousand protesters have been      killed by Ethiopian security forces, a greater number      injured, tens of thousands imprisoned and many tortured for      expressing grievances. Over a million, mostly from Oromia,      were uprooted due to government-instigated conflict in the      Eastern part of the country.       However, a combination of forces has accumulated in support      of the protesters--diaspora groups and international human      rights organizations helped publicize the protest movement in      Ethiopia and the government's violent response; the US      Congress rallied behind H. Res. 128; international news      outlets gave frequent coverage of the protests. At     the dawn of this new year, the EPRDF coalition announced      reforms and some changes began to occur. Close to 7000      political prisoners were released in January and February of      2018, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped down within      days, and Dr. Abiy Ahmed, a man with ties to the region most      impacted by the protests, was put forward by the coalition as      Ethiopia's newest prime minister.       In light of these beginnings, now more than ever, it is      imperative that the United States Congress take a stand that      reiterates the need for Ethiopia to take further steps in a      democratic direction by passing H. Res. 128. Ethiopia's      previous transfers of power indicate that leadership change      is often followed by unfulfilled promises, a culling of      opponents and power consolidation. If Prime Minister Abiy is      truly committed to breaking that pattern, this resolution      will encourage Ethiopia to lift the State of Emergency,      ensuring freedoms of expression and assembly and opening up      democratic space, all prerequisites for political and      economic reform.       1) H. Res. 128 is a signal of support for the youth in the      country who have organized to peacefully demand justice and      democracy and have paid a terrible price in terms of loss of      life, injury and arbitrary detention. Accountability for the      human rights violations that have occurred over the last 3      years will be an essential step towards genuine      reconciliation and is a key demand from the protesters.       2) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that could strengthen the      hand of the Prime Minister vis-a-vis less responsive segments      within the EPRDF party coalition structure, requiring      negotiation with the forces that control the country's      security apparatus, intelligence and the economic sectors.       3) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the State      Department and USAID to develop a comprehensive strategy to      support improved democracy and governance in Ethiopia.       4) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the Secretary      of State and Secretary of Treasury to apply appropriate      sanctions on individuals and organizations responsible for      gross human rights.       We support passage of H. Res. 128 as a means to send a      strong, unambiguous signal that the United States Congress      requires concrete reforms. Such reforms are needed to create      a path toward improved respect and protection of human and      civil rights, political stability and sustainable regional      security.       We urge members of the House to pass the resolution.     Amhara Association of America.     Coalition of Oromos for Human Rights and Democracy.     Ethiopian Advocacy Network.

Re Amnesty International USA (``AIUSA'') urges the House to          vote yes on H. Res. 128 which will be on the House floor          on April 10.       Dear Representative: On behalf of AIUSA and our two million      members and supporters nationwide, we are writing to urge you      to vote YES for H. Res. 128, supporting respect for human      rights and encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia.       H. Res. 128 outlines key benchmarks for critically needed      human rights reform in Ethiopia and calls for a review of      U.S. policy toward Ethiopia to prioritize human rights and      good governance.       H. Res. 128 was approved by Voice Vote by the House Foreign      Affairs Committee in July 2017 and has strong bipartisan      support with 108 cosponsors including 29 Republicans and 79      Democrats.       Following highly contested elections in 2005 the Ethiopian      government imposed a web of laws criminalizing any form of      dissent or questioning of government policies. These laws      have empowered authorities to engage in widespread      surveillance, and have resulted in the arrest and detention      of members of civil society.       For the past three years the Ethiopian people have been      subjected to brutal repression by the security forces in      response to protests against the increasingly autocratic rule      of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front      (``EPRDF''). Over 1000 people have been killed since 2015 and      according to the Ethiopian government's own admission, 10,000      people were arrested during the first state of emergency      between 2016 and 2017. Amnesty International believes that      the figure is above 25,000. The current human rights crisis      is the result of years of repression by security forces using      sweeping legislation criminalizing dissent, the arrest of      civil society leaders and journalists, and brutal crackdowns      leading to scores of extrajudicial executions, massacres and      the destruction of property and livelihoods. The Ethiopian      government has created a culture of impunity and a climate of      fear.       Ethiopia is currently under its second State of Emergency      since 2016. Amnesty International has documented unlawful      killings, forced displacement, arbitrary arrests, detentions,      as well as torture and the ill-treatment of detainees.       In the last two months there have been some positive      developments in Ethiopia: a new prime minister has been      appointed, the government released a large number of      political prisoners and closed the notorious Maekelawi Prison      known for torture. However, many more prisoners remain behind      bars. While the country's web of repressive legislation      remains in place and the state of emergency is in effect, all      those individuals who have been released remain at risk of      re-arrest. Indeed, some of them have been re-re-arrested. At      the same time protests are continuing and are being met with      brutal force by government authorities.       H. Res. 128 is a direct appeal to the Ethiopian authorities      to listen to their people, change course, and uphold human      rights and the rule of law.       H. Res. 128 calls on the US Secretary of State to:       Conduct a review of security assistance to Ethiopia to      improve transparency with respect to the purposes of such      assistance to the people of Ethiopia and,       Work with the Administrator of the United States Agency for      International Development, to improve oversight and      accountability of U.S. assistance to Ethiopia, pursuant to      the expectations established in the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-     Saharan Africa.       H. Res. 128 call on the Ethiopian government to lift the      state of emergency and end the use of excessive force by      security forces. The resolution calls the government to      conduct a credible, transparent investigation into human      rights violations committed during the last three years, in      an expedient manner and for those responsible for the      killing, torture, and detention of innocent civilians who      exercised their constitutional rights to be held accountable.       H. Res. 128 call on the Ethiopian government to take steps      to restore the respect and protection of human rights and      enforce accountability as provided under the Ethiopian      Constitution including the       Release dissidents, activists, and journalists who have      been imprisoned; respect freedom of peaceful assembly,      freedom of the press and media;       Repeal of laws that       (i) can be used as a tool to harass or prohibit funding for      civil society organizations that investigate human rights      violations, engage in peaceful political dissent, or advocate      for greater political freedoms.       (ii) prohibit or limit those displaced from their land from      seeking remedy or redress in courts,       (iii) restrict access to justice for displaced persons       (iv) prohibit or otherwise limit peaceful nonprofit      operations in Ethiopia.       H. Res. 128 urges the Ethiopian government to cooperate      with a rapporteur appointed by the United Nations to conduct      an independent examination of the state of human rights in      Ethiopia.       Ethiopia has engaged in a number of ambitious large-scale      development projects that have displaced hundreds of      thousands of villagers. A key trigger of the three years of      protest was the proposed expansion of the capital Addis Ababa      on lands occupied by members of the Oromo community. H. Res.      128 call upon the Ethiopian government to engage in open and      transparent consultations with citizens regarding its      development plans, especially those strategies that could      result in the displacement of people from their land and      address the grievances brought forward by representatives of      registered opposition parties.       Finally, H. Res. 128 reiterates Congress' support for the      people of Ethiopia and their peaceful efforts to exercise the      rights guaranteed by the Ethiopian constitution.       Amnesty International USA urges you to vote YES on H. Res.      128 and for the full House to pass this important resolution.       For more information, please contact me.           Sincerely,                                                     Adotei Akwei,                                         Africa Advocacy Director.
