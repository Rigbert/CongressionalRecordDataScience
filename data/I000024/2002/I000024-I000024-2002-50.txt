President, often when we think of Girl Scouts, we think of those delicious cookies that come to our door every year, delivered by smiling-faced girls. But we may not realize the positive impact Girl Scouts has had on so many women in our society.  Established by Juliette Gordon Low in 1912, Girl Scouts has evolved from a group of 18 girls in Savannah, GA to a national membership of 3.8 million. This week Girl Scouts celebrates its 90th anniversary and I want to recognize these exceptional girls and women who work so hard to become leaders in our society.  Currently, more than 50 million women are Girl Scout alumni, over two-thirds of which are doctors, lawyers, educators, and community leaders. Today, there is even a ``Troop Capitol Hill'' which is made up entirely of congresswomen who are honorary Girl Scouts.  In a time when more positive role models are needed, Girls Scouts often become good citizens and strong leaders through learning self-confidence, responsibility, and the ability to think creatively and act with integrity. They also participate in activities that teach them about science and technology, money management, sports, health and fitness, the arts, global awareness, community service, and much more.  In my State of Oklahoma, the Girl Scouts--Red Lands Council has launched an initiative to serve girls who have special financial and educational needs. This project has allowed many girls to become Girl Scouts who might not have otherwise had the opportunity.  Please join me in recognizing this outstanding organization for its role in giving today's girls a chance to become tomorrow's leaders.
