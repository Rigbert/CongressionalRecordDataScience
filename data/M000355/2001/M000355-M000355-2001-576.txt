 Torricelli, Mrs. Feinstein,         Mr. Allard, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Burns, Mr.         Bennett, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Warner,         Mr. Reid, and Mr. Roberts).  S. 218. A bill to establish an Election Administration Commission to study Federal, State, and local voting procedures and election administration and provide grants to modernize voting procedures and election administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce along with Senators Torricelli, Feinstein, Allard, Smith, Breaux, Burns, Reid, Bennett, Landrie, Santorum, Roberts, Hutchinson, and Warner meaningful, bipartisan legislation to reform the administration of our nation's elections. I ask that the entire text of my statement and the text of the legislation appear in the record.  As we move into the twenty-first century it is inexcusable that the world's most advanced democracy relies on voting systems designed shortly after the Second World War. The goal of our legislation is rather simple: that no American ever again be forced to hear the phrases dimpled chad, hanging chad or pregnant chad. The Election Reform Act will ensure that our nation's electoral process is brought up to twenty-first century standards.  By combining the Federal Election Commission's Election Clearinghouse and the Department of Defenses' Office of Voting Assistance, which facilitates voting by American civilians and servicemen overseas, into the Election Administration Commission, the bill will create one agency that can bring focuses expertise to bear on the administration of elections. This Commission will consist of four Commissioners appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It will continue to carry out the functions of the two entities that are being combined to create it.  In addition, the new Commission will engage in ongoing study and make periodic recommendations on the best practices relating to voting technology and ballot design as well as polling place accessibility for the disabled. The Commission will also study and recommend ways to improve voter registration, verification of registration, and the maintenance and accuracy of voter rolls. This is of special urgency in view of the allegations surfacing in this election of hundreds of felons being listed on voting rolls and illegally voting, as reported in the Miami Herald, while other law abiding citizens who allegedly registered were not included on the voting rolls and were unable to vote. Such revelations from this year's elections coupled with the well-knows report by ``60 Minutes'' of the prevalence of dead people and pets both registering and voting in past elections make clear the need for thoughtful study and recommendations to ensure that everyone who is legally entitled to vote is able to do so and that everyone who votes is legally entitled to do so--and does so only once.  In addition to its studies and recommendations, the Commission will provide matching grants to states working to improve election administration. During the first four years, low-income communities will get priority for these grants and low-income communities are permanently exempted from the requirement to provide matching funds. The legislation also ensure that states comply with the provisions in the Uniformed Overseas Voting Act designed to facilitate voting by members of the armed forces stationed overseas.  Finally, I am pleased also to announce that Representative Tom Davis, along with Representatives Rothman, Dreier, and Hastings are re-introducing the House companion to our bill today.                                 ______
