 President, I rise because a soldier from my home State of Kentucky has fallen. On June 5, 2007, PFC Timothy R. Vimoto was tragically killed while on patrol in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. Private First Class Vimoto, who called the town of Fort Campbell, KY, his home, was 19 years old.  For bravery in service to his country, Private First Class Vimoto received several awards, medals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal.  Private First Class Vimoto's Kentucky story may be more circuitous than most; yet I am proud to stand here and say we both hail from the Bluegrass State. Born in Hawaii, Tim's father is CSM Isaia T. Vimoto. Being from a military family, Tim followed his father to Army postings as a child.  This led Tim to Fort Campbell, KY, home to thousands of our brave soldiers and the 101st Airborne Division. Command Sergeant Major Vimoto was a senior advisor to the commander of the 101st. Tim attended Fort Campbell High School, where he made many friends and was part of the school's football team.  ``Tim was known throughout the school as the kid with the biggest and best smile,'' says Shawn Berner, Tim's high school football coach. ``He was always smiling and willing to help anyone in the school. . . . He was a very caring and generous person that touched a lot of people's lives in a positive manner.''  ``He's one of our babies,'' says Kesha Ladd, one of Tim's old teachers at Fort Campbell High. ``When you teach on post, it's like you help raise these children when their parents are deployed.''  ``Tim was liked by everyone,'' Shawn Berner adds.  After graduating high school in 2006, Tim chose to follow in his father's footsteps and enlist in the Army.  He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, based in Camp Ederle, Italy. In fact, he was at the same posting as his father at that time, and as Isaia Vimoto was the brigade's most senior enlisted soldier, Tim actually fell under his command.  Fellow soldiers remembered the influence Tim's father had on him and how it shaped him into the model soldier he became.  ``He saw the transformation from being a son to being a soldier,'' says SGT Andy Short. And ``no matter what Vimoto was doing, he had a smile on his face.''  ``Throughout his childhood, [Tim] watched his father train, deploy, re-deploy and develop into one of the strongest leaders in the Army,'' says another fellow soldier, CPT Matthew Heimerle.  Command Sergeant Major Vimoto himself, currently stationed in Italy, says his son was ``a very talented young man with lots of potential.''  Tim's family and fellow soldiers held a memorial service for him in Italy, and hundreds of friends who wanted to say goodbye packed the chapel. We are thinking today of all those who mourn his loss.  Our thoughts are with his parents, Isaia and Misimua Vimoto; his brothers, Isaia Jr. and Nephi; his sisters, Sabrina and Ariel; and many other loved ones.  Mr. President, the Vimoto family's loss of their beloved son and brother--while serving alongside the father who raised and inspired him, no less--cannot be measured. But neither can this U.S. Senate's immense pride and reverence for his service and his sacrifice.  Our Nation honors him as a soldier and a patriot. And we thank the Vimoto family for giving their country such a hero.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
