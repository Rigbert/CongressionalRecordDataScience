 President, I happen to be the original author of section 45, renewable fuels.  I have extended this provision already through 2008. The amendment will undermine the reconciliation bill by going beyond our 5-year budget window, and the amendment is no longer paid for.  So, regrettably, I oppose this specific amendment. But as the author of section 45, you can be assured that when it is necessary to extend it, we will. I ask you to vote against this amendment.
