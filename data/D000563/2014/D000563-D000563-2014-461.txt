President, in the history of the United States of America, we estimate some 500 million people have lived in this great Nation--60 percent of them as of today. But in the history of America, with 500 million people, only 1,950 men and women have been given the opportunity to serve in the Senate, including the Presiding Officer, our newest Senator, from the State of Montana. So 1,950 men and women who have occupied this Chamber in the previous Senate, becoming part of the history of this Nation and contributing to this great institution. I have been fortunate enough to have served with some of the greatest, and I have noted their presence, their impact, and I have noticed their absence too.  When we take stock of the Senate and what it has done for America, what it means to America, it goes way beyond the men and women who occupy these desks. It includes a lot of people who make a contribution to this institution who may never be recognized for it, but, nevertheless, make this the great institution it is, serving this great Nation. Today we honor two of those people.                       Tribute To Daryl Chappelle  First I wish to join in honoring Daryl Chappelle. Daryl, thank you so much for 41 years of service in the Senate. His legendary smile has warmed my spirits on days when I was really down in the dumps. He always had that happy smile, wishing me well. He was always making a person's day a little bit better. Daryl, I want to thank you. Time and time again, I am sure even on days when you weren't so up, you made a point of adding to a positive feeling for everyone--not just Senators and staff but visitors as well. You have been a great part of our Senate family. I wish you the very best in your retirement. We are going to miss you on that rickety old train that runs back and forth between the Russell Building and the Capitol. I wish you the very best.                        Tribute To Terry Gainer
