 Speaker, enclosed is a copy of a speech by Micah Genzlinger, a senior at South Burlington High School in Vermont. Micah is the Vermont winner of the VFW's Voice of Democracy broadcast scriptwriting contest. His speech reflects a passion for democracy of which I am proud. I am inserting his speech in the Congressional Record as I believe it will benefit my colleagues.                      Democracy--Above and Beyond                         (By Micah Genzlinger)       If I may, I would like to briefly tell you a little about      my life. When I was born, my parents had the freedom to give      me any name they wanted. They had the freedom to teach me      what they thought was important. They had the freedom to show      me what they thought I should see. They had the freedom to      choose what kind of school I should attend. The freedom to      bring me up in a family where they see the values, shared      their belief in God, and taught what they considered right      and wrong.       As the decisions became mine, I could choose who I was      friends with, what types of music to listen to, what kinds of      clothes to wear, what sports to participate in, and many      other things. Soon I will be making bigger decisions: who to      vote for in the elections, what college to attend, what I      should do with the rest of my life, what religion I should      study, and more. I am even free to disagree with what my      parents taught me.       You may wonder why I told you about my life. Well, I did it      for one reason only, to show you how good we have it in a      democracy. Some don't believe we are any better off, but only      in a democracy do you have the freedom to say what is on your      mind and to express your inner-self without fear of      punishment from the government. We have the freedom to choose      our jobs and to choose what cities to live in. We also have      the freedom to decide how we are going to live; whether that      be in an apartment or in a house.       Some say the government is holding us down. I ask those      people to look around the world. To look at the countries      that decide what its youth will do with their lives without      having any say, or look at the countries that kill people for      speaking out against the government. Look at countries that      limit the number of children a single family can have. Then      try to tell me that we are worse off living in a democracy.       I think my generation has become used to the fact that we      have so much freedom and does not understand the true value      of our democracy. When I watch the news on television I see      the scenes from Bosnia or the Middle East, I am reminded that      we have a very special freedom. When I look back in history      at the walls constructed in Germany, I can't even imagine      what it was like living in fear of being jailed for doing      nothing wrong, or not even being able to see any of my family      members because they were on the other side of the wall. Most      of all I can't even imagine what it would be like not being      free.       Our country is not perfect. We have poverty, unemployment,      crime and many other problems. But we have the most important      things: a democratic country that allows us to make our own      decisions, to live the way we want to live, to work at the      job we want to do, to raise as many children as we feel we      should have, and so much more. But most of all we can be      free.                          ____________________
