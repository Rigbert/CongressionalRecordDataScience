 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Let me begin by doing something that I very rarely do, and that is concur with the remarks of my friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon). We should not be naive and not understand that the largest banks in this country have done everything that they could to prevent the passage of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of H.R. 1151, I am proud to be on the floor to offer my strong support for this legislation and for its passage today. At a time of increasing bank fees, increasing ATM fees, increasing credit card fees, increasing minimum balance requirements, and the loss of many locally-owned banks to large multi-billion-dollar corporate institutions, credit unions today are more important than they have ever been.  H.R. 1151 will go a long way toward ensuring the long-term viability of credit unions, of allowing credit unions to expand rather than to contract and wither away, which is clearly the goal of many large banks.  Mr. Speaker, I make no apologies for being a strong supporter of credit unions. I want to see credit unions grow. Because they are good for the State of Vermont, and they are good for America. Congress chartered credit unions not only to help people of modest means but to give ordinary Americans a not-for-profit cooperative alternative to for-profit banks.  If we do not act today, the Supreme Court decision would be extremely harmful to tens of thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans. Let us pass this legislation.
