 On Monday the House will meet in pro forma session at 2 p.m. On Tuesday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and at 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday no votes are expected at this time.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A final list of suspension bills will be announced, as is the custom, by the close of business tomorrow. We expect to consider the Iraq/Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill. In addition, we also hope to consider the farm bill conference report. And it is possible, if the budget conference were completed, that we might consider that as well.
