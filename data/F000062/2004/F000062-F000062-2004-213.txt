 President, I rise today to support the resolution submitted by Senator Dodd to express our condolences to the families of the victims of today's Madrid bombings and our strong solidarity with the Spanish people in the fight against terror. This is a sad and tragic day.  This morning, nearly 200 innocent people were killed and 1,000 injured when 10 near-simultaneous explosions hit 3 separate trains at the height of the city's rush hour.  Spanish police found and detonated 3 other bombs. One official described it as the worst terrorist attack in Spain's history.  I condemn in the strongest possible terms this vicious and bloody terrorist attack.  The Madrid bombings appear to be part of an ongoing terror campaign by the Basque separatist group ETA, a group designated by the United States and the European Union as a terrorist organization.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.  Americans know all too well the pain and destruction caused by terror and we stand shoulder to shoulder with our Spanish friends at this difficult hour just as they stood with us on September 11.  We two peoples share the values of democracy, freedom, and respect for human rights. We have worked and we will continue to work together in the fight against terror and in bringing those responsible for this brutal attack to justice. Terrorists must know that we will not back down in the face of their crimes.  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.                          ____________________
