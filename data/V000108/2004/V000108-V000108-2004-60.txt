Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend seven dedicated teachers from Northwest Indiana who have been voted outstanding educators by their peers for the 2003-2004 school year. These individuals, Yvonne Stoll, Laura Cullen, Jeremy Walker, Sandra Sidock, David Markley, Linda Scheffer, and Valerie Giacomin will be presented with the Crystal Apple Award at a reception sponsored by the Indiana State Teachers Association. This prestigious event will take place at the Andorra Restaurant and Banquets in Schererville, Indiana, on Tuesday, May 4, 2004.  Yvonne Stoll, from the North Newton School Corporation, has been a role model, an inspiration to her students, and an outstanding professional for more than 30 years. Yvonne, a dedicated kindergarten school teacher, knows the importance of developing creative thinking skills in her students. In addition to Yvonne's teaching abilities, she has made tireless efforts to further the education of kindergarten students through her active participation in organizations such as: the Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, the Reading Council, and NNEA/ISTA/NEA.  Laura Cullen has been teaching kindergarten in the Hanover Community School Corporation for nearly 20 years. She is a loyal and enthusiastic person who has a passion to teach her kindergarten students. Laura's students graduate from her class with strong reading and writing skills which provide a solid foundation for a lifetime of learning. She is actively involved in the Jane Ball Literacy for Life Team, Grade Level Chairperson at Jane Ball Elementary, Teacher Assistance Team, Climate Committee, and the Public Law 221 Committee.  Jeremy Walker is known for his ability to connect with students in a way few other teachers are able to duplicate. Jeremy teaches Latin in the Crown Point Community School Corporation and is an integral person in his school's Latin program. A testament to Jeremy's teaching abilities, his students recently won the Indiana State Sweepstakes, establishing his Latin club as the best in Indiana. Jeremy truly has an outstanding teaching ability, while his dedication to his profession and to his students is equally outstanding.  Sandra Sidock has 30 years of experience in teaching and tutoring students in mathematics. At the Lake Central School Corporation, Sandra instilled in her students the skills needed to be successful at the next level. Although many students benefited from Sandra's knowledge, the students who needed extra assistance could always rely on her. Sandra incorporates the Legos, Cuisenaire Rods, and other techniques into her teaching curriculum to benefit the students who need extra guidance.  David Markley has taught music for seven years at Highland High School. The love and passion David has for music, both personally and professionally, is demonstrated through the creativity and enthusiasm that he projects. He not only inspires his students, but also the teachers at Highland High School, the parishioners of Gloria Dei Lutheran Church, and many others in Northwest Indiana.  Linda Scheffer has been nurturing young minds at Munster High School for the past 32 years. Her enthusiasm for the subject matter, as well as her teaching style, has withstood the test of time. Linda makes learning an enjoyable experience, for she blends her creative spirit and her willingness to experiment with new ideas and techniques to better foment home economic concepts in the minds of her students. Linda's compassion for others is exhibited by her thoughtfulness towards both students and teachers.  Valerie Giacomin has been a great asset to the Tri-Creek School Corporation throughout her years of teaching. She is conscientious about having her students meet the standards expected of them. Valerie's strong work ethic as a teacher allows her to make an extraordinary effort to provide the best possible education for her students. Valerie is a continuous source of strength and enthusiasm for her students, parents, and colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding educators on their receipt of the 2003-2004 Crystal Apple Award. The years of hard work they have put forth in shaping the minds and futures of Northwest Indiana's young people is a true inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
