Speaker, I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 79.   Mr. Speaker, what is proposed here today is not unprecedented. We are proposing to overturn a Supreme Court decision which is wrong, just as wrong as the Dredd Scott decision which provoked the 13th, 14h and 15th amendments to be proposed by Congress, just as wrong as the Supreme Court's decision invalidating the income tax which resulted in a constitutional amendment, and just as wrong as the Supreme Court's decision in the first decade under our Constitution on court jurisdiction that provoked the 11th amendment to be ratified by the States after being proposed by the Congress.  So the question before us here today is whether or not you agree with the 5-to-4 majority of the Supreme Court that flag burning is protected free speech. If you think it is protected free speech, go ahead and vote no on this constitutional amendment. If you object to the Supreme Court's decision, vote aye, and you are not setting a new precedent, because that has been done at least five times in the history of this country, when Congress and the States have flat out said those judges over there are wrong. They are wrong this time, and we ought to pass this amendment and send it to the States for ratification.
