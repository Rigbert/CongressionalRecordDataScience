President, today I honor the distinguished career of John L. Kirkwood and to congratulate him on his upcoming retirement. John Kirkwood is the current president and chief executive officer of the American Lung Association.  Mr. Kirkwood graduated from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. Since then, his life has been dedicated to improving the health of our country.  Mr. Kirkwood served as executive director of the American Lung Association of Metropolitan Chicago from 1975 to 2001. During his tenure, he was instrumental in organizing the American Lung Association Asthma Clinical Research Network, the International Tuberculosis Foundation, the Illinois Coalition against Tobacco, the Chicago Asthma Consortium and the Combined Health Appeal of Illinois. His efforts have made it possible for more Illinoisans in the Chicago metropolitan area to breathe better today.  Luckily for the rest of the country, Mr. Kirkwood decided to expand his commitment beyond the Chicago area to improving the health of the entire Nation. As president and CEO of the American Lung Association, Mr. Kirkwood has expanded the ALA's commitment to research nationwide, strengthened the organization's advocacy programs, and improved knowledge and information transfer systems to assist patients suffering from lung disease.  As the leader of America's oldest national voluntary health organization, Mr. Kirkwood has shown an exemplary commitment to the health and social well-being of all Americans. Thanks to his work and his heartfelt dedication to the public's health, individuals in my State of Illinois and the Nation as a whole will breathe cleaner air and lead healthier, happier lives. We are fortunate for his years of dedication to the American Lung Association, and his leadership will be deeply missed.  Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Kirkwood on his many accomplishments throughout a long and successful career. As he concludes this chapter of his professional life, I wish him many more years of happiness and accomplishment.                          ____________________
