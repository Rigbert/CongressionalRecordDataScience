 That bill has a bipartisan group of 30 cosponsors. It is called the Due Process Guarantee Act, and the co-sponsors include five Republicans: Senators Lee, Paul, Collins, Kirk, and Moran. Thanks to Chairman Leahy, the bill had a hearing earlier this year in the Judiciary Committee, as the Presiding Officer will so note, on February 29, 2012.  The amendment I will offer clarifies questions that arose during last year's defense authorization bill about the U.S. Government's power to detain its citizens indefinitely. Last year's bill had detention provisions in it that never had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, the Intelligence Committee, or the Armed Services Committee.  Let me just take a minute to describe why this is such an important issue for me.  When I was a very young girl--I remember it was a Sunday because my father worked every other day of the week--my father took me down to a racetrack just south of San Franciscocalled Tanforan. It was the beginning of World War II. The racetrack was then a staging point for Japanese Americans en route to more permanent detention centers.  Here is the edict that was put out:       Western Defense Command and Fourth Army Wartime Civil      Control Administration, Presidio of San Francisco,      California, April 1, 1942, Instructions to All Persons of      Japanese Ancestry, Living in the Following Area:  Then it describes the area. It says:       All Japanese persons, both alien and non-alien, will be      evacuated from the above designated area by 12:00 o'clock      noon Tuesday, April 7, 1942.       No Japanese person will be permitted to enter or leave the above described area after 8:00 a.m., Thursday, April 2, 1942, without obtaining special permission from the Provost Marshal of the Civil Control Station.  This was an order which remanded all persons of Japanese ancestry into custody for the duration of World War II.  Let me show you a little of what these facilities looked like. Shown in this picture I have in the Chamber is Tanforan Racetrack, and these are the barracks that were put up to house Japanese-American citizens and non-citizens--only because they were of Japanese ancestry.  In this next picture, this is what it looked like close up. This is a young person walking out of this small cell in that barrack.  In this next picture, these are Japanese Americans standing in line--and here is the racetrack--either to get food or for some other reason.  This stuck in my memory, and I believe it was a stain on the greatness of this country. As I saw the barbed wire, these men, women, and children housed in horse stables, in small buildings, as you can see, it was an experience I will never forget.  To ensure that this shameful experience was never repeated, almost 30 years after the 1942 evacuation order was issued, Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law the Non-Detention Act of 1971, which repealed a 1950 statute that explicitly allowed detention of U.S. citizens without charge or trial.  The Non-Detention Act of 1971 clearly states:       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the      United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.  Despite this history, during last year's debate on the Defense authorization bill some in this body advocated for the indefinite detention of American citizens. This is an issue that has been the subject of much legal controversy since 9/11.  Proponents of indefinitely detaining citizens apprehended in the U.S. argue that the Authorization for Use of Military Force--what we call the AUMF--that was enacted in the wake of 9/11 is ``an act of Congress,'' in the language of the Non-Detention Act, that authorizes the indefinite detention of American citizens regardless of where they are captured.  They further assert that their position is justified by the U.S. Supreme Court's plurality decision in the 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. However, that position is undercut by the 2003 case of Padilla v. Rumsfeld in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. So we have a kind of muddle.  But let me discuss the facts of the Hamdi case because it is important to note that Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen who took up arms on behalf of the Taliban and was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan. The Supreme Court effectively did uphold his military detention, so some of my colleagues seize upon this to say that the military can today indefinitely detain even U.S. citizens who are arrested domestically.  However, the Supreme Court's opinion in that case was a decision by a 4-to-4 plurality that recognized the power of the government to detain U.S. citizens captured abroad as ``enemy combatants'' for some period, but otherwise repudiated the government's broad assertions of executive authority to detain citizens without charge or trial.  To the extent the Hamdi case permits the government to detain a U.S. citizen ``until the end of hostilities,'' it does so only under a very limited set of circumstances; namely, citizens taking an active part in hostilities who are captured in Afghanistan and who are afforded certain due process protections, at a minimum.  Additionally, decisions by the lower courts have contributed to the current state of ambiguity. For example, consider those decisions involving Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in Chicago. He was initially detained pursuant to a material witness warrant based on the 9/11 terrorist acts.  In Padilla, the Second Circuit held that AUMF did not authorize his detention, saying:       We conclude that clear congressional authorization is      required for detentions of American citizens on American soil      because . . . the Non-Detention Act . . . prohibits such      detentions absent specific congressional authorization.  The Second Circuit went on to say that the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force--and I quote--``is not such an authorization, and no exception to [the Non-Detention Act] otherwise exists.''  So here is the problem. We have the Supreme Court that says one thing in a limited way and a federal appeals court that says another thing on an issue not directly addressed by the Supreme Court. When we debated this issue on the Senate floor last year, the Senate ultimately agreed to a compromise amendment which passed by an overwhelming 99-to-1 vote. I worked on that with Senators Lee, Paul, Levin, McCain, Durbin, Leahy, and the amendment provided the following:       Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect      existing law or authorities relating to the detention of      United States citizens, or lawful resident aliens of the      United States, or any other persons who are captured or      arrested in the United States.  Now, that was adopted to say, leave things as they are right now. It preserved the current state of the law, continuing to leave it to the courts to resolve who is right about whether the AUMF authorizes the military detention of anyone apprehended domestically.  I believe strongly the time has come now to end this legal ambiguity and to state clearly once and for all that the AUMF or other authorities do not authorize such indefinite detention of Americans apprehended in the United States.  To accomplish this, we are offering an amendment which affirms the continuing application of the principles behind the Non-Detention Act of 1971. It amends that act to provide clearly that no military authorization allows indefinite detention of U.S. citizens or green card holders who are apprehended inside the United States.  The amendment states, ``An authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the United States unless an Act of Congress expressly authorizes such detention.''  That affirms the Second Circuit's clear statement rule from the Padilla case. Some may ask why this amendment protects green card holders as well as citizens. Others may ask why the amendment does not protect all persons apprehended in the United States from indefinite detention? Let me be clear. I would support providing the protections in this amendment to all persons in the United States whether lawfully or unlawfully present.  But the question is, Is there enough support in this body to expand this amendment to cover others besides U.S. citizens and green card holders? I do not believe there is. We got 45 votes last year on a similar amendment protecting U.S. citizens. We have re-worked the amendment and gained more support this year, as reflected in the co-sponsors we have today. So my hope is that at least we can clear up the law with strong protections for citizens and legal permanent residents.  Wherever we draw the line on who should be covered by this legislation, I believe it violates fundamental American rights to allow anyone apprehended in the United States to be detained without charge or trial. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have proven time and time again they are up to the challenge of detecting, stopping, arresting, and convicting terrorists found on U.S. soil, having successfully arrested, detained, and convicted hundreds of these heinous people, both before and after 9/11.  For example, since January 2009, 98 individuals have been successfully arrested inside the United States by theFBI and other Federal or local law enforcement officers on terrorism-related charges. Last month, the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee compiled a list of the individuals arrested in the past 4 years as part of more than 50 different terrorism investigations. The list was based on publicly available information from the FBI, the Congressional Research Service, and media reports. I have it here and I ask unanimous consent to have the list printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Terrorist Arrests and Plots Stopped in the United States 2009-2012  (Compiled by Senate Intelligence Committee staff based on publicly available information from the FBI, the Congressional Research Service,                            and media reports)       (1) Ralph Deleon, (2) Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales      (Santana), (3) Arifeen David Gojali--Conspiracy to Provide      Material Support to Terrorism--November 2012.       On Friday, November 16, 2012, the FBI arrested Deleon,      Santana, and Gojali who were planning to travel to      Afghanistan to attend terrorist training and commit violent      jihad. Deleon, of Ontario, California, is a lawful permanent      resident alien, born in the Philippines. Santana, of Upland,      California, is a lawful permanent resident, born in Mexico,      and whose application for citizenship is pending in the U.S.      Gojali, of Riverside, California, is a United States citizen.      According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District      Court in the Central District of California, the defendants      conspired to provide material support to terrorists knowing      or intending that such support was to be used in preparation      for or in carrying out: conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim, or      injure persons and damage property in a foreign country;      killing and attempting to kill officers and employees of the      United States; killing nationals of the United States;      conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction outside the      United States; and bombing places of public use and      government facilities. The complaint further alleges that      Santana, Deleon, and Gojali conducted preliminary training in      southern California at firearms and paintball facilities to      prepare for terrorist training overseas.       (4) Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis--Plot to Bomb New      York Federal Reserve Bank--October 2012.       On October 17, 2012, the FBI arrested Ahsan Nafis, a      Bangladeshi national, as he attempted to detonate what he      believed to be a 1,000-pound bomb at the New York Federal      Reserve Bank in lower Manhattan's financial district. The      defendant faces charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass      destruction and attempting to provide material support to Al      Qaeda. According to an FBI press release, the accused,      ``traveled to the United States in January 2012 for the      purpose of conducting a terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Nafis,      who reported having overseas connections to Al Qaeda,      attempted to recruit individuals to form a terrorist cell      inside the United States. Nafis also actively sought out Al      Qaeda contacts within the United States to assist him in      carrying out an attack.''       (5) Adel Daoud--Plot to Bomb Downtown Chicago Bar--     September 2012.       On Friday September 14, 2012, Adel Daoud attempted to      detonate what he believed to be a car bomb outside a bar in      downtown Chicago. Daoud, a U.S. citizen, was arrested as part      of an ongoing FBI counterterrorism operation after he was      discovered on the Internet seeking information on how to      conduct terrorist attacks. According to an FBI press release,      ``In about May 2012, two FBI online undercover employees      contacted Daoud in response to material Daoud posted online      and thereafter exchanged several electronic communications      with Daoud. According to the affidavit, during these      communications Daoud expressed an interest in engaging in      violent jihad, either in the United States or overseas.''       (6) Douglas L. Wright, (7) Brandon L. Baxter, (8) Anthony      Hayne, (9) Connor C. Stevens, and (10) Joshua S. Stafford--     Plot to Bomb Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge in      Ohio--May 2012.       These five men were arrested on May 1, 2012 after they      attempted to detonate an explosive device set on the      Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge in Ohio that was      given to them by an undercover FBI agent. The accused men are      self-proclaimed anarchists who considered carrying out a      series of attacks, but ultimately decided to target the      bridge in Ohio after an initial plot to use smoke grenades to      distract law enforcement in order for co-conspirators to      topple financial institution signs atop high rise buildings      in downtown Cleveland failed to materialize. ``The defendants      conspired to obtain C-4 explosives contained in two      improvised explosive devices to be placed and remotely      detonated,'' according to the complaint.       (11) Bakhtiyor Jumaev and (12) Jamshid Muhtorov--Conspiracy      to Provide Material Support to the Islamic Jihad Union      (IJU)--March 2012.       On March 15, 2012, the FBI arrested Bakhtiyor Jumaev who      was charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material      support to the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU). The FBI had been      conducting an investigation into the activities of Jumaev and      his associate, Jamshid Muhtorov, who was arrested in January      2012 on similar charges. Jumaev and Muhtorov had pledged      support for the IJU and Jumaev sent funds to Muhtorov,      specifically intended for the IJU. The U.S. Government has      designated the IJU as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.       (13) Amine El Khalifi--Plot to carry out a Suicide Bomb      Attack against the U.S. Capitol--February 2012.       Amine El Khalifi, an illegal immigrant from Morocco, was      arrested on February 17, 2012 for attempting to detonate a      bomb in what was envisioned to be a suicide attack against      the U.S. Capitol Building. According to an FBI press release,      ``El Khalifi allegedly traveled to a parking garage near the      U.S. Capitol building. El Khalifi took possession of a MAC-10      automatic weapon and put on a vest containing what he      believed to be a functioning bomb. Unbeknownst to El Khalifi,      both the weapon and the bomb had been rendered inoperable by      law enforcement. El Khalifi walked alone from the vehicle      toward the United States Capitol, where he intended to shoot      people and detonate the bomb. El Khalifi was arrested and      taken into custody before exiting the parking garage.'' The      FBI made initial contact with Khalifi in January 2011. Over      the course of the year he cited his anger over the ``war on      terrorism'' and the ``war on Muslims'' as his rationale      behind planned attacks against a military installation and a      restaurant in Washington D.C. After acquiring and testing      dummy explosives given to him by FBI affiliates, Khalifi      modified his plans to conduct a suicide attack against the      U.S. Capitol.       (14) Sami Osmakac--Plot to Bomb Locations in Tampa,      Florida--January 2012.       On January 7, 2012, the FBI arrested Sami Osmakac, a      naturalized U.S. citizen born in the former Yugoslavia      (Kosovo) on one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass      destruction. The FBI used a sting operation to apprehend      Osmakac who was 25 years old at the time of his arrest.      According to FBI investigators, in September 2011, an FBI      source reported that Osmakac and another person had asked for      Al Qaeda flags at the source's business. The source continued      to interact with Osmakac and report to the FBI about his      activities. Osmakac allegedly expressed interest in      obtaining firearms and explosives for attacks he was      planning in the Tampa area, and the source introduced him      to an FBI undercover employee reputed to have access to      such materials. The undercover employee supplied Osmakac      with hand grenades, an assault rifle, a pistol, a car      bomb, and an explosive belt. Osmakac was unaware that the      items actually did not work. In the course of his plotting      Osmakac purportedly discussed targets such as ``night      clubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the Operations      Center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office in Ybor      City, and a business in the South Tampa,'' according to a      DOJ press release. Muslims in Tampa reportedly aided the      FBI in its investigation. Osmakac purportedly exhibited      extremist views prompting at least one local Muslim to      tell authorities about him.       (15) Jose Pimentel--Plot to Bomb New York City Targets and      Troops Returning from Combat Overseas--November 2011.       On November 19, 2011, New York City police arrested a      convert to Islam named Jose Pimentel on terrorism charges.      According to New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W.      Kelly, Pimentel purportedly discussed killing U.S. military      personnel returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, in      conjunction with bombing post offices in and around      Washington Heights and police cars in New York City, as well      as a police station in Bayonne, N.J. The alleged would-be      bomber was building explosive devices when he was arrested      after two years of surveillance by the New York City Police      Department (NYPD). Pimentel reportedly discussed his plans      with an individual he did not know was an NYPD criminal      informant. Pimentel sympathized with Al Qaeda and drew      inspiration from now-deceased radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.      The alleged would-be bomber purportedly tried but failed to      correspond with Awlaki via e-mail, and the cleric's death may      have sped up Pimentel's plotting. According to the criminal      complaint filed in the case, the NYPD tracked Pimentel's      internet activity, finding that Pimentel had posted online      pro-Al Qaeda material as well as an article detailing how to      make a bomb from Inspire Magazine. Working in the apartment      of an NYPD criminal informant, Pimentel supposedly followed      Inspire's bomb making instructions, scraping match heads,      collecting the incendiary material, as well as drilling holes      in three pipes, among other steps.       (16) Mansour Arbabsiar--Plot to Assassinate the Saudi      Ambassador to the United States--October 2011.       Mansour Arbabsiar was arrested after he approached a DEA      informant, who he believed was a member of Los Zetas, to hire      the cartel to carry out a terrorist attack against the Saudi      ambassador at a restaurant in Washington. Mr. Arbabsiar had      many connections to Iran's military and the Qods Force.       (17) Rezwan Ferdaus--Plot to Attack U.S. Capitol and      Pentagon--September 2011.       On September 28, Rezwan Ferdaus, a U.S. citizen from      Ashland, MA, was arrested on terrorism charges. He allegedly      plotted to attack the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol with      explosives-laden remote-controlled airplanes. According to      DOJ, he also planned a ground assault in conjunction with his      aerial     attack, intending to use firearms and to involve six      conspirators in this phase of his plot. Ferdaus also      purportedly attempted to provide Al Qaeda with modified cell      phones he believed would be used as detonators for improvised      explosive devices intended to harm U.S. soldiers abroad. As      described by DOJ, FBI undercover employees acting as members      of Al Qaeda supplied Ferdaus with money, fake explosives for      the airplanes, firearms, and hand grenades. In turn, (among      other things) Ferdaus provided the cell phone detonators to      these phony Al Qaeda recruiters as well as a training video      on how to construct them. Ferdaus supposedly began plotting      in 2010. In January 2011, he discussed his plans with an FBI      informant. In May 2011, he visited the Washington, DC, area      to conduct surveillance of his targets and view the site from      which he intended to launch his remote-controlled airplanes.      According to the FBI, Ferdaus believed that one of his      airplanes could collapse the Capitol dome.       (18) Agron Hasbajrami--Plot to Fight in Pakistan--September      2011.       On September 6, 2011, Agron Hasbajrami was arrested at John      F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City as he tried      to board a flight to Turkey. Hasbajrami allegedly planned to      join a jihadist fighting group in the Federally Administered      Tribal Areas of Pakistan. He also purportedly sent more than      $1,000 to Pakistan to support the efforts of a militant with      whom he communicated.       (19) Naser Abdo--Plot to Attack Targets Near Fort Hood--     July 2011.       On July 27, 2011, U.S. Army Private Naser Abdo was arrested      near Fort Hood in Texas for allegedly plotting a shooting      spree and bombing in the area--near the same place where Army      Major Nidal Hasan reportedly killed 13 individuals in 2009.      Abdo, described in the media as a Muslim soldier in the 101st      Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY, was supposedly absent      without leave from the Army after applying for conscientious      objector status. A November 2011 superseding indictment      charged Abdo with one count of attempted use of a weapon of      mass destruction, one count of attempted murder of officers      or employees of the United States, two counts of possession      of a firearm in furtherance of a federal crime of violence,      and two counts of possession of a destructive device in      furtherance of a federal crime of violence. Abdo allegedly      purchased gunpowder, shotgun ammunition, and a magazine for a      semi-automatic pistol at a gun store near Fort Hood. An      employee at the gun store supposedly brought Abdo to the      attention of law enforcement officers. Federal officials have      noted that Abdo also possessed a .40 caliber handgun, bomb      making materials, and an article on how to construct an      explosive device, among other items. The article was from      Inspire, an English-language magazine produced by Al Qaeda in      the Arabian Peninsula.       (20) Ulugbek Kodirov--Plot to Assassinate President Obama--     July 2011.       Ulugbek Kodirov, an Uzbek living in Alabama, was arrested      when he sought assistance to kill President Obama either by      shooting him or using explosives. The affidavit said that the      source whom Kodirov contacted for help told authorities that      Kodirov supported Islamic extremists and regularly viewed      jihadist websites.       (21) Emerson Begolly--Plot to Encourage Jihadist Acts in      the United States--July 2011.       On July 14, 2011, Emerson Begolly, a U.S. citizen from New      Bethlehem, PA, was indicted for attempting to encourage      jihadists to commit acts of terrorism within the United      States and distributing information related to explosives      online. In August 2011, he pleaded guilty to ``soliciting      others to engage in acts of terrorism within the United      States and to using a firearm during and in relation to an      assault on FBI agents.'' According to DOJ, Begolly posted      ``links to a 101-page document that contain[ed] information      on how to set up a laboratory, conduct basic chemistry, and      manufacture explosives.''       (22) Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif and (23) Walli Mujahidh--Plot      to Attack Seattle Military Processing Center--June 2011       On June 22, 2011, Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif and Walli      Mujahidh, were arrested on terrorism and firearms charges for      plotting to attack a Seattle military processing center. An      FBI sting operation apprehended the two as they took      possession of machine guns they had purchased for the plot.      The firearms had been rendered inert as part of the sting      operation. Assistant Attorney General for National Security      Todd Hinnen described the plot as, ``driven by a violent,      extreme ideology.'' While the two reportedly had not worked      out all of the details of their plot, they allegedly were      frustrated by ``American war policies'' and hoped for an      attack that would garner wide attention.       (24) Yonathan Melaku--Plot to Shoot Targets in Washington,      DC, Area--June 2011       On June 23, 2011, DOJ announced that Yonathan Melaku, an      Ethiopian native living in Alexandria, VA, was charged with      destruction of property and firearm violations. These charges      stemmed from five shootings at military installations in      Northern Virginia between October and November 2010. No one      was harmed in the shootings. It is unclear to what extent      Melaku, a Marine Corps reservist, was driven by jihadist      motivations; however, investigators linked Melaku to a spiral      notebook with numerous Arabic statements referencing the      Taliban, Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, ``The Path to Jihad,'' as      well as a list of several other individuals associated with      foreign terrorist organizations. Law enforcement officials      also found a video when they searched Melaku's bedroom. It      reportedly depicted ``Melaku in an automobile driving near      what appears to be the U.S. Marine Corps Heritage Museum and      repeatedly firing a handgun out the passenger-side window.''      In the video, he allegedly states, ``that's my target. That's      the military building. It's going to be attacked,'' and then      he shouts, ``Allah Akbar.''       (25) Waad Ramadan Alwan and (26) Mohanad Shareef Hammadi--     Material Support to Al Qaeda in Iraq--May 2011       Alwan and Hammadi were arrested on May 25, 2011 in Kentucky      on charges to commit conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals abroad      and provide material support, including weapons, to Al Qaeda      in Iraq among other charges.       (27) Ahmed Ferhani and (28) Mohamed Mamdouh--Plot to Attack      New York City Targets--May 2011       On May 12, 2011, Ahmed Ferhani (an Algerian native living      in Queens, NY) and Mohamed Mamdouh (a naturalized U.S.      citizen from Morocco) were arrested for plotting to blow up a      synagogue as well as churches in New York City. However, the      duo had not chosen a specific target. New York City officials      alleged that Ferhani was driven by a hatred of Jews and a      belief that Muslims are mistreated the world over. He and      Mamdouh allegedly had purchased firearms and a hand grenade      from an undercover detective posing as a gun dealer.       (29) Joseph Jeffrey Brice--Testing Explosives and Proving      Material Support to Terrorists--May 2011       Joseph Jeffrey Brice was arrested on charges of      manufacturing an unregistered firearm and later an additional      charge of providing material support for terrorism. Police      began to take an interest in Mr. Brice after he was seriously      injured in April 2010 while testing a homemade bomb.      Investigators discovered videos Brice posted that depicted      suicide bombings in Pakistan and links to a terrorism      magazine with instructions on how to make explosives. He also      posted bomb making videos to YouTube under the name      ``StrengthofAllah.'' Mr. Brice also plotted with an      unidentified man to rob a Zions First National bank in Idaho      although the plot was never acted upon. Authorities believe      Brice was not a Muslim; rather, he assumed a Muslim identity      online in order to sell his bomb-making expertise.
