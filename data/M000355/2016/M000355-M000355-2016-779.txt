 President, here is the headline too many Kentuckians had to wake up to this morning: ``Health insurance rate hike requests average 17 percent in [my home State].''  The story noted that these double-digit premium increases continue a national trend of hefty hikes as insurers adapt to a market reshaped by President Obama's signature health care law--in other words, more unaffordable premium increases, thanks to ObamaCare.  It was unfortunate to hear some of ObamaCare's defenders try to pretend otherwise and blame these rates on something like uncertainty over Kynect's future. As the story notes, ``the only company that will offer plans statewide on the exchange next year said the requested rate increase has nothing to do with the end of Kynect.'' Yesterday I shared stories from Kentuckians who continue to suffer under this law.  Thanks to what we learned last night, I am afraid we will be hearing even more. ObamaCare's defenders need to own up to what their partisan law is doing to the middle class and not waste another moment trying to deflect attention elsewhere. They need to work with us to relieve the pain of ObamaCare and start over with real care.                          ____________________
