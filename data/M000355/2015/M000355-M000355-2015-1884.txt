 President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the Keystone bill. This is the third week of floor consideration for this bipartisan jobs and infrastructure measure. Senators from both sides have been able to offer amendments and get their ideas voted on. I know Chairman Murkowski is here, and she is working with colleagues to get their amendments in the queue. It is now time to get through the remaining amendments and to vote up or down on passage of the bill.                          ____________________
