 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would partially repeal language from the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act of 2000; language that circumvents the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act's common-sense protections and regulatory safeguards against the inappropriate siting of Nevada-style casinos.  In 2000, a one-paragraph provision was attached to the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act taking land into trust for a single Indian tribe, the Lytton, with the aim of allowing the tribe to expedite plans to establish a large gaming complex in San Pablo, CA.  The site which is not part of, nor adjacent to, any land traditionally held by the Lytton is, in fact, a 10-acre property which includes a card club and parking lot, and is located in a major urban area just outside of San Francisco. The process to bring this land into trust and sidestep gaming oversight was done without regard for Federal laws currently in place to regulate the siting of such a casino.  Today California is home to 109 federally recognized tribes. 64 tribes have gaming compacts with the State and there are 54 tribal casinos. With more than 50 tribes seeking Federal recognition and approximately 25 recognizedtribes seeking gaming compacts from the Governor, revenues from California's tribal gaming industry are expected to be the highest of any State's by the end of the decade.  I have serious reservations about the expansion of Nevada-style gaming--with its slot machines and in-house banking--into urban areas, and I am particularly concerned about off-reservation gambling and ``reservation shopping''. Off-reservation casinos often cause counties additional costs in public and local services, intrude on residential areas, and are responsible for an increase of traffic and crime within local communities.  That said, under proper regulation, gaming in California has the potential to yield much needed benefits for tribal members in terms of healthcare, education and general welfare, as Congress and California voters intended. However, the question is not whether gaming should be permitted, but rather how and where. Those questions have been appropriately addressed by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  Without this legislation, the Lytton will be able to take a former card club and the adjacent parking lot as their reservation and turn it into a large gambling complex outside the regulations set up by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Allowing this to happen would set a dangerous precedent not only for California, but every State where tribal gaming is permitted.  The changes I seek today are extremely limited. This legislation would not reverse restoration of the tribe. It would not infringe on Native American sovereignty. It does not even block the casino proposal. It only seeks to give the State and the local communities a voice in the process and ensure that gaming continues to be organized within the framework of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  Circumventing the processes for Federal recognition of tribal governments and for granting land into trust presents a variety of serious and critical multi-jurisdictional issues--issues which can negatively affect the lives of ordinary citizens and deprive local governments of their political power to protect their communities.  That is why I believe it is important to seek a remedy which would restore the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act's oversight over the matter.  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act has provided this Nation with a fair and balanced approach to Indian gaming by facilitating tribal plans for economic recovery without compromising a multitude of factors that should be taken into account when deciding on the siting of casinos. This law works. It is a fair process that should continue to be followed.  It is simply not asking too much to require that Lytton be subject to the regulatory and approval processes applicable to newly acquired tribal lands by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and I look forward to working with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Indian Affairs Committee to pass this legislation quickly.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1648       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. LYTTON RANCHERIA OF CALIFORNIA.       Section 819 of the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act (114      Stat. 2919) is amended by striking the last sentence.                                 ______                                       By
