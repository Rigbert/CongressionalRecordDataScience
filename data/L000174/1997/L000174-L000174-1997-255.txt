President, I was profoundly disturbed to learn that the Palestinian Authority has adopted a policy that any Palestinian caught selling land to a Jew will receive the death penalty. Only days after the announcement, the New York Times reported the brutal abduction and murder of Mr. Farid Bashiti, a 70-year-oldPalestinian real estate dealer who had been interrogated 2 weeks before his murder by the Palestinian police for allegedly selling land to Jews in and around Jerusalem.  Palestinian authorities have denied any involvement in Mr. Bashiti's death, and I understand an investigation is underway by Palestinian and Israeli police. I do not seek to prejudge that. But it is noteworthy that Palestinian officials have not condemned his death and have openly called Mr. Bashiti a traitor. I hope that his family is able to learn the truth, and that those responsible are brought to justice. This was a horrendous crime whatever the motive, and whoever was behind it should be severely punished.  But apart from Mr. Bashiti's murder, the policy of imposing a death sentence for the sale of land is nothing short of barbaric. It cannot be justified under any circumstances. I am very aware that Palestinians fervently disagree with the Israeli decision to proceed with the construction of Jewish housing in Har Homa. I disagree with that decision as well. And I am disturbed by the reports that torture is used by Israeli police. But executing someone because he or she sold land to Jews is beyond comprehension.  Mr. President, I have spoken many times about the fragility of the peace process in the Middle East. I am very disappointed by any actions that exacerbate the situation, when the focus should be on easing tensions and seeking common ground.                          ____________________
