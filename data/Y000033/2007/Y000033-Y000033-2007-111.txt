Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation today to correct an inequity for my Alaska Native Vietnam Veterans with regard to their native allotment issues.  Approximately 2,800 Alaska Natives served in the military during the Vietnam conflict and therefore did not have an opportunity to apply for their Native allotment. In 1998, P.L. 105-276 amended the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) to provide Alaska Native Vietnam veterans an opportunity to obtain an allotment of up to 160 acres of land under the Native Allotment Act.  P.L. 105-276 contains three major obstacles that prevent Alaska Native Vietnam veterans from selecting and obtaining their Native allotment. First, Alaska Native Vietnam veterans can only apply for land that was vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved when their use first began. Second, Alaska Native Vietnam veterans can only apply if they served in active military duty from January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1971 (even though the Vietnam conflict began August 5, 1964 and ended May 7, 1975). Third, Alaska Native Vietnam veterans must prove they used the land (applied for in their native allotment application) in a substantially continuous and independent manner, at least potentially exclusive of others, for five or more years. This requirement was not in the original Native Allotment Act, nor has it been required of other Alaska Native applicants in applying for their native allotment. Further, adjudication of use and occupancy issues will take years and will be very costly.  My bill will increase the available land by authorizing Alaska Native Vietnam veterans to apply for land that is federally owned and vacant. The lack of available land under existing law nullifies the very purpose of granting Alaska Native Vietnam veterans an allotment benefit. This is true because most land in Alaska is not available for Alaska Native Vietnam veteran allotment applications under existing laws. For example, there is no land available in southeast Alaska because it either is within the Tongass National Forest or has been selected or conveyed to the State of Alaska or ANCSA Native Corporations.  My bill will also expand the military service dates to coincide with the entire Vietnam conflict: August 5, 1964 through May 7, 1975. The expansion of military service dates to include all Alaska Natives who served in the military during the Vietnam conflict is consistent with the federal government's policy of providing benefits to veterans of the Vietnam War. The federal government has given public land benefits to veterans (or their widows or heirs) of every war beginning with the Indian Wars of 1790 and ending with the Korean conflict in 1955. Incidentally, Alaska Native veterans were not eligible for these public land benefits until 1924 because the courts had determined Alaska Natives were not United States citizens.  My bill would extend the deadline of the allotment application to three years after the Secretary of the Interior issues final regulations under Section 3 of this bill. It also would correct the dates of Approval of Allotments to accommodate the extension of the application process of an Alaska Native Vietnam veteran.  My bill would also assure ANCSA Regional and Village Corporations that if an Alaska Native Vietnam veteran makes his or her allotment selection within lands selected (and not necessarily conveyed) by those Corporations said Corporation's lands entitlement will remain intact.  My bill would prohibit an Alaska Native Vietnam veteran from selecting lands within the right of way granted for the TransAlaska Pipeline or the inner and outer corridor of that right-of-way withdrawal (for security reasons after 9/11 attacks). It also would prohibit a veteran from selecting lands containing a building, permanent structure, or other development owned or controlled by the United States, another unit of government, or reserved for national defense purposes other than National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.  My bill would also allow a veteran who made an allotment selection under Section 2(g) of this bill, before the date of the enactment of this bill, may withdraw that selection and reselect lands under this section if the land originally selected were not conveyed to that person prior to enactment of this bill.  My bill will also replace existing use and occupancy requirements with legislative approval of allotment applications. Use and occupancy requirements would be replaced for several reasons: (1) Congress has made legislative approval available to all other allotment applicants under 43 U.S.C. Section 1634(a) (1) (A); (2) legislative approval of allotments prevents costly and lengthy adjudication of use and occupancy issues; and (3) many Alaska Native Vietnam veterans could not meet use and occupancy requirements as a result of military service. For example, the application of a deserving Alaska Native Vietnam veteran who was paralyzed during the Vietnam conflict would be rejected if that veteran were unable to complete the five years of use of the claimed land and had not used the land for five years before the war.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation for Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who served their country in a time of conflict. I want to remind my colleagues that we owe our veterans the respect, dignity and honor them so well deserve for fulfilling their duty and commitment to this great nation. Please do not deprive my Alaska Native Vietnam veterans their rightful opportunity to apply for their native allotment as was afforded other Alaska natives in my great State.                          ____________________
