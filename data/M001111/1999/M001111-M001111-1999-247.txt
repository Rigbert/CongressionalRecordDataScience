  Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague, Chairman Burns, in recommending the fiscal year 2000 military construction bill to the Senate for approval.  I begin by thanking him and his staff for being so great to work with. He is right, we are old hands but not that old; and it is great to work with him.  This bill, which was reported with the unanimous approval of the Senate Appropriations Committee last week, bears little resemblance to the spending structure proposed by the administration last winter. The administration, in what I consider to be a misguided effort to free up more money for defense spending, proposed a buy-now, pay-later military construction bill. The subcommittee carefully analyzed the administration's plan. We had numerous briefings as well as two subcommittee hearings. Our conclusion was that split funding not only would set a dangerous precedent but also would jeopardize the integrity of the entire military construction program.  At the recommendation of the Military Construction Subcommittee, the Appropriations Committee wisely rejected the administration's proposal for incremental funding. With the help of our chairman and ranking member, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, we were able to fully fund our Military Construction Program. Moreover, we were able to surmount the woefully inadequate amounts of funding that the administration sought to spread over the full 2-year construction program. In the end, we increased construction funding for active duty components by $278 million over the administration's total request, and for reserve components by nearly $388 million over the request.  We achieved these increases by judicious reductions in other accounts, such as the base realignment and closure account, without jeopardizing the pace of ongoing work. Senator Burns and his staff deserve a great deal of credit for the thoughtful and careful approach that they took in the drafting of this bill. As always, they have worked hard to produce a balanced, bipartisan product that takes into account both the concerns of the Senate and the needs of the military.  In particular, they have done a superb job of continuing to shine the spotlight on the quality of life projects that are so important to our men and women in uniform, and to their families. At a time when military enlistment and retention are in free fall, and the services cannot hope to match the financial incentives of the private sector, quality of life issues are magnified in importance. They do not diminish the importance of readiness projects, but they are a factor in recruiting and retaining our military personnel.  Within the budget constraints that we are all forced to operate this year, this bill attempts to meet the most urgent and most timely of the military construction projects available. All of the major construction projects that we have funded have been authorized. In addition, we have ensured adequate funding for family housing and barracks construction, and we have suggested that the Department of Defense revisit the issue of housing privatization to determine if it is a workable solution to our military housing needs.  Even so, this bill is $176 million below the military construction bill enacted last year. This continues the recent, and troubling, downward spiral in military construction investment. During a year in which the Congress has made great strides toward addressing the need to enhance defense readiness and military personnel spending, it is disappointing--and in my opinion, shortsighted--to see defense infrastructure needs struggling to keep pace.  This is an extremely important bill for our Nation and our military forces. I again commend Senator Burns and his staff for their excellent work in producing the bill, and I urge the Senate to approve it.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as United States military forces deploy into war-torn Kosovo for another protracted, costly stay of indeterminate duration and of considerable potential risk, I am left wondering why, with all of the readiness and modernization problems that are well-established matters of record, we felt compelled to add over $6 million in this bill for a new Visiting Officers Quarters at Niagara Falls. Is this really the message we want to send to our military personnel and to the American taxpayer. I think not.  The propensity of members of Congress to devote enormous time and energy to adding items to spending bills for primarily parochial considerations remains one of our most serious weaknesses. The implications for national defense, however, are no laughing matter. Those of us who serve on the Armed Services Committee have heard a great deal of testimony from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as fromregional and functional commanders in chief, of the impact extraordinarily high operational tempos are having on both near- and long-term military readiness. And we hear it directly from troops in the field. They are tired; repeated deployments and declining quality of life has taken a toll. A vicious cycle has emerged wherein the impact of high deployment rates and shrinking force structure are exacerbated by the flight of skilled personnel out of the service as a result of those trends.  So I have to wonder why, given the scale of the problems documented, we are adding $12 million to the budget for new visitors quarters at Dover Air Force Base, $12 million for a Regional Training Institute in Hawaii, $3 million for a Marine Corps Reserve Center in Louisiana, $8.9 million for a C-130J simulator facility in Mississippi, $8 million for the Red Butte Dam in Utah, and $15 million for an Armed Forces Reserve Center in Oregon. None of these projects--none of them--were requested by the Department of Defense, and none of them are on the services' Unfunded Priority Lists. Unrequested projects totaling $985 million--almost $1 billion--was added to this bill, on top of the $5 billion in member-adds included in the defense appropriations bill passed last week.  I have asked rhetorically on the floor of the Senate many times when we are going to stop this destructive and irresponsible practice of adding projects to the defense budget primarily for parochial reasons. I have yet to receive an answer. Certainly, the practice has neither stopped nor slowed. The last minute insertion in the defense appropriations bill of $220 million for four F-15 fighters not requested by the Air Force solely for the purpose of appeasing hometown constituencies was one of the more disgraceful acts I've witnessed since, well, since we went through the same exercise last year. The total in unrequested items between the defense and military construction appropriations bills is almost $6 billion. That is serious money.  As American pilots continue to patrol the skies over Iraq, maintain a tenuous peace in Bosnia, and proceed into uncharted terrain in Kosovo, we would do well to consider the ramifications of our actions. I'm under no illusions, however, that such contemplation will occur. It is apparently, and sadly, not in our nature.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying list be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  MILCON appropriations adds for FY 00                        [In millions of dollars]                            ALABAMA Maxwell AFB: Off.
