 President, I am pleased to offer today, legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Denes and Gyorgyi Fulop, Hungarian nationals who have lived in California for more than 18 years. The Fulops are the parents of six United States citizen children. Today, they face deportation.  The Fulop's story is a compelling one; one I believe merits Congress' consideration for humanitarian relief. In May of last year, the Fulops suffered the loss of their eldest child, Robert ``Bobby'' Fulop, an accomplished 15-year-old teenager who died suddenly of a heart aneurism. Bobby was considered the shining star in his family. He was very bright and very helpful to his parents.  That same year the Fulop's six-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was diagnosed with moderate pulmonary stenosis, a potentially life-threatening heart condition. Not long ago, she underwent heart surgery. I am pleased to report that she is doing much better.  Compounding this unfortunate series of events is the fact that, today, the Fulops face deportation. They face deportation, in part, because in 1995 they went back to Hungary and stayed for more than 90 days. Under the pre-1996 immigration laws, their stay in Hungary would not have been a factor in their deportation and they would have qualified for adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.  Indeed, in 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Fulop applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, for permanent resident status. The INS did not interview them until 1998. By the time the INS had processed their application, the new 1996 immigration laws had taken effect, which barred from relief long-term resident aliens who traveled outside the U.S. for more than 90 days.  One cannot help but conclude that had the INS acted on their application for relief from deportation in a more timely manner, the Fulops would have qualified for suspension of deportation under the pre-1996 laws, given that they are long-term residents of the U.S. with U.S. citizen children.  This is a tragic situation. The rules of the game were changed in the middle of the Fulop's application for permanent residence, and because the INS failed to process their application in a timely fashion they are now facing deportation. The Fulop's children, who are United States citizens, were not included in the deportation order. But because they are minors they would likely have to follow their parents to Hungary. Growing up in the American school system, the Fulop children are not able to read or write the Hungarian language, and I believe that forcing them to leave the only country they have known would pose an extreme hardship for them.  It is my hope that Congress sees fit to provide an opportunity for this family to remain together in the United States.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 453       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
