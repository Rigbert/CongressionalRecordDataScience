 President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the recess or adjournment of the Senate, when the Senate receives from the House a short-term highway extension, the text of which is at the desk, the bill be considered read the third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without any intervening action or debate.
