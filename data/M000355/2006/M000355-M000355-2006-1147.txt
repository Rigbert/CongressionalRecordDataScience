 President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the adjournment of the Senate, all time until we resume the bill tomorrow count against the time limit under the provisions of rule XXII. I further ask unanimous consent that all first-degree amendments that qualify under rule XXII be offered no later than 11 a.m. on Wednesday, other than a managers' amendment to be cleared by the managers and the two leaders.
