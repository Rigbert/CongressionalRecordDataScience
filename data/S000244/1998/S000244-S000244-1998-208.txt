 My guess is that the exemption that my amendment proposes might reduce ASCAP's and BMI's fees by as much as 5 cents on the dollar, but they will be able to pick that up with the 20-year term extension that is contained in the underlying bill.  Vote for balance, vote against McCollum and vote for Sensenbrenner.
