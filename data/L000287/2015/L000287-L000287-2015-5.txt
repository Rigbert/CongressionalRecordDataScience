 I rise to offer an amendment that is very important to the people of metro Atlanta. My amendment would allow Federal funds from the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program to be used to construct type II noise barriers. These are barriers built to cut down noise along existing highways.  Current Federal law ties the hands of State transportation agencies. It limits their ability to address key quality-of-life concerns in the planning process.  Madam Chair, my office has been working with the Georgia Department of Transportation for years to address these concerns. Many communities in metro Atlanta are tired of the noise and just want some peace and quiet. We are ready to move forward, but we need Congress to untie our hands.  My amendment does not cost one cent, not one dime. If anything, it improves the effectiveness of the money we already send to the States.  It does not require that States build these barriers; instead, it allows them the flexibility they need to minimize Federal funds, to raise property values, and to improve the quality of life in frustrated communities across America. Madam Chair, we have the opportunity to do something that would make our citizens' lives better.  Living next to a loud highway can be a headache. When you have a good and quiet neighborhood, when you can get some sleep, you can be happy. I urge the adoption of my amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
