 We commend him for his good work and that bill will be headed over this way. I would also make the observation with regard to the President's approach to energy, the announcement in China yesterday which, as I read it, gives the Chinese 16 years to do anything to reduce their carbon emissions while we are going full speed ahead here, visibly destroying American jobs or trying to prevent the creation of new jobs in North Dakota.  My goodness, as I said earlier, it seems to me what this administration is best at is either destroying existing jobs or preventing new jobs from being created because of this obsession, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, with hydrocarbons of any kind.  I see the Senator from South Dakota here as well and wonder if he may have a question.
