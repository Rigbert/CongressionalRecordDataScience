 President, no less an authority than Alan Greenspan recently pronounced our economy in the best shape he has seen in his professional life.  Unemployment, inflation, and interest rates are low; incomes, investment, and optimism remain high.  Clearly, Mr. President, now is the time to worry.  Now is the time to worry, Mr. President, because these are exactly the circumstances that breed overconfidence and complacency. Pride, Mr. President, goeth before the fall.  Mr. President, we enjoy this excellent economic performance because we have got our own house in order--we have gone through a painful period of restructuring that has made our economy more efficient, and we have taken the tough steps to balance our federal budget.  So our factories and businesses are operating efficiently, our workers are earning more, and our sound government finances are helping to keep interest rates down. What could go wrong?  Well, what if the markets for this new, more productive economy were not there? What if international investors pull their money out of some of our major trading partners? What if those countries stop buying our products and services? What if they can't pay back their loans, and American investments there lose money instead of sending profits back home?  Unfortunately, that is just what is happening now, and instead of acting quickly to limit the threat of these developments, the majority in the House of Representatives has chosen to play a dangerous game of chicken with international financial markets.  Mr. President, the Senate went on record in March, by an overwhelming vote of 84 to 16, in favor of full funding of U.S. participation in the International Monetary Fund. But those funds were dropped by the House in Conference.  I am pleased to see that Chairman Stevens, who, along with my colleague Senator Hagel on the Foreign Relations Committee has shown real leadership on this issue, has taken a second crack at the problem by including this funding on the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. Unfortunately, we will not act on that bill until after the August recess.  But just last week, the House pulled its version of the Foreign Ops bill from further consideration because of their internal squabbling over funding for the IMF.  I fear that those squabbles may mask an even more cynical motive--to hold the IMF, and by extension global financial stability, hostage to increase their bargaining leverage on unrelated issues at the end of the legislative session this fall.  Mr. President, I want to stress what is at stake while the majority in the House dithers. The financial crisis that began a year ago in Asia has not gone away--it continues to fester, and threatens to spread. Indeed, with the resources of the IMF already stretched thin, we may be entering the most critical phase of this threat to the global economy.  If the worst case happens, Mr. President, we will have no place to hide, no matter how well things have been going for us lately. Just look at the risks.  Japan is the keystone of the Asian economy--it could pull that already fragile region into a real depression if current trends are not quickly and dramatically reversed. That's why the recent elections there were so important, and why international investors are watching closely to see if Japan has the political muscle to overhaul its financial system and restore growth at the same time. That is a lot to ask, and much hangs on the outcome, including the health of important markets for American exports throughout Asia.  Mr. President, in May our trade deficit soared to $15.8 billion, as exports to Asia dropped by 21 percent compared to a year ago. Still, our friends in the House suggest that we wait until the fall to see if things get worse.  Russia presents an additional threat to our economic and security interests. Despite the announcement of a new IMF package, the Moscow stock market index has dropped 24 percent. An economically foundering Russia, facing political collapse, opens a Pandora's box of issues for stability in Europe and around the world.  On top of all this, other countries, including South Africa, Ukraine, and Malaysia, are lined up in the IMF's waiting room.  But because of the severity of the Asian crisis, the IMF's resources are so low that international investors must now have real fear that it will not be able to provide further support to its current clients, or support any additional countries now on the brink. This will add uncertainty to an already shaky situation, and can only make further panic more likely.  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, recently warned those who think we can do without the IMF that they are ``playing with fire.'' He's right.  They have decided, for short-term political reasons--some as small as their own fight over the Speaker's job--that they are willing to fiddle while the international economy burns. The IMF is not a perfect institution, Mr. President, but right now it is the only fire insurance we have got.  By delaying indefinitely the funding for the IMF, these gamblers are taking deadly risks with our own economy, an economy that has taken years of sacrifice to restore to health. They are squandering our ability to lead economically and politically in a time of international crisis in exchange for some short-term political gains.  It is time to cease this recklessness, Mr. President. It's time to provide the IMF with the funds it needs, and remove short-sighted bickering and self-serving calculations in the U.S. Congress from the list of threats to our own economy.                          ____________________
