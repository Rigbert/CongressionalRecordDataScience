 President, I rise to speak on an amendment which is identical to a bill I have introduced with Republican Congressman Peter King. This amendment was proposed by the Bush administration's Department of Justice in 2007. It would allow the Attorney General to prevent a person from buying a gun or explosive if, one, the recipient is a known or suspected terrorist; and, two, the Attorney General has a reasonable belief that the recipient would use the firearm in connection with a terrorist act.  The bill has very broad law enforcement support, including the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, who was also chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, recently said on Meet the Press:       If Congress really wants to do something instead of just      talking about something, help us out with that Terrorist      Watch List, those thousands of people that can purchase      firearms in this country. I'm more worried about them than I      am about Syrian refugees, to be quite frank with you.
