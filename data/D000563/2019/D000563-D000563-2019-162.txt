President, I am sorry for this objection. I thank the Senator from South Dakota for coming to the floor on behalf of the Senator from Utah. I have been in communication with the Senator from Utah. I hope he will join me in asking for a hearing. This is an issue which literally affects hundreds of thousands of people living in this country, many of whom have been here for years and decades. Practicing physicians in my hometown of Springfield are affected by this debate. They want to know what their future will be and the future of their children.  I am trying to find a reasonable way to work out a compromise on this, and I stand ready to do so. I hope Senator Lee will join me in asking Senators Graham and Cornyn to have a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. I want to extend this invitation to Senator Lee to join the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats who signed a letter with me today requesting this hearing.  I am happy to sit down and discuss this issue with the senior Senator from Utah or any other Senator. If we work together in good faith, I believe we can reach a bipartisan agreement on legislation that can pass both Chambers and be signed into law.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
