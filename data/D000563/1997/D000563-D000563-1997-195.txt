 Let me say this. I want to respond to some of the points raised in this debate. I have been involved in this debate for over a decade and have heard many of these arguments, and I disagree with them. But I do respect my colleagues both in the House and in the Senate who make these arguments. I believe they are heartfelt and sincere. I believe they are speaking for the people that they represent.  I believe I am speaking for the people that I represent not only in Illinois but across the Nation when I talk about the need to have some fairness when it comes to hospitalization insurance premiums and to stop all of the promises that have gone on for more than a decade that we are going to give these people fairness. ``Oh, we love small business. Oh, we love the family farmer. We are going to get around to helping you on health insurance matters in the next year 2 years.'' Senator Nickles said maybe 10 years from now we are going to get around to it.  Please. I have been involved in that debate. Senator Dorgan has. Senator Conrad has. This has gone on for more than a decade.  All of these promises we can deliver on tonight.  Listen to the arguments. Again, I find it incredible.  One of my colleagues from Kentucky stands up and says this busts the budget deal. What?
