 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's concerns, and the gentleman said earlier it is all in the eyes of the beholder. In the eyes of this beholder, we think we have been more than generous with the minority, and in showing that, to entice Mr. Pitts to come work for the Committee on Rules shows our generosity to the minority because he is a very fair man, a very creative man in dealing with rules and really understands how this House works, and we hoped that by Mr. Pitts coming to work for the Committee on Rules it was a signal to everyone in the House that everyone in the House would be treated fairly.
