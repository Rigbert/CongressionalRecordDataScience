Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3752) to preserve the sovereignty of the United States over public lands and acquired lands owned by the United States, and to preserve State sovereignty and private property rights in non-Federal lands surrounding those public lands and acquired lands, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3752       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``American Land Sovereignty      Protection Act of 1996''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) The power to dispose of and make all needful rules and      regulations governing lands belonging to the United States is      vested in the Congress under article IV, section 3, of the      Constitution.       (2) Some Federal land designations made pursuant to      international agreements concern land use policies and      regulations for lands belonging to the United States which      under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution can only be      implemented through laws enacted by the Congress.       (3) Some international land designations, such as those      under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man      and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific,      Educational, and Cultural Organization, operate under      independent national committees, such as the United States      National Man and Biosphere Committee, which have no      legislative directives or authorization from the Congress.       (4) Actions by the United States in making such      designations may affect the use and value of nearby or      intermixed non-Federal lands.       (5) The sovereignty of the States is a critical component      of our Federal system of government and a bulwark against the      unwise concentration of power.       (6) Private property rights are essential for the      protection of freedom.       (7) Actions by the United States to designate lands      belonging to the United States pursuant to international      agreements in some cases conflict with congressional      constitutional responsibilities and State sovereign      capabilities.       (8) Actions by the President in applying certain      international agreements to lands owned by the United States      diminishes the authority of the Congress to make rules and      regulations respecting these lands.       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are the following:       (1) To reaffirm the power of the Congress under article IV,      section 3, of the Constitution over international agreements      which concern disposal, management, and use of lands      belonging to the United States.       (2) To protect State powers not reserved to the Federal      Government under the Constitution from Federal actions      designating lands pursuant to international agreements.       (3) To ensure that no United States citizen suffers any      diminishment or loss of individual rights as a result of      Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international      agreements for purposes of imposing restrictions on use of      those lands.       (4) To protect private interests in real property from      diminishment as a result of Federal actions designating lands      pursuant to international agreements.       (5) To provide a process under which the United States may,      when desirable, designate lands pursuant to international      agreements.     SEC. 3.
