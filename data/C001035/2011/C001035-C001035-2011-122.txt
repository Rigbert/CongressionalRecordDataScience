President, I rise today to speak about a program designed to address the unique needs of rural schools. The Rural Education Achievement Program, or REAP, is designed to help level the playing field for small and high-poverty rural school systems. It is the only dedicated Federal funding stream to aid rural school districts in overcoming the increased expenses caused by geographic isolation.  Nearly one-third of America's public schools are in rural places, and more than 21 percent of our public school students attend these schools. Students in rural America should have the same access to Federal dollars and a good education as those students who attend school in urban and suburban communities. For this reason, I worked with Senator Kent Conrad in 2001 to author the law creating the REAP program. REAP created two grant programs including the Small and Rural Schools Achievement Program, SRSA, which provides additional funding and flexibility to small rural school districts, and the Rural and Low-Income School Program, RLIS, which provides additional funding for poor rural school districts.  Prior to enactment of this law, rural school districts received funds calculated on school enrollment. In many of these districts, Federal formula programs, which are based on population, do not produce enough resources to carry out the purposes the grant is intended to fund. One school district in Maine, for example, received only $28 in 2001 to fund a districtwide safe and drug-free school program.  In addition, small and rural school districts often forgo Federal education dollars because they lack the personnel and the resources to apply for competitive grants. Having fewer personnel also creates additional challenges in providing professional development opportunities. Small rural districts are often located long distances from other districts, towns, and universities, drastically reducing opportunities to partner or collaborate. By allowing rural school districts to combine funds, as well as providing additional funds, REAP gives these districts the levels of resources required to undertake significant reform. Funds from this program have already helped to support new technology in classrooms, distance learning opportunities, and professional development activities, as well as a vast array of other programs which will help rural districts make progress towards the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act.  In 2007 and 2009, along with Senator Conrad, I cosponsored legislation to reauthorize this important program. Unfortunately, no action has been taken. The REAP Reauthorization Act of 2011 would reauthorize and enact a few focused changes to the law. These changes will allow Federal funds to be even more closely targeted to geographically isolated districts. One important change will allow program eligible districts to participate in the Rural and Low-Income School Program if they would not receive financial benefits from the Small and Rural Schools Achievement Program.  Education is an essential driver for economic development. This rings true especially in rural America, where schools are the linchpin of rural communities. I am encouraged to see that the Maine School Management Association has spoken in support of the REAP Reauthorization Act of 2011. As cochair of the Senate Rural Education Caucus, I will continue to work towards our goal of advancing the educational interests of rural schools and districts.  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Maine School Management Association.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Maine School                                       Management Association,                                    Augusta, Maine, March 1, 2011.     Re Reauthorization of REAP.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The Maine School Boards Association      and the Maine School Superintendents Association want to      thank you for your continued sponsorship of the REAP Program.      Specifically, our Associations are pleased to support the      2011 Reauthorization of REAP. Throughout the years, REAP      funding has helped to provide equity for many small schools      in Maine and our expectation is that will continue with this      Reauthorization.       Both, the National School Boards Association and the      American Association of School Administrators also are      supportive of the Reauthorization of REAP.       The Maine School Boards Association and the Maine School      Superintendents Association appreciate your continued support      for public education. We want to commend you for your      willingness to pay attention to various legislative issues      that may impact Maine public schools. We also want to praise      your staff for their expertise and accessibility to our      organizations. As always, our Associations are available as a      resource to you and to your staff.       Thank you again.           Sincerely,                                                     Terry McCabe,                                     Associate Executive Director.                                 ______                                       By
