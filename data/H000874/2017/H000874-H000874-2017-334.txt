Speaker, I rise to offer my congratulations to former Prince George's County Fire Department Chief Steven T. Edwards as he prepares to retire as Director of the Maryland Fire Rescue Institute (MFRI) after twenty-four years. I've had the pleasure of working with him throughout those years, including in my capacity as Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus.  Steve is a fifty-year veteran of the fire services. He began his career with the Prince George's County Fire Department as a high school cadet. Over the years, Steve rose through the ranks and became Chief in 1989. After a four-year tenure marked by accolades for his leadership and citations for the Department--including the International Association of Fire Chiefs Award for Excellence--he stepped down to take on a new challenge leading MFRI. A world-renowned training institution for firefighters and emergency services personnel, MFRI prepares more than 38,000 students each year to enter the fire services. Under Steve's leadership, MFRI set high standards that help ensure that trainees are ready to face any emergency when they go out to serve in fire departments across the country. MFRI has been working closely with the Congressional Fire Services Caucus for more than a quarter-century, conducting training programs for Congressional staff. Steve has been instrumental in preparing these programs and making them so informative.  Steve has also contributed his time and talents to advancing the safety and health of fire service personnel at the national level. In 1997, he was named President of the North America Fire Training Directors, a forum for exchanging information and best practices among state fire training and education programs. In addition, Steve has served in leadership positions with National Fire Protection, the National Board on Fire Service Professional Certification, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute's National Advisory Committee. For the latter, he served as Chair from 2004 to 2006, and we worked closely together to ensure that Congress was providing fire departments with all the tools necessary to carry out their work safely and effectively.  I'm proud that Prince George's County has produced such a fine national leader for the fire services in our country. Throughout the years I've known Steve, I've seen him give all his passion and talents to the work of supporting firefighters and emergency services personnel and their families. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Chief Steve Edwards on his retirement, and thanking him for his work on behalf of the fire services in Maryland and across this nation.                          ____________________
