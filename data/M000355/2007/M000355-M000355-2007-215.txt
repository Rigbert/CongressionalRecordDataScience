 President, let me add that I share the goal of the majority leader. There is no reason why the Senate cannot finish not only the bill we will wrap up before noon but also the Foreign Operations-State appropriations bill and the education reconciliation. I will mention that during the years when Senator Leahy and I handled the Foreign Operations bill--and Senator Leahy is now the chairman and Senator Gregg is the ranking member--our record, I say to my friend, the majority leader, one year we got it done in one afternoon. I don't know if that is possible this year, but it certainly has happened before.  We will be cooperating to the maximum extent possible to help achieve both these goals before the end of the week.
