President, I have had questions about what six different administrations have done, since I have been in the Senate, in their operation of USAID, but I have never seen such micromanagement. This would could cost far more than it would save. It would actually cost far more money than this amount in debating it. It would not have been done in the Ford administration, the Nixon administration, the Reagan administration, the former Bush administration, the Clinton administration, and I would not support this kind of micromanagement in the current Bush administration. We would simply spend more money debating it than we could save, and I hope we would vote against it.
