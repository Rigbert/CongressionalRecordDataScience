President, as the world goes through this difficult economic period it is important that we continue efforts that began when times were better.  A June 10, 2009 article in the New York Times entitled ``Battle to Halt Graft Scourge in Africa Ebbs'' notes that because of a series of assassinations, dismissals, and changes in power across the African Continent, some of Africa's previous efforts to fight corruption are weakening. It is estimated that a trillion dollars obtained through corrupt practices changes hands every year around the world, and a large part of it in Africa. This staggering amount is often the revenues from the extraction of natural resources like oil or diamonds, but instead of going to help the impoverished people of the country where the resources are located, it too often goes to line the pockets of corrupt officials. If it were possible to reduce by just one-quarter the amount of money stolen, the amount saved would be five times as much as we spend annually on foreign aid.  On his recent visit to Accra, Ghana, President Obama made it clear that the responsibility for good government and with it, development, in Africa ultimately rests on the shoulders of Africans. He said ``repression can take many forms, and too many nations, even those that have elections, are plagued by problems that condemn their people to poverty. No country is going to create wealth if its leaders exploit the economy to enrich themselves . . . or if police can be bought off by drug traffickers. No business wants to invest in a place where the government skims twenty percent off the top . . . or the head of the port authority is corrupt. No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery. That is not democracy, that is tyranny, even if occasionally you sprinkle an election in there. And now is the time for that style of governance to end.''  I wholeheartedly agree with the President, and I also know that bribery depends on at least two parties--those who get paid and those who pay. Halliburton/KBR, a name we have all become familiar with for brazenly overcharging American taxpayers in Iraq, is reportedly under investigation for allegedly paying over $100 million in bribes in Nigeria in order to secure oilfield contracts. Although we do our best to investigate terrorist financing, U.S. banks are not required to fully investigate the sources of their funds, and the proceeds of corruption can sometimes get through. Offshore shell companies and bank accounts, and lax rules for identification of account holders, make it relatively easy to launder illicit money. The lack of information across borders hampers investigations and prosecution efforts and slows the return of stolen money.  The New York Times article tells the story of Nuhu Ribadu, the former director of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria, who led a courageous effort to begin to rid Nigeria of its endemic corruption problem but barely avoided an assassination attempt and was dismissed last year after reportedly refusing a $15 million bribe from a state official he was investigating. In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year, Mr. Ribadu pleaded that this country do all that it can to fight this global problem saying, ``What can you do as a country, as a good people of the world, as leaders, to help be on the side of the 140 million desperately poor Nigerians?''  While there is no question that this is a problem that requires the hard work and sacrifice of citizens of the countries where these crimes are taking place, we also need to do what we can in the United States to stand with those people who are taking risks to rid their countries of the corruption that destroys governments and whole societies.  There are a few things we can start doing now. We can do more to hold our domestic banks accountable for the money they have. We can put regulations in place that will make the holding of illegal international money no longer a profitable enterprise. We can open up international channels of communication to make sure that, while maintaining appropriate levels of privacy, we provide investigators overseas access to the records they need to track down and prosecute cases of graft in their countries. We should do all we can to prosecute those who receive bribes by cutting off funds and, as much is possible, expanding our courts' jurisdictions to prosecute those who extort money. And finally, we can come down hard on companies in the United States that are using bribery to increase their profitability in third world markets.  This is a problem that many brave Africans have tried to tackle head on, and it has cost some of them their lives. Let us make sure that we are doing all we can to help.                          ____________________
