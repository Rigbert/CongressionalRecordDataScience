Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment en bloc but particularly to an amendment that I offered which supports our Nation's reservists.  In the event of a domestic terrorism attack this country's reservists, particularly the National Guard's weapons of mass destruction team, could be called up at any time to protect and defend their fellow citizens, working with their fellow first responders across the country, police and firefighters. It would clarify that the first response to a domestic terrorism attack will qualify reservists for hostile fire and imminent danger pay. Ultimately, it is a matter of appreciation for the service to our Nation's Reserve forces. I hope all of you will join in supporting this amendment.
