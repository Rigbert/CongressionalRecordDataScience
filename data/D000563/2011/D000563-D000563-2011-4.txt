President, we continue to work on an agreement to consider the omnibus spending bill and a payroll tax compromise. Senators will be notified when votes are scheduled.  The majority leader filed cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3630 this evening. Unless an agreement is reached, that vote will be Saturday morning.                          ____________________
