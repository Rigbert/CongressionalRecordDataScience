 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, the Senate stand in adjournment until 9:30 in the morning, Thursday, May 26. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and that the Senate then return to executive session and resume consideration of the nomination of John Bolton to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N. as provided under the previous order; provided that 1 hour be under the control of Senator Voinovich.
