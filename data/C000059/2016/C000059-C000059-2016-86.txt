Chairman, this amendment is duplicative. It ignores the existing contractor award system that is already in place. Contracting officers must already consult the system for award management to ensure a contractor can be awarded a contract. Businesses on the excluded parties list system have been suspended or debarred through a due process system and may not be eligible to receive or renew Federal contracts for such cited offenses.  The best way to ensure that the government contracts with or provides grants to the best employers is to enforce the existing suspension and debarment system.  Bad actors who are in violation of the basic worker protections should not be awarded Federal contracts. That is why the Federal Government already has a system in place to deny Federal contracts to bad actors. If a contractor fails to maintain high standards of integrity and business ethics, agencies already have the authority to suspend or debar the employer from government contracting. In 2014, Federal agencies issued more than 1,000 suspensions and nearly 2,000 debarments to employers who bid on Federal contracts.  The amendment would delay the procurement process with harmful consequences. On numerous occasions, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has highlighted costly litigation stemming from complex regulatory rules, including from the Fair Labor Standards Act.  This amendment punishes employers who may unknowingly or unwillingly get caught in the Federal Government's maze of bureaucratic rules and reporting requirements. The procurement process is already plagued by delays and inefficiencies.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
