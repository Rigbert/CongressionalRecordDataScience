I went into a bakery in our district, and the owner said, Marcy, I could hire three more people and I want to add some machines and so forth because I've got orders I can't fill, but I can't get operating loans from the bank.  Credit is frozen across this country because they are these big, giant, inefficient institutions, and credit needs to be more decentralized. We need more financial institutions not fewer financial institutions. And the financial reforms that this Congress should pass should go to that level to restore a robust, competitive financial system in this country. And, by the way, we not only have to make the future better; we have to go back and catch the crooks that put us on this path.  I have a bill, H.R. 3995, that would add 1,000 agents to the FBI, to the SEC, and to the FDIC in order to fully investigate and go after these big institutions, because what happened after 9/11 was that the White Collar Crime division of the FBI was reduced to 75 investigators, 75. The SEC has 25 going after the largest financial institutions in this country? We need to, both on the civil side and the criminal side, investigate and prosecute.  When you have this level of implosion in an economy and a few people are getting very rich and everybody else is suffering, doesn't that tell you that something was fundamentally wrong? Some people say it was rigged, that control fraud may be, in fact, what has riddled through the system from the very top down through every community that we represent. So H.R. 3995 would add 1,000 more agents and help beef up prosecution in this country.
