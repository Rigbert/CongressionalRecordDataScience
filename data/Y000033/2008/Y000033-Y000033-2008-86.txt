I do thank the ranking member, and I do thank my chairman for cosponsoring this legislation and being supportive of it.  On July 7, that marks the 50th anniversary of the enactment of the Alaska Statehood Act, as approved by the United States Congress and signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.                              {time}  1715  Alaska would officially be admitted as a State January 3, 1959.  I introduce H.R. 127 which commemorates this occasion to recognize all of the people of Alaska who represent the pioneering spirit which built this great Nation and contributes to our culture and ethnic diversity.  Alaska is the most northern, most western, and most eastern State in the Union and composing an area one-fifth the size of the United States. And for all those trivia buffs out there, Alaska is roughly 2\1/2\ times the size of Texas.  Purchased from Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million, or 2 cents an acre, after Congress had concluded its resources would be vitally important to the Nation's future growth. At the time, the purchase was nicknamed ``Seward's folly'' because it was believed foolhardy to spend so much money on a remote region. Secretary of State William Seward would have the last laugh, though.  Alaska is the source of 16 percent of the daily crude oil in the United States, has 44 percent of the country's undiscovered resources. Alaska's 34,000 miles of shoreline form a gateway to one of the greatest fisheries in the world, providing for 60 percent of the country's commercial seafood harvest.  Alaska has 230 million acres set aside in national parks, wildlife refuges, and national forests which are visited each year by more than a million tourists. To give you some idea, Mr. Speaker, the State of California has 103 million acres. We put aside 230 million acres for parks and national wildlife refuges. Forests add to Alaska's beauty and provide a renewable economic resource with 28 million acres of commercial forests.  Alaska contains half of the Nation's coal reserves and its largest silver and zinc mines. Glittering gold in Alaska's streams and mountains still lures miners to work private claims. About 50 million acres of soil in Alaska are suitable for farming. About 1 million acres currently are in production.  I know that the people of Alaska will continue their commitment to the preservation and protection of this great State, but they also want to develop the resources. Alaskans are proud, strong, and independent Americans who are not afraid to stand up for what they believe in, and I'm honored and humbled to stand here today on their behalf as we again recognize this great important date in U.S. history.  Mr. Speaker, may I suggest, right above you there is a plaque, placed there in 1949; it says, Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers and build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy of being remembered. Daniel Webster. Let us develop our resources.  Alaska has the key to the solution of many problems of this great Nation, especially the energy crisis, and I ask this body as you recognize the 50th anniversary of the great State of Alaska, recognize what we can and what we have contributed to the Nation as a whole. As the 50th State, we are proud and we are extremely excited with the possibility to contribute more in the future. And I do urge my colleagues to pass this resolution  I thank the gentleman, the chairman, and the ranking member.
