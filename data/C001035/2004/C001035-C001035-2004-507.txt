President, the United States and Israel share a strong and enduring friendship. We also share the threat of terrorist attacks against our citizens. Yet, while terrorism within our borders is relatively new to us, Israelis have confronted this danger for decades. Israel's long history of fighting terrorism has spurred Israeli businesses, researchers and academics to develop highly sophisticated homeland security technologies, particularly in the fields of border integrity, transportation security, and first responder equipment. As the United States pursues new approaches to protecting our Nation, it only makes sense to look to Israel's extensive expertise in this area.  This is why I am introducing legislation with Senator Lieberman to establish a program to provide funds to eligible joint ventures between American firms and businesses in countries such as Israel that are already highly focused on the homeland security issue and have demonstrated the capacity for fruitful cooperation with America in the area of counterterrorism.  This program will act as a revolving fund to develop new homeland security technologies. As these technologies are deployed and become profitable, the businesses that developed them will be required to repay the program for the amount of the funds. This requirement, which has worked for similar existing programs, will help sustain the availability of funds for future funds.  The program will be managed by the Department of Homeland Security. It will dedicate $25 million toward these joint ventures that develop, manufacture, sell, or otherwise provide products and services with applications related to homeland security.  This legislation will build upon a number of other highly successful public-private partnerships between businesses in the United States and those located in countries such as Israel. Since its founding in 1977, the Bi-National Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD) has created numerous research and development partnerships between American and Israeli businesses. The BIRD Foundation has invested $180 million in 600 projects during the past 27 years. Similar partnerships also exist in the development of agricultural, defense, telecommunications, and other technologies. This record demonstrates the potential of a similar binational foundation in the area of homeland security.  As recent international events have demonstrated, the fight against terrorism knows no borders. This legislation will enable our Nation to deploy the highest quality and most innovative tools to improve our homeland security. I ask you to join me in supporting this effort to enhance our Nation's fight against terrorism.                          ____________________
