Speaker, it is with great pride and sincerity that I wish to congratulate Pastor Jerry Edward Moe as he celebrates the 50th anniversary of his ordination in ministry. His parishioners at Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Merrillville, Indiana will honor him on Sunday, May 18, 2003.  Pastor Moe was born on July 16, 1927, in Chicago, Illinois, to Walter and Edna Moe. He was educated in the Chicago public schools and graduated from Taft High School in 1945. Pastor Moe received his call to ministry during his teenage years and after high school went on to attend Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. After graduating with a bachelor of arts, he attended Luther Theological Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. Pastor Moe graduated from the seminary on May 17, 1953 and was ordained the same day at Central Lutheran Church located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As an ordained minister, Pastor Moe's first call was to the Air Force Chaplainry. He attended basic training at Lackland Air Force Base and was assigned to Patrick Air Force Base in Florida until 1955.  After completing his duty with the Air Force, Pastor Moe served as interim pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church in Jersey City, New Jersey. In 1956, Pastor Moe moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, where he studied post-graduate theology at the University of Edinburgh.  Upon his return to the United States, Pastor Moe accepted a call to the Valders Lutheran Parish in Wisconsin and served there from July 1957 to January 1960. From 1960 to 1963, Pastor Moe continued his service to God as the director of the Lutheran Center at Hothorpe Hall in Theddingworth, England.  Returning to the United States in 1963, Pastor Moe accepted the challenge of leading Christ Lutheran Church, a new mission church in Las Vegas, Nevada. During his tenure with Christ Lutheran, Pastor Moe was able to see the congregation grow. When Pastor Moe left this place of worship after seven years of service, the congregation consisted of more than 700 members.  Pastor Moe left Las Vegas to come back to his home state of Illinois where he served as pastor at Faith Lutheran Church for 22 years until his retirement in 1993. Since his official retirement, Pastor Moe has continued his call to worship at a variety of establishments in the state of Indiana. He served as Chaplain at St. Joseph's Medical Center in South Bend, as interim pastor at St. John Lutheran Church in Kokomo, and at St. John Lutheran Church in Marion. Today, Pastor Moe serves as the interim pastor at Prince of Peace Church in Merrillville.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Pastor Jerry Moe as he celebrates the 50th anniversary of his ordination in ministry. Throughout Pastor Moe's career in ministry he has touched the lives of many throughout the community. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
