 President, today I am being joined by Senator Feinstein in introducing the ``Tax Relief for Working Americans Act of 1999''. Congresswoman Nancy Johnson is introducing companion legislation in the House. We're here today to declare victory in the debate over whether or not we should have significant tax relief for the American people.
