Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Rogers for his leadership and support. Under his guidance, the Appropriations Committee is again setting the standard for getting things done in the House. This is the seventh of the appropriation bills that have come to the floor that we, hopefully, will be able to pass tomorrow.  I also want to thank my good friend and Ranking Member McCollum forher partnership and work on this bill. Finally, I want to thank each of our committee members for their efforts and their collegiality. It continues to be the hallmark of our subcommittee's deliberations.  Even though we may have differences of opinion within this bill, I greatly appreciate the members' constructive contributions, and I mean that sincerely. The committee has made some very difficult choices in preparing this bill.  As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the fiscal year 2016 Interior Appropriations bill is funded at $30.17 billion, which is $246 million below the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $3 billion below the budget request. We have made a sincere effort to prioritize the needs within our 302(b) allocation.  I would like to point out some of the highlights of the bill. Again, this year, the committee has provided robust wildland fire funding, fire suppression accounts. The Department of the Interior and Forest Service are fully funded at the 10-year average level. The hazardous fuel program was increased by $75 million to $526 million in fiscal year 2015 enacted, and that increase has been maintained in this bill.  The bill also continues critical investments in Indian Country, a nonpartisan priority of this committee. Building upon the bipartisan work, former subcommittee chairman Mike Simpson, Jim Moran, Norm Dicks, and, certainly, my friend Ms. McCollum, the bill continues to make investments in education, public safety, and health programs in Indian Country.  Overall funding for the Indian Health Service has increased by $145 million or 3 percent, while funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Indian Education is increased by $165 million or 6 percent from fiscal year 2015 levels, the largest percentage increase in this bill.  The bill provides full funding for fiscal year 2016 for payments in lieu of taxes, or the PILT program. PILT payments are made to 49 of the 50 States, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  The bill provides $2.7 billion for the National Park Service, included more than $60 million in new funding relating to the centennial of the National Park Service.  We have also addressed a number of priorities within the Fish and Wildlife Service accounts. The bill funds popular cost-shared grant programs above fiscal year 2015 enacted levels. It also provides for additional funds to combat international wildlife trafficking, protects fish hatcheries from cuts and closures, continues funding to fight invasive species, and reduces the backlog of species that are recovered but not yet delisted.  The bill provides $248 million for the land and water conservation fund, programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support. Some Members would prefer more funding; others would prefer less funding for LWCF. We have attempted to forge a middle ground that begins to return an emphasis of the LWCF to its original intent of recreation in the States and local acquisitions.  Overall, funding for EPA was reduced by $718 million or 9 percent from fiscal year 2015 enacted levels.  Members of the Great Lakes region will be pleased to know that the Great Lakes restoration initiative is maintained at fiscal year 2015 enacted level of $300 million. Rural water technical assistance grants and many categorical grants, including radon grants, are level funded at the fiscal year 2015 enacted level.  Again, this year, there is a great deal of concern over a number of regulatory actions being pursued by EPA, which we have discussed over the last day and the absence of legislation without clear congressional direction.  For this reason, the bill includes a number of provisions to stop unnecessary and damaging regulatory overreach by the agency.                              {time}  2015  I would like to address the Endangered Species Act. We have had a number of amendments over the last day about this subject. Certainly, this committee has no interest in interfering with science or in letting any species go extinct, but we are concerned about Federal regulatory actions lacking in basic fairness and common sense. The provisions in this bill address problems created by the ESA--not by science but by court orders--that drain limited agency resources and force departments to cut corners to meet arbitrary deadlines.  Nowhere is this more evident than with the sage-grouse. States are rightfully concerned that a listing or unnecessary restricted Federal land use plans will jeopardize existing conservation partnerships with States and private landowners. These partnerships are necessary to save both sagebrush ecosystems and local economies. So long as sage-grouse are not under imminent threat of extinction, cooperative conservation must be given a chance to work.  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
