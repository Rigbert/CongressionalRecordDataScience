 President, this amendment is a substitute amendment. Essentially, it is the balanced budget amendment as presented with Social Security excluded using the exact language of the Reid amendment. It is word for word the original balanced budget amendment excluding Social Security.  It is cosponsored by Senators Ford, Hollings, McCain, Bumpers, Mikulski, Harkin, Kohl, Daschle, Reid, and Dorgan.  Mr. President, I believe this substitute amendment plays a pivotal role as a vehicle to pass the balanced budget amendment.  We hope to debate it further and take the vote on this on Tuesday.  Let me just point out that as it currently stands, the balanced budget amendment essentially would utilize about $705 billion of FICA tax revenues--those are taxes paid for retirement--for purposes of masking the debt and balancing the budget. Many of us do not believe this is right. We do not believe it is morally right, and we do not believe it is ethically right.  The only way to protect Social Security, to keep it out of the balanced budget amendment, is by exempting it through this substitute constitutional amendment. As I previously stated, the exact words of the Reid amendment are included and incorporated within this substitute balanced budget amendment.  We will be speaking and arguing further for it, I hope, on Tuesday.  I yield the floor.
