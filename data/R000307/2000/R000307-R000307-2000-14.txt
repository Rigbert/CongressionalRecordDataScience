President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:49 p.m., recessed until Wednesday, October 4, 2000, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
