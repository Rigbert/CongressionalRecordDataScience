Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Hayes amendment and in support of H.R. 450.  There has been a lot of talk about which regulations will and will not be affected by the moratorium. Frankly, I have had enough. It's no secret, the administration has identified, in an effort to kill the bill, a select few routine regulations which they say will not continue if this bill is signed into law. Two of those examples are the migratory bird hunting regulations and subsistence hunting regulations in Alaska.  Frankly, I am of the opinion that these activities are permitted--they are routine administrative functions.  However, this amendment is intended to clarify for the Department of the Interior, who apparently cannot read the law, so they can issue regulations for recreational or subsistence hunting, fishing, and camping for the 1995-96 seasons.  I urge my colleagues' support of this amendment which is offered for the benefit of Alaska Natives and the sports men and women of America.
