Mr. Speaker, as all federal agencies are keenly aware, the government is losing many valued employees to retirement. Among them, one stands out for her dedication and commitment--Mrs. Celia Dollarhide, Director of Education Service at the Department of Veterans Affairs, who retired on May 3.  Most veterans don't know Celia Dollarhide by name. Her leadership in setting policy, working with Congress, and ensuring that education benefits are paid has been felt by the hundreds of thousands of veterans and their survivors who received an education under one of the three GI Bills during her tenure.  Celia Dollarhide has devoted her working life to federal service. After taking the federal entrance exam, Celia was highly sought by many federal agencies. Fortunately for veterans, she settled on the Veterans Administration. In 1966, Celia began her career as a claims examiner at the Chicago Regional Office, and in 1972 moved to Washington, DC, to work as an Education Specialist. By 1975, Celia was the Chief of the Program Administration Division in the Education Service. After various management positions within the Veterans Benefits Administration, she became the Deputy Director of the Education Service and in 1994, then-Secretary Jesse Brown promoted her meritoriously to the Senior Executive Service. Celia has served the last six years as Director of Education Service.  Throughout her career, Celia has received numerous awards and professional recognition due to her advocacy and leadership on behalf of veterans and their survivors. It is her core belief--that veterans could achieve so much more with an education--that has driven her to succeed at every turn. There is no way to count the number of people whose lives Celia has affected, and I wouldn't even begin to try.  Mr. Speaker, Celia Dollarhide has met the highest standards to which civil servants can aspire. On behalf of the VA Committee and our staff, I say thank you to this remarkable professional.                          ____________________
