Senator Coburn left the floor. I wished to speak to him about his amendment because it appears to have already been covered in the Isakson-Conrad amendment. I would like to ask if he also feels that way. I would hope he might come back to the floor so we could discuss that.  I also wish to notify the other side I am about to renew my unanimous consent request for a vote on the Boxer amendment. I will not until they have time to talk to the Republican side.
