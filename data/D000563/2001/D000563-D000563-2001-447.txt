 Since this amendment was originally adopted, some people have noted the fact that some incumbents may have cash on hand and that ought to be taken into consideration when you consider the triggers as to millionaires' expenditures. That is what this amendment addresses.  We also had changed the hard money contributions. We have raised the level of the contributions, which affects the same amendment, the Domenici amendment. I am only addressing the cash on hand aspect. I hope my colleagues would agree with me that we want to get as close to possible to a level playing field but not create incumbent advantage. That is what this amendment seeks to do.
