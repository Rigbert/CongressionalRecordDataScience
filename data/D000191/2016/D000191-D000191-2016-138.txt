  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, the lights and the heat are on at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, illegally occupied by ultra rightwing, antigovernment extremists. But you have to wonder if the lights are on or anybody is home down there at the Justice Department. Hello? I don't think there is anybody there.  I believe that this illegal occupation, this destruction of Federal property, was directly emboldened by the fact that the father of the two leaders, Cliven Bundy, stood down the government 2 years ago when he owed $1 million.  Other ranchers pay their grazing fees, and he refuses to do it. He was grazing in areas that were prohibited. He stood down the government at the point of a gun, and he is still illegally grazing.  Nobody--nobody--at the Justice Department has seen fit to lift a finger against him. There is no ongoing prosecution. They haven't put a lien on his cattle.  He celebrated the anniversary of the takeover and said: This is how it is done.  Now his sons are replicating that in my State of Oregon, where we abide by the laws. Yes, we disagree over a lot of Federal policies, but we abide by the laws.  It is time for the Justice Department to take some action. Wake up down there.                          ____________________
