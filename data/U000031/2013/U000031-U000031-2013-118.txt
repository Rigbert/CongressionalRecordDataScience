Speaker, I rise today to recognize a legend in Michigan broadcasting, Pat Moody, on forty remarkable years of service to the greater Michiana area.  A native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, Pat came to Berrien County in 1973 as news director of WSJM Radio. We didn't let him get away. Now four decades later, Pat is the area's most well-recognized on-air personality and host of the popular ``Moody in the Morning'' radio show.  Thousands of households and commuters tune in every morning as Pat informs, enlightens, and entertains. Like that first cup of coffee or newspaper over breakfast, Pat has become a morning staple for folks in Michigan's Great Southwest.  While perhaps best known as the area's favorite radio personality, Pat is also widely recognized as a passionate and engaged member of his community and an outspoken champion of all things Michigan.  Pat has served as Executive Vice President of the Cornerstone Chamber of Commerce for nearly two decades; authors a weekly business column, ``Moody on the Market;'' and has participated in a diverse array of civic organizations and boards, including Lake Michigan College, the Lakeland Regional Health Foundation, Michiana public broadcasting, and the Berrien Community Foundation, just to name a few.  Pat's hard work and selfless commitment to make Southwest Michigan a better place to live, work, and play has rightfully earned him the respect and admiration of the entire region.  It is truly an honor to recognize Pat Moody on reaching this tremendous milestone; to have worked alongside him on so many issues and to call him friend for so many years. Well done and congratulations! He is a local treasure, and we look forward to many, many more years of waking up to his welcoming voice.  But, he's more than just a voice . . . he's a Friend.                          ____________________
