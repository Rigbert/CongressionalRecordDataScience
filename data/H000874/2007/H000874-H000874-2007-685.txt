 There are some problems that are raised because bills failed to pass, military construction being one, the veterans being another, which have put us in a position where if there is not additional language and funding in the bill, and they are, of course, both as a result of the earmarks not being funded and as a result of the caps not being met that was in the Republican budget that passed but did not pass the Congress, and the level of funding in the 2007 bills that did not pass, there need to be some things in there that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Obey are both aware of. As I understand, they are working together in a bipartisan fashion. The staffs are working together.  So I will tell my friend, although I cannot tell you specifically because they are still working on it, as you know from your past experience that these are works in progress, that my expectation is there will be additional funding for programs that will be very adversely affected if they were required to go forward at 2006 levels or the lower of the House- or Senate-passed bills.
