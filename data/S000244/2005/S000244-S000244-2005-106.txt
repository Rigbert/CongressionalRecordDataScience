Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment, and I think we ought to talk about what operational control means.  Under the amendment, it means the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including by terrorists and illegal aliens, and including all narcotics shipments.  The amendment also provides that, within 90 days of enactment, the Department of Homeland Security provides the Congress a comprehensive plan for border surveillance and, within 180 days, DHS provides to Congress a national strategy for border security and a report on progress made.                              {time}  1600  Now these goals are obviously ambitious and the Department of Homeland Security has not been ambitious on anything, in my opinion; but it seems to me by setting deadlines, and then the two committees in their oversight functions can be on the back of the Department of Homeland Security, and we might shame them into doing the right thing.
