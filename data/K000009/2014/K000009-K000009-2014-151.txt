I share the same passion as Congresswoman Lummis. We want to just lift you and be a part of this team for H.R. 863. We hope that everyone listening this evening will cosponsor this important legislation.  As I listened to you talk, I thought I would give some background, having lived through it here. You talk about museums, Congresswoman Maloney, and you go around the Capitol itself, it is a museum, and you go: This doesn't look like America.  For three decades, we have been trying to hang portraits of women who chaired committees in this institution, and it has been a herculean struggle. We finally rehung a portrait in the Education and the Workforce Committee for Mary Norton, who chaired that committee. She wrote some of the most important legislation in this country and was the first woman ever to chair that committee. They had her portrait in a closet--in a closet--just like these statues of suffragettes had to be brought up into the main Capitol.                              {time}  2045  When I first arrived in Congress, there were only the statues. There was the portrait of Pocahontas in the main room, and then the statue on the very top, Liberty, on the top of the Capitol. But as you looked at the other portraits, you never saw women. Well, Congressman Bob Ney of Ohio, who headed House Administration many years ago, heard our plea and he finally arranged to have Jeannette Rankin, a Republican and progressive from Montana, but it took us until the 21st century to do it. She was actually elected before the 19th Amendment was passed to the Constitution. She came from Montana, and we didn't even have her portrait in the Capitol hung.  In addition, Shirley Chisholm of New York, she is now hung on the first floor. She was the first woman of color to run for President of the United States.  The lack of their presence to me is just so blatant, and that is why I want to thank both of you marvelous, marvelous Members and women for seeing this gap in American history.  Even the Women's Room in the Capitol is behind closed doors so the general public doesn't always see the women. It is very interesting. I think we are about to open another door and allow the fullness of American history to come forward.  I would like to place in the Record the names of citizens from northern Ohio:  Toledo's Geraldine Macelwane, appointed the first woman on the Lucas County Common Pleas bench. She won election for four consecutive terms;  Julia Bates, our current county prosecutor in Lucas County, Ohio, and Ohio Supreme Court Justices Alice Robie Resnick and Maureen O'Connor, the only two women ever in American history to be elected to the supreme court of our State;  In northern Ohio, we have sent many fine women. Obviously, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, who serves with us now, and Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones before her, the first two African American women ever elected to Congress from the State of Ohio, now joined by Joyce Beatty of Columbus; Mary Rose Okar; and State legislators Nina Turner, Capri Cafaro, Shirley Smith, Nikki Antonio, Nan Baker, Sandra Williams, Barbara Boyd, Theresa Fedor Edna Brown, Linda Furney and Marijean Valiquette, all women who were trailblazers on the political front.  Toledo has had a woman mayor, Donna Owens. Tina Skeldon Wozniak is a Lucas county commissioner; and Anita Lopez, our county auditor.  Sister Ann Francis Klimkowski was the founding president of Lourdes University, and all of the sisters, the Roman Catholic sisters--the Franciscans, the Sisters of Notre Dame, the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of St. Joseph, and the Ursuline Sisters who served selflessly across this country in hospitals and schools and gave themselves to their communities almost unrecognized. There was a traveling display of them that finally went around the country, and I hope that becomes a part of this museum. They gave their lives for us.  All of those women helped build us and on whose shoulders we are standing, and, as with Congresswoman Lummis, I just wish to place in the Record--when I was young, I thought I would go to the Air Force Academy, and when I sent my letter in and was rejected because I was a woman, I didn't really completely put it together in my mind. I just tried to do something else, and so I applied to Notre Dame University, and was rejected because I was a woman. They didn't allow women to be students there in those days. And then finally to the FBI. I thought it would be great to work for my country. I would be a female Elliot Ness. And, of course, I was rejected because a woman.  So another door always opened, but in the area in which I grew up, it wasn't possible.  Finally, let me say in memory of our mother, who was never able to obtain her degrees until after she retired. She had a very hard life, and received her high school degree after she went on Social Security. One of her very first jobs was working in a restaurant where, when the minimum wage went into effect her boss, who was an animal, basically cashed the check with the additional amount in it, and then he kept the difference. We didn't have enforcement at the Department of Labor. So each of us have stories about what happened in our lives, and they deserve recording in a museum for the women of America.
