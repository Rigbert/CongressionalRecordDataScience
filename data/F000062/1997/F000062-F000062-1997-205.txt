 President, consistent with my remarks made both on the 14th and today, it will be my intention to vote against the Daschle substitute amendment to H.R. 1122.  I made the argument that I believe both H.R. 1122 as well as the Daschle substitute are unconstitutional.  With respect to the Daschle amendment, my reading of it indicates that, even if a severely, horribly deformed fetus were capable of only 1 hour of life outside the womb, a woman would be forced to carry that pregnancy to full term and deliver that child, without consideration of what may be severely debilitating consequences to her health.  For me that is not enlightened public policy, and I cannot support it.  Additionally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to me from Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard University, which more definitively spells out the constitutional vulnerability of the Daschle amendment.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Harvard University Law School,                                      Cambridge, MA, May 15, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I've been surprised to learn that      some people are evidently confused about whether the health      exception contained in Senator Daschle's proposed legislation      complies with the constitutional requirements set forth in      Roe and Casey. You've asked me to put in writing my      explanation of why the Daschle exception is constitutionally      insufficient, and I'm glad to do so.       Both Roe and Casey unambiguously hold that a state may not      prohibit any post-viability abortion that is ``necessary, in      appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the      life or health of the mother.'' The Daschle language would      forbid abortion of a viable fetus unless the physician      certifies that continuing the pregnancy ``would threaten the      mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical      health,'' and goes on to explain that even this narrowed      health exception--which impermissibly excludes medically      diagnosable risks, however severe, to the woman's mental      health and which requires the physician to certify that the      physical injury to the woman would be ``grievous''--is      inapplicable unless the ``severely debilitating disease or      impairment'' that the physician believes requires termination      of pregnancy is ``specifically caused by the pregnancy.''      Thus, although a pregnancy may be terminated without      violating Daschle if its continuation would cause what the      proposed statute calls ``an inability to provide necessary      treatment for a life-threatening condition,'' a pregnancy may      not be terminated without violating Daschle if its      continuation would cause only an inability to provide      necessary treatment for a severely debilitating but not life-     threatening condition.       The upshot is that the Daschle language would criminalize      at least three categories of post-viability abortions that,      under Roe and Casey, may not be prohibited:       First, abortions that are regarded by the woman and her      physician as necessary to avoid medically diagnosable injury      to mental health, including suicidal depression that might      result from having to carry to term a fetus so severely      deformed (as in a case of anencephaly, for instance) that it      would be born only to die hours later after a brief and      painful life;       Second, abortions that are required because, in the      judgment of the woman and her physician, continuing the      pregnancy would seriously and permanently threaten the      woman's physical and/or mental health but not by bringing      about what the physician could certify is a ``severely      debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the      pregnancy;''       Third, and to some degree encompassed within the second      point above, abortions that are medically required because      continuing the pregnancy would preclude the provision of      necessary treatment for a condition that, although not life-     threatening, would indeed amount to a ``severely debilitating      impairment''--such as, for instance, permanent inability to      bear children in the future, or permanent impairment of some      important bodily capacity or function such as, e.g., vision--     but not an impairment that is ``specifically caused by the      pregnancy.''       I should stress the arbitrariness of the exclusion, from      the Daschle language, of impairments in the latter category.      If a woman is pregnant with a viable fetus in circumstances      where the pregnancy itself, unless terminated, would cause a      severe impairment (say, to kidney function), the Daschle bill      would permit her to obtain an abortion. If the same woman is      pregnant with the same viable fetus where the pregnancy      itself causes no impairment but where the continuation of      that pregnancy would make impossible the use of certain drugs      or procedures (because those drugs or procedures would cause      severe deformity in the fetus, for instance, as is often the      case with chemotherapy or radiation therapy) without which      the woman would suffer an even more severe impairment (say,      to kidney and liver function and future reproductive      capacity), the Daschle bill would make it a crime for her      doctor to perform the same abortion. This arbitrary      distinction would in all likelihood violate the Due Process      Clause of the Fifth Amendment even apart from Roe and Casey,      bit in any event it seems undeniable that it would violate      the principles laid down in those decisions, which quite      pointedly focus on whether the abortion is necessary to      preserve ``the life or health of the mother,'' not on the      (quite irrelevant) issue of whether the pregnancy itself      endangers her life or health.       The Daschle bill recognizes that the key question is the      necessity of the abortion and not what the pregnancy itself      might cause when it comes to what it calls ``life-     threatening'' conditions, making clear that a pregnancy may      be terminated if it causes an ``inability to provide      necessary treatment'' for such conditions. The glaring      omission of any parallel provision for terminating a      pregnancy that causes an inability to provide necessary      treatment for severely debilitating even if not life-     threatening conditions, or an inability to provide procedures      that would prevent the development of such conditions, cannot      be squared with the requirements of Roe and Casey.       For these reasons, I cannot understand how anyone could      doubt the inconsistency of the Daschle language with the      requirements of the Constitution as construed in Roe and      Casey. I can readily understand the political temptation of      some to sign onto a measure that seems less drastic and      dangerous from some perspectives than Santorum, and this      letter is not intended to address the political pros and cons      of various positions. I think it would be a tragedy, however,      for Senators, or the White House, to proceed on the basis of      demonstrably indefensible readings of the Daschle language or      of Roe v. Wade or both.           Sincerely yours,                                                Laurence H. Tribe.
