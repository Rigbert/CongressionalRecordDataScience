 I am proud of the commitment we have made in this bill to safe water programs, particularly with regard to Africa, and I agree that nothing in this bill would preclude USAID funds from matching the good work of these dedicated private, nonprofit organizations. In fact, it is my understanding that USAID has provided $1.1 billion these last 2 years to leverage over $3.7 billion in private funds for a variety of projects including safe water.
