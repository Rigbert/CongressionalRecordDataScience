Thank you, Madam Chair.  First of all, I want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Ike Skelton, for the fantastic job he has done on this mark. He has done it in a bipartisan fashion. And also, of greatest importance, this mark funds the war that we are fighting.  We have troops in the field in harm's way. We fund the priorities that they need right now. And given all of the demands on the Armed Services Committee, that is no easy feat.
