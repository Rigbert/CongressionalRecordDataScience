Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3313, the Marriage Protection Act, simply prevents one or more Federal judges from striking down the provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, that protects States from having to recognize same sex marriage licenses granted in other States.  This bill will prevent unelected lifetime appointed Federal judges from taking away from the States their right codified in DOMA to reject same sex marriage licenses issued elsewhere if States so choose.  DOMA passed the Congress overwhelmingly in the House by a vote of 342 to 67 and in the Senate by a vote of 85 to 14, and it was signed into law by President Clinton.                              {time}  1315  This afternoon we will hear from opponents of this bill that this is an unprecedented move to restrict the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. This is not the case.  Beginning with the first Congress, when the Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed, the jurisdiction of the Federal courts was limited; and since that time, Congress has passed enactments either expanding or restricting the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, whether it be in the area of diversity jurisdiction or elsewhere, including the interpretation of Federal laws.  Just less than 2 years ago, as a part of a supplemental appropriations bill, the Congress enacted a provision inserted by Senator Daschle of South Dakota preventing Federal court review of determinations made on the clearing of brush on Indian reservations in South Dakota. That was not called an assault on the Constitution by anyone. It was merely a determination by the Congress that these types of questions should not be reviewed judicially, and that is very clearly authorized by article III, section 2 of the Constitution.  Today, we are talking about an issue of whether the Federal courts can interpret the Defense of Marriage Act to take away the right of the State to determine its own marriage laws.  We have heard earlier in this debate that the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts in an interpretation of States rights made the determination that it was unconstitutional to deny marriage licenses, and in that one State only, to persons of the same gender who applied for such a license. What this bill will do is to prevent a Federal court from exporting the decision of a divided court in a single State to the other States.  I do not believe that when James Madison wrote the Constitution his idea of federalism was to allow a divided court in a single State to set national policy, and I sincerely doubt the Constitution would have been ratified had that been the notion that pervaded Philadelphia in 1787 and in the State legislatures elsewhere.  What we are doing here is restoring the Federal system. We are restoring a Federal system in an area that has always been conceded to be the province of the State.  Now, a lot of people will also argue against this bill saying that the danger is not there. I am here to say that the danger is real.  Just 2 days ago, a lesbian couple married in Massachusetts filed the first lawsuit in a Florida Federal court to set Federal precedent and to strike down DOMA's protection that allows States not to recognize same-sex marriage licenses issued in Massachusetts. The attorney for the plaintiffs explicitly stated he filed the case because he wants a Federal court to force every State to recognize same-sex marriage licenses issued in Massachusetts, whether the people of that State agree or not.  Now, the laws of Florida are different than the laws of Massachusetts. Florida should be allowed to make its own laws and to enforce its own laws and not to have residents who disagree with those laws run to Massachusetts and come back and force a Federal judge to recognize that license in Massachusetts.  The threat that is posed to traditional marriage by a handful of Federal judges whose decisions can have an impact across State boundaries has renewed concern about abuse of power from the Federal judiciary. This concern has roots as old and venerable as our Nation's history and is nothing new in the year 2004.  Thomas Jefferson wrote of Federal judges: ``Their power is the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible to the elective control.''  Abraham Lincoln said in his first inaugural address in 1861: ``The candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers having, to that extent, practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.''  This statement by Abraham Lincoln was in the wake of the Dred Scott decision, a decision of the Supreme Court which was the single most important spark that began a civil war which to this day was the most bloody conflict in our history.  A remedy to abuses by Federal judges has long been understood to lie, among other places, in Congress's ability to limit Federal court jurisdiction. H.R. 3313 would prevent a few Federal judges from rewriting State marriage recognition laws in ways that do not reflect the will of the people. Nothing in this bill denies anyone their day in court. The bill simply provides that in cases involving DOMA's protection of States rights, those cases are to be brought in State court.  The door of the courthouse is not slammed shut. The people who were married in Massachusetts and want to get recognition of their marriage elsewhere, it is the State courthouse that they go to, not the Federal courthouse.  Any Member who wishes to protect the Defense of Marriage Act's protections for States from invalidation by Federal judges should support this bill. The vast majority of Members of the House represent States that have passed laws that specifically rely on the right of the States codified in DOMA to resist same-sex marriage licenses issued out of State.  The Constitution clearly provides that the lower Federal courts are entirely creatures of the Congress, as is the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, excluding only the Supreme Court's very limited original jurisdiction over cases involving ambassadors and cases in which States have legal claims against each other.  In The Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton made clear the broad nature of Congress's authority to amend Federal court decisions to remedy perceived abuse. He wrote, describing the Constitution, that ``it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such exceptions, and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove the inconveniences'' which are posed by decisions of the Federal judiciary.  That understanding prevails today. As a leading treatise on Federal court jurisdiction has pointed out: ``Beginning with the first Judiciary Act in 1789, Congress has never vested the Federal courts with the entire `judicial power' that would be permitted by article III'' of the Constitution. Even the famously liberal Justice William Brennan wrote a Supreme Court opinion that said: ``Virtually all matters that might be heard in article III Federal courts could also be left by Congress to State courts.''  The United States Constitution applies to the State courts. That was made clear in the 14th amendment.  Limiting Federal court jurisdiction to avoid abuses is not a partisan issue. Senate Minority Leader Daschle, as I have previously indicated, supported legislation enacted during the last Congress that denies the Federal court jurisdiction over the procedures governing timber projects in order to expedite forest clearing. If limiting the jurisdiction of the Federal court is good enough to protect trees, it sure ought to be good enough to protect a State's marriage policy.  Far from violating the separation of powers, legislation that leaves State courts with jurisdiction to decide certain classes of cases would be an exercise of one of the very checks and balances provided for in the Constitution. No branch of the Federal Government can be entrusted with absolute power and certainly not a handful of tenured Federal judges appointed for life. The Constitution allows the exercise of judicial power, but it does not grant the Federal courts the unchecked power to define the limits of its own power.  Integral to the American constitutional system is each branch of government's responsibility to use its powers to prevent overreaching by the other branches. H.R. 3313 does just that, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
