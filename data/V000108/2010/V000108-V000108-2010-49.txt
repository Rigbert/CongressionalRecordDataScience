With the current economic struggles facing our nation, it is fitting that this year's theme focuses on honoring those individuals and organizations that have had an immense impact on society during our most difficult times. Throughout our nation's history, time and time again, African American communities have found strength and purpose in coming together to rise above unfortunate circumstances, and I rise today to pay tribute to those who have demonstrated such remarkable leadership.  The theme for this year's Black History Month, The History of Black Economic Empowerment, is a reminder that in striving for a greater society, we must examine the past. Few organizations can match the impact that the National Urban League has had on promoting economic empowerment in our nation's urban communities. The National Urban League has been a cornerstone of communities across America in carrying out its mission, to enable African Americans to secure economic self-reliance, parity, power and civil rights. As the National Urban League celebrates a remarkable milestone, its 100th anniversary, we take this time to remember the outstanding contributions of those visionaries who sought to bring about hope during the bleakest of times and to recognize those who have carried on their work.  As the Representative for the First Congressional District of Indiana, I have had the pleasure of representing the Urban League of Northwest Indiana and the honor of knowing one of the organization's most influential members, Ms. Eloise Gentry. Ms. Gentry passed away on August 20, 2009, after leading the Urban League of Northwest Indiana for more than thirty years. While Ms. Gentry is missed by all of Northwest Indiana, the impact she has had on her community, not only as the president and chief executive officer of the Urban League but also as an educator in the Gary Community School Corporation and in her many other community service undertakings, will continue to resonate for generations to come. As an educator, activist, and community leader, Ms. Gentry has touched thousands of lives.  As her obituary read, ``First and foremost, Eloise Gentry was an EDUCATOR.'' I cannot think of a more fitting one-word description. From those she taught in the classroom to those she worked closely with at the Urban League to those whose lives she improved through her work, everyone who had the pleasure of knowing Ms. Gentry learned from her, if not by her words then by her example.  While we have lost a pillar of our community, Eloise Gentry's lasting impression and the efforts of the Urban League of Northwest Indiana continue on today. Under the leadership of newly appointed president and chief executive officer, Vanessa Allen, the Urban League of Northwest Indiana, along with the more than one hundred local affiliates across America, continues to strive to provide economic empowerment and educational opportunities for African Americans while seeking to ensure their civil rights.  It is the efforts of organizations like the National Urban League and its affiliates that allow us to reflect on what makes the United States of America so special. While the United States is made up of people from so many different racial, religious, social, and ideologicalbackgrounds, it is the vision and leadership of people like Eloise Gentry, who have sought to improve the quality of life for all Americans, that has made America what it is.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing the tireless dedication of the members of organizations such as the National Urban League, who continue their selfless work today, and I ask that you join me in remembering a true hero, Ms. Eloise Gentry, one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens.                          ____________________
