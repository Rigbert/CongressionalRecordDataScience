  A point was made last night that extending the user fees in section 502 has no impact on the U.S. Customs Service budget. That is baloney. If it has no impact, why is it in the bill in the first place? Obviously, it is in the bill because it has an impact on budget scoring. Once CBO scores these funds against the Patients' Bill of Rights, these funds cannot be used by the U.S. Customs Service for customs modernization.
