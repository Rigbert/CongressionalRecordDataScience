I have been urging since last year that these consensus nominees be considered promptly and confirmed. If Senators would follow the Golden Rule, that would happen without further delay.  I ask unanimous consent that the Judicial Council letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection the material was orderd to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                November 15, 2010.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeff Sessions,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Gentlemen: We write on behalf of the courts of the Ninth      Circuit. As you know, the Ninth Circuit is by far the largest      federal circuit in the country, encompassing the 9 western      states, plus the territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of      the Northern Mariana Islands. Approximately one fifth of the      population of the United States lives within the borders of      the Ninth Circuit. Our case-load reflects the diversity of      our territory and the people that inhabit it and is heavily      impacted by increased immigration enforcement, drug      interdiction activities, prison litigation, bankruptcy and      environmental cases--to name just a few of the most active      areas.       In order to do our work, and serve the public as Congress      expects us to serve it, we need the resources to carry out      our mission. While there are many areas of serious need, we      write today to emphasize our desperate need for judges. Our      need in that regard has been amply documented (See attached      March 2009 Judicial Conference Recommendations for Additional      Judgeships). Courts cannot do their work if authorized      judicial positions remain vacant.       While we could certainly use more judges, and hope that      Congress will soon approve the additional judgeships      requested by the Judicial Conference, we would be greatly      assisted if our judicial vacancies--some of which have been      open for several years and declared ``judicial      emergencies''--were to be filled promptly. We respectfully      request that the Senate act on judicial nominees without      delay.           Sincerely,         Alex Kozinski, Chief Judge, Ninth Circuit;         Sidney R. Thomas, Circuit Judge, Ninth Circuit;         Ronald M. Gould, Circuit Judge, Ninth Circuit;         Audrey B. Collins, Chief Judge, Central District of            California;         Vaughn R.

Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeff Sessions,     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, and      Senator Sessions: I write to express my concern with the pace      of judicial confirmations in the United States Senate.      Yesterday, the Senate recessed without confirming a single      one of the 23 Federal judicial nominations pending on the      Executive Calendar. The Federal judiciary and the American      people it serves suffer the most from this unprecedented      obstruction. One in eight seats on the Federal bench sits      empty, and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has      declared that many of those vacancies constitute judicial      emergencies. Despite the urgent and pressing need to fill     these important posts, a minority of Senators has      systematically and irresponsibly used procedural maneuvers to      block or delay confirmation votes on judicial nominees--     including nominees that have strong bipartisan support and      the most distinguished records. The minority has even been      blocking non-controversial nominees--a dramatic shift from      past practice that could cause a crisis in the judiciary.       The Judiciary Committee has promptly considered my judicial      nominees. Nonetheless, judicial confirmation rates in this      Congress have reached an all-time low. At this point in the      prior Administration (107th Congress), the Senate had      confirmed 61% of the President's judicial nominations. By      contrast, the Senate has confirmed less than half of the      judicial nominees it has received in my Administration.      Nominees in the 107th Congress waited less than a month on      the floor of the Senate before a vote on their confirmation.      The men and women whom I have nominated who have been      confirmed to the Courts of Appeals waited five times longer      and those confirmed to the District Courts waited three times      longer for final votes.       Right now, 23 judicial nominees await simple up-or-down      votes. All of these nominees have the strongest backing from      their home-state Senators--a fact that usually counsels in      favor of swift confirmation, rather than delay. Sixteen of      those men and women received unanimous support in the      Judiciary Committee. Nearly half of the nominees on the floor      were selected for seats that have gone without judges for      anywhere between 200 and 1,600 days. But despite these      compelling circumstances, and the distinguished careers led      by these candidates, these nominations have been blocked.       Judge Albert Diaz, the well-respected state court judge I      nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth      Circuit, has waited 245 days for an up-or-down vote--more      than 8 months. Before becoming a judge, Diaz served for over      10 years in the United States Marine Corps as an attorney and      military judge. If confirmed, he would be the first Hispanic      to sit on the Fourth Circuit. The seat to which he was      nominated has been declared a judicial emergency. Judge Diaz      has the strong support of both of North Carolina's Senators.      Senator Burr has publicly advocated for Judge Diaz to get a      final vote by the Senate. And just before the August recess,      Senator Hagan went to the floor of the Senate to ask for an      up-or-down vote for Judge Diaz. Her request was denied.       We are seeing in this case what we have seen in all too      many others: resistance to highly qualified candidates who,      if put to a vote, would be unanimously confirmed, or      confirmed with virtually no opposition. For example, Judge      Beverly Martin waited 132 days for a floor vote--despite      being strongly backed by both of Georgia's Republican      Senators. When the Senate finally held a vote, she was      confirmed to the Eleventh Circuit unanimously. Jane Stanch      was recently confirmed by an overwhelming majority of the      Senate, after waiting almost 300 days for a final vote. Even      District Court nominees have waited 3 or more months for      confirmation votes--only to be confirmed unanimously.       Proceeding this way will put our judiciary on a dangerous      course, as the Department of Justice projects that fully half      of the Federal judiciary will be vacant by 2020 if we      continue on the current pace of judicial confirmations. The      real harm of this political game-playing falls on the      American people, who turn to the courts for justice. By      denying these nominees a simple up-or-down vote, the      Republican leadership is undermining the ability of our      courts to deliver justice to those in need. All Americans      depend on having well-qualified men and women on the bench to      resolve important legal matters--from working mothers seeking      timely compensation for their employment discrimination      claims to communities hoping for swift punishment for      perpetrators of crimes to small business owners seeking      protection from unfair and anticompetitive practices.       As a former Senator, I have the greatest respect for the      Senate's role in providing advice and consent on judicial      nominations. If there is a genuine concern about the      qualifications of judicial nominees, that is a debate I      welcome. But the consistent refusal to move promptly to have      that debate, or to confirm even those nominees with broad,      bipartisan support, does a disservice to the greatest      traditions of this body and the American people it serves. In      the 107th Congress, the Judiciary Committee reported 100      judicial nominees, and all of them were confirmed by the      Senate before the end of that Congress. I urge the Senate to      similarly consider and confirm my judicial nominees.           Sincerely,     Barack Obama.                                  ____                                               U.S. District Court                                 for the District of Columbia,                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2010.     Re: Judicial Vacancies--United States District Court for the          District of Columbia.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     The Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the      judges of the United States District Court for the District      of Columbia, I request that the Senate act soon to fill the      vacancies that exist at our Court.       Of our 15 authorized judgeships, we currently have four      vacancies. One has been vacant since January 2007. With the      additional vacancy that will result from Judge Ricardo M.      Urbina's assumption of senior status, effective January 31,      2011, this Court faces the prospect of having only 10 of its      15 authorized judgeships filled. The severe impact of this      situation already is being felt and will only increase over      time. The challenging caseload that our Court regularly      handles includes many involving national security issues, as      well as other issues of national significance. A large number      of these complex, high-profile cases demand significant time      and attention from each of our judges.       Without a complement of new judges, it is difficult to      foresee how our remaining active judges will be able to keep      up with the heavy volume of cases that faces us. A 33 percent      vacancy ratio is quite extraordinary.       Two nominees (Beryl Howell and Robert Wilkins) have been      reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and await      floor votes; two nominees (James Boasberg and Amy Jackson)      have had their hearings and hopefully will soon be reported      out of Committee.       We hope the Senate will act quickly to fill this Court's      vacancies so the citizens of the District of Columbia and the      Federal Government and other litigants who appear before us      continue to enjoy the high quality of justice they deserve.           Sincerely,                                                Royce C. Lamberth,     Chief Judge.                                  ____                                     American Bar Association,                                      Chicago, IL, August 5, 2010.     Hon. Barack Obama,     President of the United States of America,     The White House, Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeff Sessions,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear President Obama, Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader      McConnell, Chairman Leahy, and Senator Sessions: Now that the      Senate has concluded another historic debate and vote on a      nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court and is about to recess for      its summer break, I am writing to express the American Bar      Association's mounting concern over the persistently high      number of judicial vacancies on our federal district courts      and courts of appeals. I urge you, upon your return to      Washington in September, to make the filling of judicial      vacancies a priority for the Administration and for the      Senate. As lawyers who represent our clients in federal      courts across this nation, members of the American Bar      Association know first hand that longstanding vacancies and      protracted delays in the nomination and confirmation process      do great harm to the federal judiciary and to public life.       Despite the confirmation of 37 Article III judges during      the 111th Congress, the vacancy rate has not dropped below 10      percent since last August. For the past six months, the      vacancy rate has remained at over 11 percent, and the number      of vacancies has hovered around the 100 mark. The lack of      progress in reducing the vacancy rate this session is      especially worrisome in light of the number of judges who      have reached, or are fast approaching, retirement age:      eighteen judges have announced their intention to retire in      the next year, and several additional vacancies will no doubt      arise as a result of judicial elevations, deaths and      resignations. If the nomination and confirmation process does      not speed up significantly, confirmations will not even keep      pace with the rate of attrition. The high number of      vacancies, combined with the low number of confirmations, has      created a problem that is fast approaching crisis      proportions.       Vacancies have different effects on different courts. Those      courts with relatively normal caseloads per judgeship and a      sufficient number of active judges may be able to absorb the      extra workload and operate normally if vacancies are filled      within a reasonable time. In contrast, courts that already      are operating with staggering caseloads and too few      authorized judgeships are strained beyond capacity by      unfilled vacancies and are unable to keep up with the      workload.       In these jurisdictions, persistent vacancies make it      impossible for the remaining judges on the court to give each      case the time it deserves; community and business life      suffers because shorthanded courts have no choice but to      delay civil trial dockets due to the Speedy Trial Act; and      courts are forced to adopt time-saving procedures, some of      which may serve efficiency at the price of altering the      delivery and quality of justice over time in ways not      intended. The harm caused by persistent vacancies on these      courts may reach into the future, too: if no abatement of      these conditions is in sight, the specter of this kind of      work environment is likely to result in additional judicial      retirements and resignations and deter excellent attorneys      from seeking positions on the federal bench.       Lawyers who practice regularly in the federal courts and      their clients who expect timely judicial resolution of their      disputes are deeply concerned that the partisanship that has      long characterized the process and the persistently high      number of vacancies are creating strains that will inevitably      reduce the quality of our justice system and erode public      confidence in the independence and impartiality of our      federal courts. This is a result we, as a nation, can ill-     afford: all three branches must be robust and strong to      advance the important work of government.       We urge you to take immediate action to avert a potential      crisis and preserve the quality and vitality of the federal      judiciary, and we offer the following suggestions:       1. The President and the Senate should make the prompt      filling of federal judicial vacancies a priority. Each party      to the process should commit sufficient time and resources to      the endeavor, and resolve to work cooperatively and across      the political aisle to reduce the vacancy rate as quickly as      possible. A commitment should be made to cultivate a process      that is dominated by common purpose and a spirit of mutual      respect and bipartisan cooperation.       Politics and bipartisanship are not mutually exclusive.      Even though the judicial nomination and confirmation process      is political by design and gives each branch an opportunity      to exercise a check on the quality of the federal bench, it      should not serve as a battleground for other political      disputes. A renewed spirit of bipartisanship is essential to      reducing the backlog of vacancies and improving the process.       2. The Administration should make a concerted effort to      shorten the time between vacancy and nomination and to submit      a nomination to the Senate for every outstanding Article III      judicial vacancy. The Administration should make a special      effort to act with due diligence to nominate individuals to      the vacant judicial seats that the Administrative Office of      the United States Courts has classified as ``judicial      emergencies'' (42 now exist), based on a combination of the      length of time the seat has been vacant and the number of      weighted or adjusted case filings for that seat.       We commend the Administration for its commitment to engage      in meaningful prenomination consultation with home-state      senators, a concept that the ABA endorsed in 2007 as a means      to reduce partisanship. As a result, many nominations have      had the backing of both home-state senators, regardless of      party affiliation. Unfortunately, even though prenomination      consultation has increased bipartisan accord during the      initial phases of the process, it has not insulated nominees      from partisan politics on the Senate floor: senators have      blocked or delayed the consideration of numerous nominees who      have the support of their home-state senators as well as the      overwhelming support of the Senate Judiciary Committee.       3. The Senate should give every nominee an up-or-down vote      within a reasonable time after the nomination is reported by      the Senate Judiciary Committee.       Dilatory tactics have been used repeatedly to stall Senate      floor consideration of judicial nominees, starting with the      first nomination to reach the floor for a vote. Even though      the Senate has confirmed 25 nominees this session, the Senate      Judiciary Committee has reported out nominees far faster than      the Senate has scheduled votes. As a result, the backlog of      nominees awaiting floor action has steadily increased over      the course of the session.       Twelve of the 21 nominees currently awaiting floor      consideration were approved by unanimous consent, unanimous      vote, or voice vote of the committee; two were approved with      little dissent, and only seven received significant      opposition. That almost two-thirds of them had no or little      opposition in committee, combined with the fact that many      prior nominees subjected to delayed floor consideration      ultimately were confirmed by unanimous or almost unanimous      vote, strongly suggests that the failure to schedule timely      floor votes on many pending nominees has little or nothing to      do with their qualifications.       Tactics to delay votes on nominees that are launched for      reasons not associated with their qualifications blatantly      inject politics into the process. Such tactics waste the time      of the Senate and increase the time a nominee is in limbo.      Worst of all, they needlessly deprive the federal courts of      the judges they sorely need.       Senate leaders should seek to avoid scheduling delays over      nominees who have bipartisan support and should discourage      and dissuade their colleagues from using the judicial      confirmation process to advance or defeat other legislative      objectives. If legitimate concerns are raised over a      nominee's qualifications for a lifetime appointment to the      federal bench, sufficient time should be scheduled to permit      the Senate to engage in full debate. The objective should not      be to rush consideration of nominees whose qualifications are      questioned, but to assure timely consideration of every      judicial nominee whose nomination has been approved by the      Senate Judiciary Committee and forwarded to the Senate for a      confirmation vote.       We urge all members of the Senate to remain cognizant of      the central importance of a fully staffed federal judiciary      and to make an effort to reach across the aisle to try to      find constructive ways to support the judiciary and protect      it from excessive political zeal. We believe that a true      respect for the importance of the federal courts will best      inform each senator's decision with regard to action on      pending judicial nominations.       Our judicial system is predicated on the principles that      each case deserves to be evaluated on its merits, that      justice will be dispensed even-handedly, and that justice      delayed is justice denied. There may be disagreements with      individual decisions rendered by the federal courts, but few      would dispute their essential role in our system of      government and their impact on daily life. Congress should      take action to support, not undermine, the vital work of the      federal courts.       We urge the President and the Senate to take all necessary      steps to fill existing vacancies promptly and to restore      bipartisan accord to the nomination and confirmation process      so that the federal courts will not be deprived of the judges      they need to do their important work.           Sincerely,                                                  Carolyn B. Lamm,     President.                                  ____                 [From the Washington Watch, Oct. 2010]          October 201: Vacancy Signs at the Federal Courthouse                            (By Bruce Moyer)       The federal judicial confirmation process is at one of its      most dysfunctional junctures in American history, and its      failure to move nominees has brought about a vacancy crisis      in our federal courts. This is not a partisan issue with      shades of black and white; the breakdown in the Senate owes      itself as much to one party as the other. This is a national      issue that speaks to the country's declining appreciation for      its courts, the increasing corrosiveness of our politics, and      the rising abuse in the Senate of its procedures.       As the Senate departed Washington on Sept. 30 for a six-     week election recess, 103 federal Article III judgeships      stood vacant, equaling nearly one out of every eight federal      judgeships. The Judicial Conference says that 48 of these      vacant judgeships constitute ``judicial emergencies,''      meaning they have been vacant for at least 18 months and are      in districts or circuits dealing with pressing caseloads.       Judicial vacancies are harmful. They prevent the courts      from operating at their full capacity in dispensing fair,      prompt justice. Vacancies mean larger dockets, longer delay,      and greater pressure and expense for lawyers and litigants.      As Slate legal columnists Dahlia Lithwick and Carl Tobias      recently commented, ``Crowded dockets mean longer waits for      cases to be heard promptly. This affects thousands of      ordinary Americans--plaintiffs and defendants--whose liberty,      safety, or job may be at stake and for whom justice may      arrive too late, if at all.'' Justice Anthony Kennedy said it      best, in comments to the Los Angeles Times: ``It's important      for the public to understand that the excellence of the      federal judiciary is at risk. If judicial excellence is cast      upon a sea of congressional indifference, the rule of law is      imperiled.''       Under the Constitution, the U.S. Senate is the sole entity      charged with the responsibility to ``advise and consent''      upon the President's appointment of judges. Despite the      Founders' straightforward wishes, the judicial confirmation      process has grown distorted before our very eyes. Over the      past 30 years, the Senate has increasingly stonewalled or      rejected the President's judicial nominees, regardless of      party. Confirmation rates at 18 months into a presidency have      fallen from the high-water mark set in 1982 by President      Reagan (93 percent) to 47 percent today (the percentage of      President Obama's nominees who have won Senate confirmation).      These numbers--along with opaque, obstructionist ``secret      holds'' on nominations and unprecedented use of the      filibuster--reflect a process more like ``Advice & Dissent,''      the apt title of Sarah Binder and Forrest Maltzman's recent      work on the struggle to shape the federal judiciary.       Finger pointing by the two main U.S. political parties is      in overdrive over how the process has devolved and who is at      fault. If the confirmation wars expand and increase,      regardless of which party takes control of the Senate, the      implications for the future are even more troubling. In      August, Assistant Attorney General Christopher H. Schroeder      warned an audience of Ninth Circuit judges and lawyers that      if the current rate of replacing retired, resigned, and      deceased judges continues, nearly half of the 875 federal      judgeships could be vacant by the end of the decade.       When the Senate left Washington for its election recess, it      abandoned its responsibility to provide an up-or-down vote on      16 federal judicial nominees--all of whom were favorably      approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with strong      bipartisan support. One nominee, Albert Diaz, who would be      the first Hispanic judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals      for the Fourth Circuit, has waited the longest: the Senate      Judiciary Committee favorably reported his nomination to the      Senate back in January.       The Federal Bar Association's mission is to promote the      effective crafting and administration of justice and      jurisprudence in our federal courts. That cannot happen if      judgeships remain vacant at current levels. Over the past      year, the FBA has called upon Senate leaders of both parties      to hasten their work on judicial confirmations to assure that      nominees who have been favorably reported out of the Senate      Judiciary Committee are assured of a prompt up-or-down vote      in the Senate. The association also has     encouraged the President to promptly nominate qualified      nominees with dispatch. FBA chapters in districts and      circuits with pending judicial nominees have contacted their      home-state senators to urge a prompt vote on their nominees.      This advocacy must continue.       Will the FBA help to make a difference? If the FBA doesn't      raise its voice, who will?                          ____________________
