President, if I could respond to the senior Senator from Texas, he raises an excellent point. I would bring up a quote that is just one of those 22 quotes in which the President has said over and over again that he would like to do more on immigration, that he was very disappointed the House didn't take up the comprehensive immigration bill but that his hands were tied. I believe at one point he even said, ``I am not a king.''
