Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona, and surrounding communities, has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Bud Gordon is one of these individuals. On March 22, 2003, Bud will be honored at the annual YMCA Ira D ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Awards Dinner.  For the past several years, Bud has volunteered and supported many of our most recognizable civic projects in Corona. He has served as the Executive Chairman of the Happy Hairston Youth Foundation and with late Happy Hairston, chaired the golf tournament for many years. Over the past seven years, Bud also has raised over one milliondollars for local charities while serving as the Chairman for numerous golf tournaments that benefited local groups such as the Fender Museum Foundation, the Boy Scouts, the ARC Angel Foundation and the Happy Hairston Youth Foundation. He has also served as a committee member on several other charity golf tournaments such as the American Cancer Societies, The Boys and Girls Club of Temecula, and the Corona Regional Medical Center.  In addition to his service on established charitable organizations, Bud initiated a new program called ``The Cool Down Corona Program''. During the hot summer months, senior citizens without air conditioning were suffering needlessly. Bud decided to go down to the local hardware store and purchase 30 window air conditioners. He then contacted the Corona Police Department, the Corona Fire Department and the Corona Senior Center and obtained the names of seniors in our community that did not have air conditioners. Over the past few years the program has grown and every year more seniors are helped during the summer months with much needed relief.  Bud also co-founded the At Risk Children Foundation, or ARC Angel Foundation and has raised and given back to the community over half a million dollars in goods and services. One of the first activities organized by ARC Angel was to take 700 children from lowincome families to an Anaheim Angels ballgame at Edison Field, many of whom had never been out outside the city of Corona. Bud personally ftmded the tickets, food, souvenirs, and a mobile disc jockey.  One of the defining moments in Bud's charitable record, was his involvement after September 11, 2001. On the weekend following the tragedy, Bud gave away United States flags to anyone who came into his car dealership requesting a flag. He also offered to donate $100 to the New York Relief Fund for each car that was sold in the name of that customer. On the week anniversary of September 11th, Bud closed the dealership at noon to have a brief program in remembrance of the victims. Local firefighters and police were honored and Bud announced he would match funds for anyone who would like to donate money to the relief efforts.  Bud has set a standard of excellence and commitment in his work with charity. His tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. His involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives the ``Ira D. Calvert Distinguished Service Award''.                          ____________________
