Chairman, it seems to me we have been about the business over the last few days in this Congress of saying if we do not agree with your views, we are going to find a way to penalize you. We are going to find a way to try to intimidate you. We are going to try to find a way to quite you, to shut you up. That is not America. That is beneath us.  This amendment is beneath us. All of us know it is directed at the PIRG's, and all of us have had an opportunity to be annoyed by the PIRG's. But, very frankly, I am annoyed by a lot of people, and I am sure I annoy a lot of people, and that is the greatness of America. We get the opportunity to annoy one another.  Let us continue that right in America.
