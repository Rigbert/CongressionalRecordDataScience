 President, I am sorry, I didn't phrase the question well and clearly enough. Even if the money gets through, as the Senator is suggesting his amendment would accommodate, how would the Senator's amendment fully fund and pay the arrearages the Senator believes we owe our allies? Is there enough money in the Senator's amendment to fully pay the money the Senator believes that we owe our allies through the United Nations as it relates to the United Nations peacekeeping?
