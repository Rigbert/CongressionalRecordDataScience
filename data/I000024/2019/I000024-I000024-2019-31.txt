President, today I wish to honor the memory of Gregory E. Pyle, Chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, who passed away last week. Chief Pyle was a dedicated servant and leader of the Choctaw Nation for 30 years. After more than 13 years as the Assistant Chief of the Tribe, in 1997, he became Chief of the Choctaw Nation until his retirement in 2014.  Chief Pyle was a man of vision and action. He put families first by focusing on health, jobs, and education. Under his thoughtful leadership, the Choctaw Nation focused on economic development, which resulted in new business and job opportunities for Tribal members.  One of my fondest memories with Chief Pyle was when we worked together to pass the historic Code Talkers legislation, which awarded Congressional Commemorative Medals to the Code Talkers of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, along with other Tribes, in recognition of their service during World Wars I and II. Not many people remember this, but Chief Pyle and I started on our journey to honor these heroes in 2002, and it wasn't until 2008 that we were able to get it done. This measure along with many others not only speaks to his character, but also to his unwavering dedication to the Choctaw people.  The Choctaw Nation and the State of Oklahoma are grateful for his dedication and humble leadership. His legacy will benefit generations to come.                            ____________________
