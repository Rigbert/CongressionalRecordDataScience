Mr. Speaker, on August 20, 1997, the Comptroller General issued decision letter B-277719 concluding that section 108, of the paragraph entitled ``General Provisions--Department of the Interior'', Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 is permanent law. Section 108 states that: ``No final rule or regulation of any agency of the Federal Government pertaining to the recognition, management, or validity of a right-of-way pursuant to Revised Statute 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932) shall take effect unless expressly authorized by an Act of Congress subsequent to the date of enactment of this Act.''  This letter was issued in response to a request by 30 Members of Congress and resolves the question of permanency of this important provision.  I ask that a copy of the letter dated July 29, 1997, requesting a decision from the Comptroller General on the permanence of section 108 and Decision Letter B-277719 be printed in the Congressional Record.                                                July 29, 1997.     James F. Hinchman     Acting Comptroller General of the United States, General        Accounting Office, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Hinchman: The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations      Act, 1997 (P.L. 104-208) contains the following section under      the heading ``General Provisions'' in Title I--Department of      the Interior: ``Sec. 108. No final rule or regulation of any      agency of the Federal Government pertaining to the      recognition, management, or validity of a right-of-way      pursuant to Revised Statute 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932) shall take      effect unless expressly authorized by an Act of Congress      subsequent to the date of enactment of this Act.''       We emphatically believe that Section 108 was intended by      Congress to be a provision of permanent law and we seek your      expedited consideration of this question and a letter      decision on the issue. Time is of the essence. Out of an      excess of caution, several of the undersigned Members of the      House urged inclusion of this language in H.R. 2107, the      current Department of Interior and Related Agencies      Appropriations bill, which will soon be considered by the      Senate and possibly by a conference committee. We are      concerned that re-enactment of this provision could      inadvertently give rise to erroneous inference that Congress      does not consider the provision permanent. 32 Comp. Gen. 11      (1952); 36 Comp. Gen. 434 (1956).       Please note that Sec. 108 contains the phrase ``subsequent      to the date of enactment of this Act'' which clearly is      intended to have effect beyond the fiscal year covered by the      bill. Words substantially similar to this phrase previously      have been recognized as words of futurity. 65 Comp. Gen. 588      (1986). Any characterization of this phrase as only a      modifier of the words ``an Act of Congress'' would reduce the      phrase to mere surplusage because there is no Act of Congress      enacted prior to or on the date of enactment of Sec. 108 that      expressly authorizes regulations pursuant to R.S. 2477.      Therefore, enactment of any such authorization is necessarily      subsequent to the date of enactment of Sec. 108. The phrase      is meaningless if it is interpreted solely as a temporal      limitation on the three words immediately preceding it.      ``Constructions that do not give effect to all of the words      of a statute must be avoided . . .'' 70 Comp. Gen. at      354 (citing 2 N. Singer, Sutherlands Statutory      Construction Sec. 33.02 (4th ed. 1984)). Clearly, Sec. 108      contains sufficient words of futurity to indicate that it      is a permanent law.       The legislative history of Sec. 108 and related predecessor      provisions is both relevant and illuminating. 65 Comp. Gen.      588 (1986). The language that ultimately became Sec. 108 was      taken intact from a legislative bill, S. 1425, as reported to      the Senate by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources      on May 9, 1996. The language of S. 1425 was included in the      Senate version of the FY 1997 Department of Interior and      Related Agencies Appropriations bill at the request of the      Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and      the Ranking Republican Member of the Committee on      Appropriations and its Subcommittee on Interior.       Also relevant is limitation of funds language concerning      the same subject matter that was enacted for FY 1996 by the      Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of      1996 (P.L. 104-135): ``Sec. 110. None of the funds      appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be      obligated or expended by the Secretary of the Interior for      developing, promulgating, and thereafter implementing a rule      concerning rights-of-way under section 2477 of the Revised      Statutes.'' Subsequently, the same limitation of funds      language was included in H.R. 3662, the House version of the      FY 1997 Department of the Interior and Related Agencies      Appropriations bill, which passed the House on June 20, 1996.      The conference committee considered the House's limitation of      funds approach but ultimately adopted the Senate's permanent      language taken from S. 1425 for inclusion in P.L. 104-208.      This clearly indicates that Congress considered and rejected      a temporary provision in favor of a permanent one. 36 Comp.      Gen. 434 (1956).       Another factor indicating that Sec. 108 is permanent law is      the fact that it is contained in a paragraph under the      heading ``General Provisions, Department of the Interior''      but applies by its own terms to ``any agency of the Federal      Government'' As a factual matter, Sec. 108 applies to the      Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture, which      administers land subject to R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, and any      other federal agency that administers reservations from the      public lands, including the Department of Defense and the      Department of Energy. The other 13 sections under the      ``General provisions, Department of the Interior'' heading      apply exclusively to the Department of the Interior.      Therefore, Sec. 108 is sufficiently unrelated to the title of      the Act in which it appears to support the conclusion that      was intended to be permanent. B-214058, February 1, 1984.       In conclusion, it is overwhelmingly clear from a plain      reading of Sec. 108, the presence of words of futurity, its      legislative history and the legislative history of related      provisions, and its relationship to the rest of Act that this      provision is permanent law.       We would greatly appreciate your immediate attention to      this question and a reply at your earliest convenience.         Conrad Burns, Orrin Hatch, Robert F. Bennett, Larry E.

Congressional Requesters: This responds to your July 29,      1997, letter asking whether section 108 of the Department of      the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997,      is permanent law or expires at the end of fiscal year      1992.\1\ Section 108 of the Interior Appropriations Act      states that: ``No final rule or regulation of any agency of      the Federal Government pertaining to the recognition,      management, or validity of a right-of-way pursuant to Revised      Statute 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932) shall take effect unless      expressly authorized by an Act of Congress subsequent to the      date of enactment of this Act.'' 110 Stat. 3009-200. For the      reasons discussed below, we believe section 108 is permanent      law.                               Discussion       Since an appropriation act is made for a particular fiscal      year, the starting presumption is that everything contained      in the act is effective only for the year covered. 31 U.S.C.      Sec. 10301(c)(2)(1994). For this reason, a provision in an      appropriation act will be considered to be permanent only if      the statutory language or the nature of the provision makes      it clear that Congress intended the provision to be      permanent. 65 Comp. Gen. 588, 589 (1986).       Permanency is indicated most clearly when the provision in      the appropriation act uses words of futurity. While      ``hereafter'' is a common ``word of futurity,'' we have      afforded language such as ``after the date of approval of      this act'' the same treatment. E.g., 36 Comp. Gen. 434, 436      (1956). The language ``subsequent to the date of enactment of      this Act'' found in section 108 of the fiscal year 1997      Interior Appropriations Act is of the same character.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Footnotes are at the end of the letter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The precise location of the words of futurity can be      important and can determine whether or not a provision is      permanent. Cf. B-228838, Sept. 16, 1987 (words of futurity in      a proviso of a section did not make the entire section      permanent). In the case of section 108, the location of the      phrase ``subsequent to the date of enactment of this Act''      presents two possible interpretations. On the one hand,      ``subsequent to the date of enactment of this Act'' could      apply only to the     immediately preceding phrase ``Act of Congress'' and thereby      describe only the period of enactment for the authorizing      ``Act of Congress'' that must occur for an agency rule or      regulation on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way to take effect. Under      this reading, the phrase ``subsequent to the date of      enactment'' means that the agency rule can become effective      only if it is expressly authorized by a new, not a previous,      Act of Congress. This limitation on agency rulemaking would      expire at the end of fiscal year 1997.       Alternatively, ``subsequent to the date of enactment of      this Act'' could apply to all of section 108 and thereby      describe the time period applicable to the limitation on      agency rulemaking on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way. Under this      reading, the phrase ``subsequent to the date of enactment of      this Act'' means that the requirement for an express      authorization by an Act of Congress before the agency rule      can become effective is a permanent requirement beginning      with the enactment of the fiscal year 1997 appropriation. We      believe the latter interpretation is the meaning best      ascribed to section 108 based on its legislative history and      purpose.       Language similar to that found in section 108 first      appeared as section 349(a)(1) of the National Highway System      Designation Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-59, 109 Stat. 568,      617-618 (1995). Section 349(a)(1) states:       ``(a) Moratorium.--       ``(1) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, no agency of the Federal Government may take any action      to prepare, promulgate, or implement any rule or regulation      addressing rights-of-way authorized pursuant to section 2477      of the Revised Statutes (43 U.S.C. 932), as such section was      in effect before October 21, 1976.''       As indicated by the heading of subsection (a) of section      349, paragraph (1) was a moratorium on agency actions on      rules and regulations regarding R.S. 2477 rights-of-way.      Paragraph (2) provided that the moratorium would be effective      through September 30, 1996. The purpose of the moratorium was      to delay regulations proposed by the Secretary of the      Interior so that the Congress and the states could address      concerns over proposed changes to the process for recognizing      state and local government claims for rights-of-way across      federal lands granted pursuant to R.S. 2477. 141 Cong. Rec.      S8924-8925 (daily ed. June 22, 1995) (statements of Sens.      Stevens and Murkowski).       Before the moratorium expired, the Senate Committee on      Energy and Natural Resources considered S. 1425, a bill to      ``recognize the validity of rights-of-way granted under      section 2477 of the Revised Statutes, and for other      purposes.'' The bill, as reported from the Committee on May      9, 1996, consisted entirely of the language now found at      section 108 of the fiscal year 1997 Interior Appropriations      Act. The purpose of S. 1425 was to allow the Department of      the Interior to develop new regulations while prohibiting      their implementation until expressly approved by an Act of      Congress. S. Rep. No. 104-261, at 2 (1996). There is no      question that if it had been enacted into law, S. 1425 would      have continued indefinitely the restriction against agency      rules or regulations on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way becoming      effective without an authorizing Act of Congress. See, id.,      at 3-4 (Letter from June E. O'Neill, Director, Congressional      Budget Office, dated May 8, 1996). While no further action      was taken on S. 1425, its language ultimately became section      108 of the fiscal year 1997 Interior Appropriations Act.       A little more than a month after the Senate Committee on      Energy and Natural Resources reported S. 1425, the House of      Representatives passed H.R. 3662, the Department of the      Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 1997.      Section 109 of H.R. 3662 stated that ``None of the funds      appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be      obligated or expended by the Secretary of the Interior for      developing, promulgating, and thereafter implementing a rule      concerning right-of-way under section 2477 of the Revised      Statutes.''       This language was identical to language in the fiscal year      1996 appropriation act enacted two months before. See note 2      above. When the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported      its version of the appropriations bill, it deleted the House      language and substituted the language of S. 1425, stating      that it was ``identical to the bipartisan proposal reported      by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee (Senate      bill 1475 [sic]).'' S. Rep. No. 104-319, at 56 (1996). This      is the language ultimately enacted as section 108 of the      fiscal year 1997 Interior Appropriations Act as contained in      Pub. L. No. 104-208.       This history strongly supports the conclusion that Congress      intended section 108 to be permanent. Section 108 was lifted      verbatim from a bill that by virtue of its language and its      character as general legislation would, if enacted, have      continued indefinitely the restriction on implementing rules      on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way. Also, the Senate and ultimately      the Congress substituted the language of S. 1425 for the      language of H.R. 3662, which like the identical language of      Pub. L. No. 140-134 for fiscal year 1996, was clearly      applicable only for a fiscal year. In revealing the origin of      section 108, the applicable discussion in S. Rep. No. 104-319      and H. Conf. Rep. No. 104-863 contains nothing to suggest      that Congress intended for the effect of the language from S.      1425, i.e., an indefinite restriction, to be different when      included in the appropriation act.       Other reasons support the conclusion that the Congress      intended section 108 to be permanent legislation. The      language of section 108 is not a restriction on the use of      appropriations. It is a substantive provision addressing when      certain agency rules or regulations can take effect. Its      language standing alone is permanent in nature. 36 Comp. Gen.      at 436. Also, no real effect would be given to the phrase      ``subsequent to the date of enactment of this Act'' if it      were interpreted to only describe the time period when an      authorizing ``Act of Congress'' must occur before an agency      rule becomes effective. Section 108 could not have been      designed to vitiate a prior Act of Congress expressly      authorizing final agency rules or regulations on R.S. 2477      rights-of-way for the simple reason that there was and is      none. Accordingly, any Act of Congress expressly authorizing      a final rule or regulation on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way would      be one enacted after enactment of the fiscal year 1997      Interior Appropriations Act. For the phrase ``subsequent to      the date of enactment of this Act'' to have any effect, it      must mean that the section 108 restriction on when a rule or      regulation on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way takes effect is      permanent law beginning with the date of enactment of the      fiscal year 1997 Interior Appropriations Act.       For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that section      108 is permanent law. I trust the foregoing will be of      assistance.           Sincerely yours,                                                 Robert P. Murphy,                                                  General Counsel.                               Footnotes     \1\ The Department of the Interior and Related Agencies      Appropriations Act, 1997, is contained in section 101(d) of      the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, Pub. L.      No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-181(1996).     \2\ Section 8 of the Mining Act of 1866 stated that ``the      right of way for the construction of highways over public      lands, not reserved for public uses is hereby granted.'' That      section was codified as section 2477 of the Revised Statutes,      and has been commonly referred to since then as ``R.S.      2477.'' Section 706 of the Federal Land Policy and Management      Act of 1976 (FLPMA), Pub. L. No. 94-579, 90 Stat. 2793,      repealed R.S. 2477 but section 701 provided that FLPMA did      not terminate any land use, including rights-of-way, existing      on October 21, 1976. FLPMA did not provide a time limitation      on filing claims for pre-1976 rights-of-way. The rules and      regulations that are the subject of section 108 are proposals      to change how R.S. 2477 claims are processed.     \3\ Your letter refers to another restriction running through      fiscal year 1996. Section 110 of the Department of the      Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996, as      contained in section 101(c) of the Omnibus Consolidated      Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-     134, 110 Stat. 1321, 1321-156, provided that none of the      funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the Act      could be used by the Secretary of the Interior to develop,      promulgate, and implement a rule concerning R.S. 2477 rights-     of-way. 110 Stat. 1321-177. This provision was in H.R. 1977,      the Department of Interior and Related Agencies      Appropriations Bill, 1996, when it was reported from the      House Committee on Appropriations on June 30, 1995. It      remained intact through the enactment of Pub. L. No. 104-134      on April 26, 1996, and is narrower in scope than the      moratorium enacted by section 349 of Pub. L. No. 104-59 five      months earlier.     \4\ The provision for the moratorium was added to the Senate      bill as a floor amendment and had a December 1, 1995      expiration date. The conference committee adopted the      moratorium contained in the Senate bill and extended its      application through the end of fiscal year 1996. H. Rep.      Conf. Rep.
