 President, both the Senate and House took decisive action to combat the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic that has devastated so many of our communities. We are now working to take the next important step forward. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act we passed would expand education and prevention efforts, improve treatment programs, and enhance tools for law enforcement. This critical legislation can bring hope to those affected by this horrible epidemic and would not have been possible without the dedicated leadership of Members such as Senator Grassley, Senator Portman, and Senator Ayotte. We are currently working toward an agreement that will allow us to go to conference with the House and work out the final legislation.  We have all seen the toll this heroin and prescription opioid crisis has taken on our home States. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see the continuing impact in Kentucky. Getting this done is important for our country. With continued cooperation from both sides, we will get a good bill to the President's desk very soon.                          ____________________
