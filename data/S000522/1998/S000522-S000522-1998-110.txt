Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill, and therefore, violates clause 2 of Rule XXI.  The rule states, in pertinent part, that ``No amendment to a general appropriations bill shall be in order, if changing existing law.''  Let me make it very clear that this gives affirmative direction, in effect, and very importantly, it does impose additional duties. Whether it be the OMB director or whoever makes the final decision, additional duties will be imposed as a result of this amendment.  So I hope the ruling of the Chair, as consistent with the other amendments, will rule this out of order.
