 Obviously if we don't pass something by December 31, on January 1 prices for the Federal Government will go up very dramatically, as the gentleman knows; and it will have an impact on spending. And I know the gentleman and I are both concerned about that.  The next to last issue--just two more issues, if I can, Mr. Leader.  As you know, we've talked about the Violence Against Women Act. We've passed a bill through this House that was passed essentially on a partisan basis. They passed a bipartisan bill in the Senate, Violence Against Women. And domestic violence is an epidemic, in some respects, in this country.  I am hopeful that we might consider taking up the Senate bill again because it got passed on such an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis in the Senate. I would suggest to the gentleman that it may well pass on a bipartisan basis here as well.  The problem, as you know, from my perspective and from our side, with the House bill is that you exclude a number of people. The problem with excluding people--for instance, undocumented immigrants from being able to come forward and having a sense of safety and security in doing so--is that the abuser of the undocumented immigrant, left unaccountable, may well be the abuser of a citizen or a child in this country, either as a citizen or here illegally; and, therefore, we think there ought to be broader coverage. Apparently, the Senate shares that view. As you know, every Republican woman and Democratic woman voted for that bill in the Senate.  Does the gentleman have any idea whether we could either go to conference on that bill or whether or not we might bring the Senate bill up for passage?  I yield to my friend.
