Speaker, I would like to say a couple of things during this span, as we wait for the rule to come down from the Committee on Rules. On this side we want a balanced budget. I believe a lot of Members on that side want a balanced budget, too. They want it honestly scored, and that means by the Congressional Budget Office. We are tired of smoke and mirrors and phony numbers and the CR that we had last time. A lot of us were optimistic that something was going to happen, and it did not. That is why we are in the situation that we are in today.   Mr. Speaker, I reminded a colleague of mine earlier this afternoon that I was one of those who voted against the Bush budget back in 1990. I remember being down in the White House and meeting with a number of his advisers, and I said then that his assumptions and statistics that he was showing us in 1990 were wrong, because he told us that if that budget passed in 1990, and it did, despite my opposition, that we would have a surplus in 1995 of $65 billion. The OMB was off $225 billion.  We are tired of that. We are tired of trying to hoodwink the American public in terms of making tough decisions, and when the pie is finally taken out of the oven, it is not done. We want it done. The end product every one of us on this side wants and a good number on your side, and I hope including yourself: that pie done in a balanced fashion by the year 2002.  One of the things we are trying to do now is to get the sides together, put them in a room, lock the door, call out for Domino's Pizza on whatever you are going to do, and not let them out until we get a deal.
