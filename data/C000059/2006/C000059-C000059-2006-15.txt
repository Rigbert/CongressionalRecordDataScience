Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. We have laid out a compelling vision and mission for the civil space program to conduct a robust program of human and robotic space exploration.  Last year, this Congress overwhelmingly endorsed the President's Vision for Space Exploration with a vote of 383-15 on the NASA Authorization Act. This amendment would abandon those plans endorsed by Congress.  We cannot turn back NASA's long-range plans. I certainly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and let's stay on track.
