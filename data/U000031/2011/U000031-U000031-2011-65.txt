Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, today we take a step toward compassionate, innovative, and job-creating health care. It is ironic we must end something to realize a new beginning, but that is exactly what ObamaCare has compelled us to do; and that is precisely what we will do today.  It's time to be honest with the American people. Remember the Hippocratic oath? First, do no harm.  ObamaCare produces the opposite of growth, compassion, and innovation in health care. It destroys jobs, busts budgets, creates an unsustainable set of mandates on individuals, employers, and States. It will stifle innovation and the development of life-saving medicines. It will make health care more expensive, not more affordable.  Mr. Speaker, that is not compassionate. That won't produce innovation, and that's why repeal is the first step toward a better beginning. What is compassionate about forcing employers to provide insurance that they cannot afford to employees who will lose their jobs due to ObamaCare? What is compassionate about creating a rigid new entitlement that States are commanded to fund with money that they simply do not have? What is compassionate about cutting over $200 billion from the Medicare Advantage program, leaving seniors with fewer services, higher co-pays, and more out-of-pocket expenses? What is compassionate about shackling more Americans with greater government dependence?  ObamaCare was created--erected--on a foundation of false promises: if you like your health insurance, you can keep it; health care premiums will go down; employers will not drop coverage; seniors won't see any changes in their Medicare benefits.  Today we know that those were only slogans--sound bites in a cynical sales pitch--and certainly not promises kept. Yes, today repeal will pass in the House. We will then embark on reform that I believe can be supported by both Republicans and Democrats.
