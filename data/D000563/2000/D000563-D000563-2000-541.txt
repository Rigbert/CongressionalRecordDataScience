It is totally voluntary. There is no Federal mandate involved. If a school district says they are concerned enough about this problem that they want to put together a program that is going to try to educate children about the danger of guns, that is going to try to educate parents about the safe storage of guns, public service announcements to encourage trigger locks, then they can apply for these funds. It is only $7 million, which by Federal standards is a very small amount of money.  I hope it will give some school districts the resources they need to step forward and protect children from needless tragedies which we read about every day.
