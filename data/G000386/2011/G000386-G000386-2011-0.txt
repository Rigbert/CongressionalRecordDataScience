 President, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss a case that was argued a few weeks ago before the Supreme Court, Hall v. the United States. This case involves a specific provision that I authored which is contained in the 2005 bankruptcy reform law. Throughout the litigation in this case, my statements supporting the provision--in other words, the statements that were said here on the floor of the Senate and in committee report were discussed in these cases at length.  I want to take a few minutes and walk through the history and intent of this provision so people hear it straight from this author's mouth, meaning from this Senator.  At its core, the case Hall v. the United States is about statutory interpretation.
