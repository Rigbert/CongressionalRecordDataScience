Buckingham, and Darius Matthews,      petitioned the Vermont General Assembly for the establishment      of a new institution of higher education in the town of      Middlebury, Vermont;       Whereas on November 1, 1800, the Vermont General Assembly      adopted a law to establish a college in Middlebury and named      this group of distinguished Vermonters to be known as ``the      President and fellows of Middlebury college'', and designated      Jeremiah Atwater as the new college's first President;       Whereas on November 5, 1800, less than 1 week after      receiving its Charter, Middlebury College opened its doors to      7 students and 1 professor using space at the local grammar      school for instruction;       Whereas by 1810, the college had grown to 110 students and      needed space of its own, and the campus of Middlebury College      was built, and on May 19, 2000, the United States Postal      Service issued postcards to commemorate the Old Stone Row and      the first 3 buildings of the Middlebury College campus;       Whereas over the last 2 centuries, Middlebury College has      evolved from 1 of the first colleges in the United States      into 1 of the most respected liberal arts colleges in the      Nation, with more than 2,000 students, almost 200 professors,      and a main campus of over 250 acres;       Whereas the Middlebury College Bicentennial Planning      Commission has designed Celebration 2000 to commemorate this      milestone in Vermont's and the Nation's educational history;       Whereas this bicentennial is a celebration honoring the      people and events that have made and continue to make      Middlebury College a leader in higher education;       Whereas Celebration 2000 features concerts, plays, and      symposia, both on campus and at additional locations such as      the New York Public Library, and the dedication of a new     science building, Bicentennial Hall, with an exterior that      resembles the Old Stone Row and the early architectural      history of this 200-year-old school; and       Whereas the year-long celebration of 2 centuries of quality      higher education will culminate during Founders' Week,      November 1st through 5th, 2000, when a variety of events will      occur in honor of Middlebury, the college, and Middlebury,      the college's town: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) the Senate commends and congratulates Middlebury      College on the completion of its first 200 years of      educational excellence and wishes the college continued      success as it commences a third century of educational      opportunity and leadership; and       (2) the Secretary of the Senate shall send a copy of this      resolution to the Middlebury College President, John M.
