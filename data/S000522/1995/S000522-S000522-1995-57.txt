Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I just take a very brief moment to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman, the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Rogers].  I had intended on offering an amendment to restore funds to the authorized level for the Radio Free Asia. Just a few days ago we voted on the Bereuter amendment, which reaffirmed our collective commitment to Radio Free Asia. The subcommittee looked at this, I know, and came to the conclusion that the money available plus the $5 million that is included in this bill would be sufficient because there is not an expectation that Radio Free Asia will be up and running soon. I hope that is an error, that it gets up and running sooner rather than later.  Should Radio Free Asia get off and running as we hope, I would just hope the chairman and ranking member would work with us to insure sufficient money would be available.
