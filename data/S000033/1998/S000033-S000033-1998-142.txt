 Speaker, I rise today to discuss the issue of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity as it relates to both our civilian population and our Gulf War veterans. I continue the submission for the Record the latest ``Recognition of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity'' newsletter which lists the U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, U.S. federal and state courts, U.S. workers' compensation boards, and independent organizations that have adopted policies, made statements, and/or published documents recognizing Multiple Chemical Sensitivity disorders for the benefit of my colleagues.  Governors of Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina and                                Washington       In (independently) adopting resolutions declaring May 11-17      (July 13-17 in Washington) as MCS Awareness Week. In      Washington, the governor issued a second proclamation after      rescinding the first on the advice of his General Counsel,      just 8 days after it was adopted with approval of the state      toxicologist [1998, 7 pages including both Washington      versions, R-178].                       Maryland State Legislature       In Senate Joint Resolution No. 32 directing the Maryland      Department of the Environment (MDE) to carry out a study of      Chemical Hypersensitivity Syndrome [1988, 3 pages, R-40]. The      MDE commissioned a state-of-the-art review from Rebecca      Bascom, M.D., entitled ``Chemical Hypersensitivity Syndrome      Study'' [1989, 132 pages, R-41].Massachusetts Operational Services Division, Environmentally Preferable                       Product Procurement Program       In its final bid document for the procurement of      Environmentally Preferable Cleaning Products by state      agencies for use in state facilities, which ``will not      replace the cleaning products already on contract; they will      be offered as alternatives.'' The product specifications      developed by the Massachusetts Executive Office of      Environmental Affairs, Office of Technical Assistance,      include ``desirable'' (as distinct from ``mandatory'')      criteria that products contain as few volatile organic      compounds (VOCs) as possible and not contain any added dyes      or fragrances. These are justified in Appendix N of the bid      document on the grounds that ``A lower VOC content . . . is      especially important for sensitive individuals'' and ``The      Commonwealth recognizes that many sensitive individuals      prefer cleaning products without added dyes and fragrances.''      [1998, 30 page excerpt including Appendix N, R-181]       Missouri Department of Social Services, Division of Aging       In a detailed response to a request from Dr. Grace Ziem for      workplace accommodation of an employee with MCS, the agency      agreed to (among other things): make changes in the work      schedule; provide a private work area with floor to ceiling      walls; provide multiple carbon-fiber air filtration machines;      conduct staff education on MCS; adopt and post voluntary      fragrance free policy governing all employees; request      maintenance staff use cleaning products only from an approved      list; and clean the carpet. [3 pages, 1 April 1996, plus 1 of      follow-up, R-98]                    New Jersey Department of Health       In a comprehensive review of chemical sensitivity with      recommendations for state action commissioned from Nicholas      Ashford, Ph.D., J.D., and Claudia Miller, M.D., entitled      ``Chemical sensitivity: a report to the New Jersey Department      of Health'' [1989, 176 pages, R-45].         New Mexico Department of Education, School Health Unit       In a brochure on ``Multiple Chemical Sensitivities''      describing the illness and nine ``steps schools can take to      promote environmental safety.'' Also lists resource persons      and materials [1997 (undated), 2 pages, R-139]. New Mexico Department of Energy, Minerals & Natural Resources, State                        Park & Recreation Division       In a letter from the director outlining steps the division      is taking to reduce barriers to access for individuals with      EI/MCS [10 January 1994, 1 page, R-46]. These include      prohibiting smoking in restrooms, temporarily discontinuing      the use of certain cleaning and disinfectant chemicals upon      special request of EI/MCS individuals, and switching to least      toxic/allergenic cleaning and pesticide products.  New Mexico Department of Health, Community Health Systems Division,                    Emergency Medical Services Bureau       In an editorial from Barak Wolff, MHP, chief of the EMS      Bureau, entitled `` `Scared to Death' of Having to call 911''      and an accompanying article by Dr. Ann McCampbell entitled      ``First . . . Do No Harm: The Challenge of Patients with      Multiple Chemical Sensitivities,'' both published in the      state's Focus on Emergency Medical Services newsletter [Vol.      15, No. 3, October 1996, 4 pages, R-117]. The editorial and      article discuss the need for emergency service personnel to      accommodate people with MCS and they make several specific      recommendations for 911 operators, emergency responders and      hospital staff.     New Mexico Governor's Committee on Concerns of the Handicapped       In sponsoring and financing a day-long ``Town Hall Meeting      on Multiple Chemical Sensitivities'' on 24 June 1996 with the      full support of the governor, despite his earlier veto of a      legislative proposal for additional funding (see next entry).      Described as ``A public forum to discuss the problems faced      by chemically sensitive New Mexicans and to propose state      level solutions,'' this was the first state-wide effort to      bring together a panel of representatives from state agencies      to ``hear from persons with MCS and other interested parties      on the issues of Housing, Employment, Health Care,      Pesticides, Schools, and Access to State Facilities and      Services.'' [Brochure, program and detailed fragrance free      policy, 24 June 1996, 3 pages, R-96]. Based on the testimony      received at the Town Meeting, the Governor's Committee then      issued a ``Report to the Legislature on Multiple Chemical      Sensitivity,'' including a ``Suggested Public Meeting Policy      on Accessibility for Persons with Multiple Chemical      Sensitivity [27 August 1996, 8 pages, R-104]. The report      recommends six actions ``be taken now,'' including funding      the state Office of Epidemiology to study the prevalence of      MCS within the general population''; directing all hospitals      to ``establish written protocols for providing barrier free      environments for the use of persons with MCS admitted for any      reason''; directing all ADA coordinators of public facilities      in New Mexico to adopt public meeting policies ``to allow      attendance by persons affected by MCS''; creating an ``MCS      information and assistance'' program within State government      to ``provide ADA coordinators, housing officials, hospitals      and other decision makers with the most complete and up-to-     date information on MCS as well as . . . providing individual      assistance to affected persons via an ``800'' telephone      number''; and ``conducting a study of the housing needs of      persons affected with MCS.''                      New Mexico State Legislature       In a ``Joint Memorial Requesting the Governor's Committee      on Concerns of the Handicapped to Study Issues Related to      Multiple Chemical Sensitivities.'' The resolution specifies      that the study focus on ``issues of health care, insurance,      public benefits and services, access to government, legal      services and environmental regulation'' [Senate Joint      Memorial 10-House Memorial 6, Second Session, 1996, 3 pages,      R-91]. A follow-up amendment to the General Appropriation Act      of 1996 requesting $50,000 in funding for this ``Memorial''      also was passed by the legislature (House Bill 2 on 15      February 1996) but then vetoed by the governor on 4 March      1996.                  New York State Department of Health       In a $100,000 grant given to the Mt. Sinai Occupational      Health Clinic for MCS research, part of a larger annual grant      to the clinic in 1993 [4 page excerpt, R-47]. The report,      including a review of MCS cases seen at eight occupational      clinics in New York State, originally was supposed to be      completed in late 1994 but is now expected in 1997.                  Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission       In a decision (upheld on appeal to the Commonwealth Court      of Pennsylvania) finding that a landlord must make reasonable      accommodation for a tenant who suffers from MCS, including      giving tenant prior notification of painting and pest      treatments (see Recognition of MCS by State Courts, below,      for reference).                    Washington State Board of Health       In its 1994 Washington State Public Health Report, which      says ``Several hundred Washington residents have reported a      condition diagnosed by some physicians as Multiple Chemical      Sensitivity'' and goes on to discuss common MCS symptoms and      sensitivities. [December 1993, 3 page excerpt, R-55].     Washington State Departments of Health and Labor & Industries       In the joint ``Final Inter-Agency Report on Chemically      Related Illness'' issued by the Secretary of the Department      of Health and the Director of the Department of Labor and      Industries, which acknowledges that ``MCS has become a focus      of increasing public health concern in Washington state and      elsewhere,'' cites the 1987 Cullen definition, and says      ``Public agencies are increasingly recognizing a need to      address the public health aspects of the MCS syndrome,      without necessarily waiting for conclusive answers from      scientific research'' [June 1995, 5 page excerpt including      table of contents, R-54].     Washington State Chemically Related Illness Advisory Committee       In its final report, in an appendix devoted to MCS, the      committee says MCS is ``characterized as a condition in which      individuals experience symptoms following exposures at low      levels to multiple chemical substances. It is a chronic      condition that is reproducible with challenge, and which      resolves when incitants are removed'' [June 1995, 3 page      excerpt, R-95]. The committee included representatives of      state government, affected business and labor organizations,      the medical community, and MCS patients. Its final report      also is included as an appendix in the Washington State Final      Inter-agency Report on Chemically Related Illness (see entry      above).    Washington State Governor's Committee on Disability Issues and                                Employment       In a booklet entitled ``Reasonable Accommodation: A Guide      for Employers, Businesses and Persons with Disabilities,''      signed by the governor and the commissioner of the State's      Employment Security Department, which discusses MCS/EI in      detail in a section on ``Reasonable Accommodation for Persons      with Hidden Disabilities'' [March 1992, 34 pages, R-53].
