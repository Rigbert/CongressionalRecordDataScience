Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a hero from my congressional district, United States Army Special Forces Sergeant Aaron J. Blasjo. Today I ask that the House of Representatives to join me to honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to his country.  Aaron was born in Riverside, California and graduated from Ramona High School in 2004. He was determined to be in the Special Forces and after graduation he promptly enlisted in the United States Army. Aaron was assigned to A Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. His most recent deployment was his third tour in Afghanistan, where he served in the Special Forces canine unit. About Aaron, his grandfather, Wesley Blasjo, stated, ``I think he wanted to do something for his country. He liked the camaraderie and all the things that go along with Special Forces.''  Aaron was a member of the Palm Baptist Church and traveled to Africa on a short missionary trip to help others. A youth pastor at the church remembers Aaron as serious but caring member of their church community.  In 2009, he married Crystal Thompkins in Riverside. Two months ago, Aaron became a proud father to his son, Talon Blasjo, which was one of the highlights of Aaron's life. On May 29, 2011, the day before Memorial Day, Aaron was killed in action in Wardak Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He was 25 years old. In addition to his wife Crystal and son Talon, he also leaves behind his mother and father Daniel and Roberta Blasjo; and his extended family.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Aaron, who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. The day they learned of Aaron's death was probably the hardest day the Blasjo family has ever faced and my thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude for their sacrifice go out to them. There are no words that can relieve their pain, and what words I offer only begin to convey my deep respect and highest appreciation.  Sergeant Blasjo's wife, son and parents have all given a part of themselves with the loss of Aaron, and I hope they know that their husband, father, and son, the goodness he brought to this world and the sacrifice he has made, will always be remembered.                          ____________________
