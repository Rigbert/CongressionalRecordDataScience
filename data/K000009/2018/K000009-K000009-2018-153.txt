Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan Polish Caucus, I rise to pay tribute to the brilliant life and unique contribution to scholarship of Dr. Thaddeus C. Radzilowski who passed away on July 20, 2018 at the age of 80.  Dr. Radzilowski was the co-founder and President of the largest Polish American think tank in the United States known as the Piast Institute founded in Hamtramck, MI. An academic giant in his field, he taught at several prestigious universities including the University of Michigan, Madonna University, Heidelberg College, Southwest Minnesota State University, and finally as President of St. Mary College.  He was a prolific leader in the Polish American community, who uniquely understood the importance of preserving Polish-American heritage in the United States. He held a piercing dedication to accurately and painstakingly recount the sacrificial history of Poland, its people, and its diaspora. The history of Poland, often under-presented, resulted from the annihilation by the Russian military squads (NKVD) of over 23,000 of its preeminent leaders in academia, the military, and religious and community life. Those who would have recorded the 20th century's most bloodied battles were annihilated, making Dr. Radzilowski's scholarship all the more critical.  Under his leadership, the Piast Institute made significant contributions to the study of Central and Eastern Europe including publishing articles and school curricula, convening key experts, presenting exhibitions, and mentoring the next generation of leaders in his field. Thanks to his dedication, he was the recipient of countless awards including the Cavaliers Cross of the Polish Order of Merit presented to him by the Polish President.  A man committed to serving others, Dr. Radzilowski served with dignity and honor in the U.S. Armed Forces in Vietnam. He truly embodied America's values which bind us.  Mr. Speaker, please allow me to join hundreds of thousands of grateful Polish Americans in my district and across the United States in applauding his remarkable career and exemplary life. His legacy will continue to guide and inspire generations to come. That is why I am honored to fly an American flag over the Capitol in his name.                          ____________________
