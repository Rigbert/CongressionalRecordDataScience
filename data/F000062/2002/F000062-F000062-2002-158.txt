 It delays the implementation of this mandate by 1 year, until 2005. It gives both coasts of the United States the opportunity to do what they need to do to increase refining capacity, to develop the terminals, to develop the truck fleet, and to get ready for what is going to be a massive infusion of a product that can't be shipped by pipe. It has to be shipped by truck or by rail or by barge.  I hope the Senate will allow us this additional year to get ready for this unfortunate mandate.
