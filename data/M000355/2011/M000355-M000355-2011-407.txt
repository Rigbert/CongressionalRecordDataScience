 With prices in most States moving closer and closer to $4 a gallon, and already higher in some areas, America has a right to know where the President and Democrats in Congress stand on the issue.  Let me begin this morning with a simple observation that it is no accident gas prices are skyrocketing at a time when Democrats control two-thirds of official Washington. It is no secret Democratic leaders in Washington do not particularly care for this issue. Ask them about gas prices and chances are they will tell you about some car they plan to build and have ready for production about 25 years down the road. Suggest we tap some of our domestic sources of oil and they will give you 101 reasons we cannot and how that is not a real solution anyway because it will take too long to get it out of the ground.  We have been having that particular argument for decades now--literally for decades.
