President, over 25 years ago, a member of the Select Panel for the Promotion of Child Health said in a statement to Congress, ``Children are one-third of our population and all of our future.'' We must protect the health and welfare of our nation's children if we are to secure the future of our country. This year we have a tremendous opportunity to ensure that security. With the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, we can improve the health and health care of our Nation's future, for the over 70 million children in America and, in particular, the 9 million children who have no health coverage.  Since the creation of SCHIP 10 years ago, more than 6.2 million children have been covered by this vital program, including over 290,000 children in Illinois. As the first State to provide coverage for all children, Illinois has been a leader in the movement to change the course of health care in this country. Since 1993, SCHIP, its relationship to Medicaid, and the flexibility that this administration has permitted the programs to have, have made it possible for Illinois to provide health care to the more than 313,000 children who did not have access to it before.  Nearly 1 million Illinois families have at least one uninsured family member, and the face of the uninsured is changing. The uninsured are not only the mother and daughter living in downtown Chicago. The uninsured includes the family who runs a small business in the suburbs, the family farm in central Illinois, and the single father working at a factory downstate.  The majority of kids without health care coverage come from working families, families like Mr. and Mrs. Buss and their three young sons. Lisa Buss and her husband own a small home inspection company. They paid over $9,000 last year alone on regular medical care, without any catastrophic events or emergencies. That's a lot of money for a family living in the suburbs of Chicago. There is also the Hickey family of Godfrey, Illinois. After anunfortunate accident, their son broke a couple of bones in his hand. Without insurance, they were hesitant to see the specialist at the suggestion of the emergency room physicians, but for the health of their son, they did so. For a 5 minute visit, they paid close to $1,000. Mr. Hickey works in the construction trade and work had been slow. Susan is a teacher for the Alton School District. They were given no financial assistance except to be offered a payment plan. Now, the Hickeys have to find a way to pay for their house payment and their utilities, rising gas prices, and this medical treatment.  The unnecessary burden and anxiety caused by health care is an unfortunate reality for too many, and children often bear the brunt of this hardship. Kids should not have to wait until their fever is 103 degrees to see a doctor. Kids should be able to obtain glasses when they are straining to see the chalkboard. Kids should be able to obtain antibiotics when that ``cold'' just won't go away. Our parents should not have to worry about whether they can afford to take their son to a bone specialist.  As is often the case, States are leading the way with children's health coverage initiatives. In 2005, my State of Illinois was the first State to ensure health care coverage for all children. Since then, many States have taken on the challenge of expanding health care coverage. The State of the States 2007 report by AcademyHealth indicates that more than a dozen States have enacted innovative policies to expand coverage. These range from comprehensive health care reform in States such as Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine; to public-private partnerships in States such as Arkansas, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Utah; to initiatives to cover all children in Illinois and Pennsylvania.  Democratic and Republican governors alike are exploring ways to reach the uninsured, proving that children's health and health care coverage are American issues, not partisan issues. One important way to insure more children is through a strong reauthorization of SCHIP.  Today, with the introduction of the Healthy Kids Act, I propose SCHIP reauthorization legislation that builds on the progress made in these States. First, the bill provides States with more funding to enroll children who are eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP. These kids account for more than half of all uninsured children.  Second, the Healthy Kids Act will eliminate obvious barriers to coverage and simplify enrollment procedures. For example, seven States have reported declines in Medicaid enrollments because of new citizenship requirements. Approximately 65 percent of internists report serving patients with Limited English Proficiency; for children living in these families, making language assistance services available is a critical precursor to quality care. My bill proposes options for States to reach the neediest children through SCHIP by reducing some of these barriers. For example, the bill provides for funds for language assistance services.  Third, the bill also supports the establishment of medical homes, a network of providers for children that helps prevent them from falling through the cracks. The bill puts forth an effort to create pediatric quality and performance measures. The Healthy Kids Act also establishes a disease prevention and treatment demonstration project for ethnic and racial minority children, using research that specifically examines disparities in minority children enrolled in Medicaid/SCHIP. We can reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for this population.  Finally, the bill creates a commission to study children's health coverage. The Commission on Children's Health Coverage will develop policy recommendations and track the program's overall performance. Feedback and analysis of SCHIP's performance is critical to improving the program in the future.  SCHIP has been an unparalleled success and a model for health insurance coverage that both Democrats and Republicans can be proud of. Ensuring health care coverage for children in need is a priority for both sides of the aisle. The reauthorization of SCHIP is a rare opportunity for the Federal Government to expand its support for policies in States like Illinois and others. Let's take a step forward and work to provide basic health insurance for all children. Healthy children grow into healthy adults, in turn, these individuals are happier and spend less money on health care in the long run. The SCHIP program is critical for our Nation's health and economic future.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1364       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

There are hereby appropriated, out of any      money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums      as may be necessary to provide for such increase in      allotment.       ``(2) Projected enrollment of children.--The projected      enrollment of children for a State under this paragraph for a      fiscal year is equal to the average number of children      enrolled under the State child health plan in fiscal year      2007 increased, for each subsequent fiscal year through the      fiscal year involved, by a factor equal to the population      growth of children in the State for such fiscal year, as      projected by the Secretary before the beginning of the fiscal      year involved.       ``(3) Amount of allotment increase.--       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the amount      of the allotment increase under this subsection for a State      for a fiscal year shall be an amount equal to the product      of--       ``(i) the number by which the average number of children      enrolled under the State child health plan in the fiscal year      exceeds the enrollment of children projected under paragraph      (2) for such State for such fiscal year; and       ``(ii) the per capita expenditures for children under the      State child health plan for the previous year, increased by      the average annual rate of increase (for the three previous      fiscal years) in the amount of such per capita expenditures.     The amount of the allotment increase under this subsection      shall not be subject to administrative or judicial review.       ``(B) Limitation.--       ``(i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), in no case shall      the sum of the allotment increases for all States under this      subsection for a fiscal year exceed an amount equal to 20      percent of the total Federal payments to all of the States      otherwise made under this title for the fiscal year. If such      sum exceeds such amount, subject to clause (ii), the      allotment increase for each State under this subsection for      the fiscal year shall be reduced in a pro rata manner in      order that such sum does not exceed such amount.       ``(ii) Congressional approval of additional amounts.--If      the Secretary estimates that the allotment increases that      should be provided under this subsection, but for clause (i),      would exceed the limitation established under such clause,      the Secretary shall submit to Congress a request for      supplemental appropriations for the purpose of meeting such      shortfall.       ``(4) Clarification.--An adjustment in an allotment shall      not be made under this subsection due to excess State      expenditures resulting from a growth in per capita costs,      increased reimbursement to providers, or other factors not      directly related to outreach to eligible, but previously      unenrolled children.''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)      shall take effect beginning with allotments for fiscal year      2008.     SEC. 207.
