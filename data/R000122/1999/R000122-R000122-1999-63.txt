President, let me thank my colleague, Senator Feingold from Wisconsin, who was here before but graciously allowed me to go ahead to introduce this amendment.  Also, having come to the floor earlier today and not only commended Chairman Bond and ranking member Mikulski for their valiant efforts to reach priorities in very limited financial circumstances, I will announce up front I am going to propose this amendment which would increase lead funding as a means to talk about the issue, but I will withdraw the amendment in recognition of not only the serious efforts the chairman and ranking member have made, but also in recognition that last year when I came to the floor, both Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski were instrumental in increasing the appropriation by $20 million and, indeed, holding that appropriation at conference. So I am very confident, with their efforts, they will continue to work hard to make sure this remains a critical priority.  The problem of lead exposure to children in the United States is something that I believe is critical, one that we must address. I have been supported in that opinion by many of my colleagues.  Earlier this year, 14 of my colleagues joined me in a letter urging the chairman and the ranking member to do all they can to increase appropriations for lead abatement in this appropriations bill. Those colleagues include Senators Jeffords, Specter, Leahy, Lautenberg, Chafee--my colleague from Rhode Island--Schumer, Dodd, Lieberman, Kerry, Boxer, Kohl, Snowe, Torricelli, and Durbin. All of them from across this country recognize the critical need to eliminate lead exposure, particularly with respect to children.  But there are two of my colleagues who deserve particular praise. Senator Collins and Senator Torricelli are cosponsors of this amendment. Senator Collins has been a strong and very effective advocate for this program of lead abatement.  I was pleased to join her in Providence, RI, several weeks ago for a hearing of the Public Health Subcommittee, where we looked at lead paint exposure to children in Rhode Island. It was a very good hearing. I am pleased to say I will be able to join Senator Collins in Maine in a few weeks to have a similar hearing.  Senator Torricelli and myself have been very active not only with respect to this issue but also with respect to the issue of appropriate screening and treatment for children who have elevated levels of lead in their blood systems.  I admit that over the last 20 years we have made significant progress in our society with respect to exposure to lead principally because we have banned lead paint, we have banned lead solder in food cans, and we have deleaded gasoline. This has resulted in significant reductions.  But, nevertheless, nearly a million children enter kindergarten each year with elevated levels of lead in their blood. This is a preventable problem. This is a problem, if it is not prevented, that causes serious cognitive development problems with children. This is also a problem that is not exclusive to one part of the country.  In fact, if you look at cities across the country, you will see there are elevated blood lead levels in children.  In Baltimore, for example, there is a lead poisoning rate of 27.9 percent. Almost 30 percent of the children who are tested have elevated lead levels. In Milwaukee, 22.5 percent; St. Louis, 23 percent; Chicago, 20.6 percent; Philadelphia, 38 percent; and Memphis, 12.1 percent. This is a nationwide problem. The major cause of this exposure is lead paint in the homes of these children.  Indeed, children who are in low-income circumstances, particularly children who are living in housing that was constructed before 1974, are significantly vulnerable to lead exposure and lead poisoning.  More than half the U.S. housing stock was built prior to 1978, so as a result we have thousands and thousands of units that still contain lead paint which is the source of contamination for these young children.  In fact, it has been estimated that 20 million housing units throughout the United States contain hazardous levels of lead paint.  In my home State of Rhode Island, it is estimated that about 90,000 units present moderate to high lead paint exposure risks to children who live there.  This is a very difficult and expensive problem to deal with. It has been estimated that to modify and to remediate all these homes in my own home State, it would cost about $300 million. To deal with every seriously contaminated residential unit in the United States would cost something on the order of $500 billion. But those costs also must be measured against the cost of doing nothing, the cost of allowing children to be exposed to lead paint, and those costs are dramatic and severe.  Many educators point to lead paint exposure as one of the reasons why special education costs are so high. Infact, it has been estimated that children with elevated levels of lead in their blood are seven times more likely to drop out of school before finishing high school. These costs are significant and severe. I think we have the obligation to try to remedy this problem before these children are exposed, before their academic, intellectual, and emotional development is impaired by exposure to lead.  Since 1992, the Office of Lead Hazard Control in HUD has been dealing with this issue, principally through their Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program. They have been able, since 1993, to provide $435 million to the States--31 States and the District of Columbia--to deal with this issue.  These States have used the money for testing young people for exposure, inspecting and testing homes, modifying homes; in fact, to even relocate children who are exposed and the home cannot be modified.  I have seen the results in Rhode Island.  Since 1993, in Rhode Island, we have been able to perform lead abatement in more than 500 homes. But it costs money, the kind of resources that we need to incorporate in this bill, the kind of resources that are necessary to address a problem that spans this Nation.  My amendment would propose an increase of $20 million for the Office of Lead Hazard Control. It would be offset by an across-the-board cut in salaries, expenses, and other program management budget items in the HUD budget.                     Amendment No. 1778, Withdrawn  Recognizing the severe constraints that the chairman and the ranking member are laboring under, recognizing the fact they are already demonstrating a commitment to provide for these resources, I withdraw this amendment in the hopes that as we go to conference, under the leadership of Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, we can find additional resources to address this extremely important and critical issue that affects the health and welfare of our children.
