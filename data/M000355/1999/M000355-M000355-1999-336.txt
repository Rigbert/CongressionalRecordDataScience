 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear friend Gil Clark. I have admired and respected Gil as a friend and coach for many, many years. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family today, as Gil continues a brave fight against liver cancer.  Gil and I go way back. I met Gil in the 1950's, when he was my little league baseball coach in Louisville. Gil began coaching with the Beechmont Youth Program at its inception in 1955, and served faithfully as president of the program for more than 35 years.  Gil always taught our little league team that the most important thing about sports was that you practice hard and play your best, not necessarily that you win. He loved baseball without qualification, and all of us on the team could tell. His enthusiasm for the game was infectious, and his desire to teach us lessons about life through sports was inspiring. Gil wanted our team of aspiring players to understand that in life, you're not always going to win--but you should always perform to the very best of your ability. Gil certainly made a lasting impression on my life, and I'm sure that in his many years as a coach he has positively influenced the lives of numerous other young people as well.  Gil committed himself to teaching and coaching young people at Beechmont, and worked on the administration of the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Parks service for many years. Gil practiced what he preached to those around him, and showed runners year after year that perseverance and spirit could get the job done.  In 1974, Gil was asked by Louisville's mayor to take on the challenge of directing the ``Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon.'' Gil organized many races during his tenure with Metro Parks, but he especially enjoyed putting on the miniMarathon each year. Gil took the mayor's challenge seriously, built the race to its present glory, and is now known in Kentucky as the ``father of the miniMarathon.''  Gil, thank you for working with me and coaching me as a young little leaguer at Beechmont, and thank you for your dedication to so many other young people throughout the years. I am certain that your service to the Louisville/Jefferson County community is appreciated by all, and I am amazed at your continued commitment to others even in your time of illness. May God continue to bless you, and give you strength in your valiant fight.  Mr. President, please include a copy of a Louisville Courier-Journal article from Sunday, April 25, 1999 recognizing Gil Clark's accomplishments.               [From the Courier-Journal, Apr. 25, 1999]                     There's Always Been Gil Clark                             (By Jim Adams)       Gil Clark stood on a slope beside Iroquois Park at 7:59:50      a.m. yesterday (runners never round off their minutes) and      beheld what he had built: A wide river of 6,500 runners was      standing in place, looking up at him.       ``Ten,'' he said into the microphone.       ``Nine,'' he said, firm of voice.       ``Eight,'' he said. He waived a starting pistol above the      pith helmet he was wearing, the trademark headpiece some      might think is stitched to his scalp.       This moment could last no more than 10 seconds, of course,      but it was a sight that caused the hearts of some of      Louisville's serious road runners to soar yesterday at the      start of the 26th Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon.       That's because the 78-year-old Clark--director of the 13.1-     mile race since its inauguration on a Monday morning in      1974--was diagnosed with liver cancer last fall. Just a month      ago, he lay unconscious in a hospital for five days; at      death's door.       A stream of runners appeared at his bedside last month to      say their personal farewells to the man who almost everyone      acknowledges has done more than anyone else for road racing      in Louisville.       He didn't invent the pre-Derby race--a politician did      that--but Clark took it, built it, shaped it and nurtured it,      and so a lot of people call him the father of the      miniMarathon. The way the runners talk about him, he actually      seems more like its favorite uncle.       ``He's the one that made running in Louisville,'' said Jack      La Plante, who has run in more than 20 miniMarathons and who      stopped to grin for a picture with Clark yesterday morning.      ``He put the city on the map, as far as runners go,'' La      Plante said right before running the race gain.       ``He's it,'' said Stan Clark, long one of the leading      runners in the miniMarathon, who is not related to Gil Clark.      At last month's City Run, Gil Clark's absence was a huge      hole, Stan Clark said. ``He's always present; he's always      there. There's always been Gil Clark.       Mary Anne Lyons, the leading female runner in the      miniMarathon in recent years, tells this story: An      acquaintance told her that years ago, she had set the      miniMarathon as a personal goal and had trained long for it,      but then ran into an unyielding schedule conflict on race      day--a sister's wedding, Lyons thought it was.       Grasping at straws, the woman--unsure why--called Clark to      explain her dilemma. Ever sympathetic, Clark listened, then      told the woman to go out and run the route on her own and      record her time, Lyons said--and that woman told her that her      name appeared on a listing of race finishers that year.       The story captures the essence of what runners clearly feel      about Clark. ``He's for the middle and the back of the      pack,'' said Kathy Priddy, Clark's assistant for 18 years      when he was Metro Parks' manager for recreation services.      He's been an advocate of what's fair and decent.       His view is at the very core of the miniMarathon itself, a      race open to everyone, where neighbors run against neighbors,      co-workers against co-workers.       The miniMarathon has always known it could be flashier and      draw a different type of runner if it wanted to, but Clark      has never thought much of those impulses. ``I don't want to      be director of a race that gives away money,'' he said in a      telephone interview Friday. ``If we can't do it for the fun      of it, for the fitness of it, and for the camaraderie, then I      would want it to die.       Clark was an unlikely road-race god on Feb. 4. 1974, when      he was hired for the park job at age 53 after a career in      sales. No one in his family has ever raced. Clark himself has      always been a baseball man; he played in high school in      Alton, Ill., and spent decades running the youth baseball      league in Louisville's Beechmont neighborhood.       But within two days, he was transformed from baseball man      to running man. ``On the sixth day of February, the mayor      (Harvey Sloane) came to see me and told me we were going to      have a mini. I think he called it a half-marathon,'' Clark      said. ``I'll give them an audience,'' Clark said Sloane      declared--and indeed the finish, then at the Riverfront Plaza      and Belvedere, was generously attended by City Hall workers      liberated for the occasion.       It was, Clark said, the first road race of its kind in      Kentucky.       Businesses soon griped about work-day traffic tie-ups when      the first miniMarathons were run on Mondays; the religious      community wasn't happy when Sunday was considered as an      alternative. So Saturday got the miniMarathon by default.       Today, Clark said, he believes Louisville has the only park      department in the nation that oversees 20 or more races in a      year--``for the good of the public,'' he added. ``We have      developed a lot of fine races in Louisville, Kentucky, and      I'm proud of that,'' he said.       Priddy, Clark's assistant, said he actually retired and      moved to Florida in 1997 with his wife Lorene, Whom he always      called ``Mom.'' But she died in March of that same year, just      days after the move, and Clark canceled his retirement and      came back to the city where he'd lived since 1948.      ``Louisville was his life,'' Priddy said. ``He would have had      nothing in Florida.''       Back in Louisville, he also continued to be involved with      the mini, although the Derby Festival had by then taken over      official management of the race.       And he also had the unending appreciation of the running      community--a community that seems to doubt it would even      exist were it not for him. Runner Lyons, for example, who is      30, believes that if Metro Park's running program had not      been built, she might not be running today. Running in that      case would have required travel, she said, and she very well      might not have done it.       Clark worked with the program he loved until late last      year. He said he did well after surgery for his liver cancer,      but early this year, ``for some reason I can't explain, it      all went berserk.''       One of his two sons, Marvin Clark, said yesterday that in      late March, it truly appeared that his father would die.      Doctors held out little hope, then no hope, and prayers were      said for a peaceful exit.       Then, Gil Clark began moving--first a leg, then he opened      an eye, and soon he spoke. Marvin and his father both said a      doctor wrote on his chart these two words: ``Devine      intervention.''       ``God's got something else for me to do, I guess,'' Clark      said Friday. ``I might see another Vencor (the road race that      precedes the miniMarathon), but if He lets me live to      tomorrow night, I will be most grateful.''       Aside from whatever God has in mind for Clark, the Derby      Festival had some ideas, too. Yesterday, it wanted him to      fire the starting pistol for he mini-Marathon.       Friends Tandy Patrick and Jim Woosley, a Louisville police      officer, picked Clark up at his son's home in eastern      Jefferson County in Patrick's Camaro convertible--with the      top down and the heater on.       Clark wore a white-and-purple jogging suite and his      multicolored pith helmet--he doesn't remember who gave the      helmet to him, and by now it's been through so many races it      appears entirely held together by duct tape and paint. He was      bundled in a blanket and scarf in the front seat of the      Camaro. But this was the way he wanted it, so he could wave      at the runners.       To travel the 25 feet from the Camaro to the starter's      stage, Clark used a wheelchair, but stood strong when Mayor      Dave Armstrong gave him a glass plaque, the Derby Festival's      Lifetime Achievement Award.       And then the countdown to another race began.                          ____________________
