Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of Plast, the Ukrainian Scouting Organization.  Plast was founded in 1911 by Dr. Oleksandr Tysovsky, and it is based on the principles of scouting started by Lord Baden Powell in Great Britain.  As a consequence of the country's absence of national independence through most of the 20th Century, Plast was forced to go underground when the occupying Soviet Union declared the organization illegal and banned its activities.  However, following World War II, when many Ukrainians emigrated to various countries of the Free World, including the United States, the plastuny (members of Plast) among the emigres formed Plast organizations in the countries of their settlement. This included incorporating ``Plast, Inc.'' in 1950 in the state of Michigan.  Additionally, after the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine in 1991, Plast was re-constituted in Ukraine with the help of plastuny from the United States and other Free World countries.  Today, Plast is an international organization of Ukrainian youth which fosters personal development, leadership and teamwork, as well as a love of Ukrainian culture and history while also raising youth to be conscientious, responsible and valuable citizens of their communities at the local, national, and international level. The former President of Ukraine, Victor Yushchenko, is an honorary plastun, and Liubomyr Cardinal Husar, a U.S. citizen and now Patriarch-emeritus of the Ukrainian Eastern Rite Catholic Church based in Ukraine, is one of many distinguished plastuns.  Currently, Plast has 23 branches coast to coast in the United States, and Plast will be celebrating its Centennial with a Jamboree in Ukraine, August 10th to 24th, with the official opening of the Jamboree Celebration on August 19th in the city of L'viv.  As such, we should recognize August 19, 2012 as the Centennial Day of Plast, commend the Ukrainian Scouting Organization for its tremendous contributions, and celebrate the Centennial of Plast.                          ____________________
