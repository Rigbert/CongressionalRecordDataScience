President, it has been 10 months since the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions favorably reported the nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy to serve as Surgeon General of the United States. While this seat sat vacant, our Nation has suffered through concerns and divergent information about the possibility of an Ebola outbreak and is on the cusp of what is predicted to be a difficult flu season. It is past time to move forward and confirm this nomination.
