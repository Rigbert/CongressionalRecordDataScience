Speaker, that language was clearly designed, as the gentleman knows, as the staff knows, and as has been publicized, to preclude one of the agencies that delivers health care in Puerto Rico from doing so, and that is Planned Parenthood that gets public funds. This is designed, we believe, to restrict it. But let's put that aside. Let's say we have a disagreement on that. Let's accept that.                              {time}  1245  What the Senate said, if we have disagreements on these things, we are going to pass a bill that gets that money out the door. And they passed it 68-30, which means approximately one-half of the Republicans voted for it because--and, very frankly--a predecessor of yours, Mr. Blunt, was a cosponsor of that bill--one of my very close friends, as you know--along with Mrs. Murray.  So, they achieved the objective in the United States Senate of doing exactly what I think you are actually correct, Mr. Speaker, in saying, and that is that the people want us to act.  It is not on the schedule this week. It is not on the schedule next week. And it ought to be on the schedule for consideration, and it ought to be in a bipartisan way, which means that both you and I could say that, yes, our sides can support this. Without, we have some very significant differences, Mr. Speaker. We all understand that. The American people understand that. And we ought not to try to deal with those in something as critically important.  That is what the Senate decided to do. That is what Roy Blunt decided to do. That is what Senator Murray decided to do. And that is what 68 Members of the United States Senate decided to do.  Now, let's, just for the sake of argument, agree that we have a disagreement on the interpretation of what that does, but if we have a disagreement, that means that we are not able to pass that bill. You may disagree with our reasoning, but that is the fact. And that is the conclusion the United States Senate came to, Mr. Speaker. So they did a bill that they could agree on in a bipartisan way.  And I tell you, Mr. Speaker--I will reiterate it once again--bring the Senate bill. It wasn't our bill. This is a Blunt-Murray bill. Mr. Blunt is the former majority leader and majority whip and minority whip of the House of Representatives. The Senator from Missouri, a Republican leader in the Senate, sent us a bipartisan bill.  Let's take that bill, and whatever other differences we have, let's debate them, Mr. Speaker. Those provisions can be brought to the floor separate and apart, without undermining the need to immediately fund the Zika public health efforts.  So, I, again, say to my friend, those two issues--and I might also add, perhaps in closing, that we ought to bedealing with Flint as well, another public health issue that has been pending, Mr. Speaker, for over a year.  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield, before he goes to a new subject?
