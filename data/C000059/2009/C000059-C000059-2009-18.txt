Chairman, I rise today to bring your attention to the ongoing water crisis in my home State which has exacerbated the economic downturn throughout California.  Statewide, the unemployment rate has risen to more than 11 percent. In the Central Valley, regional unemployment has reached 20 percent with some communities' unemployment now up to over 40 percent. California's water crisis is the result of severe drought conditions on top of the federally imposed pumping restrictions that have been placed on our State's critical water infrastructure.  The appropriations bill before us provides some funding for a number of California's mid- and long-term water resource management projects. Unfortunately, many of the projects that are receiving funding are years away from completion and will not provide any assistance to Californians suffering today.  Even the most promising short-term projects in the Delta, like the Two Gates project, will only provide relief if regulatory permitting and anticipated court challenges are resolved in quick fashion. Many of the most affected communities have made it clear that they aren't looking for a handout. They want their water and they want their jobs back.  During the markup of this bill in the committee, I offered an amendment to do just that by ending the federally imposed pumping restrictions. Sadly, most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle rejected the amendment and voted to protect a 3-inch fish instead of protecting jobs and the people of my State of California. I'm disappointed the Rules Committee denied a similar amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. Nunes.  Mr. Chairman, the federally imposed pumping restrictions are harming California families up and down the State. If this Congress and this administration fail to take the bold steps necessary to address the crisis in the next 6-12 months, the people of California will know exactly who's responsible for the job losses.
