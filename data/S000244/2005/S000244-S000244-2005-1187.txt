Chairman, I yield myself the time given to me in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, first, both sections of the bill do provide an exception for incest, and all of the arguments that have been made to the contrary are simply not correct.  Furthermore, this amendment should be defeated because it would codify the circumvention of parental involvement when the overwhelming majority of Americans support parental involvement. In some polls, over 80 percent of the public supports parental involvement. As recently as March 2005, 75 percent of over 1,500 registered voterssurveyed favored requiring parental notification before a minor gets an abortion, and only 18 percent opposed parental notification.                              {time}  1745  Under current law, grandparents and clergy do not have the authority to authorize a medical procedure for a minor child, or even ear piercings or the dispensing of aspirin at schools. So why should such a fundamental parental right be thrown aside for the abortion procedure alone? This amendment would sever the essential parent-child relationship. Grandparents and undefined clergy are not parents. It is that simple.  It is instructive that the Supreme Court has always held that the important duty to ensure and provide for the care and nurture of minor children lies only with the parents, a conclusion which arises from the traditional legal recognition that ``the natural bounds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their children.'' That was Parham v. J.R., 1979, of the Supreme Court. And as Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter observed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, parental consent and notification laws related to abortions are ``based on the quite reasonable assumption that minors will benefit from consultation with their parents and that children will often not realize that their parents have their best interests at heart.''  Significantly for CIANA, the Supreme Court recently struck down a Washington State visitation law under which grandparents were granted visitation of their grandchildren over the objection of the children's mother. That State visitation law was struck down precisely because it failed to provide special protection for the fundamental right of parents to control with whom their children associate.  The amendment also excludes from the bill any clergy, and the amendment leaves the word ``clergy'' undefined. Just last year, one State court ominously described the dangers of using the term ``clergy'' in the law without providing any clear definition. That court stated, ``Almost anyone in a religious organization willing to offer what purports to be spiritual advice would qualify for clergy status.'' That is Waters v. O'Connor, 2004, the Court of Appeals of Arizona. That means that under this amendment, an impressionable and vulnerable minor could be sexually exploited by a cultist and the cultist could escape liability and prosecution under this legislation because the cultist claims clergy status.  In fact, when the Federal Rules of Evidence were being debated in Congress, Congress specifically rejected using the word clergy in those rules. Doing so would have invited courts, just as this amendment would, to allow all matter of cult figures to fall under the term.  Parents, and not anyone else, know and can provide their dependent minor children's complete and accurate medical histories. Before children undergo medical procedures, parents are required to provide this critical information. Without that medical history, an abortion could be devastating to a child's health.  As the Supreme Court has made clear, ``the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting. An adequate medical and psychological case history is important to the physician. Parents can provide medical and psychological data, refer the physician to other sources of medical history, such as family physicians, and authorize family physicians to give relevant data.'' That is H.L. v. Matheson, 1981.  And in addressing the right of parents to direct the medical care of their children, the Supreme Court has stated, ``Our jurisprudence historically has reflected western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children. Our cases have consistently followed that course; our constitutional system has long rejected any notion that a child is a mere creature of the State.'' And, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally ``have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare their children for additional obligations. Surely this includes the high duty to recognize symptoms of illness and to seek and follow medical advice. The law's concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life's difficult decisions.'' Parham v. J.R., 1979.  Parents, not grandparents or undefined clergy, are legally, morally, and financially responsible for their children's follow-up medical care. If parents are kept in the dark by others, they will not be able to recognize potentially dangerous consequences of abortions.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to defend the integrity of the parent-child relationship, which this amendment does so much to undo; to protect the rights of young girls from potential medical harm by defeating this amendment. Please vote ``no.''  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Gillmor). All time for debate on this amendment has expired.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.
