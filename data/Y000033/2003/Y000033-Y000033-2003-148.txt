Mr. Speaker, today, along with nearly every member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I and Congressman Jim Oberstar are introducing a truly historic highway and transit funding bill that will benefit every State in the Nation.  The introduction of this bipartisan legislation would not have been possible without the support and cooperation of Congressman Oberstar. In addition, the Chairman Petri of the Subcommittee on Highways, Transit and Pipelines, along with the subcommittee ranking Democrat, Congressman Lipinski were instrumental in getting this legislation written for introduction.  The legislation provides $375 billion over the next six years. This proposed level of funding is based upon the needs of our country as outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation Condition and Performance report.  With this bill, we will have the resources to maintian our existing transportation infrastructure and begin to improve it as well. We can address our national congestion crisis and safety problems.  Our transportation infrastructure is old and getting worse. Thirty two percent of our major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 28% of our bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.  Congestion is affecting our quality of life and costing our nation $67 billion a year--more than $1,100 for the average commuter each year.  Commuters are sitting longer and longer in traffic jams and billions of gallons of fuel is wasted each year due to congestion.  Most importantly, this country is facing a transportation safety crisis. More than 42,000 people die each year on our roads and highways. Nearly one-third of all these fatal crashes are caused by substandard road conditions and roadside hazards. This is totally unacceptable for the most advanced nation in the world.  Over the next six years, we provide $298 billion for highway, road and bridge improvements . . . and $69 billion for transit programs.  This legislation proposes to increase the minimum guaranteed percentage for every State from 90.5 percent to 95 percent by 2009. We understand that more equity is needed for all 50 States.  The bill significantly increases funding for highway safety programs.  In addition, the bill authorizes $17.6 billion for ``Projects of National and Regional Significance''--a major boost for these important projects.  It also authorizes $7.5 billion to address the problem of railroad-highway crossings and the elimination of road hazards.  Our legislation will also have another positive benefit by giving a major boost to our nation's economy. Nationally, this proposal creates more than 1.3 million new highway jobs over the next six years.  It is time to face the facts--our highways, bridges and transit systems are aging and not up to the standards which our citizens expect. We need to stimulate the economy and this important legislation will do just that. America's congestion and safety crisis will not go away--it must be addressed immediately.  Enactment of this landmark legislation is a legacy for all users of our transportation infrastructure, both today and for future generations and moves our aging transportation system into the 21st century.                          ____________________
