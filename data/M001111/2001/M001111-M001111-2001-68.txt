 President, I am very pleased that the Senate has now finally passed the Senate Transportation appropriations bill. It has been a long and arduous process, but we have done the right thing today. We have done the right thing for our constituents who have been sitting in traffic, for our constituents who are concerned about safety at our airports, for our constituents who daily travel in this country, who use our waterways and our highways and our air transportation system.  We have moved this bill forward in a way that I think is very sound. We have tried to meet the needs, as I said, of all of the Senators, who I think have done a good job on this floor. But, most importantly, I am especially pleased that we have moved the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill out of the Senate without compromising one iota on the safety of our families on our highways in regard to the Mexican truck provision. I think that is absolutely the way to go. I commend my colleagues who stood with me on this issue as we have moved this bill through the Senate.  I also take this opportunity to thank my staff: Peter Rogoff, Kate Hallahan, Denise Matthews, Cyndi Stowe, Angela Lee, and Dale Learn; as well as Senator Shelby's staff: Wally Burnett, Paul Doerrer, and Candice Rogers; and our Commerce Committee staff: Debbie Hersman.  All of our staff members have spent countless hours in this Chamber, negotiating late into the night on many evenings over the past 10 days. I especially thank all of them for their tremendously good work and hard work and for being a part of getting this bill passed out today.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
