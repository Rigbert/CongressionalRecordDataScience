Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot today, and I would just like to clarify some of the things that were said. The rules of this House, the Supreme Court say the committee can judge what is pertinent, not the witness. That is the rules and that is the Supreme Court. We told all three of these parties that was the case, and they still declined to answer.  Let us make it perfectly clear that POGO is not the whistleblower. Neither are the gentlemen or ladies that are involved in these contempt citations the whistleblowers. The whistleblower, Johnson, was filed on top of for money. POGO now is under criminal investigation as I stand here and speak.  Mr. Speaker, I know that this is such a serious debate, that we have to have more debate. So I ask unanimous consent, pursuant to clause 2 of rule XVI, to withdraw the resolution.
