 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut for his remarks. They are right on. I wish to associate myself with them. I wish to thank him for his decades of perseverance on behalf of education. It was an excellent set of remarks. I thank him very much.  Mr. President, my understanding is that each Member has an hour to speak on the motion to proceed. I intend to use my time not only on the education bill, but because of the situation in California with respect to energy, I wish to give this body, on the 1-year anniversary of the energy crisis, a brief report. I ask unanimous consent to do so.
