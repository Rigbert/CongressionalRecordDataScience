President, this amendment was enacted by the Senate as part of the bankruptcy bill last year. The bill received a vote of 97-1. It imposes no new legal duties on creditors or lenders but says they must follow the law if they want to take advantage of the law.  We are talking about equity creditors, lenders who prey on people who are disabled, elderly, vulnerable, and less educated. Folks on a fixed income with a home end up with a new mortgage because they wanted siding on their home or a new roof and several months or years later find out they are about to lose the last thing they have on Earth--their home--because of unscrupulous practices by these creditors.  The bottom line is this: If we are going to have rules in this society for borrowers, we should also have rules for creditors. The rules are called the law. If they do not follow the law, they can be thrown out of bankruptcy court if they are a borrower. If they do not follow the law and the Durbin amendment passes, they will be thrown out of the court because they have been guilty of unscrupulous credit practices, taking advantage of the elderly.  All the Senators on the floor who have lamented the scandalous behavior of these creditors in the past have a chance now to vote for an amendment to tell them once and for all that their low-life tactics are unacceptable in America.  I yield the floor.
