 President, today the Senate will have a period of morning business until 4 p.m. this afternoon. This period was set aside to give Senators an opportunity to give statements on the fifth anniversary of September 11.  At 4 o'clock today, the Senate will continue to debate H.R. 4954, the port security bill. Several Senators were in the Chamber on Friday to offer amendments, and the managers are here again today to make more progress. We hope to finish this bill midweek, and those Senators who have amendments should be talking with the bill managers today. There are no rollcall votes today, and we will announce the voting schedule for tomorrow before we adjourn this evening.  I also wish to remind everyone that this evening Senators should meet in the Chamber at 5:40 p.m. so we can proceed as a group to the east front for an event to mark the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.                          ____________________[Page S9283]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
