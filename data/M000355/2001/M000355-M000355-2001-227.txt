 President, one final item: I want to notify the Senate that about 4 o'clock I am planning to address the Senate on the implications of this bill on our two parties. I know we frequently don't show up to listen to each other's speeches, but I recommend that Senators who are interested in the impact of this bill on the future of the two-party system and on their own reelections might want to pay attention to what I have to say. My current plan is to deliver that speech around 4 o'clock, and I want to notify people on both sides of the aisle and the staffers who may be listening to the proceedings on the Senate floor.  I think this is one speech that maybe Senators on both sides of the aisle ought to listen to. So maybe just to give notice, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to address the Senate for up to 30 minutes, beginning at 4 o'clock.
