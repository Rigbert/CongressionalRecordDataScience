 President, I serve as chairman of the Senate Aging Subcommittee and I feel a necessity to inform my colleagues about the issue of rumors about the pending bankruptcy of some nursing home chains in the United States.  There are reports in the press, and in discussions with my colleagues I have received information, indicating that one and possibly two large nursing home chains may be facing bankruptcy in the near future. That has an economic side and it has a human side. I will speak first about the human side.  Should one or both of these nursing home chains go bankrupt, we would have an immediate challenge to ensure the continued care of somewhere between 35,000 residents, on the one hand, and 70,000, on the other, in these respective homes where they are currently under care. This would be a significant task. Nursing home residents are frail and are not easily moved. Moving them runs the risk of causing ``transfer trauma,'' a condition that can result in death. Therefore, it is critical that we keep focused on preventing avoidable harm and take precautions to prevent this from happening.  I have introduced legislation to ensure that the quality of patient care is monitored if there would be bankruptcy. My legislation requires the appointment of an ombudsman to act as an advocate for the patient. This change will ensure that bankruptcy judges are fully aware of all the facts when they guide a health care provider through the process of bankruptcy. Prior to a chapter 11 filing, or immediately thereafter, the debtor employs a health care crisis consultant to help it in its reorganization effort. The first step is usually cutting costs. Sometimes this step may result in a lower quality of care for the patients who live there. The appointment, then, of an ombudsman, should balance the interests between the creditor and the patient. These interests need balancing because the court-appointed officials owe fiduciary duties to creditors and the estate but not necessarily to the patients.  There will be occasions which illustrate that what may be in the best interest of creditors may not always be consistent with the patients' best interest. The trustee's interest, for example, is to maximize the amount of the estate to pay off the creditors. The more assets the trustee disburses, the more his payment will be. On the other hand, the ombudsman for the patient is designed to ensure continued quality of care at least above some minimum standards. Such quality of care standards currently exist throughout the health care environment, from the health care facility itself to State standards and even Federal standards that were adopted in 1987.  I would like to have my colleagues consider the following excerpt from the Los Angeles Times on September 28, 1997, which describes the unconscionable, pathetic, and traumatizing consequences of a sudden nursing home closing because of bankruptcy:       It could not be determined Saturday how many more elderly      or chronically ill patients may be affected by the health      care company's financial problems. Those at the Reseda Care      Center in the San Fernando Valley, including a 106-year-old      woman, were rolled into the streets late Friday in      wheelchairs and on hospital beds, bundled in blankets as      relatives scurried to gather up clothes and other personal      belongings.  The presence of an ombudsman should help prevent a recurrence of instances similar to what I just described, where trustees quickly close health care facilities without notifying appropriate state and federal agencies and without notifying the bankruptcy court.  I began discussions with the Health Care Financing Administration at the beginning of April to urge them to take seriously the rumors we were hearing about possible nursing home bankruptcies and to encourage them to make preparations. I called for contingency plans that would prepare, well in advance, for the daunting challenges bankruptcies would pose to various federal and state agencies. HCFA briefed the staff of the Aging Committee, as well as staff from the Finance Committee and Budget Committee. While the HCFA staff appreciated the severity and size of the problem of ensuring resident safety in the event of a bankruptcy, they did not have a plan--or even a plan for a plan.  I wrote to the HCFA Administrator urging her to take the effort very seriously, to keep at the planning and to stay in touch with my office. Only on April 28th did I hear from her officethat we could expect to see the plan in the next two weeks. That is why I wrote to her again on April 29, to tell her to get on with the effort and to let me and interested Members know of the plan to ensure that the people in the affected nursing homes will be protected.  Once we are assured that residents will be safe we can turn to the financial part of the bankruptcies. Now I will address these financial issues.  Before we take any action involving the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, we should ask, and get solid answers to, some critical questions.  The first is this: if the rumors of financial distress are true, how is it that some providers are in such distress while others seem not to be? What factors have put certain companies at particular risk? The answer to that question will go a long way to help us know what kind of response their situation demands.  At this point, I'd like to make an observation about the Medicare element of this situation.  This is in response to the one excuse you are going to find from some of these changes why something ought to be done in the balanced budget amendment of 1997.  A Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Skilled Nursing Facilities was mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). Some argue that, comparing CBO's 1997 baseline with its 1999 baseline, Medicare has saved $7 billion more than originally anticipated, and that this pushed these companies over the edge.  But we need to ask whether or not it did.  CBO has recently clarified its baselines, explaining that the alleged difference between the two baselines comes from an apples-to-oranges comparison: the 1997 baseline included Part B spending on patients in these facilities, while the 1999 baseline does not. When apples are compared to apples, CBO tells us, the Medicare Part A baseline for Skilled Nursing Facilities has decreased by only $200 million over 5 years--not by the $7 billion that we are hearing. Of course this doesn't tell us what is going on in the real world--it only tells us that the discussion should not be about CBO's baselines, it should be about what is really going on out there.  And that is what we need to find out.  Next, questions have been raised by shareholders, in class action suits against the management of these companies, about the competence and effectiveness of the management of these two companies. Did these companies try to grow too large, too fast? Did they take on more debt than they could manage? Was their business strategy flawed? A host of questions need to be answered about the internal operation of these companies--to see if they were being well run--before we assume that more taxpayer dollars will fix the problem. Otherwise we could wind up subsidizing the mistakes of well compensated executives.  These are serious questions that should be answered by the committees of this body. We should make full use of the evaluators who work for Congress. And the Administration should devote some effort to the inquiry as well. We need to understand the problem before we propose a solution.  Yet, some solutions are being presumed, and they are being presumed based on that apples-to-oranges comparison which says there has been $7 billion more saved from Medicare than was anticipated in the 1997 balanced budget amendment. We should make haste to get these answers, and not rush blindly into what could otherwise be a thoughtless bailout.                          ____________________
