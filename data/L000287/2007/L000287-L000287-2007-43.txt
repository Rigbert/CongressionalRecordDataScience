Madam Chair, I rise for two reasons.  First, this has been a long and very difficult bill on the floor. I think the House should recognize the fabulous work of both Mr. Obey of Wisconsin and my colleague from New York (Mr. Walsh). They endured all this. Congratulations for a good job.  Further, I believe we ought to extend our appreciation to the Chairwoman who has done a wonderful job and a fair job in the process, Mrs. Tauscher of California.
