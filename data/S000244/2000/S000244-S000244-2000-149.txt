Speaker, today I introduce the ``Scientific Certainty in Sentencing Act of 2000.'' As the Chairman of the House Science Committee, I have had the opportunity to see first hand the amazing changes that take place each day in various fields throughout the science world. Advancements in DNA testing are no exception. Each advance brings a new degree of accuracy.  The legislation I am introducing today will allow convicted federal criminals the use of DNA testing. This would be allowed for those who did not have the opportunity to use DNA testing during trial or those who can show that a new technologically advanced DNA test would provide new evidence in their case.  Whether this new testing results in an exoneration, reduced sentence, or a reaffirmation of the conviction, we can all rest assured that the rule of law is upheld and that truth and justice have prevailed.  This legislation allows the great strides that have come, and will come, in the field of biological science to be utilized so that we may ensure that we are keeping the correct people behind bars. The bill is not a vehicle for frivolous appeals, but rather to allow all relevant facts to be shown in each case, which can only benefit all parties involved.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in promoting the use of the best technological advances in regards to convicted federal criminals.                          ____________________
