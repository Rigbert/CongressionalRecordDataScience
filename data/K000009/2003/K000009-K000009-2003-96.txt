Speaker, I would just like to say in response to the earlier Special Order, if the tax rate programs of the Bush administration as enacted 2 years ago actually produced jobs, then why has America lost nearly 3 million more jobs since that last bill was passed when in fact all those dollars were not invested in America but taken abroad and continue to empty out the manufacturing and agricultural sector of this country?  My speech this evening actually has to do with old men's oil wars. I thought it would be important to put on the record the following:  Midland, Texas, home to our current President, was drilled dry of oil decades ago. The President's father, who had also been President, had launched Zapata Oil Company to find more oil when Texas ran dry in the Gulf of Mexico and beyond. And then to his son, when the father was President and through his father's friends, was born Harken Energy which the current President headed. Both these firms looked beyond Texas' border for black gold. Both these firms were headed by men who became President of the United States. Harken invested in Bahrain. The President had to divest himself of that before he became our current President; but his father, George 41, still remains a Carlyle Group oil and defense acolyte. Their world view is shaped by oil. Their life has been oil. The politics they pursue is directly entwined with oil.  America consumes 25 percent of the world's petroleum, which is a diminishing world resource, yet we only have 2 percent of the world's people. So having drilled America dry for all intents and purposes, the fifties oilmen, I call them, began to rely more heavily on remaining global supplies. The motherlode lies in the Middle East. It is now on these supplies that America has become dangerously reliant. But rather than become energy self-sufficient here at home and create thousands of jobs in this country, America's older leaders have continued to drive America backwards into a dying petroleum age.  But Henry Kissinger, age 79, is smiling. For longer than I have been an adult, his vision has been to tie Iraq's oil to Israel and points west. This trade route would secure U.S. vital interests in the Persian Gulf, in oil and Israel. And now America has assured that Iraq is policed by over 100,000 U.S. forces.  Donald Rumsfeld, age 70, is smiling, too. He vainly bragged this month he is not known for his diplomacy. The world agreed. In his 1983 visit to Saddam Hussein as Middle East special envoy for the Reagan administration, he was rebuffed when he proposed on behalf of Bechtel Corporation, whose chairman in those days was George Schulz, an oil pipeline that would extend from Iraq through Jordan to Aqaba. Hussein demurred, fearing the pipeline would run too close to Israel. Now Rumsfeld has sat in Abu Gharyb Palace in Baghdad as viceroy Jay Garner receives Bechtel and Halliburton, which Dick Cheney headed. That company now receives noncompetitively bid contracts from this government to secure the oil fields. Not far from northern Iraq lies Baku on the Caspian Sea, an oil bonanza that even Hitler coveted. U.S. forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan make future pipeline defense there so much easier.  George Schulz, age 82, is smiling. No longer Chair of Bechtel, he still serves on its board. His Stanford protege Condoleezza Rice, for whom Chevron named an oil tanker, heads the National Security Council.  Dick Cheney, 62, is smiling. Halliburton, of which he served as CEO before becoming Vice President, just landed a no-bid contract, $7 billion from the government of the United States paid for by the taxpayers of the United States, to control the oil fields of Iraq. Vice President Cheney already is receiving $180,000 a year from Halliburton in deferred compensation. I want to know if Halliburton plans to make an oil deal with President Karzai in Afghanistan who just happens to have ties to Unocal Oil.  Let America embrace the world of the future. Let us move beyond the hydrocarbon age. U.S. addiction to foreign petroleum has cost too many lives and the undemocratic oil kingdoms it has perpetuated are an international disgrace and the primary reason for the rise of terrorism. This world view of the old oil barons should be no more. Let America become energy independent here at home. Let the oil kingdoms democratize. Let us invest that $100 billion-plus we spend to defend foreign oil routes in new technologies here at home: photovoltaics, fuel cells, biofuels, in high speed rail, hydrogen, renewables.  Mr. Speaker, it is time for a new generation of Americans to take over the government of the United States.                          ____________________
