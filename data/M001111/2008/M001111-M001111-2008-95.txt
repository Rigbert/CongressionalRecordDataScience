 President, the Senator from Oklahoma has raised a point of order, and I want all our colleagues to know that his point of order lies against the emergency designations for the census funding, as he has just talked about, but in reality his point of order lies against all the emergency spending in this amendment, including the veterans education funding and the extension of unemployment benefits, and against the disaster relief.  So I urge our colleagues to vote with us on the point of order. It has already been part of the agreement. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.
