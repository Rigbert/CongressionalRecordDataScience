 Speaker, I would like to call your attention to an article printed in the March edition of the Labor Party Press, and submit the article to the Congressional Record for my colleagues' benefit:          [Labor Party Press, Volume 4, Number 2, March 1999]           ``Don't Blow Away Social Security'' (PART 2 of 3)             WHAT'S WRONG WITH PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY?                    1. The stock market is volatile.       The stock market goes up and up. And sometimes it goes down      and down. Even without an economic catastrophe, the stock      market's volatility would make our retirement income entirely      unpredictable. Dean Baker has noted that if the economy grows      as slowly as the Social Security trustees are predicting,      then the prognosis for the stock market isn't too rosy      either. Social Security barely covers seniors' expenses as it      is now.       Former Congressional Budget Office director Robert      Reischauer has pointed out that if we had private Social      Security accounts back in 1969, a person retiring in that      year would have had a 60 percent larger payout upon      retirement than someone retiring seven years later, after the      market dipped. John Mueller, a former economic advisor to the      House Republicans, makes a similar observation. Since 1900,      he notes, there have been three 20-year periods in which      returns on the stock market fell to about zero. In between      were periods of positive returns. ``This meant that some      people earned a negative real return from investing in the      stock market, while others received a real pretax return as      high as 10 percent.'' For retirees, it would be the luck of      the draw.       Under our current system, the government bears the risk of      economic downturn, and we're all promised a constant monthly      amount of retirement income. Under a privatized system, we      each individually bear the risk. Even the cleverest investor      will likely lose money in a major financial downturn. And not      all of us are so clever--or can afford to spend our time      playing amateur Wall Street trader.  2. Shifting to a privatized system would require a hugely expensive                          period of transition.       Say we begin establishing private Social Security accounts      for all of us Americans who are currently working and under      65. Who will generate funds to cover the current retirees?      You and me. Essentially, the next several generations of      Americans would have to pay twice--once into our own fund,      and again to sustain current retirees. According to one      estimate, full-scale privatization of Social Security would      require about $6.5 trillion in additional taxes over the next      seventy-two years. The Employee Benefits Research Institute      estimates that transition costs could amount to something      like 5 percent of the nation's Gross Domestic Product for the      next 40 years. By instituting privatization, we'd be starting      a Social Security crisis, not ending one.            3. Maintaining private accounts will be costly.       Many of us tend to think that any federal program must be      incredibly inefficient and bureaucratic. A Roper poll asked      Americans to estimate the administrative costs of Social      Security as a percentage of benefits. They guessed, on      average, 50 percent. The real answer is one percent. Only one      percent of the money that goes into Social Security is spent      on administration. By comparison, the administrative costs      for private insurance are about 13 percent of annual benefit      amounts.       The main reason Social Security administration is so cheap      is that the whole fund is invested in one place, the U.S.      Treasury. Imagine the administrative cost of managing     millions of separate accounts invested in a myriad of stocks      and bonds. Much of the money would go to Wall Street      investment houses which is why they like the privatization      idea so much.       In Chile, which privatized its retirement system in 1981,      people pay between 10 and 20 percent of their annual      retirement contribution just to maintain their account. The      stock market would have to perform spectacularly to make up      for that kind of expense.    WHAT'S WRONG WITH INVESTING THE SOCIAL SECURITY FUND IN STOCKS?       Clinton and others are advocating that part of the Social      Security system's extra money be invested in the stock market      instead of the Treasury, hoping that it would collect more      interest there. Because the money would still stay in one big      lump, the administrative costs wouldn't stack up the way they      would if everyone had their own account.       But again, the stock market is volatile. There's no      guarantee that the gamble would pay off.       Dean Baker and others also worry that investing the Social      Security Fund in the stock market just opens the door to      further privatization. ``I think it plays into the hands of      people who want individual accounts,'' he says. ``It      logically leads people to believe that there's a fortune to      be made in the stock market. And if there's a fortune to be      made, well then, let me get access to that as an individual.      But in fact, there isn't a fortune to be made, because      they've overestimated the returns.''       As it happens, financial institutions hate this aspect of      Clinton's plan. If dollars are going to be invested in the      stock market, they want to get a cut. But that won't happen      if the government does the investing in one big lump.      Financial types have also complained about the ``danger'' of      having the government controlling such a big chunk of change      on Wall St.       Because so much of the Social Security reform debate is      being driven by Wall Street, Baker believes this plan isn't      going anywhere. And he's glad.          RAISING THE RETIREMENT AGE & OTHER ``POPULAR IDEAS''       There are many other proposals afloat for ``saving'' Social      Security. There's Clinton's idea of setting up voluntary      ``Universal Savings Accounts'' outside the Social Security      system. Workers could contribute through payroll deduction      and the government would match their contribution. Workers      could then invest this pot of money in the stock market.      What's ironic about this plan is that it does nothing to      address the alleged crisis in the Social Security system. But      it does address the deep desire of Wall Street brokers to get      a massive new influx of commissions. And it would also ease      the way for cutting back Social Security in the years to      come.       Some people have proposed shoring up Social Security by      cutting back or even eliminating rich people's access to      Social Security. At a time when the rich are filthy rich,      this does sound appetizing. But politically, it's probably      poison. Because these days, any program that's perceived as a      poor people's program is likely to end up on the chopping      block--just like Medicaid and welfare.       Some of our elected officials propose raising the      eligibility age to get full Social Security benefits as a way      of keeping money in the system. The retirement age is already      slated to rise from 65 to 67 in the coming years, but they      want to force us to work even longer. Proponents of this idea      think it's only fair, since Americans are living longer than      they used to.       Anyone who can make this argument has probably never worked      in a hospital, a refinery, or on a railroad. No one should be      forced to do this work at the age of 70! The average black      man can't possibly like this idea, since in this country a      black man born in 1950 was expected at birth to live only 59      years, on average: he'll never see a dime of Social Security      money. Instead, we should be talking about lowering the      retirement age to match that in other industrialized      countries--and to reflect our growing productivity (See ``But      Other Countries Do Better.'')       One plan by two leading Democrats, Sen. Daniel Patrick      Moynihan of New York and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, would      both increase the retirement age to 68 and reduce Social      Security's cost-of-living adjustment by a percentage point.      Dean Baker points out that such a COLA cut would really add      up for people who live into their 80s and 90s. By the time      someone reaches 85, they would see their annual benefit      reduced by 19 percent. That makes it hard to pay the rent.       There are more equitable ways to being more money into the      Social Security system. The Labor Party and others advocate      eliminating the cap on the payroll tax. But our main message      is this: When it comes to Social Security, our most popular      and efficient social program . . . if it ain't broke, don't      fix it.                               ____________________
