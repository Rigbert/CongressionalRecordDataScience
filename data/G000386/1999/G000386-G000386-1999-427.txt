 President, Older Americans Month is drawing to a close. Before it ends, I would like to describe another Iowan whose accomplishments reflect an ageless spirit.                            margaret swanson  Margaret Swanson of Des Moines has been called the city's ``best known and most beloved volunteer.'' Approaching age 80, she has completed 50 years of volunteer service.  Despite her pledge to slow down, she still maintains a heavy schedule. She estimates that she volunteers 20 hours to 25 hours a week. Sometimes, she has four or five board meetings in a single day.  New causes present themselves, and Mrs. Swanson is not of a mind to say no. Her varied interests have included the Iowa Lutheran Hospital, the American Red Cross, the Girl Scouts, the East Des Moines Chamber of Commerce and the Iowa Caregivers Foundation. She identifies a need, immerses herself in the task and produces the desired result.  When her church needed an elevator, she raised money to buy one. When a used car center tried to open in her neighborhood, she fought for a day care center instead. When a home for children had an out-of-tune piano, she found an inexpensive tuner. No challenge appears too large or too small for her attention.  Mrs. Swanson's volunteer work has earned her such esteem that other community activists clear their ideas with her before proceeding. Her fellow volunteers prize her knowledge and judgment.  Age doesn't seem to play a role in Mrs. Swanson's approach to volunteerism. She is an outstanding volunteer, rather than an outstanding senior volunteer. Growing older means only that she brings more experience and more wisdom to her work. In volunteerism, as in so many other aspects of life, maturity is an asset, certainly not a liability.  During Older Americans Month, I want to thank Mrs. Swanson for her limitless gifts of time and energy to the citizens of Des Moines. By setting high standards of altruism, and by inspiring new generations of volunteers, Mrs. Swanson perfectly illustrates the theme of Older Americans Month, ``Honor the Past, Imagine the Future: Toward a Society for All Ages.''
