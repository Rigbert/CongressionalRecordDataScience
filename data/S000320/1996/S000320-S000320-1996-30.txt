 President, I rise this morning in support of the Hutchison-Shelby amendment to S. 39, the Sustainable Fisheries Act.  Over the past several years, it has become increasingly clear that our marine fisheries are in serious trouble. The Sustainable Fisheries Act will significantly improve the management and conservation of our marine resources by allowing the regional councils to adopt measures to reduce overfishing, bycatch, and waste.  What is clear to all who have been involved in the reauthorization of the Magnuson Act is that decisionmaking authority over the adoption and implementation of bycatch reduction programs must lie with the councils. For the most part, the bill before us today furthers this insight. However, there is a provision which will significantly impair the authority of one of the councils, the Gulf Council, to manage the bycatch program of the red snapper.  The Hutchison-Shelby amendment corrects this oversight and restores the necessary discretion to the Gulf Council. I want to be clear that we are not adding additional powers. Our amendment merely brings the Gulf Council in line with the authority of the other regional councils.  Without the Hutchison-Shelby amendment, the red snapper fishery will be closed, which will shut down recreational fishermen and a thriving charter boat industry. In the city of Gulf Shores alone, red snapper fishing generates approximately $80 million annually. Salt water fishing in my State will soon become a billion dollar industry, and limiting the authority of the Gulf Council to manage these waters will devastate the economy of Alabama.  I thank the Senator from Texas for her leadership on this important issue, and I urge adoption of this amendment.
