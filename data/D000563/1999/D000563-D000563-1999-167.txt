President, the hallmark of our criminal justice system has always been the search for the truth. With this goal in mind, I am introducing legislation to ensure the quality of justice in our criminal courts through the use of DNA testing.  In the last decade, the use of DNA evidence as a tool to assign guilt and acquit the innocent has produced dramatic results. The Innocence Project at the Cardozo School of Law has identified 62 cases in the United States since 1988 in which the use of DNA technology resulted in overturned convictions. In my home State of Illinois, 12 innocent men in the past 12 years have been released from Illinois' Death Row after DNA testing or other evidence proved their innocence.  The bill I am introducing today, The Right to Use Technology in the Hunt for Truth (TRUTH) Act will amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, the bill will allow Federal defendants to file a motion to mandate DNA testing to support claims of actual innocence. Under current law, rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure imposes a 2-year time limitation for new trial motions based on newly discovered evidence. This time limitation can act as a carrier even in cases where the evidence of actual innocence is available. My bill will allow defendants to bring a motion for forensic DNA testing without regard to the 2-year time limitation. It will not waive the 2-year time limit for all new trial limitations. Only motions for forensic DNA testing under limited circumstances will not subject to the 2-year time limitation.  This Federal rule change allows a defendants to utilize technology that was unavailable at the time of their conviction. The bill requires the defendant to show that identity was an issue in the trial which resulted in his conviction and that the evidence gathered by law enforcement was subject to a chain of custody sufficient to protect its integrity.  DNA technology has undergone rapid change that has increased its ability to obtain meaningful results from old evidence through the use of smaller and smaller samples. In the World Trade Center bombing case, DNA was recovered from saliva on the back of a postage stamp.  In the past, crime laboratories relied primarily on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) testing, a technique that requires a rather large quantity of DNA (100,000 or more cells). Most laboratories are now shifting to using a test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that can generate reliable data from extremely small amounts of DNA in crime scene samples (50 to 100 cells).  Two States in the country, New York and Illinois, have laws mandating post-conviction DNA testing. The Illinois law has led to as many as six overturned sentences, including some murder charges.  When the measure was debated in the Illinois Legislature, some lawmakers raised concerns that allowing DNA-based appeals would lead to an avalanche of prisoners' demands for such tests.  But the response from experts is that such motions have not been excessive because prisoners who were justifiably convicted of crimes would have that DNA tests would only underscore their guilt.  Recently, a high-level study of a commission appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno has encouraged prosecutors to be more amenable to reopening cases where convictions might be overturned because of the use of DNA testing. The Innocence Project in New York estimates that 60 percent of the samples it sends out for testing come back in their clients' favor.  Justice Robert Jackson wrote some 40 years ago, ``[i]t must prejudice the occasional meritorious application to be buried in a flood of worthless ones. He who must search a haystack for a needle is likely to end up with the attitude that the needle is not worth the search.'' This bill will help make the hay stack smaller by separating out motions for new trial based on scientific evidence of actual innocence.  I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system by utilizing all that technology has to offer. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1700       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as ``The Right to Use Technology in      the Hunt for Truth Act'' or ``TRUTH Act''.     SEC. 2. MOTION FOR FORENSIC TESTING NOT AVAILABLE AT TRIAL                    REGARDING ACTUAL INNOCENCE.       (a) In General.--The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure      are amended by inserting after rule 33 the following:     ``Rule 33.1. Motion for forensic testing not available at        trial regarding actual innocence       ``(a) Motion by Defendant.--A court on a motion of a      defendant may order the performance of forensic DNA testing      on evidence that was secured in relation to the trial of that      defendant which resulted in the defendant's conviction, but      which was not subject to the testing which is now requested      because the technology for the testing was not available at      the time of trial. Reasonable notice of the motion shall be      served upon the Government.       ``(b) Prima facie case.--The defendant shall present a      prima facie case that--       ``(1) identity was an issue in the trial which resulted in      the conviction of the defendant; and       ``(2) the evidence to be tested has been subject to a chain      of custody sufficient to establish that the evidence has not      been substituted, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any      material aspect.       ``(c) Determination of the Court.--The court shall allow      the testing under reasonable conditions designed to protect      the interests of the Government in the evidence and the      testing process upon a determination that--       ``(1) the result of the testing has the scientific      potential to produce new, noncumulative evidence materially      relevant to the defendant's assertion of actual innocence;      and       ``(2) the testing requested employs a scientific method      generally accepted within the relevant scientific      community.''.       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for the      Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are amended by adding      after the item for rule 33 the following:``33.1.
