Mr. Speaker, twenty-nine years ago--on July 20, 1974--the Republic of Turkey invaded the independent Republic of Cyprus and seized control of more than one third of the island. In 1983, Turkey declared the seized territory to be the ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.'' For two decades this entity has received diplomatic recognition only from its creator and protector the Republic of Turkey. United Nations observers are deployed, and the 113-mile barbed wire fence known as the ``Green Line'' continues to divide the island.  The United States has supported efforts by the United Nations to address the continued division. Though not accepted by both sides, the latest plan, the Annan Plan, remains on the table for consideration. Both Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders have met trying to resolve their differences on this issue.  Over the last several years, the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, has held two briefings focusing on Cyprus. We have heard optimism from some witnesses, and skepticism from others. But the common thread throughout the testimonies has been that Cyprus has been divided too long and must come together to move into the future.  In April, the Green Line was opened to private individuals and groups and their automobiles, and Cypriots flocked across by the thousands into areas denied them for over a generation. Although required to return home each day, families have been able to visit their pre-war homes. In an effort to develop trade between the two areas, the Government of Cyprus announced in June that it would permit Turkish Cypriot trucks carrying goods from the north to cross into the south. The trucks are inspected in accordance with European Union regulations and the laws of the Government of Cyprus Transport Department, which will issue permits to the drivers for the transport of goods, and various fees have been reduced or abolished.  Thus, while we observe the anniversary of a bleak day in the history of Cyprus, we do so in the light of optimism. The people of Cyprus have made clear their desire to overcome the legacy of the past and move toward somesense of normalcy after decades of division. Regrettably, intransigence on the Turkish Cypriot side remains a formidable obstacle to ending the artificial division of Cyprus. We must encourage and support the efforts of open-minded reformers. I am hopeful that negotiations will resume under the auspices of the United Nations Good Offices Mission for Cyprus and that a new generation of Cypriots will have the opportunity to exercise their fundamental freedoms, including freedom of movement, and enjoy economic prosperity in their own land.                          ____________________
