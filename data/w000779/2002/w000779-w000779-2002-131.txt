 My question is, Is the Senator from Nevada aware of any evidence of any studies or analyses indicating that these vote-by-mail elections are tainted by fraud? I am not aware of any. Senator Smith deserves a lot of credit because he could have raised that issue in our election, and he declined to do it.  Is the Senator aware of any evidence of fraud in these races?
