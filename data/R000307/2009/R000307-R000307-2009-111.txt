President, my amendment is very simple, I say to all those milling about. My amendment strikes section 114 of H.R. 2 and replaces it with language that prevents any State from receiving Federal SCHIP funds to cover kids from families with incomes which are the lower of $65,000 or the State median income for a family of four.  It also addresses the Medicaid-SCHIP sandwich by preventing States from receiving SCHIP funding or bonus payments for any higher income Medicaid kids.  We now have States that can cover kids with family incomes up to $128,000. I do not think that is right.  Let me tell the chairman he is absolutely wrong if he says median income is too low. It is median family income, as determined by the Secretary, look at page 2 of my amendment. But how on Earth can we explain to people that we are giving money to a $128,000 income family of four when this is supposed to be for low-income kids? You are ruining SCHIP.
