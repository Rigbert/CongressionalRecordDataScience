President, the Senate is about to adjourn for its August recess--4 weeks when we get to reconnect with our constituents, catch up on the concerns of our home States, and study our legislative plans with a depth and attention that we cannot devote during the hectic days we are in session. Some of us may even spend a little time with our families and friends. As I have done in years past, I will be in Vermont. The choice between spending August in Washington, DC, or Middlesex, VT, has always been an easy one for me.  When the Senate is in session, our obligations are many and varied, as important as they are diverse. We hold hearings, and then we pursue followup questions. We try to engage in oversight, though that has not been a particularly fruitful exercise with this current administration. We investigate issues, and then we endeavor to craft solutions. We vote and we caucus and we deliberate.  It is not always a process that yields results, but today I can report it has. I am pleased to join with the chairman of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee today in introducing a bipartisan bill on patent reform. The bill is the result of almost 2 years of hard work on hard issues. We held several hearings, had innumerable meetings with a universe of interested participants in the patent system, and received input from a number of voices in debate about patent reform. We delved deeply into the myriad problems plaguing our patent system, especially those that hinder the issuance of high-quality patents.  In introducing this bill together, we take a productive step toward updating the most outdated aspects of the patent code and attempt to bolster the Patent and Trademark Office in its administrative review of patents throughout the process. We are striving to place incentives on the parties with the most information to assist the PTO by sharing that information. We place our patent system in line with much of the rest of the world, by moving from a ``first-to-invent'' system to a ``first-to-file.''  Congress needs to address the urgent needs for revision and renewal in our patent system, and we must harness the impressive intellectual power and varied experiences of all the players in the patent community as we finalize our new laws. I believe that, while introducing this bill today is not the end of the process--and indeed, in many respects, it is truly the beginning--it is a significant accomplishment that we have come together to set down a comprehensive approach to overhauling our patent system. If the United States is to preserve its position at the forefront of innovation, as the global leader in intellectual property and technology, then we need to move forward, and this bill is our first step. We must improve and enhance the quality of our patent system and the patents it produces.  This legislation is not an option but a necessity. Senator Hatch and I have made genuine progress on this complex issue. We agreed on many salutary changes, but it can be no surprise that we differed on some aspects of the effort as well. Recognizing the critical importance of compromise, of offering a bill to the interested public to study and improve, and of taking a clear first step down the path to genuine reform, we both made concessions. This is not the bill I would have introduced if I were the sole author, and I expect Senator Hatch would say the same. I appreciate the concessions that Senator Hatch made. I have tried to be both reasonable and accommodating in honoring my commitment to him--a commitment that he requested specifically--to introduce a bill before the August recess.  In particular, I am concerned about how some of the changes proposed would affect the generic pharmaceutical industry, especially the provision that would limit the ``inequitable conduct'' defense to only those cases in which a patentee's willful deception of the PTO results in an invalid patent claim. While I think we should expect the highest caliber of behavior by those who are seeking patents--which are, after all, often highly profitable government monopolies--surely we can atleast insist on an absence of affirmative deceit. I hope and expect that we can continue the discussion on this issue as the year progresses.  I also want to ensure the delicate balance we have struck in the post-grant review process and make certain that the procedure is both efficient and effective at thwarting some strategic behavior in patent litigation and at promoting a healthier body of existing patents. Fee-shifting, even in a limited set of cases, likewise raises concerns that should have a more public airing.  I respect the necessity for considering and balancing a number of different concerns as we draft comprehensive and complicated legislation. I will never sacrifice the quality of the laws we produce to expediency, but I recognize the utility of such compromises when, as with this bill, introduction is a first step in a larger and longer discussion.  I am extremely pleased that Senator Hatch and I have come together to tackle these important and urgent issues. Many hours of hard work were spent by both of our offices to develop legislative language so that we can, today, jointly introduce a bill to move the debate forward. The bill is a remarkable achievement and a substantial step toward real reform. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Hatch, other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the affected parties on these matters.                                 ______                                       By
