President, let me say at the outset that I agree with Senators McConnell and Boxer. Senator Brownback calls for normalizing relations with Azerbaijan. Certainly that makes sense. We want to move toward the day when we have those normal relations. But we cannot overlook the fact that, for over 10 years, Azerbaijan has in fact imposed the blockade on Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, at great suffering to the people of that region.  It has stopped the transport of food, fuel, medicine, and other vital commodities to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.  Our foreign policy is basically premised on the belief that if we are going to have normal relations with Azerbaijan, they have to have normal relations with Armenia.  As Senator McConnell said, Senator Brownback has a vision for the future that we may share someday, but first we must address the concerns that Senator McConnell addresses in his amendment. I support him. I think it is a very sensible approach. To waive section 907 in the absence of any progress toward lifting the blockade would reward the Government of Azerbaijan for failing to remove it.  Keep in mind that even though we have this section 907 restriction, we provide humanitarian and democracy-building assistance to Azerbaijan, and in fact the businesses of the United States do business there involving a lot of international agencies. But before we really normalize relations, let us demand a normalization of relations when it comes to the treatment of the Armenian people.  I don't need to remind anyone in this Chamber of the long and sad history of the Armenian people and the genocide which they endured. They have asked us to stand by them until they can resolve this peacefully. I think the United States is right to do so.  I object to the approach used by Senator Brownback and fully endorse the efforts by Senator McConnell.funding to send latin american students to the u.s. army school of the                                 americas  Mr. President, while the budget caps did not allow adequate funding for this bill, I want to complement Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy on the bill they have produced within the constraints they faced. I am particularly pleased that the bill includes funding for microcredit programs, with the expectation that the Agency for International Development will spend more for microcredit programs than last year. I am pleased that funding for the United Nations Population Fund is included in the bill. I am delighted that Foreign Military Financing funds for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have been increased. These additional funds will help the Baltic countries meet their Membership Action Plans as they aspire to join NATO.  This bill contains International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds that are used for Latin American students to attend the U.S. Army School of the Americas. The school is the Army's Spanish-language training facility for Latin American military personnel, located at Fort Benning, GA. The school is a relic of the cold war with a horrendous legacy of teaching torture and assassination. It deserves to be closed for what it has taught in the past, what it stands for in Latin American democracies today, and what its counter-insurgency training at such a tainted institution may lead to in the future.  I had planned to offer an amendment to delete IMET funding for the school. However, I felt that my colleagues here in the Senate had not heard enough about the school, so I will not offer my amendment today. I introduced a bill, S. 873, to close the school. Our colleagues in the House have also introduced such a bill, H.R. 732, which now has 137 cosponsors.  Let me tell you why I think this school should be closed. I think you need only to look at the yearbook of the School of the Americas. Let me tell you what you will find. It is not surprising that among the graduates of the School of the Americas is the top of the list of the worst human rights abusers in Latin American current history. Listen as I read some of the graduates from the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, GA, an institution supported by U.S. taxpayers. These were people trained at the expense of the United States to return to Central America and lead. Listen to the people included:  19 Salvadoran soliders linked to the murder of 6 Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador in 1989;  48 of 69 Salvadoran military members cited in the U.N. Truth Commission's report on El Salvador for involvement in human rights violations;  Former Panamanian dictator and convicted drug dealer Manuel Noriega and nine other Latin American military dictators;  El Salvador death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson;  Two of the three killers of Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador;  Mexican General Juan Lopez Ortiz, whose troops committed the Ocosingo massacre in Chiapas in 1994;  Guatemalan Colonel Julio Alpirez, linked to the murder of U.S. citizen Michael Devine in 1990 and Efrain Bamaca (husband of Jennifer Harbury) in 1992;  124 of 247--50 percent--of Colombian military officials accused of human rights violations in the 1992 work ``State Terrorism in Colombia'', compiled by a large coalition of European and Colombian non-governmental organizations;  Two of the three officers prosecuted by Guatemala for masterminding the killing of anthropologist Myrna Mack in 1992, as well as several leaders of the notorious Guatemalan military intelligence unit D-2;  Argentinian dictator Leopoldo Galtieri, a leader of the so-called ``dirty war,'' during which some 30,000 civilians were killed or ``disappeared'';  Haitian Colonel Gambetta Hyppolite, who ordered his soldiers to fire on a provincial electoral bureau in 1987;  Several Peruvian military officers linked to the July 1992 killings of nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University;  Several Honduran officers linked to a clandestine military force known as Battalion 316 responsible for disappearances in the 1980's;  10 of the 12 officers responsible for the murder of 900 civilians in the El Salvadoran village of El Mozote; and  Three of the five officers involved in the 1980 rape and murder of four United States churchwomen in El Salvador.  This school is not the victim of a few isolated incidents of wrongdoing by its graduates. This list shows that human rights violations are endemic among its graduates, with far in excess of 200 murderers and other human rights violators on its past rolls.  Yet last week, when the commandant of the school, Col. Glenn R. Weidner, came to brief Senate staff on the school, he said ``it doesn't take much to get on this list,'' that has been read in the Senate. I would say to the colonel what it takes is murder, rape, and torture. And the list is long and convincing.  I would also say to him that these 225 graduates have been confirmed by the Congressional Research Service. I did not include in my bill the other allegations of the School of the Americas graduates that could be independently confirmed. Can the school claim innocence in the actions of its graduates? Many do not think that is possible. For example, just a few months ago the Guatemalan Truth Commission report faulted the school's counterinsurgency training as having ``had a significant impact on human rights violations during the armed conflict,'' a conflict that killed 200,000 people.  How, in the name of democracy, can we keep this school open?  I am not proposing that we hold U.S. foreign military training programs accountable for all of the actions of these graduates. We know from experience that people can be brutal with or without training. But why in God's name do we continue this?  Colonel Weidner also said that those wanting to close the school were isolationists, opposed to engaging in Latin America. Nothing could be further from my point of view. The question is how we engage.  Let me also say to those who suggest that these comments somehow are a reflection of criticism of the military of the United States that this school should close. The Army should support its closing. I think the men and women in uniform who serve this country do a wonderful job. But this school has not produced the kind of graduates for which we can take credit and pride. I believe it is an insult to American Army officers to have their own country's reputation sullied by an institution that has been associated with horrible crimes and human rights abuses committed by its graduates.  We should remove the albatross of their association from them and from our country by closing the School of the Americas.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending? I believe there is.
