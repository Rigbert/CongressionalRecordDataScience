 President, answering the question, let me just repeat what the National Security Adviser in Iraq has just said:     And we will never give amnesty to those who killed American      soldiers or who killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.  Is it helpful to be passing resolutions condemning our allies in Iraq for positions that the National Security Adviser says the Government doesn't hold?  I am pleased to hear that my good friend from Florida opposes the amendment that I hope will be offered later today that calls for an American troop withdrawal by the end of the year. That is a debate I thought we were going to be having, rather than adopting resolutions condemning one part of the Iraqi Government or another--the Iraqi Government, of course, being a great ally of the United States in the war on terrorism.  Maybe that debate will occur later in the day, and I look forward to hearing from the Senator from Florida when we have that debate. I am sure he will be arguing the vote on that should be no, and the Senator from Florida, of course, will be entirely correct; that is exactly how that amendment should be dealt with. I hope it will be defeated overwhelmingly.
