 President, a few weeks ago President Obama asked Congress to raise the Nation's debt ceiling. Today virtually every Republican in the Senate will oppose that request. Washington needs to start spending less than it takes in, and our future will be uncertain and our economy in danger as long as the President fails to lead on this crucial issue.  President Obama's record on the issue is absolutely clear. On the day he took office, the Nation's debt stood at $10.6 trillion. Today it is $15.2 trillion. More spending, more debt, fewer jobs--that is what we have gotten from this administration, and now they want to make it worse. But we should be working together to lower the debt, not having votes to increase it.  The President must be willing to face this crisis head-on. He must be willing to acknowledge how serious this issue is. Most Americans understand that we cannot keep spending money we do not have on programs we do not need. Unfortunately, the President does not seem to be one of those Americans. He has no plan to get this crisis under control, and he continues to act as if it really is not a priority. Has he noticed how that is working out for Europe?  Americans are worried and they are frustrated. Middle-class families are doing without. Why can't Washington? Well, we believe it can. So today Republicans will send a simple message to the White House: No more blank checks. Democrats have been in charge of the Senate and the White House for 3 years. They have had the time they need to figure this out. They have chosen the path of blame instead. They have had their chance. They have made it worse. We must do better.                          ____________________
