I am trying to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that they have been on the calendar since last November. There are extraordinary hardships back in the State of Illinois. I know of no other way, and I have tried every way, to avoid this objection. I do not speak for the minority leader but only as one Senator from the State of Illinois. And I do object.
