 I want to give the Senator from Kansas yet another example of this regulatory overkill by HCFA. I don't know whether the Senator from Kansas is familiar with this, but it is the new 15 -minute incremental reporting requirement. HCFA is requiring nurses to act more like accountants or lawyers billing for every 15 minutes of their time. They are going to have to carry stopwatches to comply with this. Implementation is not only going to be very difficult for the staff to administer, but also, once again, it changes the very relationship between the patient and the nurse. It is very disruptive to a patient's care.
