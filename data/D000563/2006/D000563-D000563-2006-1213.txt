I want to make sure for those who have been following the debate from the beginning that they understand exactly the issue.  As I understand it, we are talking about those private companies that drill for oil on lands owned by the people, by the Federal Government, and how much money they will receive for drilling oil. I ask the Senator from Oregon, if he could, in the simplest terms, to explain to me how much is at stake here? How much did the taxpayers pay in these royalty payments to those who are drilling for oil on land that the people, the Federal Government, owns?
