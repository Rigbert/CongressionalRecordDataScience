 Speaker, I rise today to discuss the issue of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity as it relates to both our civilian population and our Gulf War veterans. I continue the submission for the Record the latest ``Recognition of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity'' newsletter which lists the U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, U.S. federal and state courts, U.S. workers' compensation boards, and independent organizations that have adopted policies, made statements, and/or published documents recognizing Multiple Chemical Sensitivity disorders for the benefit of my colleagues.          Recognition of MCS in 8 U.S. Federal Court Decisions       In decisions affirming MCS (by this or another name) as a      real illness, handicap or disability under:       Daubert: Kannankeril v. Terminix Internationals Inc. Third      Circuit Court of Appeals (CA 3), No 96-5818 [17 Oct. 1997, 5      pages, R-148], overturning a lower court's summary judgement      for the defendant (District of NJ, No 92-cv-03150) on a      Daubert motion, saying it had ``improperly exercised its gate      keeping role by excluding'' the plaintiff's medical expert,      Dr. Benjamin Gerson, and his testimony on causation--     specifically his view that the plaintiff developed MCS as a      result of overexposure to chlorpyrifos. [Terminix had sprayed      Dursban in the plaintiff's home 20 times in 17 months.] The      court described MCS as becoming ``sensitized to multiple      other chemicals'' and said ``It is an acknowledged scientific      fact that chlorpyrifos, the active ingredient in Dursban, is      harmful to humans and can cause the very symptoms displayed      by Dr. Kannankeril,'' which included headaches, fatigue,      numbness, memory and concentration problems, sleeplessness,      nausea, and skin rashes. Even though Dr. Gerson had not      examined the plaintiff or written about the toxic effects of      organophosphates, the court said his ``opinion is not a novel      scientific theory'' and ``is supported by widely accepted      scientific knowledge of the harmful nature of      organophosphates.''       Fair Housing Act: United States v. Association of Apartment      Owners of Dominis West et al, Case No. 92-00641 (D. Ha.) 25      August 1993 [19 pages, R-61], in which a consent order won by      the Department of Justice's Housing and Civil Justice      Enforcement Section requires the management of an apartment      complex in Honolulu to take several steps to accommodate a      tenant with MCS.       Rehabilitation Act: Vickers v. Veterans Administration, 549      F. Supp. 85, W.D. Wash. 1982 [4 pages, R-56], in which the      plaintiff's sensitivity to tobacco smoke was recognized as      handicap by the VA and the court, but his request for totally      a smoke-free environment was denied on the grounds that the      VA had already made sufficient reasonable efforts; Rosiak v.      Department of the Army, 679 F. Supp. 444, M.D. Pa. 1987 [6      pages, R-57], in which the court, although finding the      plaintiff ``not otherwise qualified'' to continue working,      implicitly recognized his MCS disability, as did the Army,      which the court found had made sufficient reasonable (albeit      unsuccessful) efforts to accommodate the plaintiff's chemical      sensitivity.       Social Security Disability Act: Slocum v. Califano      (Secretary, HEW), Civil No. 77-0298 (D. Haw.) 27 August 1979      [9 pages, R-60], in what is believed to be the earliest      decision of any court recognizing MCS, the US District Court      of Hawaii awarded disability benefits to a plaintiff whose      pro se claim of ``chemical hypersensitivity'' dated from 1      May 1968; Kornock v. Harris, 648 F.2d 525, 9th Cir. 1980 [3      pages, R-59]; and Kouril v. Bowen, 912 F.2d 971, 974, 8th      Cir. 1990 [7 pages, R-58]; Creamer v. Callahan, Civil No. 97-     30040-KPN (D. Mass.), 5 November 1997, [7 pages, R-150]      reversing and remanding the decision of the SSA Commissioner,      who agreed that the administrative law judge's ``analysis was      flawed with respect to MCS.'' The court ordered the      Commissioner to file a supplemental memorandum on SSA's      ``position with respect to MCS,'' which he did--specifically      stipulating that SSA ``recognizes multiple chemical      sensitivity as a medically determinable impairment'' (31      October 1997, 2 pages, R-164).          Recognition of MCS in 21 U.S. State Court Decisions       In decisions affirming MCS illness (by this or some other      name) as a handicap or injury in cases regarding:       Housing Discrimination: Lincoln Realty Management Co. v.      Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 598 A.2d 594, Pa.      Commw. 1991 [47 pages, R-62].       Employment Discrimination: County of Fresno v. Fair      Employment and Housing Commission of the State of California,      226 Cal. App. 3d 1541, 277 Cal. Rptr. 557 Cal App. 5th Dist.      1991 [11 pages, R-63]; and Kallas Enterprises v. Ohio Civil      Rights Commission, 1990 Ohio App. 1683, Ohio Ct. App. May 2,      1990 [6 pages, R-64].       Health Services Discrimination: Ruth, Barbara; June P.      Hall; Cricket J. Buffalo; Susan Molloy; and Cathy Lent v.      Kenneth Kizer/Molly Coe, Director, CA. Department of Health      Services, No. 665629-8, 1989 [1 page, R-65], in which the      plaintiffs won the right to receive oxygen treatments for MCS      by successfully appealing to the CA Superior Court of Alameda      County which overturned the prior ruling of an administrative      law judge.       Negligence/Toxic Tort: Melanie Marie Zanini v. Orkin      Exterminating Company Inc. and Kenneth Johnston, Broward      County Circuit Court, No. 94011515 07, verdict of 7 December      1995 and final judgement of 28 December 1995 [4 pages, R-92],      in which the jury ruled that the pesticide applicator's      negligence in applying Dursban was the legal cause of damage      to the plaintiff, who was awarded a total of $1,000,000 in      damages by the jury. This was subsequently reduced to      $632,500 in the final judgement.; Ruth Elliott, et al., v.      San Joaquin County Public Facilities Financing Corp. et al.,      California Superior Court, San Joaquin County, No. 244601, 31      October 1996 [2 page verdict report, R-112] in which a public      lease-back corporation was held responsible for 14 awards of      partial to permanent disability based on MCS and various      other health complaints that started after extensive      renovations were inadequately ventilated (half the roof air      conditioners did not work). Awards ranged from $15,000 to      $900,000 each (total $4,183,528) Linda Petersen and Eleni      Wanken v. Polycap of California, California Superior Court,      Alameda County, No. H7276-0, 1 April 1988 [1 page verdict      report, R-143], in which plaintiffs were awarded $250,000 and      $13,000, respectively, for MCS they developed after a      polyurethane roofing material was installed at two school      buildings where they worked. These jury awards led to prompt      settlement of a dozen other cases against the same defendant.       Tort of Outrage and ``Deliberate Intention'' Exception to      Workers Compensation: Birklid et al v. The Boeing Company,      Supreme Court of the State of Washington, 26 October 1995,      No. 62530-1, in which the court issued an EN BANC ruling in      response to a question it ``certified'' from the Ninth      Circuit Court of Appeals. By unanimous 9-0 decision, the WA      Supreme Court found sufficient evidence of Boeing's      deliberate intent to harm its employees from chemical      exposure that the 17 workers who claim they were physically      and/or emotionally injured as a result (including those with      MCS) can sue the company for civil damages in addition to      their workers' compensation benefits. (This ``deliberate      intention'' exception was last allowed by the court in 1922).      The court also found that the chemically-injured workers had      a claim under the Tort of Outrage for recovery of damages      arising from Boeing's intentional infliction of emotional      distress. The matter now returns to the U.S. District Court      for the Western District of Washington for a jury trial.

Joan Amann, et al, No. 25155, order dated 25 January      1995, Nevada Supreme Court [4 pages, R-93], in an order      dismissing the casino's appeal of a district court ruling      that reversed the decision of an appeals officer in favor of      a group of 23 claimants. The Supreme Court agreed with the      lower court's finding that the officer had ``overlooked      substantial evidence offered by the [23] claimants that      clearly supported a causal relation between their work place      injuries [due to pesticide exposure] and their continuing      disabilities.''       New Hampshire: Appeal of Denise Kehoe (NH Dept. of Labor      Compensation Appeals Board), No. 92-723, Supreme Court of New      Hampshire 1994, 648 A.2d 472, which found that ``MCS      Syndrome'' due to workplace exposure is an occupational      disease compensable under NH's workers' compensation statute      and remanded to the Compensation Appeals Board ``for a      determination of whether the claimant suffers from MCS and,      if she does, whether the workplace caused or contributed to      the disease'' [3 pages, R-71, see also]; (2nd) Appeal of      Denise Kohoe (NH Dept. of Labor Compensation Appeals Board),      No. 95-316, Supreme Court of New Hampshire 13 November 1996,      in which the Court again reversed the Compensation Appeals      Board, finding both that the claimant had MCS (legal      causation) and that ``her work environment probably      contributed to or aggravated her MCS'' (medical causation) [5      pages, R-127];       Oregon: Robinson v. Saif Corp, 69 Or. App. 534; petition      for review denied by 298 Ore. 238, 691 P.2d 482 [5 pages, R-     67]; Saif Corporation and General Tree v. Thomas F.

Randolph County Board of      Education, No. 93-11878, 18 November 1994 decision of      Administrative Law Judge Marshall Riley, Workers'      Compensation Office of Judges, reversing denial of MCS claim      for temporary total disability and medical payments by      Workers' Compensation Division [7p, R-131]; Julie Likens v.      Randolph County Board of Education, No. 93-14740, 4 April      1995 decision of Chief Administrative Law Judge Robert J.      Smith, Workers' Compensation Office of Judges, reversing      denial of MCS claim for temporary total and medical      disability by Workers' Compensation Division [8p, R-132]; and      Barbara H. Trimboli v. Randolph County Board of Education,      No. 92-65342-OD, 10 June 1996 decision of Administrative Law      Judge Terry Ridenour, Workers' Compensation Office of Judges,      reversing denial of MCS claim for temporary total disability      and medical payments by Workers' Compensation Division [5      pages, R-133].     Recognition of MCS in 14 Workers' Compensation Board Decisions       In decisions affirming MCS illness (by this or some other      name) as a work-related injury or illness in:       Alaska: Hoyt, Virginia v. Safeway Stores, Inc, Case      9203051, Decision 95-0125, Alaska Workers' Compensation Board      1995 [21 pages, R-73].       Connecticut: Sinnamon v. State of Connecticut, Dept. of      Mental Health, 1 October 1993 Decision of Nancy A. Brouillet,      Compensation Commissioner, Acting for the First District,      Conn. Workers' Compensation Commission. [10 pages, R-106].      The commissioner, citing testimony from Dr. Mark Cullen,      among others, found ``the great weight of medical evidence      supports the diagnosis of MCS syndrome causally related to      the Claimant's exposure while in the course of her      employment'' in state office buildings with poor indoor air      quality. She ordered payment of temporary permanent      disability benefits as well as payment ``for all reasonable      and necessary medical treatment of the Claimant's MCS      syndrome.''; O'Donnell v. State of Connecticut, Judicial      Department, 22 May 1996 Decision of Robert Smith Tracy,      Compensation Commissioner, Fourth District, Conn. Workers'      Compensation Commission. [5 pages, including cover letter      from plaintiff's attorney, R-107]. The commissioner      recognized MCS ``caused by numerous exposures to pesticides      at work . . . and exacerbated by repeated exposure to other      odors and irritants at work'' in a Juvenile Court building.      Because ``this claimant has been given special accommodations      since March 1992 when she was granted an isolated office and      the stoppage of spraying of pesticides'' that allowed her to      continue working full-time, no monetary benefits were      awarded.       Delaware: Elizanne Shackle v. State of Delaware, Hearing      No. 967713, Delaware Industrial Accident Board in and for New      Castle County, December 1993 [21 pages, R-142] awarding total      temporary disability benefits and ``one attorney's fee''      based on the IAB's finding that the claimant's work exposure      (in a state correctional facility built by prison labor) had      ``caused her present respiratory symptoms'' and that this      ``has sensitized her to other odors.''       Maryland: Kinnear v. Board of Education Baltimore County,      No. B240480, Md. Workers' Compensation Commission, 28 June      1994 [1 page, R-75].       Massachusetts: Sutherland, Karen v.

Fireman's Fund Insurance Co, Case No. 9682387, 15 May 1990      decision of Administrative Judge James McGuinness, Jr., Mass.      Industrial Accident Board, ordering that the employer pay for      disability benefits as well as ``all costs, including      transportation, lodging and meals, incurred or to be incurred      in the course of seeking and obtaining reasonable medical and      related care . . . including treatment rendered by and at the      Center for Environmental Medicine.'' [18 pages, R-125];      Elaine Skeats v. Brigham & Women's Hospital, Case No.      02698693, 24 October 1996, decision of Administrative Judge      James McGuinness, Jr., Mass. Industrial Accident Board,      ordering that the employee ``compensate the employee for      expenses incurred in the course of satisfying the historic      and prospective prescriptions of Doctors . . . prompted by      her industrial injury and relative to: intravenous therapy,      vitamin and nutritional supplements, message therapy, air      conditioning, air purification, air filtration, masking,      water filtration, allergy bedding, laboratory testing and      mileage travelled.'' [14 pages, R-126]       New Mexico: Elliott, Erica v. Lovelace Health Systems and      Cigna Associates Inc, No. 93-17355, 8 November 1994, decision      of Rosa Valencia, Workers' Compensation Judge, finding that      MCS was triggered by glutaraldehyde and Sick Building      Syndrome for which employer had been given timely notice.      Also supported Elliott's refusal to return to work in the      buildings that made her sick buildings as ``reasonable under      the circumstances.'' Decision granted 3 months of temporary      total disability pay followed by permanent partial disability      for ``500 weeks or until further order of the Court'' [15      pages, R-113]       New York: Crook v. Camillus Central School District #1, No.      W998009, 11 May 1990, decision of Barbara Patton, Chairwoman,      NY State Workers' Compensation Board specifies ``modify      accident, notice and causal relationship to multiple chemical      sensitivity'' and awarded continuing benefits of $143.70 per      week [1 page, R-108].       Ohio: Saks v. Chagrin Vly. Exterminating Co Inc., No. 97-     310968, 18 September 1997 [2 pages, R-151], decision of      District Hearing Officer Arthur Shantz, recognizing claim of      chemical sensitivity; and Kelvin v. Hewitt Soap Company, No.      95-599131, 5 June 1996 [2 pages, R-152], decision of District      Hearing Officer Steven Ward, recognizing claim of multiple      chemical sensitivity as ``occupational disease'' contracted      ``in the course of and arising out of employment.''       Washington: Karen B. McDonnel v. Gordon Thomas Honeywell,      No. 95-5670, 22 October 1996 decision of Judge Stewart, WA      State Board of Industrial Appeals, recognizing ``toxic      encephalopathy'' as an acceptable diagnosis for MCS-induced      permanent partial disability [2 p, R-118].                               ____________________
