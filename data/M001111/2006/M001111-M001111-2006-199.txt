 President, today I wish to honor Jack Michaels, a decorated veteran and a lifelong advocate for veterans and disabled persons and their families all over the country. It has been my sincere pleasure to work with him to forward these efforts and I wish him all the best in his retirement from his post as Executive Director of the Northwest Paralyzed Veterans Association. His remarkable record of service reminds us all that one person's efforts can improve the lives of many.  The effects of Jack's advocacy can be felt in many ways. Jack served courageously as a Captain in the United States Army from 1966 to 1971 and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, a Purple Heart, and other honors. After being shot down in combat and incurring a severe spinal cord injury, Jack realized his service to the United States was far from over; rather, it was just beginning.  We see Jack's influence in our national civil rights legislation. During Jack's tenure as the National President of Paralyzed Veterans of America, he worked tirelessly to facilitate the passage of landmark civil rights legislation, the Americans with Disabilities Act.  We see Jack's influence in the Puget Sound area. He provides expertise in accessibility and has served on public projects including Safeco Field, Seahawks Stadium, Benayora and McCaw Halls, and Seattle's new City Hall and Regional Justice Center, just to name a few. His leadership enabled the Northwest Paralyzed Veterans Association to provide expertise to enable Amtrak's Cascades to become the first fully accessible train in America. His continued efforts to make SeaTac International Airport more accessible for the disabled will result in a new over-sized disabled passenger vehicle parking lot to be dedicated by Memorial Day this spring.  We see Jack's influence in Seattle's public transportation system. While working with the Washington Coalition for Citizens with Disabilities, of which he was a co-founder, and the Northwest Chapter Paralyzed Veterans of America, which he founded, Jack advocated for a totally accessible public transit system, which became a reality at King's County METRO 20 years later.  We see Jack's influence in the lives of hundreds of disabled veterans, for whom he has delivered, often personally, adaptive equipment in a donation program he created that provides free wheelchairs and hospital beds to those in need.  Throughout his service and advocacy, Jack never forgot his brothers and sisters in arms, both past and present. Through his words and his works, Jack constantly reminded American policymakers and citizens alike of the bravery, honor, and sacrifice military service entails. He reminded us of our national obligation to take care of our veteran population and to create a system with the capacity to provide for future veterans. He reminds us that the absolute least we can do to thank the courageous men and women who put their lives in jeopardy every day to protect our rights is provide for them and their families when their service is complete. With the aging Vietnam and Korean war veteran population and ever growing number of Iraq veterans returning home, it is on all of us to continue Jack's work for veterans and never to forget the example he set.  You might notice the frequent use of a single word throughout this recounting of Jack's military and civilian experience: served. Jack dedicated his life to service, first when he volunteered for the Army, then in countless other volunteer and advocacy endeavors. He gave his time and expertise in exchange for the satisfaction of effecting change and improving the lives of others, many of whom he may never meet. Rather than react with anger or despair to his harrowing combat injury, Jack treated it as a call to action. Jack's work has given opportunity to thousands of veterans and disabled Americans and left a legacy of service that will continue to touch lives for decades to come.                          ____________________
