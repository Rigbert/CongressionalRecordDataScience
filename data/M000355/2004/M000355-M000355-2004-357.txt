 President, this morning the Senate will conduct a period of morning business for up to 60 minutes, with the first 30 minutes under the control of the majority leader and the second 30 minutes under the control of the Democratic leader.  Following morning business, the Senate will resume executive session consideration of Henry Saad to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit. The order from last night provides for up to three cloture votes beginning at 11 a.m. on the Sixth Circuit nominations. First is on Henry Saad, to be followed by a vote on Richard Griffin and then David McKeague. Therefore, Senators can expect the first votes of the day around 11 o'clock this morning.  Also we will turn to consideration of the defense appropriations conference report when it arrives from the House. We will be monitoring their action on that bill so that we can determine when we may begin debate on that bill this afternoon.  I don't believe there is a need for a great deal of debate on the defense measure; however, we will confer with the Democratic leadership on a time agreement for this afternoon. There are a number of other legislative and executive items we are attempting to clear before we depart for the August adjournment. We will be processing those throughout the day as well.                          ____________________
