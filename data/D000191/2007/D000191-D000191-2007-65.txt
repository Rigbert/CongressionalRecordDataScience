Chairman, in response to the gentleman from Arizona, we have added the risk element which wasn't there previously. And he is right. We are still confronted with the Bush administration. But I feel that the new TSA administrator is the best we have ever had, and let's give him the tools he needs to do his job properly. Risk-based, competitive grants. If he doesn't find there is risk in the intercity bus service, then he shouldn't give out the grants. I think he will find plenty of meritorious, risk-based, competitive grants that will help better protect the traveling public in this vital mode of transportation.
