 This amendment directs the Secretaries of Energy and Commerce to jointly establish an energy enterprise competition to promote youth interest in careers in science, technology, engineering, and math, especially as those fields related to energy.  I heard from one of my heroes today, Dean Kamen, probably the best inventor of our time. He has, on his own, started just a wonderful program employing hundreds of thousands of youth all around the country, all around the world, a competition called FIRST Robotics, to really get high school and middle school students invested in looking at the science of so many different things in competitions that I participated in.  My Governor, Rick Snyder, who was in town tonight, was honored as I think the number one guy in the Nation earlier this year in Michigan. We are going to have the national competition in Detroit, I want to say, in 2 years. But I have been at the regional competition for this, and where kids and mentors and companies are invested, this is the future of science in so many different things.  This is a great amendment. I would urge all my colleagues to vote for it. I know that, as I look at my friendship with Dean Kamen, he will probably never talk to me again if I oppose the amendment. It is a great amendment. It should have been done as part of our committee mark.  I look forward to working with the Education committees and appropriators to make sure that it is funded. It is a good thing. I would urge all my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
