 President, I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the Senator from Indiana.  The amendment requires India to declare as civil reactors all reactors that supply electricity to the civil sector.  There is no way that India will accept this.  I might wish they would, but they will not.  That's because for decades, they have built reactors that can be either civil or military.  So India has reserved as military enough reactors to produce more plutonium for nuclear weapons--in case they decide they need to do that.  But India will also use those reactors for electric power.  If this amendment is enacted, India will have to choose to either make all its power reactors civil, and build new ones to produce plutonium; or waste the electric power capability of its current military reactors.  India will not do that.  So this is a killer amendment.  It's also a killer amendment because it requires India to commit toverifiably reduce its nuclear weapons stockpile.  I wish India would do that--but it will not.  India fears both Pakistan and China, which also have nuclear weapons.  The Dorgan amendment does not require Pakistan and China to reduce their stockpiles, only India.  This is a non-starter for India.  Finally, the amendment requires India to commit to ``joining a legally-binding, nuclear test moratorium.'' I wish India would do that. I hope the administration will push for that.  But for now, there is only one ``legally-binding, nuclear test moratorium.'' It is called the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty.  And I do not think this administration will press India to join that treaty.  So, I sympathize with all of the concerns raised by this amendment. But I know that it would kill the nuclear deal.  That is the bottom line: if we support the deal, we have to reject this amendment.
