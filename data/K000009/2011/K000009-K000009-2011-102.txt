And while I will not offer an amendment to strip section 721, a legislative provision that prevents the U.S. Department of Agriculture from doing its job as instructed in the farm bill, relative to fair competition in meat products so consumers get fairly priced meats, I otherwise rise in strong opposition to the language that's in the bill.  And when the authorizing committee wrote the farm bill, USDA was directed to use the existing packers and stockyards act to restore fairness to livestock and poultry contract markets. But instead of allowing the agency to do its job, Congress, in an uneven-handed way, has allowed itself to become captured by the consolidated meat industry.  And while ranchers, farmers and producers are increasingly being squeezed out of the markets, and small, local slaughterhouses continue to close, large consolidated players manipulate the rules to favor their own business operations, and meat prices rise. Congress simply can't stand by silent.  So on behalf of the millions of farmers, ranchers and producers that struggle every day to survive as they face the gargantuan task of competing against monopolistic entities, I oppose the base language in 721.  And I would like to place two statements in the Record, a letter from the American Farm Bureau opposing section 721 and a letter from over 140 organizations supporting the pro-competition proposals made by the Department of Agriculture.                                                     American Farm                                            Bureau Federation,                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 2011.     Hon. Marcy Kaptur,     House of Representatives, House Office Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Congresswoman Kaptur: On behalf of the six million      families represented by the American Farm Bureau Federation,      we write to support your amendment to allow the Agriculture      Department (USDA) the opportunity to complete reviewing the      60,000 comments received and the proposed rule entitled      ``Implementation of Regulations Required Under Title XI of      the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008; Conduct in      Violation of the Act.'' It is also imperative that USDA      continue its economic analysis of the rule.       Farm Bureau is in the unique position of representing every      species impacted by this rule. We also have no affiliation      with major packers, integrators or processors, and therefore      our only interest is the impact of this rule on farmers and      ranchers. Because of this unique position, there are several      provisions in this rule that we strongly support, while      others give us pause.       Generally speaking, Farm Bureau's philosophy supports a      market environment where our farmers and ranchers can sell      their product in a way that best fits with their individual      operation and risk aversion level. Our policy clearly states      that ``We support efforts to ensure open markets to all      producers.'' Over the years, our farmers and ranchers have      recognized the need for a referee in the marketplace, and      Farm Bureau policy supports the Grain Inspection, Packers and      Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) in that role. Some of our      policy supporting the authority of GIPSA includes:       ``We . . . oppose any attempt to lessen the ability of      [GIPSA] to adequately enforce the act and its regulations.''       ``We support more vigorous enforcement of U.S. antitrust      laws in keeping with original intent; to include . . . [the]      Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.''       ``The Packers and Stockyards Act should be amended to . . .      strengthen the ability of GIPSA to stop predatory practices      in the meat packing industry.''       We support ``establishing GIPSA as the overall authority      and provider of oversight to ensure livestock contracts are      clearly-written, confidentiality concerns are addressed,      investments are protected . . .'' as well as ``enhanced price      transparency, [and] price discovery,'' and ensuring that      ``contractors honor the terms of contracts.''       These overarching policy principles guide Farm Bureau's      comments on this proposed rule.       It is also worth noting that Farm Bureau has consistently      requested thorough economic analysis from agencies when      promulgating new rules. Without such an analysis it is      difficult for America's farmers and ranchers to assess the      true impact of rules and to understand all of the      implications of proposed rules. This rule is no exception.       We oppose language to preclude USDA from reviewing the      comments and completing their economic analysis and are      strongly opposed to any action that would stop work on that      rule.           Sincerely,                                                     Bob Stallman,     President.                                  ____     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC, April 21, 2011.       ATTN: Agriculture & Appropriations Legislative Aides       Dear Representative: As a result of rapid consolidation and      vertical integration, the livestock and poultry markets of      this nation have reached a point where anti-competitive      practices dominate, to the detriment of producers and      consumers. Numerous economic studies in recent years have      demonstrated the economic harm of current market structures      and practices, and have called for greater enforcement of      existing federal laws in order to restore competition to      livestock and poultry markets.       Until recently, Congress and the U.S. Department of      Agriculture have largely ignored these trends. Fortunately,      Congress included language in the 2008 Farm Bill to require      the U.S. Department of Agriculture to write regulations,      using its existing Packers and Stockyards Act authorities, to      begin to restore fairness and competition in livestock and      poultry markets.       On June 22, 2010, the Grain Inspection Packers and      Stockyards Agency (GIPSA) issued proposed rules to implement      the 2008 Farm Bill mandates, and to address related      anticompetitive practices in the livestock and poultry      industries. These reforms are long overdue and begin to      respond to the criticisms by farm groups, consumer groups,      the Government Accountability Office and USDA's Inspector      General about USDA's past lack of enforcement of the Packers      and Stockyards Act. The proposed GIPSA rules define and      clarify terms in the Act in order to make enforcement more      effective, and to provide clarity to all players in livestock      and poultry markets.       The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 makes it unlawful      for packers, swine contractors, and live poultry dealers to      engage in any ``unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive      practice or device,'' or to ``make or give any undue or      unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person      or locality in any respect, or subject any particular person      or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or      disadvantage in any respect.'' The ambiguity of these terms      has resulted in uncertainty in the marketplace and hindered      enforcement of the Act.       Key provisions of the proposed GIPSA rules would:       Provide contract growers with commonsense protections when      making expensive investments in facilities on their farms to      meet the packer or poultry company requirements; provide      growers, farmers, and ranchers with access to the information      necessary to make wise business decisions regarding their      operations; require transparency and eliminate deception in      the way packers, swine contractor and poultry companies pay      farmers; eliminate collusion between packers in auction      markets; and provide clarity about the types of industry      practices the agency will consider to be unfair, unjustly      discriminatory, or when certain practices give unreasonable      preference or advantage. These are all terms used in the      existing statute, which have never been adequately defined.       Prohibit retaliation by packers, swine contractors or      poultry companies against farmers for speaking about the      problems within industry or joining with other farmers to      voice their concerns and seek improvements. Currently, many      farmers are often retaliated against economically for      exercising these legal rights.       Allow premiums to be paid to livestock producers who      produce a premium product, but requires the packer or swine      contractors to keep records to detail why they provide      certain pricing and contract terms to certain producers.       Reduce litigation in the industry by eliminating the      ambiguity in interpretation of the terms of the Packers and      Stockyards Act. Such ambiguity leads to litigation as farmers      and packers seek court action to clarify the intent of the      Act.       GIPSA has received approximately 60,000 comments on the      proposed rule during the five-month public comment period      that ended in November 22 of 2010. USDA is in the process of      analyzing those comments, and providing the in-depth cost-     benefit analysis necessary before issuing the final rule.       Because of the great importance of this rule to livestock      and poultry producers and consumers, and the large volume of      misinformation about the rule perpetuated by livestock and      poultry trade associations and packer-producer groups, the      undersigned organizations are writing to reiterate our strong      support for the GIPSA rule and for its swift publication in      final form.       We urge your support for the GIPSA rulemaking process, and      its efforts to restore fairness and competition in our      nation's livestock and poultry markets.

The meatpackers have a stranglehold on this House, scaring Members with millions of dollars in campaign contributions and real threats of political retribution. Instead of engaging in well-meaning public debate and attempting to win on the merits of the argument, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which has a right to speak out, but not a right to intimidate, sent out a national notice to its members to harass the American Farm Bureau. This is not the nature of well-meaning debate and, for many, has crossed the line of propriety.  I urge my colleagues to resist the misinformation and to stand strong for independent producers and family farmers and ranchers.  Section 721 of the base bill goes further than many realize. It will stop USDA from conducting its economic analysis of this industry.  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
