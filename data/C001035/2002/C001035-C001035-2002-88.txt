President, I am pleased to introduce today legislation that is cosponsored by Senators Cleland, Bond, and Hutchinson, that would modernize the current outdated homebound requirement that has impeded access to needed home health care services for far too many of our Nation's frail, elderly, and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. I thank former Senator Bob Dole, one of our Nation'sleading advocates, on behalf of individuals with disabilities, for bringing this issue to my attention.  The highly skilled and often technically complex care that our home health care agencies provide has enabled millions of our most vulnerable older and disabled citizens to receive health care just where they want to be: in the security, comfort, and privacy of their own homes.  Under current law, a Medicare patient must be considered homebound to be eligible for home health services. While an individual is not actually required to be bedridden in order to qualify, his or her condition must be such that ``there exists a normal inability to leave home.'' Moreover, leaving home must require ``a considerable and taxing effort by the individual.'' The law does allow for absences from the home of ``infrequent'' or ``relatively short duration.''  Unfortunately, the law does not define precisely what this means. It leaves it to the fiscal intermediaries to interpret just how many absences qualify as ``frequent'' and just how short these absences must be. The result is that interpretations of the law vary widely from region to region. As a consequence, there have been far too many instances where an overzealous or arbitrary interpretation of the definition has turned elderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries who are dependent on Medicare home health services and medical equipment into virtual prisoners in their own homes. We have heard disturbing accounts of individuals on Medicare who have had their home health care benefits terminated for leaving their homes briefly to visit a hospitalized spouse or to attend a major family gathering, including in one case, to attend the funeral of their own child.  Another mother did not attend the funeral of her own child out of fear that by doing so, she would jeopardize her home health benefits. This does not make sense, and it is just cruel.  The current homebound requirement is particularly hard on younger, disabled Medicare patients. For example, People magazine reported a story last year about a Georgia resident, David Jayne, a 40-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease, who was confined to a wheelchair and could not swallow, speak, or even breathe on his own. Obviously, he needed skilled nursing visits several times per week in order for him to remain at home and not at an inpatient facility.  Despite his disability, however, Mr. Jayne meets frequently with youth and church groups. He is an inspirational person. He speaks using a computerized voice synthesizer and gives inspirational talks about how the human spirit can endure and even overcome great hardship.  The Atlantic Journal Constitution ran a feature article on Mr. Jayne and his activities, including a report about how he had, with great effort and help from his family and friends, attended a football game to root for the University of Georgia Bulldogs.  A few days later, unbelievably, at the direction of the fiscal intermediary, his home health agency--which had been sending a home health nurse to his home for 2 hours, 4 mornings a week--notified him that he was no longer considered homebound and terminated his benefits. His benefits were subsequently reinstated due to the enormous amount of media attention to this case, but this experience motivated him to launch a crusade to modernize the homebound definition and led him to found the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare Homebound Restriction.  So even out of this terrible experience, once again this inspirational individual who is suffering so greatly from Lou Gehrig's disease has managed to launch a crusade to try to prevent what happened to him from happening to other severely disabled individuals who are dependent on home health care.  The fact is, the current requirement that Medicare beneficiaries be homebound in order to be eligible for home health benefits reflects an outmoded view of life for persons who are elderly or live with disabilities. The legislation I am introducing attempts to correct this problem. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it.  I hope we can make this change, which will make a real difference for millions of disabled and elderly Medicare beneficiaries.  The homebound criteria for home health may have made sense thirty years ago, when an elderly or disabled person might expect to live in the confines of their home, perhaps cared for by an extended family. The current definition, however, fails to reflect the technological and medical advances that have been made in supporting individuals with significant disabilities and mobility challenges. It also fails to reflect advances in treatment for seriously ill individuals--like Mr. Jayne--which allows them brief periods of relative wellness. It also fails to recognize that an individual's mental acuity and physical stamina can only be maintained by use, and that the use of the body and mind is encouraged by social interactions outside the four walls of a home.  The legislation that we are introducing today will amend the homebound definition to base eligibility for the home health benefit on the patient's functional limitations and clinical condition, rather than on an arbitrary limitation on absences from the home. It would retain the requirements in current law that the individual must have either a condition, due to illness or injury, that restricts the ability of the individual to leave his or her home except with the assistance of another individual or the aid of a supportive device; or a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated.  In addition, the condition of the individual must still be such that ``there exists a normal inability to leave home'' and that ``leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort.'' Under our legislation, however, the current arbitrary requirement that patients be allowed ``only infrequent absences of short duration'' from the home would be dropped. Our legislation builds upon major improvements in the definition of homebound that were initiated in the last Congress by Senator Jeffords, Reed and others which specifically allow Medicare patients to leave the home to attend religious services and participate in adult day care.  Our proposal is supported by the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, the National Association for Home Care, and the Visiting Nurses Association of America. It is also consistent with President Bush's ``New Freedom Initiative,'' which has, as its goal, the removal of barriers that impede opportunities for those with disabilities to integrate more fully into the community. By allowing reasonable absences from the home, our legislation will bring the Medicare home health benefit into the 21st century, and we encourage all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.                                 ______                                       By
