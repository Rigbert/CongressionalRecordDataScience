When four or five Republicans join us, it is because many of them are facing a tough reelection.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, today when we brought this measure before the Senate again, incentives for renewable energy, we included in it $8 billion for the highway trust fund, which can be attributed to 400,000 good-paying American jobs. We also included the mental health parity bill, which has been a bipartisan bill that has been sought by this Senate for maybe a decade. It has certainly been a long time. We included as well an extension of the exemption for the alternative minimum tax so middle-income families would not face higher taxes.  I ask the Senator from Nevada what kind of support we had from the Republican side of the aisle. If I am not mistaken, only five Republicans, four of whom are up for reelection in November, joined us in that vote.
