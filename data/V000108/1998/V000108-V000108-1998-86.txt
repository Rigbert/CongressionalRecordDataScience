Speaker, it is my distinct honor to pay tribute to one of Northwest Indiana's leading physicians, Dr. Heratch Doumanian, of Merrillville, Indiana. On Sunday, September 30, 1998, Heratch will be honored by the Asian American Medical Society for his selfless, exemplary service to society, the community, and the medical profession. This Sunday, for his dedicated, consistent community work, Heratch will be awarded the Crystal Globe Award, the Asian American Medical Society's highest service award.  Each year, the Asian American Medical Society honors a prominent, extraordinary resident of Northwest Indiana for their outstanding contributions to the community. In recognition of their tremendous efforts for the betterment of Northwest Indiana, they are honored at a banquet and awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe.  This year's recipient, Dr. Heratch Doumanian, is one of the most caring, dedicated, and selfless citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District. As a physician, Heratch serves as not only a respected member of the medical community, but also as a teacher, a mentor, and a community volunteer. He offers his services and time to many professional organizations including the Radiologic Society of North America, the American Medical Society, the Lake County Medical Society, the Indiana State Medical Society, the American College of Radiology, and the Asian American Medical Society. In addition, Heratch served as the President of St. Mary's Medical staff in 1995, is a present member of the St. Mary's Medical Quality Assurance Committee, and served as the President of the Asian American Medical Society in 1988.  Since 1966, Heratch has served as a Radiologist at both the Diagnostic Outpatient Center, and the St. Mary Medical Center. In addition, he shares his knowledge as a teacher at the Indiana University Northwest Medical School. Before starting his work in 1966, Heratch attended the American University, in Beirut, Lebanon, and in 1957 he graduated from its Medical School. After graduation, Dr. Doumanian came to the United States and completed two Internships in Chicago, Illinois, at the St. Bernard Hospital from 1957-1958, and the Michael Reese Medical Center from 1959-1960. In 1960-1962, Heratch served our country as a Captain in the United States Army Medical Corps. After his military service, he completed a Residency at the University of Chicago Hospital, and he earned a Fellowship from the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. When his Fellowship ended in 1966, he moved to Northwest Indiana and began his successful medical and community work for the people of this region.  While Heratch has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work as a physician, he has always made an extra effort to give to the community. He is currently very involved in the Armenian Assembly of America, and serves the organization as a Fellow Trustee. Additionally, he is a Parish Council Member of the St. Joachim and Anne Armenian Church, and is a member of the Armenian General Benevolent Union, Chicago Chapter. Although his work and community service often limits his time, Heratch has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family. He and his wife, Sonya, have three children: Greta, a lawyer; John, a medical student; and Leo, also a medical student.  The Hippocratic Oath discusses how a doctor or medical professional should conduct his life, public and private. ``. . . I will lead my life and practice my art in uprightness and honour; that into whatsoever house I shall enter, I shall be for the good of the sick to the utmost of my power, holding myself far aloof from wrong, from corruption . . .'' When Heratch moved to Northwest Indiana in 1966, he brought with him a dedication to uprightness and honor that has touched many lives. His dedication to the community and his family, in addition to his commitment to the unfortunate and sick are clear examples of one man working to the utmost of his power and ability. We in Northwest Indiana are lucky to be the recipients of his service.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Heratch Doumanian for receiving the 1998 Crystal Globe Award from the Asian American Medical Society. Truly, Heratch has earned this recognition. His service, dedication, and altruism inspire us all to greater deeds.                          ____________________
