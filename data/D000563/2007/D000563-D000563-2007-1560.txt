The difference is this: I have had a passion for a long time about the fight for global AIDS. I believe we need to appropriate the funds that the President promised and for which I applauded him to fight the global AIDS epidemic.  Every year I try to plus up and increase the amount of money that goes to fight global AIDS. I have been successful. I am proud of it. I think it is something I have done that has made a difference in the world.  That, under the Senator's definition, is an earmark. It is not an earmark as we have traditionally understood it. The money is not going to a private company, individual or private entity. The money is going to a Federal agency.  To add to this earmark reform language, all the money that goes to Federal agencies may give the Senator some satisfaction, but it is just creating voluminous, unnecessary paperwork.  Can we not focus on where the abuses have occurred, where the earmarks have gone to special interest groups, businesses, and individuals? Let's get that right. The rest of it is what an appropriations bill is all about.  Mr. DeMINT. In the interest of continued debate, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.
