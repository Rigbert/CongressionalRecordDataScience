President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan legislation to support and strengthen America's school libraries.  Research shows that well-equipped and well-staffed school libraries are essential to promoting literacy, learning, and achievement. Indeed, recent studies in Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Alaska reveal that a strong library media program, consisting of a well-stocked school library staffed by a trained, school-library media specialist, helps students learn more and score higher on standardized tests than their peers in library-impoverished schools. These findings echo earlier studies conducted in the 1990s, which found that students in schools with well-equipped libraries and professional library specialists performed better on achievement tests for reading comprehension and basic research skills.  Mr. President, with our ever-changing global economy, access to information and the skills to use it are vital to ensuring that young Americans are competitive and informed citizens of the world. That is why the school library is so important in supplementing what is learned in the classroom; promoting better learning, including reading, research, library use, and electronic database skills; and providing the foundation for independent learning that allows students to achieve throughout their educational careers and their lives.  While the promise of a well-equipped school library to promote literacy, learning, and achievement is boundless, and its importance greater than ever, the condition of libraries today does not live up to that potential. As Linda Wood, a school-library media specialist from South Kingstown High School in Rhode Island, noted during a Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing two years ago, school library collections are outdated and sparse.  Many schools across the nation are dependent on books purchased in the mid-1960s with dedicated funding provided under the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. Many of the books still on school library shelves today were purchased with this funding and have not been replaced since 1981, when this dedicated funding was folded into what is now the Title VI block grant. As a result, many books in our school libraries predate the landing of manned spacecraft on the moon, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the end of Apartheid, the Internet, and advances in DNA research.  Mr. President, over the past several months I have received over one hundred books pulled from library shelvesacross the country which further illustrate the sad state of school libraries today. I would like to cite just a few examples.  A book entitled Rockets Into Space, copyright 1959, informs students that ``there is a way to get to the moon and even distant planets, [but the trip must] be made in two stages. The first stage would be from earth to a space station. The second stage would be from the space station to the moon. It would cost a lot of money to buy a ticket to the moon.'' This book was checked out of a Los Angeles school library 13 times since 1995.  Further, a book found on a Rhode Island school library shelf, entitled Studying the Middle East in Elementary and Secondary Schools, copyright 1968, contains the following information: ``UNDERSTANDING SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ARABS--It is difficult to generalize about any group of people and yet there are some characteristics which seem predominant and helpful in understanding the Arabs.'' Needless to say, the book then proceeds to describe characteristics of Arab people in derogatory terms.  And finally, a book entitled Colonial Life in America, copyright 1962, found on a shelf in a Philadelphia school library, informs the student that life on ``a large plantation in the South was like a village. Slave families had their own cabins.'' This book describes southern plantation life as idyllic, without reference to the harshness and injustice of life as a slave.  As you can see, in a rapidly changing world, our students are placed at a major disadvantage if the only scientific, geographical, and historical materials they have access to are outdated and inaccurate. The reason for this sad state of affairs is the loss of targeted, national funding for school libraries.  In sum, school library funding is grossly inadequate to the task of improving and supplementing collections. Library spending per student today is a small fraction of the cost of a new book. Indeed, while the average school library book costs $16, the average spending per student for books is approximately $6.75 in elementary schools; $7.30 in middle schools; and $6.25 in high schools. Consequently, many schools cannot remove outdated books from their shelves because there is no money to replace these books.  My home state of Rhode Island is working on an innovative effort to ensure that students gain access to materials not available in their own school libraries. RILINK, the Rhode Island Library Information Network for Kids, gives students and teachers 24-hour Internet access to a statewide catalog of school library holdings, complete with information about the book's status on the shelf. RILINK also allows for on-line request of materials via interlibrary loan, with rapid delivery through a statewide courier system, and provides links from book information records to related Internet research sites, allowing a single book request to serve as a point of departure for a galaxy of information sources.  Unfortunately, such innovations, which could benefit schoolchildren across the nation, cannot be expanded without adequate library funding. Indeed, the only federal funding that is currently available to school libraries is the Title VI block grant, which allows expenditure for school library and instructional materials as one of nine choices for local uses of funds. Since 1981, states have chosen other needs above school library books and technology. Sadly, districts only spend an estimated 17 percent of funds on school library and instructional materials. This amount is wholly insufficient to replace outdated books in both our classrooms and school libraries, and this lack of targeting and diffusion of funding is why block grants are so harmful.  Mr. President, well-trained school library media specialists are also essential to helping students unlock their potential. These individuals are at the heart of guiding students in their work, providing research training, maintaining and developing collections, and ensuring that a library fulfills its potential. In addition, they have the skills to guide students in the use of the broad variety of advanced technological education resources now available.  Unfortunately, only 68 percent of schools have state-certified library media specialists, according to Department of Education figures, and, on average, there is only one specialist for every 591 students. This shortage means that many school libraries are staffed by volunteers and are open only a few days a week.  I am introducing this bipartisan bill today, along with Senators Cochran, Kennedy, Dodd, Bingaman, Wellstone, Murray, Mikulski, Clinton, Chafee, Rockefeller, Reid, Sarbanes, and Baucus to restore the funding that is critical to improving school libraries. The Improving Literacy Through School Libraries Act authorizes $500 million to help school libraries with the greatest needs update their collections and would ensure that students have access to the informational tools they need to learn and achieve at the highest levels. This bill allows for maximum flexibility, enabling schools to use the funds to update library media resources, such as books and advanced technology, train school-library media specialists, and facilitate resource-sharing among school libraries. The bill also establishes the School Library Access Program to provide students with access to school libraries during non-school hours, including before and after school, weekends, and summers.  Providing access to the most up-to-date school library collections is an essential part of increasing student achievement, improving literacy skills, and helping students become lifelong learners. The bipartisan Improving Literacy Through School Libraries Act is strongly supported by the American Library Association, and will help accomplish these essential goals. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work for its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill and a letter of support written by the American Library Association be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 327       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: I would like to take this opportunity to      thank you and Senator Thad Cochran for your bi-partisan      support of school libraries as you introduce the Improving      Literacy Through School Libraries Act of 2001. This bill      would provide assistance to the nation's school libraries and      school library media specialists at a time when they are      laboring mightily to cope with the challenges of increasing      school enrollment, new technology and the lack of funding for      school library resources.       As an academic librarian in New York, I know personally how      this legislation will contribute to effective learning by our      school children. Many of the nation's school     libraries have collections that are old, inaccurate and out      of date. How can we encourage children to read, continue      their education in college and become life-long learners if      the material we have available for them is inadequate?       Your legislation proposes to upgrade collections, encourage      and train school librarians, and effect greater cooperation      between school professionals directly involved teaching      children--school library media specialists, teachers and      administrators. This critical legislation should be included      in the reauthorization process now going forward in the      Senate. The school children of today deserve the best      resources we have to give them.       On behalf of the 61,000 school, public, academic and      special librarians, library trustees, friends of libraries      and library supporters, I thank you for your effort to      improve the resources in school libraries. We offer the      support of our members in working towards passage of the      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                 Nancy C. Kranich,                                                        President.                                 ______                                       By
