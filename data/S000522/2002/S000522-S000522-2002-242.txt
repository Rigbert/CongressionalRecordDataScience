Mr. Speaker, today, Americans for a Free Cuba gathered on the Senate steps to officially open the Cuban Political Prisoners Initiative display in the Senate Russell Office Building. They will be storming the halls of the US Senate tomorrow, urging Senators not to vote for lifting the travel ban on Cuba.  The Business and Agricultural communities have used their vast resources to make their case for lifting sanctions on Cuba at a summit here in Washington, but we know that their case is based on their own self-interest. They have failed to acknowledge or fully consider that lifting sanctions would empower Castro to cling to power and continue his reign of terror over millions of suffering people.  The members of the Americans for a Free Cuba have heroically made the case for those Cubans who cannot speak for themselves because of Castro's brutal and restrictive regime through their silent vigil and demonstration. This is a regime that prohibits freedom in almost every way possible while punishing and imprisoning all opposition. The compelling stories of Cuban defectors clearly demonstrate that many will do whatever they can to escape the dreadful conditions brought about by their totalitarian ruler. Both the people and political prisoners in Cuba as well as those who cherish freedom are counting on Americans to stand up to Castro and keep the pressure on through the embargo.  Thankfully, President Bush is behind The Americans for a Free Cuba 100 percent. I commend President Bush for the strong and unwavering stance he has taken against the Castro regime. The President has made it clear that the United States will work with Cuba only after Castro takes concrete measures to improve the abysmal human rights situation in his country. I support the President's demand to Castro that he must free political prisoners, legalize political activity, permit free elections, and cease discriminating against Cuban workers before Congress should even begin to consider lifting economic sanctions. Administration officials have vowed a Presidential veto to any version of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill that weakens trade or travel sanctions on Cuba.  The Cuba Political Prisoners Initiative was initially launched in April when over a dozen members of Congress, from both political parties, adopted a dozen political prisoners. These prisoners each have a unique story but all share in a common suffering because of their love of freedom.  While the Cuba Political Prisoners Initiative was launched this Spring, it will not end until every single Cuban political prisoner is free. I am sending out a letter signed by my colleagues who are part of this initiative to Sergio Vielra de Mello, the new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, urging him to follow through on the resolution this commission adopted in April that called on the Cuban government to improve its record on human, civil, and political rights and allow the UN and other representatives to examine human rights conditions in Cuba.  Twenty former political prisoners were amongst those gathered on the Senate steps today.  They are the heroes for freedom that endured the horrors of Castro's Cuba and lived to tell about it. Also in attendance was Maritza Lugo Fernandez a former Cuban political prisoner joining us today who was jailed more than 30 times before she was exiled by the Castro regime. Her husband, Rafael Ibarra Roque, is still a political prisoner in Cuba and is the prisoner I have adopted.  Before going to prison, where he has been since 1994, Mr. Roque's home was raided by Castro's thugs, who seized virtually everything he owned of value including the family car, the stove, a television, and even his pets. He was arrested and charged with ``sabotage,'' but no credible evidence whatsoever exists that he committed this crime. Those close to the case know his real ``crime'' was having the courage and audacity to speak out against the regime and demand the same freedoms Americans--and other freedom loving people hold to be self-evident and a basic foundation for society.  Mr. Roque has been sentenced to twenty years in the wretched Combinado del Este Prison in Havana where political prisoners are subjected to especially brutal treatment. The State Department's 2001 Human Right's report on Cuba speaks of political prisoners suffering beatings, intimidation, and sexual abuse. These abuses are carried out not only by prison officials but also by state security agents posing as prisoners.  Unfortunately Mr. Roque's case is not an exception but rather the norm for human rights activists in Cuba. Hundreds of others whose only crime is their love of freedom languish in Castro's prisons and the Cuban people on a whole have suffered under the terror of his rule for over 40 years.  The Cuba Political Prisoners Initiative display that we have opened in the Senate Rotunda is somber but will serve as an important reminder of the hundreds of innocent Cubans languishing in Castro's prisons for all Senators, Senate staff, and visitors who pass by it each day. I am confident that when the American people and members of Congress hear the true facts about the great human rights abuses occurring in Cuba, and fully consider the great harm Castro seeks to do our nation through working with terrorist states and harboring fugitives of justice, they will agree that keeping sanctions on Cuba is our only option.  The challenge of fighting for human rights in Cuba remains great. However, we must never give up and we must never, ever forget those who are persecuted for carrying the torch of freedom.                          ____________________
