Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the administration, faculty, staff, students and families of Clay High School in Oregon, Ohio. On October 9, 1998, the Clay High School community will rededicate the Clay Memorial Stadium.  In December, 1941, our nation entered the greatest conflict in human history. Young people from all walks of life served in our armed forces. Many soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines came from the Oregon, Ohio, area and served with honor and distinction as we freed the world of Axis terror and facism. Some of these young people never returned. They gave their lives for freedom with the hope that our nation and their community would always cherish the gifts that America offers.  It was in this spirit that the Oregon, Ohio, community dedicated the Clay Memorial Stadium, in 1948, to the young men and women who gave their lives in defense of liberty. This year marks the 50th Anniversary of the stadium. The Clay High School family and the Oregon community at large are now embarking on a renovation project to make the stadium's World War II memorial the focus of the facility. The community also plans to add memorials to those who served in Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf War. The renovated stadium promises to be a renewed memorial to those who have made the supreme sacrifice and a symbol of youth and hope as we enter the 21st Century.  Mr. Speaker, as the Congressional author of legislation to create a national World War II Memorial it gives me much pride to represent the ctiizens of Oregon, Ohio in this great House. They and the nation will never forget the sacrifice of the millions of men and women who gave their lives to freedom in the victory over tyranny that defined world history for the 20th century.  Our community extends warm appreciation to the citizens of Oregon, Ohio as they rededicate the Clay Memorial Stadium.                          ____________________
