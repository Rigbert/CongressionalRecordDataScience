 Senator Nelson has not only been an advocate for the space program for NASA--and he is. As most everybody knows, has been up there. I was traveling with him one time, and I believe we were over Asia, and he was showing me from the plane--we couldn't see as well as he could--the rotation. I was very impressed.  He has been a stalwart in the advancement of the space program. We both worked hand in glove with him.  I do believe this is a pretty good appropriation considering where we are. I am hoping we will get back to regular order since Senator Mikulski and I have advocated for this. We are hoping maybe later today we can vote this bill out with a vote like the House had yesterday.
