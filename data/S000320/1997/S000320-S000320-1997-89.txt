 President, if I could add a few more comments to the remarks made by the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. The Senator from Rhode Island is a distinguished veteran of the Senate. He has been here and has made his presence felt. He chairs a very important committee in the Senate--the Environment and Public Works Committee. I have had the privilege and the pleasure of working with him on a number of issues both on and off this committee. I can tell you, he has been the catalyst for the money for Rhode Island here in the Senate. Let us set the record straight. Thank you.
