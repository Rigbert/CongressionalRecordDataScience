 STEVENS. Ten minutes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I don't think there is a solution to the concern of the Senator from Maine. It appears that if the chairman of the Appropriations Committee would like the time remaining before the 6 o'clock vote--well, I'm open to any suggestion.                      Unanimous Consent Agreement
