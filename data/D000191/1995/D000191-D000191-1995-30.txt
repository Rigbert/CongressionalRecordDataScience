Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, the chairman of the full committee got before us and he gave us some mind-boggling numbers. Let us reduce it to something a little more understandable. There are a few people who did not make it into his scale. There are 2,600 young people in the State of Oregon getting State student grants this year who will not get those grants next year because we are zeroing out that program. That is 2,600 Oregonians.  That is mirrored time and time again around the country. State student incentive grants are gone. They are zeroed out. They can go over and apply for the increased Pell grants. We heard a lot about the increased Pell grants. It is partially true. They are increasing the amount of the grant, but there are an estimated 221,000 students who would be eligible under this year's income guidelines, middle-income kids, who will not be eligible under their new guidelines.  So yes, those lucky few who still get the grants will get a little bit more, but 221,000 middle-income American kids, scholastically qualified to go to college, will not get help with Pell grants next year because of changes they are making in the program. Seven hundred fifty-seven thousand Perkins loan kids are put at risk because of the changes we are making in the program.  I got student loans, many of you got student loans. Let us remember back to those distant days. There are others here who are much more wealthy, they never needed student loans. Try and have a little compassion. Try and understand the plight of the average American family. I know it is hard when you are at $133,600 a year and you live in the cocoon of Washington, DC to understand average American families. But just try. They need this help so their kids can do a little better, like we did.
