 President, in keeping with my policy on public disclosure of holds, today I placed a hold on further action on the Clean Diamond Trade Act, legislation reported out by House of Representatives.  Although this bill is very important to the continent of Africa's efforts to rid itself of rebels that use the sale of rough diamonds to overthrow legitimate governments, the measures in this legislation fall within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.  The proposed legislation calls for prohibiting diamond imports and should be discussed thoroughly before any rash decisions are made. With this in mind it is necessary for this bill to be referred to the Finance Committee to be heard and debated by our members before we send this legislation back to the floor.                          ____________________
