Chairman, I rise to support the intent of the gentlewoman's amendment. I am very glad to hear what the gentlewoman is saying. She is trying to do everything she can to support American-made products and particularly American-made anchor chain. I would be willing to work with the chairman and the gentlewoman as the process goes forward to ensure we purchase American-made products. I just wanted to express that support. I thank the gentleman for his offer.
