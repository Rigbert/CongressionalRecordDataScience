 President, we have been debating education policy for several days and actually several times over the last several months here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am very excited about that, because one of the reasons I came here to the U.S. Senate was to make sure that we focus on real issues that affect everyday average families across our country. There is nothing more important to any parents than making sure, when they send their children off to school in the morning, that they get the kind of education that will mean they will be a success in this country.  I am disappointed, however, that the bill before us, the Coverdell IRA proposal, will not provide that kind of quality education that parents are demanding. I believe it is a flawed policy which really will not make any meaningful difference for either private or public school students and their families. It is not a real results-driven proposal.  Many of my colleagues have been out here on the floor over the last several days talking about what the IRA Coverdell proposal will do and that it will only mean $7 for a family in the future. Many of my colleagues have talked about how it will begin us on a road to publicly funding private schools, and the dangers of that.  We can debate that. But I am here today to bring forward an amendment that I believe will make a substantial difference in our children's education across the country, and that is regarding the issue of class size. Ask any parent who sends his or her child off to school what question they ask when their child comes home on the first day of school. It is, ``How many kids are in your class?'' They ask that because they know it will make a difference in whether or not their child gets the attention and the education he or she needs throughout that entire school year. If there are 40 kids in the classroom, or 35 kids in the classroom, your child will not get the kind of education and attention that he or she needs and deserves in this complex world that we live in today.  My amendment that is before the Senate is a sense of the Congress that we should support efforts to hire 100,000 new teachers so that we can reduce class sizes in first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students per class all across America.  This is simply a sense of the Congress saying this is the way we should move forward. We have been on the floor before to debate this issue, and this Congress has said no, they are not going to fund lower class sizes. I am back today because I believe this is the kind of difference that we can make, that we should make, and that we must make. Reducing class sizes will make a difference for children across the country.  Will 100,000 teachers be enough? No, but it will be an impetus. This amendment simply will send a message that we understand the issue and we are willing to take it under consideration and move it forward.  I know as a former educator what a difference it makes to have a smaller class size. I have taught 4-year-olds. I have had 18 children in my classroom. I have had 24 children in my classroom. It means the difference between having the time to work individually with students or simply having crowd control for the entire classroom.  Every teacher of early grades will tell you the more time they have with their students, the better chance they have to make sure that all students will have the chance to learn to read, to learn to write, to learn the basic skills that will mean that they are a success throughout their later years. It also means that those teachers will have the time to deal with the complex problems that come before them as a teacher in our classrooms.  I distinctly remember one time I had with a class when I had a young student come to class and we were in the process of talking about the alphabet. We were talking about one of the letters. I was talking with my young children about different words that begin with the letter A, and all of a sudden a young child in my classroom just simply blurted out to me, ``My dad didn't come home last night; he was arrested.'' My entire class stopped. How could I have talked about the alphabet? How could I have talked about the words that started with the letter A?  I had a devastated child in my classroom of 24. Yet, I could not take the time to sit with him and work with him because I had 23 other children in my classroom who needed attention and whose parents wanted them to learn about the alphabet.  That child probably went on to a very troubled adulthood. We could have made a difference simply by having fewer students in the classroom, by simply having the time to deal with these kind of problems. Don't just take it from me as a former educator, take it from the studies.  I have submitted a number of studies in the past as I have talked about this issue on this floor. A 1989 study of the Tennessee STAR Program which compared the performance of students in grades K through 3 in small and regular size classes found that students in small classes of 13 to 17 students significantly outperformed other students in math and reading every year at all grade levels across all geographic areas.  My sense of the Congress simply says we understand this is significant. It says we in the Senate want to make a difference in the learning of American children, and we want to move forward on the progress of reducing class size and take that on as an issue in this country.  I have talked about it as an educator. I have talked about the studies many times that prove what I say, but we should also be listening to other people. I know that when we were here a month ago and debating, I submitted a number of letters from different teachers from across my State and across this country, but I want to specifically have printed today a letter, and I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the editor by State Senator Al Bauer be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter to the editor was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Columbian, April 15, 1998]                       Murray Has the Right Idea       The April 5 editorial, ``Patty Murray's teacher plan is      costly mandate,'' criticized the plan by U.S. Sen. Patty      Murray, D-Wash., for the federal government to hire 100,000      new teachers to reduce class sizes nationwide.       The editorial warned that ``unintended consequences can      destroy any attempt at progress,'' noting that a school      district in the Seattle area cut early childhood education      for at-risk youngsters because of its decision to reduce      class sizes.       The criticism makes the best case for Murray's proposal. If      that school district had the additional federally funded      teachers to reduce class sizes in all grades, it would not      have to negatively impact Head Start and at-risk programs.      Matter of fact, the district could also improve those      programs by smaller class sizes.       As for the criticism that 100,000 new teachers would need      that many more new classrooms, teachers are creative enough      to develop curriculum around the needs of children without      additional classrooms.       I visited several classrooms this year where two teachers      shared 46 or more students. With Murray's proposal, a third      teacher could be added to such a team, thereby reducing the      student-teacher ratio from one teacher for 22 students to one      for 15. We are not talking about added classrooms; we are      talking about more teacher time for each student so that      fewer students fall through the cracks.       As for how Murray should pay for the additional teachers,      Congress should pay in the same way the members propose to      pay for a highway budget that is billions of dollars higher      than the balanced-budget agreement.       It sounds like what happened in the State Legislature this      past session. The majority party refused the proposal by us      Democrats to spend $50 million more for class size      reductions, particularly in the early-grades. The majority      also decided to propose to the voters in November to transfer      currently used sources of revenue for education from the      general fund to the highway fund.       The editorial correctly urges school districts to sue the      Legislature for underfunding education from the State level.      In 1977 the Legislature was sued, and the courts ruled that      it was the paramount duty of the Legislature to fully fund      kindergarten through grade-12 education. As a consequence, in      the Vancouver School District school levies dropped. A person      with a $50,000 home or property saved $254 a year.       It is time to get the Legislature to live up to the court's      mandate. Where are our priorities? Children's education lasts      forever; asphalt lasts a few years.       I am glad we have Murray in the U.S. Senate. By speaking      out for our most valuable assets, our children, she is      exerting the leadership on educational matters she      demonstrated while serving in the State Senate.--State Sen.      Al Bauer, Vancouver.
