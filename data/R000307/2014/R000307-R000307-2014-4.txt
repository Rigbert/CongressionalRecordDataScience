President, in a State where cattle outnumber people, the Kansas livestock industry is one of the leading economic and cultural drivers of our State. Across the Midwest, ranchers and their families work hard every day to provide protein for a growing and hungry world, often without the appreciation or recognition they deserve.  I rise today to offer my sincere congratulations and thanks to a trusted leader and friend. Thomas ``Dee'' Likes has served for the last 31 years as the chief executive officer and executive vice president of the Kansas Livestock Association. Under his leadership, the 5,500-member trade association has grown into one of the most influential and respected agricultural organizations in Kansas and across the nation.  Dee Likes has made a distinguished impact on the livestock industry. As the longest tenured State affiliate organization CEO in the history of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, he helped lead the industry through the 1996 merger between the National Cattlemen's Association and the Beef Industry Council of the National Live Stock and Meat Board.  In addition to his service as CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, Dee Likes has been a true partner in government. He has successfully represented the livestock industry in front of Congress and has served two terms as president of the Kansas Agricultural Alliance, a coalition that represents over 20 Kansas agricultural associations before the Kansas Legislature.  I am grateful to Dee for his friendship, his advice, and his counsel over the years. Kansas agriculture has been fortunate to have Dee's commitment and dedication. I hope he and his wife Terry will enjoy their next chapter in life.                          ____________________
