 Tom's tenure as the 26th president of the University of Vermont came during a tumultuous time in higher education. Despite demographic declines and reduced public investments in higher education, Tom made quality, affordable education and investment in scholarship his top priorities.  Tom expanded UVM's course offerings, oversaw 20 building projects, andhelped increase the value of UVM's endowment by 80 percent. When appointed in 2012, Tom was given the responsibility of heading UVM's Move Mountains fundraising campaign with the goal of raising $500 million by 2020. Because of Tom's personality, passion, and, at times, persuasion, the University hit its fundraising goal a year ahead of schedule, a very impressive accomplishment considering the economic hardship that has defined the last decade. The success of this campaign increased scholarships for students, invested in top-tier faculty, and made capital investments to improve the student experience.  While the university has continued to evolve, under Tom's leadership, UVM has managed to stay true to its founding as a Land Grant university. Tom has worked tirelessly during his tenure to expand UVM's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics--STEM--offerings including the 4-year construction of a $104 million STEM Complex. Tom shares the belief that income should not be a barrier to a good education. Because of his dedication to the education of all students, Tom was instrumental in developing UVM's Catamount Commitment, which promises Pell Grant-eligible Vermonters that the reminder of their tuition will be covered, either through grants or waived by the university entirely.  Tom's tenure at UVM tops off a long and distinguished professional experience in the field of academia. Tom taught at the law schools of the University of Missouri, Washington University in St. Louis, MO, and was appointed to be a dean and professor of law at the University of Arizona College of Law. Following his time at the University of Arizona, he began his 17-year tenure at the University of Minnesota, where he eventually was appointed to become its senior vice president and provost.  Calling Tom a prolific academic and legal scholar would be an understatement. He has written 11 books and over 50 articles primarily in the field of antitrust litigation. In addition to his writings, in 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee had the honor and privilege of obtaining Tom's advice and consultation on the confirmation of then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. The lasting impact of Tom's work in the field of legal studies is no small feat and will be felt for generations to come.  It is rare to find Tom's unparalleled selfless dedication to academia and the needs of students across the country as well as throughout the world. Over the course of his 7-year tenure, Marcelle and I have had the pleasure on multiple occasions to enjoy the company of Tom and his wife Leslie. They are wonderful people who care about nothing more than giving the next generation the opportunity to succeed through academics. Tom's charming and caring presence will surely be missed on campus, but we look forward to having Tom and Leslie as Vermont residents for some time. Marcelle and I thank Tom for his service, and we wish him and Leslie all the best in the next chapter of his distinguished career.                          ____________________
