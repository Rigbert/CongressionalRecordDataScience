 President, I wish to recognize and pay tribute to Colonel Randall D. Bookout, Chief, Senate Liaison Division, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison for the U.S. Army, who will retire on January 1, 2000. Colonel Bookout's career spans 27 years during which he has distinguished himself as a soldier, leader and friend of the United States Senate.  An Ohio native, Colonel Bookout graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1972 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Infantry Branch of the U.S. Army. During his career, he has commanded at the platoon through the battalion levels, where he ably trained and led America's soldiers at home and overseas. In Fort Wainwright, Alaska, he commanded the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, ``The Manchus.'' He has also served in command and staff positions at Fort Carson, Colorado, the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, the Pentagon and overseas in Panama and Korea. Prior to assuming his current duties, he served as the Aide de Camp to the Secretary of the Army.  Since January 1996, Randy Bookout has served with distinction as the Chief of the Army's Senate Liaison Office where he has superbly represented the Chief of Legislative Liaison, the Chief of Staff, Army and the Secretary of the Army, as well as promoting the interests of the soldiers and civilians of the Army. His professionalism, mature judgment, sage advice and inter-personal skills have earned him the respect and confidence of the Members of Congress and Congressional staffers with whom he has worked on a multitude of issues. In over four years on the Hill, Randy Bookout has been a true friend of the U.S. Congress. Serving as the Army's primary point of contact for all Senators, their staffs and Congressional Committees, he has assisted Congress in understanding Army policies, actions, operations and requirements. As a result, he and his staff have been extremely effective in providing prompt, coordinated and factual replies to all inquiries and matters involving Army issues. In addition, hehas provided invaluable assistance to Members and their staffs while planning, coordinating and accompanying Senate delegations traveling worldwide to over sixty countries. His substantive knowledge of the key issues, keen legislative insight, and ability to effectively advise senior members of the Army leadership directly contributed to the successful representation of the Army's interests before Congress.  Throughout his career, Colonel Randy Bookout has demonstrated his profound commitment to our Nation, his selfless service to the Army, a deep concern for soldiers and their families, and a commitment to excellence. Colonel Bookout is a consummate professional whose performance, in over 27 years of service, has personified those traits of courage, competency and integrity that our Nation has come to expect from its professional Army officers.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Colonel Bookout for his honorable service to the U.S. Army and the people of the United States. We wish him and his family Godspeed and all the best in the future.                          ____________________
