 President, that sounds completely irresponsible to me, to send a false promise by some kind of sham vote that you are supporting veterans or Community Development Block Grant Programs or all the other programs that we hear from the other side. I heard the Senator from Pennsylvania say this will just tell the Appropriations Committee that this Senate says you are to spend that money.  I am the ranking member on the Transportation-HUD subcommittee. We are already looking at a transit cut of $100 million, an Amtrak cut, which I know the Senator from Pennsylvania cares about, a cut of $394 million, and the FAA is cut by $561 million, a safety factor.  I say to my colleague from North Dakota, I am completely worried about the irresponsible message that these amendments are sending and the sham that they are. I heard last night when I offered my amendment, the chairman of the Budget Committee said we were raising taxes to pay for our amendments on this side.  I want to ask this of the ranking member on the Budget Committee. My amendment I am offering today is to restore Community Development Block Grant Programs at a real, significant number.
