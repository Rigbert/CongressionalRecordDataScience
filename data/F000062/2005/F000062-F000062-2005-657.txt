 President, I support the nomination of Governor Michael O. Leavitt to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.  Governor Leavitt has had a lengthy career in public service, having served most recently as the 10th Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  In 1992, Leavitt was elected the 14th Governor of Utah and was that State's longest-serving Governor.  During his three terms as Utah's Governor, he was chosen by the Nation's Governors to represent States in working with Congress on welfare reform, Medicaid and children's health insurance. He chaired the National Governors Association, the Western Governors Association, the Republican Governors Association and Council of State Governments.  Governor Leavitt established an innovative welfare reform waiver program focused on increasing family income using an approach that emphasized employment and child support, but also addressed initial problems with families in need such as domestic violence, education, training, language barriers, and substance abuse issues to promote sustainable employment.  This year, the HHS Secretary will have the critical task of overseeing the implementation of the first ever drug benefit in Medicare as well as the implementation of several program reauthorizations such as Ryan White, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, all within an ever-constrained budgetary picture.  As someone who voted for the Medicare Modernization Act, it is my hope that Governor Leavitt will work with me to address some of the weaknesses of the bill in addition to ensuring that the more than 41 million Medicare beneficiaries know about this new benefit in Medicare and its low-income subsidies.  Of greatest concern to me is the cost of prescription drugs. In voting for the Medicare bill, I said on the Senate floor that one of the greatest weaknesses of the bill was that it not only did not do enough to control the rising cost of prescription drugs but it specifically prohibited the HHS from using the bulk purchasing power of the Federal Government to negotiate with prescription drug plans to lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. I believe this prohibition should be stricken and that there should be a role for the HHS Secretary in what Medicare and beneficiaries pay for their drugs.  I am committed to working with the HHS Secretary to find real solutions for lowering drug costs for our Nation's seniors.  As the Medicare drug benefit is enacted, I am also hopeful that Governor Leavitt will work to ensure access to all needed medications for people living with HIV and AIDS, to allow for adequate transition time for the most vulnerable low-income seniors and to provide sufficient incentives and transparency for employers to retain their retirees' health care coverage.  Governor Leavitt will oversee the Department of Health and Human Services at a time of rising deficits and this will require tough decisions. But these decisions must be balanced with the needs of the millions of Americans, young and old, who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP to provide their health care insurance.  Medicaid provides insurance to 40 million Americans, about 8 million of whom live in California. It covers 55 percent of all poor children and it pays for the births of one-third of all American children. It serves 50 percent of all people with AIDS and as many as 90 percent of children with AIDS.  Medicaid is the insurer of last resort. If Medicaid did not exist, these individuals and families would be uninsured.  But it is also the biggest budget items in many States. There is no question we can improve the efficiency and quality of Medicaid to ensure our dollars are being well-spent but we also cannot lose site of the fact that increases in spending per enrollee from 2000 until 2003 were slower than increases in private insurance spending.  There are 45 million Americans without health insurance today. Arbitrary limits on Federal Medicaid spending will only increase the number of uninsured, driving up overall health care costs and burdening our nation's already overcrowded emergency rooms.  There is a great deal of work to be done, and I look forward to a productive working relationship with Governor Leavitt.                          ____________________
