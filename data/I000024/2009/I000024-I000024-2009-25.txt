President, during the course of the day today--and I feel I can do this since it is my birthday--I had five different subjects I wish to cover. I will make one comment about the talk just given--the eloquent speech just given by the Senator from South Dakota.  I think the thing that surprises most people is, we will have meetings and people will say: Wait a minute, you don't even know what is in the Senate bill being written up behind closed doors. The comments we are making--most of them--refer to the bill passed in the House. The reason for that is, that is the only thing we have to talk about.  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized until such time as we move on, and I understand that is 11:20.
