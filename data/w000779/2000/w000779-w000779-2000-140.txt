President, I will be brief this afternoon. I note Senator Hollings is here and also Senator Grams.  I come to the floor because last fall I indicated that I would come to the floor of the Senate again and again until this body passed bipartisan legislation to make sure the Nation's older people secure prescription drug coverage under Medicare. We have had some very exciting developments on this issue in recent days. I think all the work that has been put in by so many parties is beginning to pay off.  I think the reason there is such intense interest in this issue is that while Medicare provides important health insurance coverage for older people, its coverage still today has many gaps. In particular, it doesn't cover prescription medicine.  There is not anyone I know today--Democrat or Republican--who would argue that if we are going to redesign Medicare now, we would leave prescription drugs out. Quite the contrary. Virtually everyone who has studied this issue believes prescription drug coverage is absolutely critical because today's medicines are key to keeping older people well. The drugs of the future are going to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol.  I cited on the floor of the Senate the important anticoagulant medicines. If you spend perhaps $1,000 or $1,500 in a year, you can prevent stroke. If an older person suffers a stroke as a result of not having access to those medicines, they could incur expenses of $100,000 or more. So the need is intense.  This is an issue that must be addressed in a bipartisan way. For many months now, there has been a bipartisan effort in the Senate. Senator Snowe and I have teamed up on legislation which we believe, using marketplace principles, addresses many of the concerns Senators on both sides of the aisle have had. It doesn't contain price controls or a sort of one-size-fits-all approach.  We would allow for a tobacco tax to finance the program. We don't require one. We say that it would be possible to finance the program using the general fund. But 54 Members of the Senate, a majority of the Senate, voted for the Snowe-Wyden funding plan for prescription drug coverage for older people. We now have a majority of the Senate in a recorded vote saying they would be willing to pay the dollars needed for a good prescription drug benefit for older people.  Our approach in the Snowe-Wyden legislation focuses on making these drugs accessible and affordable. Right now Medicare, of course, doesn't cover prescriptions. But just as importantly, older people, when they can afford their medicine, and go to a drugstore are, in effect, having to subsidize the big buyers--the HMOs and the health plans that can negotiate discounts.  In effect, the older people are getting shellacked twice when it comes to this issue of prescription drugs. They get no coverage. They have to subsidize the benefits, in effect, of those who have real bargaining power--those who are on the health plans.  I would like to wrap up with a couple of minutes on an issue that I know is important to South Carolina and in Minnesota, as well as my home State of Oregon. That is the plight of rural older people. There has been some discussion of this prescription drug issue, of course, on the floor of the Senate, but never before has there been a focus on the special needs of older people in rural communities.  In my State--and I know in the States of Senator Hollings and Senator Grams as well--if you live in a rural community, you have fewer physicians available to write medications. You have fewer pharmacies so that medication is not accessible. You have to drive longer distances in order to get your medicine.  We found, according to the Oregon Health Sciences University's Office of Rural Health, that a conservative number of seniors in rural Oregon who live in poverty is 16,500. I can tell you, having gone through many of those rural communities during the break, that there is a special need for coverage for prescription drugs for older people in rural communities.  I will wrap up by reading a few of the accounts older people from rural Oregon have sent me about the problems they are having in affording their medicine. An elderly couple, for example, in Baker City depending solely on Social Security takes prescription drugs for chronic back ailments. After they purchase their monthly medication, they have only $200 for that month left over to pay for their necessities.  They wrote me, and I am going to quote: ``. . .  that is not living, that is existing.''  I think all of us know you cannot live on $200 a month. Yet that is what an older couple in Baker City, OR, are faced with after they finish paying for their prescription medicine.  In Clatsop County, after an older couple paid for their supplemental coverage, they had to spent $450 a month on their prescription medicine. They fear their supplemental insurance premium is going to go up again this year. That is always the case. They are then going to have to stop taking their medication altogether.  In Coos County, a 75-year-old female resident is getting by on a fixed income of about $800 a month. Every single month she is spending more than 25 percent of her monthly income on prescription medicine.  One older woman in that county lives on Social Security and doesn't have any prescription drug coverage at all. She is now at the point where she cannot afford spending the necessary $200 a month for her medications.  Before I came to Congress, I tried to specialize in the gerontology field. As sure as night follows day, when we have a vulnerable older woman who cannot, in a cold Oregon winter, afford to take her medications, she is going to get much sicker. Very often she will end up in the hospital needing extensive medical services that are available under what is called Part A of the Medicare program, the institutional program.  We ask: Can we afford to cover prescription drug medicine? That example I just gave of the older woman in Coos County makes it very clear this country cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs for older people under Medicare. If older folks do not get these medications, they are going to get sick and the medical bills will be far higher.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record many other cases from rural Oregon.  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Rural Case Studies       A 75-year-old hearing impaired woman from Coquille living      on Social Security does not have any prescription drug      coverage. She cannot afford spending the necessary $200 a      month for her medications.       Deschutes County: An 83-year-old woman from Sisters and her      79-year-old husband are currently taking 12 prescription      drugs to treat diabetes, osteoarthritis and hypertension.      Their sole source of income is Social Security, and they      incur a cost of $400 a month for these medications, which      represents 25% of their income.       Lincoln County: An 81-year-old widow from Toledo currently      takes eight prescription drugs daily for glaucoma, angina and      high blood pressure. Social Security is her only income, and      her Medicare supplemental insurance policy does not cover the      medication. If she doesn't use her eye drops she will go      blind, and if she cuts down the dosage on her other      medication, due to expense, she is in danger of having a      stroke or a heart attack.       Linn County: A 78-year-old woman living in Lebanon suffers      from hypertension. She is presently taking six prescription      drugs: Atenolol, Ziac, Zestril, Cimetidine, Quinidine and      Xanax. She spends an average of $236.92 a month on these      drugs. This figure does not count her considerable expense on      over-the-counter medication and vitamins.       A retired couple from Lebanon live on a combined Social      Security income of $990 a month. They suffer from arthritis,      high blood pressure and osteoporosis. Because of the      increasing financial strain, they can no longer afford their      medications.       Umatilla County: An elderly couple from Pendleton lives on      a combined fixed income of $1,269 a month from Social      Security and relies solely on Medicare for their health      insurance. The 76-year-old husband has Parkinson's disease      and glaucoma, while his 73-year-old wife, who suffers from      heart problems, has skipped her medication at times when she      couldn't afford it. Without any drug coverage, they      collectively spend $800 a month--63% of their income--on      their 14 prescriptions.       A 74-year-old man who takes six prescription drugs a month      cannot survive on his Social Security and Medicare benefits.      His niece must help him pay the $500 month for his      prescriptions.       A retired teacher from Pendleton is taking eight      medications for chronic back pain. She spends $200 a month on      her prescription drugs.       Wasco County: An elderly couple from The Dalles depends on      their combined monthly Social Security income of $1,263 and      profits from the sale of their family farm to survive. Even      though they have supplemental insurance, health care costs      are still high. In addition to considerable medical expenses      for eyeglasses, hearing aids and other health care needs,      they spend over $250 a month on prescription drugs to treat      asthma and high blood pressure.
