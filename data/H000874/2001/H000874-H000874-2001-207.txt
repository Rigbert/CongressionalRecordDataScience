Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 802. This important piece of legislation will authorize our President to award the Medal of Valor to an outstanding public safety officer who has demonstrated valor above and beyond the call of duty. The Medal of Valor, which would be awarded to an outstanding firefighter, law enforcement official or emergency service provider, will shed a positive spotlight on professionals who risk their lives so that we can have a civil and safe society. Their achievements also are a reminder of the many ways in which public safety professionals are making our communities safer and better places to live every day.  Mr. Speaker, each day the brave men and women in the areas of public safety serve every neighborhood, city, and state without looking for any recognition or awards, Although serving the public can be a thankless existence at times, I believe the time is long overdue to recognize and celebrate the achievements of our public safety officers. As the Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus and an active member of the Law Enforcement Caucus, I have the privilege of working with these modern-day heroes and heroines on issues that will ultimately assist them in making each and everyone of our communities a better place to live.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to send a strong message to our public safety officers by supporting this legislation.
