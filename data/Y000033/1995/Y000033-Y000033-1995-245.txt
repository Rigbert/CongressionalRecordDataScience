Mr. Chairman, I understand and appreciate the interest of the gentleman from Washington in this issue of importance to his district.  May I say the gentleman has talked to me about this. He has done an excellent job in the past and into the future representing his district concerning this issue.  We have discussed it. We will be discussing it in conference. The gentleman will be working very closely with me in the conference, and I hope we will be able to address his concerns as well as the State of Washington, especially with the State of Alaska working in conjunction.
