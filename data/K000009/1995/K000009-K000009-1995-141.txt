Speaker, just hot off the press, America ran another budget-busting $11.4 billion trade deficit for the month of May, continuing the recordbreaking hemorrhage for 1995 for our country. For the first 5 months of this year, we recorded a trade deficit with the world of over $52 billion, an increase of 30 percent over the same period last year, more lost wages for this country, more lost wealth. What is the administration, the leadership of this House, and every other ``blind trader'' around Washington doing about this bleeding of America's wealth?  While we chalked up a deficit of $2.8 billion with China just in May and a projected $32 billion deficit with them for this year, the administration is pushing for extension of most-favored-nation for China. With Mexico, after all the promises of increased exports to Mexico, our country is projected to run a $20 billion trade deficit with them this year. American workers can no longer afford to sustain these kinds of trade losses. Let us bring that wealth back to America.                          ____________________
