Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's comments, and I think he is absolutely right in the first half, and absolutely wrong in the second half.  I would disagree with my colleague's comments that Democrats have not had an opportunity to contribute to the process. We have in the past. We worked in a bipartisan way.  It is, however, not true that this year everything is different. Something was different, but not what I believe the ranking member said. That is that we did include a large number of Republican provisions, certainly in committee by the amendment process, and on the floor.
