Casimir I. Lenard AUS (Ret.) who passed from this life on December 7, 2007. At exactly the same moment, the Polish-American Congress was holding a recognition ceremony during which he was awarded with the first-ever Polish-American Congress Medal of Freedom.  Casimir Lenard was born in Chicago, Illinois on March 10, 1918. Even though Chicago had an ever-expanding Polish population, at the age of 10 he journeyed to Poland, a country who regained its independence after more then a century of being ruled by its neighbors. He studied at the Jesuit Gimnazjum in Chyrow, Poland. Upon completion, he returned to the United States to attend Northwestern University where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Economic History.  In receipt of his degrees, he learned of the German-Nazi's invasion of Poland. Upon hearing this news, he immediately joined the Chicago Black Horse Troop, 106th Cavalry, Illinois National Guard. This commenced a meritorious and distinguished military career. When the United States was drawn into the conflict in Europe, in 1941, he became part of the first U.S. Army to go overseas as a commissioned 2nd Lieutenant, assigned to the 1st U.S. Infantry Division. As a member of the 1st Reconnaissance Troop, Lenard was engaged in overseas combat duty from 1942 to 1945. He participated in major operations in the European Theatre including the D-Day invasion. He also served as press and radio censor with the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces.  In 1945, he returned to the United States where he married Casimira (Myra) Lamot. He worked in the family restaurant business, known as ``Lenard's Little Poland'' in Chicago and ``Lenard's Casino'' Summer Resort in Beverly Shores, Indiana. However, when the United States engaged in the Korean War, he volunteered for active duty, serving from August 1951 to 1957, under special assignment with the Headquarters Berlin Command and later in Chicago.  In 1962, he was selected for a 5-year tour of active duty with the General Staff at the Pentagon, where he became Chief of the Army Intelligence Reserve Office. And as the United States engaged in another military conflict in Vietnam, he again heeded the call to service in 1967. After his tour, he was a military intelligence research analyst at the U.S. Army Institute of Land Combat. In 1970, Col. Lenard retired after 30 years of distinguished military service.  Col. Lenard gained numerous recognitions and awards during his extensive military career including: the Silver Star Medal with Cluster, the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' for Valor, the French Croix de Guerre with Palm, seven overseas campaign ribbons (Algeria-French Morocco, Tunisia, Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, Ardennes-Alsace and Rhineland) and numerous other, citations, the last being the Normandy Medal of the Jubilee of Liberty.  Upon retirement from the military, he became the first executive director of the Polish-American Congress, Washington D.C. Office. After leaving that office in 1974, he became Project Manager of the U.S. Bicentennial Ethnic Racial Council. He organized nationwide conferences and coordinated local and national U.S. Bicentennial activities, providing many opportunities for Polonia participation.  Together, with his wife Myra, Col. Lenard worked on many initiatives to support Polish independence, as the country once again suffered under the pervasive influence of its Soviet neighbor. He administered millions of dollars in grants at The National Endowment for Democracy through the Polish American Congress Charitable Foundation to support the budding Polish underground: Solidarity. He helped provide to Citizens' Committees with urgently needed technical resources and finances. Col. and Mrs. Lenard lead the march toward supporting Poland's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Col. Lenard served on the Board of Directors of the American Red Cross. Moreover, Col. Lenard was well-known for his advocacy of close relations between Poles and Jews, the two groups that suffered the most under German-Nazi rule.  For his work with the Polish-American Community, the Polish-American Congress and the embitterment of Poland's position in the world, Colonel Lenard and his wife Myra, either jointly or as individuals, received many awards. These included the following: the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland with Star, Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, Polish Cavalry saber with inscription ``For Your Freedom and Ours From The Grateful Nation of Poland,'' the Polish-National Alliance's ``Gold Cross Legion of Honor,'' the Polish Apostolate ``Pride of Polish American Community Award, the Founders Award and the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.  Myra Lenard passed from this life on May 1, 2000, later to be joined with her husband. They are survived by their three children: George, Antoinette and Elizabeth as well as their grandson Jeffrey Lenard.  The Polish-American Congress Medal of Freedom was awarded to Col. Lenard on December 7, 2007. Since he was unable to obtain his award and the gratitude of Polish-Americans in person, it is a fitting to conclude this record of a remarkable man with the acceptance speech he wrote, but could not make upon receipt of this honor:       Merry Christmas to all of my dear friends.       This is the first time in many years that I will not be      able to share with you the wonderful holiday celebration we      all look forward to that is sponsored by the Washington      office of the Polish-American Congress.       Nonetheless, I am with you in spirit. I cherish the      memories of our long association together, our common      struggles in favor of a free and democratic Poland and in      favor of Polish-American culture and the values that we all      share.''                          ____________________
