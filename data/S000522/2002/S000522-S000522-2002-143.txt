Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 314) recognizing the members of AMVETS for their service to the Nation and supporting the goals of AMVETS National Charter Day.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 314       Whereas on July 23, 1947, AMVETS (American Veterans of      World War II, Korea, and Vietnam) was chartered by the United      States as a not-for-profit corporation;       Whereas membership in AMVETS is open to veterans who have      honorably served, or are serving, in the Armed Forces,      including the Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves,      during or since World War II;       Whereas the veterans of the Armed Forces have made great      sacrifices to ensure the peace and security of the United      States;       Whereas the members of AMVETS are dedicated to providing      important services to their local communities and to their      fellow veterans;       Whereas the motto of AMVETS is ``We fought together, now      let's build together'';       Whereas the members of AMVETS consistently honor that motto      through countless hours of patriotic service, including      providing services to hospitalized veterans, assisting      veterans with their problems regarding housing and      employment, marching in parades, participating in color      guards and burial details, and educating the Nation's youth;       Whereas the war on terrorism has emphasized the sacrifices      that veterans have made, and continue to make, for the      benefit of the Nation;       Whereas AMVETS has designated July 23 as AMVETS National      Charter Day; and       Whereas the goal of AMVETS National Charter Day is to raise      public awareness regarding AMVETS's commitment and service to      veterans, the families of veterans, and the Nation: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress recognizes the members of AMVETS      (American Veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam) for      their service to the Nation and supports the goal of AMVETS      National Charter Day.
