Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 494) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States has enjoyed the loyalty of the United States citizens of Guam, and that the United States recognizes the centennial anniversary of the Spanish-American war as an opportune time for Congress to reaffirm its commitment to increase self-government, consistent with self-determination, for the people of Guam.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 494       Whereas the Chamorro people have inhabited Guam and the      Mariana Islands for at least 4,000 years and developed a      unique and autonomous seafaring agrarian culture, governing      themselves through their own form of district government;       Whereas in 1565 the Kingdom of Spain claimed the islands of      the Chamorro people, which were named the Ladrones by      Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 and renamed the Marianas by the      Jesuit missionary Diego Luis de San Vitores in 1668, to      secure the trans-Pacific route of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon      Trade, then, upon San Vitores's death in 1672, the islands      were placed under military governance;       Whereas in 1898 the United States defeated the Kingdom of      Spain in the Spanish-American War and acquired Guam, Puerto      Rico, and the Philippines by virtue of the Treaty of Paris;       Whereas, in signing the treaty, the United States      Government accepted responsibility for its new possessions      and agreed that Congress would determine the civil rights and      political status of the native inhabitants, as stated      specifically in Article IX;       Whereas President William McKinley, by Executive Order 108-     A on December 23, 1898, placed the island of Guam under the      administration of the United States Navy, which administered      and governed the island, initially as a coaling station, then      as a major supply depot at the end of World War II;       Whereas a series of rulings popularly known as the      ``Insular Cases'', issued by the United States Supreme Court      from 1901 to 1922, defined Guam as an ``unincorporated      territory'' in which the United States Constitution was not      fully applicable;       Whereas the United States Naval Government of Guam was      forced to surrender the island of Guam to the invading forces      of the Japanese Imperial Army on December 10, 1941, after      which Japanese occupation and control of Guam lasted until      the United States Forces recaptured the island in 1944;       Whereas Guam is the only remaining United States territory      to have been occupied by Japanese forces during World War II,      the occupation lasting for 32 months from 1941 to 1944;       Whereas the people of Guam remained loyal to the United      States throughout the Japanese occupation, risked torture and      death to help clothe and feed American soldiers hiding from      enemy forces, and were subjected to forced labor, ruthless      executions, and other brutalities for their support of the      United States;       Whereas, upon liberation of the people of Guam, the island      was returned to United States Navy governance, which, like      its prewar predecessor, limited the civil and political      rights of the people, despite numerous appeals and petitions      to higher authorities and Congress for the granting of United      States citizenship and relief from military rule;       Whereas in 1945, upon establishment of the United Nations,      the United States voluntarily listed Guam as a nonself-     governing territory, pursuant to Article 73 of the United      Nations Charter, and today Guam continues to be included in      this list;       Whereas on March 6, 1949, the House of Assembly, the lower      house of the popularly elected 9th Guam Congress, which was      merely an advisory body to the Naval Governor of Guam,      adjourned in protest over the limitation of its legislative      rights granted to it by the United States Department of the      Navy in 1947 and refused to reconvene until the United States      Congress enacted an organic act for Guam;       Whereas the Organic Act of Guam (64 Stat. 384) passed by      Congress and signed by President Truman on August 1, 1950,      statutorily decreed Guam's status as an ``unincorporated      territory'', established a three-branched civilian government      patterned after the Federal model, and conferred United      States citizenship upon the people of Guam;       Whereas, since the granting of American citizenship, the      people of Guam have greater participation in the American      democratic processes and some measure of self-government;       Whereas the people of Guam, who strongly adhere to the      belief that a government should derive power and right from      the governed, successfully gathered enough support to push      for the passage of the Elective Governor Act (Public Law 90-     497) on September 11, 1968, and in which Congress granted the      people of Guam the right to elect their own governor and      lieutenant governor;       Whereas the Congress enacted the Guam-Virgin Islands      Delegate bill on April 10, 1972, allowing for Guam to have a      nonvoting delegate in the United States House of      Representatives, and although the delegate is not accorded a      vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, it is      still one of the benchmarks in Guam's political evolution and      heightens Guam's visibility in the national arena;       Whereas, although Congress authorized in Public Law 94-584,      the formation of a locally drafted constitution, the      subsequent Guam Constitution, it was not ratified by Guam's      electorate through a referendum on August 4, 1979;       Whereas concerns regarding Guam's political status led the      Twelfth Guam Legislature to create the first political status      commission in 1973, known as the Status Commission, the      Thirteenth Guam Legislature in 1975 created another      commission, known as the Second Political Status Commission,      to address Guam's political status issue and explore      alternative status options, and in 1980, the existing Guam      Commission on Self-Determination (CSD) was created to      identify and pursue the status choice of the people of Guam,      and in 1996 the Twenty-Fourth Guam Legislature created the      Commission on Decolonization to continue pursuing Guam's      political status;       Whereas the CSD, after conducting studies on 5 Guam      political status options, proceeded to conduct a public      education campaign, which was followed by a status referendum      on January 12, 1982 in which 49 percent of the people of Guam      voted for Commonwealth, 26 percent for Statehood, 10 percent      for Status Quo, 5 percent for Incorporated Status, 4 percent      for Free Association, 4 percent Independence, and 2 percent      for other options;       Whereas on September 4, 1982, a runoff was held between      commonwealth and statehood, the top options from the January      referendum, with the outcome of the runoff resulting in 27      percent voting for statehood and 73 percent of Guam's      electorate casting their votes in favor of a close      relationship with the United States through a Commonwealth of      Guam structure for local self-government;       Whereas in 1988 the people of Guam first presented the Guam      Commonwealth Act to Congress to meet the various aspirations      of the people of Guam, which bill has been reintroduced by      Guam's Congressional delegates since 1988 until the present;       Whereas Congress has continued to enact other measures to      address the various aspirations of the people of Guam, while      considering legislative approaches to advance self-government      without precluding Guam's further right of self-     determination, consistent with the national political climate      that emphasizes decentralization of the decision making      process from Washington to the local governments and a      relationship with the Federal Government that is based on      mutual respect and consent of the governed; and       Whereas the people of Guam are loyal citizens of the United      States and have repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to      the American ideals of democracy and civil rights, as well as      to American leadership in times of peace as well as war,      prosperity as well as want: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes 100 years of Guam's loyalty and service to      the United States; and       (2) will use the centennial anniversary of the 1898      Spanish-American War to reaffirm its commitment to the United      States citizens of Guam for increased self-government,      consistent with self-determination for the people of Guam.
