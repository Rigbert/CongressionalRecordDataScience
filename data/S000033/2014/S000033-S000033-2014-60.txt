  Let me wrap it up by making the point that Acting Secretary Gibson made this morning which was a very simple but important one. What he said is we must address the immediate crisis of ending these outrageously long waiting periods that veterans are now experiencing in order to get into the VA. Right now--and I am proud of what he is doing--they are moving very aggressively to get veterans all over this country into private health care when necessary and any other form of health care, to make sure those waiting periods go down. I think they are doing a pretty good job. They have to continue to do that, but we should be mindful that this is going to be a very expensive process.  The other point he made, which is equally important, is that long term, if the goal is to end these unacceptable waiting periods, we have to give the VA the staffing and the space and the facilities and the infrastructure they need.  He came forward with what I recognize is a very big pricetag. His pricetag was $17.6 billion, so we can get the 10,000 more staff we need, the doctors, the psychiatrists, the primary health care physicians, the mental health counselors we need, get the space we need, because in many facilities around the country the staff can't operate because they don't have adequate space.  So what I would say to my colleagues, if we are serious about addressing this very important problem, we will go forward in two ways. No. 1, immediate crisis, let's end those waiting lists. Let's contract out when necessary to private physicians.  Long term, it is absolutely imperative that the VA have the infrastructure it needs so we don't have this crisis again 2 years from today.  The last point, I reiterate. If we send people off to war--if we make that enormously difficult, painful decision--I hope every Member in this body understands that taking care of veterans is a cost of that war and that we have a moral responsibility to do everything we can with them and for them and their families.  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a memorandum submitted by Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson at our committee hearing earlier today.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2014.                    Memorandum for Chairman Sanders     From: Sloan D. Gibson, Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs.     Regarding: Testimony at July 16, 2014 Senate Committee on          Veterans' Affairs Hearing.       Per your request, attached for your information is a      summary of additional resource needs through FY2017 that I      outlined in my testimony today before the Senate Committee on      Veterans' Affairs.       In developing the resource requirements, the overarching      goals were to:       Support the work of the Senate-House conference committee      to improve Veterans' access to medical care and services.       Ensure that VA has the resources necessary to deliver      timely, high quality care and benefits to Veterans enrolled      in the VA system.       Schedule all Veteran appointments within standards of      acceptable care.       Enhance and reform infrastructure that enables VA medical      care (i.e. facilities construction/IT improvements) to      modernize VA's operations and provide access to care when and      where Veterans want it.       Further, the resource requirements were shaped by      principles that the Administration believes should be key to      any discussion of VA resource needs. These principles      include:       Leverage contract care where necessary, but focus efforts      on incentivizing improvements in the VA system itself--     Consider referrals to non-VA care to address burgeoning      workload as a temporary stop-gap to immediately address the      current problem, but concurrently look to strengthen the VA      system by including incentives and resources for VA to      deliver care in-house.       Require cost-effective, coordinated care--Make efficient      use of taxpayer dollars by ensuring quality care is delivered      in a cost-effective way. Require VA to actively coordinate a      Veteran's care across all care environments.       Modernize VA infrastructure and processes--Ensure that VA      facilities and IT infrastructure are modernized and equipped      to meet increasing demand for services; reform VA IT delivery      and procurement to make it more effective in delivering      services to Veterans.       Support VA system without undercutting other national      priorities--Given that VA is required to provide quality care      to Veterans--and faces serious resources needs not      contemplated when budget caps were negotiated--funding to      support the ramp-up of VA medical care contemplated below      must be provided outside of current base discretionary      resources.
