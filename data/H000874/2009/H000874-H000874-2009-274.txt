 Maybe one of the answers is we have less enthusiasm on this side of the aisle for interposing in cases that the court is considering. I was called back on a Sunday by your side of the aisle many years ago to do exactly that. It ended up having no effect.  There are a lot of people on my side of the aisle who believe that the objective that is being sought, which the President of the United States and, to this extent, General Odierno agrees with the Commander in Chief that these photos ought not to be released, as I pointed out to you in the paragraph that I read from the President's letter. In fact, the court has stayed the release of those pending a review by the Supreme Court of the United States. This matter is under consideration. There was general concern about obviating FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act, generally as opposed to specifically. But the President has made it very clear, the Commander in Chief, and obviously General Odierno agrees with the Commander in Chief on this issue, that he is going to take such steps as are necessary to ensure that these photos are not released, to the extent that he and General Odierno both agree that the release of those pictures may, in fact, have an adverse effect on the safety of our troops. So what I simply respond to the gentleman is that the President of the United States and General Odierno are both in a agreement and the President of the United States is taking action to effect that agreement.                              {time}  1230
