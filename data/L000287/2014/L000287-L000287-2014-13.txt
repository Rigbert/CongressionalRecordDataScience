Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity's centennial anniversary. My good friend, the Gentlewoman from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) and the Gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), is sponsoring the Senate companion to this resolution.  As a Sigma brother, I am proud that this fraternity has grown into a worldwide institution.One hundred years ago, A. Langston Taylor, Leonard F. Morse, and Charles I. Brown founded the fraternity at Howard University. These men were committed to the idea of ``Culture For Service and Service for Humanity.'' They believed that all potential members ought to be judged by their own merits. Family background, wealth, race, and nationality are irrelevant to a prospective brother's worth; instead, the fraternity built a brotherhood of individuals who shared a deep commitment to service, education, and brotherhood.  Today, Phi Beta Sigma continues to build upon its founding principles and expand its legacy across the country and around the globe. With more than 150,000 college-educated Sigma brothers and 650 chapters, the fraternity organizes many service projects and missions. These include: Sigma Beta Club, equipping youths with leadership skills; Project Vote, which encourages voter registration; Sigma Wellness: Living Well Brother-to-Brother, an initiative seeking to eliminate health disparities for men of color; and the Ghana School Project, which provides vocational opportunities for children worldwide. As many of you know, these are just a few examples of Sigma contributions to American society and our brothers and sisters around the world.  This week, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity's historic centennial anniversary and congratulating the Sigma brothers for a century of service to all Americans.                          ____________________
