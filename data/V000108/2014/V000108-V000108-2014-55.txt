We had a discussion of this amendment in committee, and it did fail on a voice vote.  I would agree with the gentleman when he said that the situation in Syria and that part of the world is very complicated, and that there are no good options. I can't argue that point either.  He also stated that there are significant risks if weapons are, if you would, provided, and I could not deny that.  But at some point in time, given the problems we have in that area of the world and the people who have been displaced and who are in those refugee camps, I think we ought to keep what few unpleasant options we have open, to assume a reasonable risk if, at some future point in time during the next year to year and a half, we can work to improve the situation.  So with all due respect and understanding of the gentleman's concerns, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
