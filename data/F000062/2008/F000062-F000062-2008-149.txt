 President, I rise today with my good friend and colleague, Senator McConnell, to introduce the Aung San Suu Kyi Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2008.  We are proud to be joined by 73 of our colleagues in sponsoring this measure to award the Congressional Gold Medal to a woman who has inspired us all with her commitment to nonviolence, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law for the people of Burma. On December 17, 2007, the House voted 400-0 to award Suu Kyi this honor and we urge the Senate to promptly follow suit.  Last September we witnessed the largest democratic demonstrations in Burma in almost 20 years. Tens of thousands of Burmese citizens took to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to speak out against the country's oppressive military regime, and to cry out for democracy.  I watched these courageous people with a deep sense of admiration and respect.  Led by respected Buddhist monks, the people of the ``Saffron Revolution'' called on the military junta to release all political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and engage in a true dialogue on national reconciliation. Yet, as it had in the past, the military junta responded to the recent peaceful protests with violence and bloodshed. Soldiers used brutal force to break up the protests, beating and sometimes killing innocent civilians.  No amount of force, however, can crush the spirit of Aung San Suu Kyi and her peaceful quest for democracy and human rights. Indeed, she is a woman of unrivaled courage. In the face of threats, intimidation, harassment, and an assassination attempt, she has never wavered from her principles and continues to support national reconciliation for all the people of Burma.  By introducing this legislation, we seek not only to honor a remarkable woman who embodies the values and standards of the Congressional Gold Medal, but also to raise our voices once again in support of her cause which is our cause: a free and democratic Burma.  By now, her story is well known. Aung San Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945, in Rangoon to Aung San, commander of the Burma Independence Army, and Ma Khin Kyi. In August 1988, Suu Kyi, in her first political action, sent an open letter to the military-controlled government, asking for free, open and multi-party elections. The following month, she founded the National League for Democracy, which remains dedicated to a policy of nonviolence and civil disobedience. Suu Kyi was named its general-secretary.  Recognizing the threat Suu Kyi posted to their grip on power, the Burmese junta had her placed under house arrest and held without charges or trial. Yet, despite the best efforts of the military junta to suppress the growing democratic movement, in 1990 the National League for Democracy won 82 percent of the seats in parliamentary elections. But the junta annulled the election results and refused to release Suu Kyi.  Since then, the Burmese regime--now called the State Peace and Development Council--has refused to engage in a national dialogue with Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition, and intensified its campaign of oppression and abuse. In 2003, pro-government thugs attempted to assassinate Su Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy as they rode in a motorcade in the northern city of Depayin.  Last May, the military junta renewed her house arrest for another year. In fact, for most of the past 18 years, she has remained imprisoned or under house arrest, alone withoutminimal contact with the outside world.  Yet, as in 1990, the regime has once again failed to stamp out Suu Kyi's message of democracy, human rights, non-violence and the rule of law. She continues to inspire not only the people of Burma but the entire world. Indeed, Suu Kyi's commitment to freedom and democracy has been widely recognized.  In 1990, Suu Kyi was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament. The prize honors efforts on behalf of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in opposition to injustice and oppression. It is named for the late Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner.  In 1991, Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her commitment to nonviolence and support for freedom and democracy for Burma. She was not allowed to attend the ceremony. In its recommendation, the Nobel Committee wrote:       In the good fight for peace and reconciliation, we are      dependent on persons who set examples, persons who can      symbolize what we are seeking and mobilize the best in us.      Aung San Suu Kyi is just such a person. She unites deep      commitment and tenacity with a vision in which the end and      the means form a single unit. Its most important elements      are: democracy, respect for human rights, reconciliation      between groups, non-violence, and personal and collective      discipline.  Suu Kyi donated her $1.3 million in prize money to establish a health and education fund for Burma. She is the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize recipient.  In 2000, Suu Kyi was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award, by President Bill Clinton.  Last year, 45 U.S. Senators signed a letter to United Nations Secretary General Ban ki-Moon urging him to get personally involved in pressing for Suu Kyi's release.  In letter addressed to the State Peace and Development Council, a distinguished group of 59 former heads of state--including former Filipino president Corazon Aquino, former Czech president Vaclav Havel, former British prime minister John Major and former Presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush--called for the regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi. They correctly noted that ``Aung San Suu Kyi is not calling for revolution in Burma, but rather peaceful, nonviolent dialogue between the military, National League for Democracy, and Burma's ethnic groups.''  It is only fitting, that Congress join this international chorus in support of Aung San Suu Kyi and award her the Congressional Gold Medal.  As a U.S. Senator, I have worked hard to raise awareness about the situation in Burma and pass legislation to put pressure on the military junta to release Suu Kyi and begin a true dialogue on national reconciliation. In 1997, former Senator Bill Cohen and I authored legislation requiring the President to ban new U.S. investment in Burma if he determined that the Government of Burma had physically harmed, rearrested or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed large-scale repression or violence against the Democratic opposition. President Clinton issued the Executive Order in 1997 and the ban remains on the books today.  In 2003, after the regime attempted to assassinate Aung San Suu Kyi, Senator McConnell and I introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 which placed a complete ban on imports from Burma. It allowed that ban to be renewed one year at a time for up to 3 years. It was signed into law and has been renewed one year at a time for each of the past 4 years.  Last year, the women of the United States Senate came together to form the Women's Caucus on Burma to express our solidarity with Suu Kyi, call for her immediate release, urge the United Nations to pass a binding resolution on Burma. At our inaugural event, we were pleased to be joined by First Lady Laura Bush who added her own voice to those calling for peace and democracy in Burma. Our message is clear: We will not remain silent, we will not stand still until Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners are released and democratic government is restored in Burma.  This legislation is but one small step on the path to that goal. I remain hopeful that the military regime will heed the will of its people and the international community and we will be able to present Aung San Suu Kyi with this honor in person.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2631       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds as follows:       (1) Aung San Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945, in Rangoon,      Burma, to Aung San, commander of the Burma Independence Army,      and Ma Khin Kyi.       (2) On August 15, 1988, Ms. Suu Kyi, in her first political      action, sent an open letter to the military controlled      government asking for free, open, and multi-party elections.       (3) On September 24, 1988, the National League for      Democracy (NLD) was formed, with Ms. Suu Kyi as the general-     secretary, and it was, and remains, dedicated to a policy of      non-violence and civil disobedience.       (4) Ms. Suu Kyi was subsequently placed under house arrest,      where she remained for the next 6 years--without being      charged or put on trial--and has been imprisoned twice more;      she currently remains under house arrest.       (5) Despite her detention, the National League for      Democracy won an open election with an overwhelming 82      percent of the vote--which the military junta nullified.       (6) While under house arrest, she has bravely refused      offers to leave the country to continue to promote freedom      and democracy in Burma.       (7) For her efforts on behalf of the Burmese people, she      has been awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in      1990, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2000, and the      Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.       (8) Ms. Suu Kyi continues to fight on behalf of the Burmese      people, even donating her $1.3 million from her Nobel Prize      to establish a health and education fund for Burma.       (9) She is the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize      recipient, spending more than 12 of the past 17 years under      house arrest.       (10) Despite an assassination attempt against her life, her      prolonged illegal imprisonment, the constant public      vilification of her character, and her inability to see her      children or to see her husband before his death, Ms. Suu Kyi      remains committed to peaceful dialogue with her captors,      Burma's military regime, and Burma's ethnic nationalities      towards bringing democracy, human rights, and national      reconciliation to Burma.
