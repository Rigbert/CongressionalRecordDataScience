 Norm Stahl is in the first circuit, a New Hampshire judge. Norm Stahl was nominated in March. I held the hearing in June, and in June of that year, 1992, election year, we confirmed him. Justin Wilson didn't make it. There were reasons that that occurred, by the way. I can understand a political party saying: Hey, look, this nominee you have sent up is just not palatable to us. We in the majority will not vote for that person. We are flat not going to. I got that. I understand that.  The deal I made honestly, straight up with President Bush--if he were here,he would acknowledge it, and my Republican colleagues on the committee will tell you--I said: Here is what I will do. If there is someone who is absolutely, positively going to be a fire storm, if they are brought up, I will flag that person as soon as you name him, tell you what the problem is, and tell you there is going to be a fight. And you can decide whether you want to go forward or not go forward.  That is not the case with Bonnie Campbell. I ask the Senator a question: Has anyone come to him and said, the reason I am against Bonnie Campbell is she is incompetent, or the reason I am against Bonnie Campbell is because she doesn't have a judicial temperament, or the reason I am against Bonnie Campbell is she is just not a mainstream person? I mean, I haven't heard anybody tell me why they are against Bonnie Campbell. Have you?
