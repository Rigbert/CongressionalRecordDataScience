President, today with Senators McCain and Leahy, I am introducing legislation that would extend the moratorium on discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.  Senator McCain is absolutely right. The moratorium expires in a few days, and we are very hopeful the bipartisan bill we are going to introduce today is going to help bring the Senate together on what has surely been a very contentious issue.  Considerable confusion even exists as to what the current law entails. For example, there are countless stories written that say there is a ban on Internet taxes. That is absolutely incorrect. The only thing that is banned today is taxes that single the Internet out for discriminatory treatment. We are extending that ban.  As Senator McCain has noted, there are strong feelings on both sides of this issue. I happen to believe very strongly that no jurisdiction in this country has shown they have been hurt by their inability to discriminate against the Internet. Certainly folks in State and local government feel very strongly about it, and they have a right, at this time of economic concern, to know where the revenue is going to be for their essential needs.  Senator Dorgan, Senator Kerry, Senator Hollings, and I intend to continue the very constructive conversations we have had literally for 18 months on the issue, but because it is important to move forward quickly, given the fact the moratorium expires, Senator McCain, Senator Leahy, and I are introducing our bipartisan effort today and plan to continue our conversation with our colleagues.                          ____________________
