President, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I know the amount of labor and work that goes into the preparation of a bill of this magnitude. I also know when you postpone the orderly process of passing spending bills and wait an extra 4 or 5 months, there is an opportunity for mischief. I think only in time will we be able to sift through 1,600, 1,800, 2,000 pages of this bill to find out in painful detail what is included.  There are several things that have come to my attention. I would like to draw them to the attention of my colleagues here in the Senate.  Let me start by saying there is one issue most people don't like to talk about and I am going to raise this evening because I think it is critically important. The District of Columbia is a city which is governed by a mayor, a city council, and 535 wannabe mayors in the Congress.  It seems that every Member of the House or Senate who wanted to be a mayor at some time in their lives decided at some point to make a decision for the District of Columbia. I think that is unfortunate. The people of this city, like every city, have a right to govern themselves. Occasionally that intrusion of congressional mischief can reach a perilous state. Let me give an example.  The AIDS rate for the AIDS disease in our Nation's Capital is the highest in the country. It is 10 times the national average. More and more women are being diagnosed with AIDS in Washington, DC. DC health officials reported last October 616 new AIDS cases in 2001 alone, 33 percent among women. In 1981 women only accounted for 7 percent of AIDS cases.  City health officials in Washington estimate 40 percent of AIDS cases are associated with injected drugs.  The question is, how can we stop this AIDS epidemic in the Nation's Capital, which is not only infecting more and more women and children, but appears to be out of control. Frankly, there are programs that work. One of the programs is not popular to talk about. Most of my colleagues run away from it, but you cannot run away from reality. It is a needle exchange program. It is a program that invites addicts in, in an effort to try to first give them a needle that is clean, and then bring them into rehabilitation so they can stop their addiction.  There are those who say don't give them clean needles because they will just keep using them. But you know what they will use, they will use dirty needles and pass the AIDS epidemic on and on and on.  I am not expert in this area. I get squeamish talking about needles andinjections. But the fact is, the people who are experts, the American Medical Association and medical officials, have said it works. Put these programs on the street corners and in the storefronts of Washington, DC, and we can start reducing the AIDS infection rate in our Nation's Capital.  There is no reason in my mind why the people of the District of Columbia should not be able to use their own money to try this approach to reduce drug addiction and reduce the AIDS epidemic in their hometown.  Across the United States, there are programs in many States. But sadly enough, the Members of the House of Representatives have put in a provision that prohibits the District of Columbia from even using its own tax dollars to in any way support this kind of project.  Some of the very congressmen who beat on the desk and beat on their chest and talk about how they are going to fight these needle exchange programs represent districts and States where these programs take place today. This is a sad outcome in this bill. I hope those who reflect on it will realize they are taking some high and mighty moral position and people will die because of it.  Stand by the doctors, stand by the professionals. Stop playing mayor and city council for the District of Columbia. Sadly, this appropriation continues to do so.  Exhaustive scientific review has found that needle exchange programs are an effective way to slow the spread of HIV and AIDS. In a speech last September. Dr. Joseph O'Neill, Director of the Office of National AIDS policy indicated that the administration did not oppose the use of state and local funds to support needle exchange programs.  The American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Association of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health Association endorse these programs. The Institute of Medicine identified access to sterile syringes as one of four ``unrealized opportunities'' in HIV prevention in a publication issued last year. The IOM committee recommends that the Administration ``rescind the existing prohibition against the use of Federal funds for needle exchange to allow communities that desire such programs to institute them using federal resources.''  Former Surgeon General David Satcher, MD stated that:       There is conclusive scientific evidence that syringe      exchange programs, as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention      strategy, are an effective public health intervention that      reduces transmission of HIV and does not encourage the      illegal use of drugs.  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, MD concluded that needle exchange programs are an ``effective means of preventing the spread of the disease [HIV/AIDS] without increasing the used of illicit drugs.'' He called limiting the use of state and local funds for these programs ``counterproductive.''  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were 156 needle exchange programs operating in the United States in 81 cities and 31 States last year, many of which receive state and local financial support for their activities. None of these programs receive Federal support at this time.  The CDC publication also indicated that 95 percent of needle exchange programs in operation referred clients to substance use treatment and counseling programs, and over half provide on site voluntary HIV testing and more than a quarter also screen for hepatitis B and C.  In 2000, four needle exchange programs were functioning in my home state of Illinois.  In spite of the overwhelming support from public health and medical professionals, we here in Congress have once again prevented the District of Columbia from using its own local funds to finance these lifesaving programs. I was pleased that the Omnibus Appropriations bill passed by the Senate allowed the District of Columbia to use LOCAL funds to finance a needle exchange program. Washington, DC has one needle exchange program, Prevention Works, that is supported with private funding. Both the Mayor and Police Chief support the program.  However, I am deeply disappointed to learn that the conference report we are considering today maintains the irresponsible status quo, which prevents the District from using its own locally generated revenue to finance needle exchange programs.  This conference report disregards the expert opinions of former Surgeon Generals David Satcher and C. Everett Koop, leading medical and public health organizations, the Director of the Office of National AIDS policy and the Institute of Medicine.  It is my sincere hope that next year we will stop politicizing this issue and recognize that the District of Columbia, just like all of our home states and districts, deserves to have all possible resources at its disposal to combat this devastating public health crisis.  The same is true when it comes to attorneys' fees for special education. Think about this. In every school district in America, if you have a disabled child and want that child to have an education, you have a right to say to the school district: Here is my child who needs the education. If the school district contests it and says this child doesn't have a disability and we are not going to pay for a special ed teacher, you have a right to appeal that decision. That's the case across America.  Sometimes, because it is complicated and expensive, attorneys are involved to represent the parents and the school district and to resolve their differences. It happens every day across America.  In the District of Columbia it has gotten out of hand. Some law firms--only a few--have exploited the parents of disabled children and turned in attorneys' fees requests to the District of Columbia public school system that are way out of line. Some of these firms have become shady operations that offer not only attorney counseling, but special education services, a package that raises many suspicions.  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and I have debated this over and over again as to whether to cap the fees that can be paid to attorneys and what to do about it. In the Senate we raised the cap on attorneys' fees for DC special education to $4,000 maximum per case. I hope that is enough to take care of these cases. But I will tell you I do not believe we should be imposing a cap on attorneys' fees. The parents of these poor children who are disabled should not be denied legal representation.  I am happy Senator Hutchison and I could agree on limiting the attorneys' activities so those questionable activities, those criminal activities will stop. But I think we should put an end to this cap on attorneys' fees and say to the DC public school system once and for all, for goodness sakes, offer kids with disabilities the kind of special education opportunities that are available across America. This provision capping attorneys' fees in this appropriation bill I think is a mistake.  Not only are such caps an intrusion on home rule and local spending prerogatives, I do not believe that imposing a cap on payment of attorneys' fees is the way to address significant and long-standing problems with the delivery of special education services to children in the District of Columbia. These fees arise because parents are forced to bring due process actions against the city school system--and the parents win their cases.  It is unacceptable for Congress to impose a dollar cap on how much the City may pay attorneys who win these cases, particularly after a judge has awarded a fee based on a reasonableness standard. However, I do support language in this bill which addresses concerns about particular attorneys who have shamelessly taken advantage of the system.  I support a complete bar on paying attorneys' cases in which the District's Chief Financial Officer, CFO, determines that an attorney, officer, or employee of the firm has a pecuniary interest in any special education diagnostic services, schools, or other special education service providers.  Furthermore, I believe the provisions in the Senate bill which mandate stronger ethical standards are appropriate.  I support the provisions in the bill dictating that the District's CFO require disclosure by attorneys in IDEA cases of any financial, corporate, legal, board membership, or other relationships with special education diagnostic services, schools, or other special education service providers before paying any attorneys' fees; that the CFO mayrequire certification by counsel that all services billed in special education were rendered; that the CFO report to Congress quarterly on the certifications and the amount paid by the government of the District of Columbia, including the District of Columbia Public Schools, to attorneys in cases brought under IDEA; and that the District's Inspector General may audit the certifications to ensure attorney compliance.  It is my hope that these provisions will produce needed accountability. I am glad they were retained in the final product.  I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the cap remains in this final version of the bill. I share the sentiment that abuses of this program need to stop. I want to work to address that problem and to figure out why the District has had such perennial problems with its ability to meet the needs of its children in special education.  But it is wrong for this Republican Congress to deprive children of legal recourse when they are denied services to which they are entitled. It is wrong for the Republican Congress to preclude the District of Columbia from using its own funds to make all legitimate payments in this critical special education program.  There is another provision that was slipped in this bill as it relates to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Freedom of Information Act. This provision is an enormous setback to the efforts of State and local governments to combat illegal firearms trafficking. It undermines the very purpose of the Freedom of Information Act.  This act entitles citizens to open access to Government records, prevents the Government from shielding its activities from public scrutiny. The City of Chicago, which I represent, filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain information about the ATF trace database. The purpose, of course, is to determine which gun sellers and manufacturers were responsible for selling guns to criminals.  In response to these rulings, the gun industry went to the House Appropriations Committee and asked for a rider in this bill to prevent the ATF from complying with the FOIA request and telling the City of Chicago and the public what they were doing.  This provision sets a dangerous precedent because it essentially directs a Federal agency not to comply with the Federal court ruling, thus undermining the very purpose of FOIA. If litigants can be denied information under FOIA through legislative action--even when a Federal court has upheld this request--FOIA itself is in jeopardy.  There is no cost justification for this. This doesn't have anything to do with appropriations. This is an effort by the gun industry to stop cities that are ravaged by gun crime from going after the irresponsible gun dealers who are selling guns to criminals. And the NRA and the gun industry are shielding them with this rider in the appropriations bill.  I was joined by Senators Jack Reed and Ted Kennedy in urging that this provision not be included. Unfortunately, it was.  Let me acknowledge also, as has been said by some of my colleagues, that I am very concerned about the language of funding for homeland security in this bill. The Senate, in its version of this bill, added almost $4 billion in homeland security funds to be sent back to the State and local governments to protect America. As I stand and speak on the floor of the Senate, we are warning families across America that we are in orange alert and that they have to take special precautions to protect themselves and their children from the possibility of biological and chemical warfare and dirty radioactive bombs.  Sadly enough, we are not providing the resources for the State and local governments to meet this challenge. Make no mistake, America is prepared to attack in the Middle East, but America is not prepared to defend itself at home. That is a sad reality. This bill cuts out almost $4 billion that would have gone for some very important purposes: Additional money for the Transportation Security Administration for monitoring airports; additional money for the INS and border security to stop those from coming in this country who are bent on bad behavior; community policing grants to try to help communities have someone on the other end of the line when you dial 9-1-1, cut $130 million; FEMA disaster recovery assistance, cut by $1 billion; the Department of Justice Office of Domestic Preparedness, cut by $1 billion; firefighter grants, cut by $150 million; interoperable communications equipment grants, cut by $235 million--the No. 1 priority in my State so that the police and firefighters and medical first responders can communicate, cut in this appropriations bill from the Senate level.  These cuts, frankly, came at the request and with the approval of the White House and the Office of Management and Budget.  Emergency Operation Center, cut nationwide by $155 million; port container security, cut by $45 million; port technology demonstration projects so that we can see dangerous cargo coming in these ships, cut by $1 million; explosives training initiative, cut by $7 million; and $42 million from embassy security.  I pray to God that nothing happens to this country as a result of terrorism. But I think we have been derelict in our duty to provide the resources to State and local governments to protect families and to protect communities and businesses across America. This bill, with its $4 billion in cuts off the Senate level, leaves us in a precarious situation and one that I hope does not come back to haunt us in years to come.  Let me conclude on a positive note. I thank the Senator from Alaska. Despite these words of critique, I personally appreciate, as does Senator DeWine, the personal interest and initiative he took in the global AIDS epidemic. His decision on the floor to approve an amendment which we offered is going to mean that thousands and maybe more will have their lives saved. I thank the Senator from Alaska. He has been a leader on this issue all the way. We have reached a 42-percent increase in funding to fight the global AIDS epidemic through his cooperation and leadership. I thank him very much.  I yield the floor.  I ask unanimous consent that a statement entitled ``Underfunding Homeland Security'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     Underfunding Homeland Security       At a time when the Administration is ramping up for war      overseas, one would think we would be doing everything      possible to fortify our security at home as well.       That's certainly what the Administration has led us to      believe, but oddly enough, we're poised to pass this 1100      plus page omnibus bill that slashes funding for the pillars      of homeland security.       And after cutting funds for first responders, for airport      security improvements, for community police officers and      more, what do they propose? That Americans fortify their own      homes with duct tape and plastic sheets. This Administration      can and must do better to protect the safety of the American      people.       This bill leaves significant gaps in funding for homeland      security priorities.       The Republican-controlled conference committee rejected      increases in homeland security funding that were approved      unanimously last year by a Democratic-led Appropriations      Committee. Instead, the Republican-controlled conference      imposed an additional 0.65 percent across-the-board cut to      all federal programs, leaving already cash-strapped      initiatives in even greater need. The results of the      cumulative cuts, which total more than $4.4 billion, include:       First Responders: This bill cuts $2.98 billion from      activities designed to aid first responders. Cuts include a      $1.59 billion reduction for the Federal Emergency Management      Agency (FEMA)--including a $150 million cut to firefighter      grants--as well as a $235 million cut to funds for police and      firefighters to purchase communications equipment and a $155      million cut to fund emergency operations centers.       Police/Law Enforcement: The bill reduces funding for      Community Oriented Policing (COPS) public safety and      community policing grants by more than 40 percent--from $330      million to $200 million. This cut would completely eliminate      funding needed to hire 1,360 community-based police officers.       Aviation/Port Security: The bill cuts $170 million from      Transportation Security Administration (TSA), impeding      efforts to improve airport security, and cuts $46 million      from port security funds. The bill also makes cuts to the      U.S. Customs Service, resulting in the loss of more than 200      employees and compromising the implementation of the      Container Security Initiative and other homeland security      efforts. The INS/border security budget is also reduced by      approximately $182 million.       Other Cuts: The bill also cuts programs to train state and      federal law enforcement and security personnel by nearly $50      million, including a $7 million cut to the Explosives      Training Initiative and $42 million to embassy security.       A supplemental appropriations bill would be necessary to      provide funding adequate to meet the homeland security needs      of localities across the country in advance of any military      action in Iraq.                                illinois       States and localities are still waiting for the funds      promised to them. The States have legitimate concerns.      There's a lot of brave talk about fighting terrorism, but      when it comes to paying for it, this administration has not      delivered.       In my home State of Illinois, we have an Illinois Terrorism      Task Force (TTF). This is a collective body representing 50      agencies addressing emergency needs throughout the state of      Illinois. They have told me that a minimum of $100 million is      required to cover security expenses in Illinois for FY03.       The Terrorism Task Force originally asked for $320 million      in federal funding and then scaled back its request to the      current level ($100 million) in anticipation of federal      budget cuts.       According to the TTF director Mike Chamness, these funds      are crucial to Illinois' ability to properly address the      threat of terror.       Without these dollars, programs designed to secure Illinois      will cease to exist.       First responders will be ill-equipped and prepared to      address emergency situations.       Major items in the TFF's $100 million request include:       $25 million for first responders' respiration equipment      upgrade (nuclear, biological, and chemical).       $14.4 million for communication systems (interoperable      communications equipment for police, firefighters, and state/     local emergency operations centers).       Elite Terror Response Team: under current funding Federal      monies have not been available to send teams for the ``Elite      Response'' training.       It is imperative that my home state of Illinois--like every      other State in this nation--provides their front-line first      responders the best equipment, the essential tools, and the      finest training available. We rely on their readiness and      should expect nothing less. These funds are needed sooner,      not later.                            city of chicago       Now let me tell you about the funding needs for Homeland      Security in the City of Chicago.       The City of Chicago had made an assessment of total budget      needs for homeland security at around $175 million       The top ticket item in Chicago is the Chicago public safety      radio migration plan which is estimated to cost $80 million.       The migration allows for all agencies to communicate in an      interoperable manner on a daily basis without major equipment      modification or complicated system changes.       Among other important needs are:       Emergency Responder Training and Equipment--$7.9 million.      CPD is requesting first responder training, first responder      equipment and secondary responders unit training.       Emergency Operations Center Expansion--$10 million. This      expansion will provide incident manager with real-time live      video, satellite imagery, building X, Y, and Z coordinates      and other state of the art technologies.       Hazardous Materials Equipment--$7 million. The Chicago      Department of Environment is requesting hazardous materials      response equipment for any large, widespread or egregious      hazardous incident.             need to do much more than duct tape & plastic       We can't stand up and say we're truly doing everything we      can to ensure that our cities and counties, bridges and      roads, airplanes and trains are as secure as possible and      that our fellow Americans are safe on our soil if this bill      is what represents the level of our commitment to fund      programs to ensure homeland security.       I fully expect the President to come back to Congress and      ask for additional funds to support our military needs      overseas. Without question, we must address these needs. But      it would be unconscionable to increase funding for military      activities in Iraq and neglect our security needs at home. If      war comes with Iraq, the battle lines will be expanded to      include our country. We simply cannot afford to leave      American citizens unprotected.                                  ____ ATF/Freedom of Information Act Provision (Re: City of Chicago Lawsuit                            vs. Gun Industry)       Another provision slipped in to the appropriations bill at      the last minute involves the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and      Firearms and the Freedom of Information Act.       This provision would be an enormous setback to the efforts      of state and local governments to combat illegal firearms      trafficking and would undermine the very purpose of the      Freedom of Information Act.       The Freedom of Information Act entitles citizens to open      access to government records and prevents the government from      shielding its activities from public scrutiny.       The City of Chicago filed a FOIA request to obtain      information from an ATF trace database. A U.S. District Court      and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ordered      the ATF to release these records.       In response to these rulings, the gun industry went to the      House Appropriations Committee and asked for a rider to      prevent the ATF from complying with this FOIA request.       This provision sets a dangerous precedent because it      essentially directs a federal agency not to comply with a      federal court ruling, thus undermining the very purpose of      FOIA. If litigants can be denied information under FOIA      through legislative action--even when a federal court has      upheld the request--FOIA itself is in jeopardy.       There is no cost justification for this provision. The City      of Chicago demonstrated in its litigation that it would take      the ATF less than 10 minutes to assemble and release the data      is has requested.       I was joined by Senators Reed and Kennedy in urging that      this provision not be included, and I am disappointed that it      was.       In the past, I have challenged the Senate and the President      to back up the high priority we have placed on the global      AIDS pandemic with adequate resources.       [Senator DeWine has even called me a ``bull dog'' on this      issue. I took that as a great compliment.]       This 2003 appropriations process demonstrated that the      Senate does indeed recognize the need for increased resources      to fight global AIDS.       In December, I, and 15 other Senators, sent a letter to      appropriators asking them to increase overall AIDS spending      by 50 percent over 2002 levels. At the time we were looking      for an increase of $236 million.       While facing $9-$10 billion in cuts throughout the FY 2003      appropriations bill, the Foreign Operations Subcommittee      responded to this request, and managed to find an additional      $41 million for global AIDS.       The Senate Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee      agreed to match House approved levels, increasing the funds      going to the CDC's Global AIDS Program by about $15 million.       While this increase of $56 million was welcome,      unfortunately, it was not enough.       Senator Mike DeWine and I set out to achieve that 50      percent increase, and through a floor amendment to the      omnibus bill, sought another $180 million to bring overall      spending on Global AIDS to $1.525 billion.       This amendment was accepted--its success demonstrates the      Senate's sincere commitment to fighting global AIDS.       $100 million of these funds were slated for the U.S.      contribution to the Global Fund--the world's primary      organization to monitor and support worldwide AIDS      prevention, treatment and care programming.       And the remaining $80 million would go to USAID global AIDS      programs.       Well, during conference, we lost $80 million of the $180      million total. But, nevertheless, I count this as a victory      for the global AIDS pandemic.       In the end, an additional $50 million was secured for the      Global Fund, bringing the U.S. contribution up to $350      million for 2003, and an additional $50 million went to      bilateral programs.       This omnibus bill designates $1.2 billion for global AIDS.      That is a 46 percent increase over what Congress appropriated      in 2002.       The President's 2003 budget request suggested an increase      in funding of global AIDS funding of 29 percent. I would say      we have come a long way.       We will need this type of increase--at least a 50 percent      increase--each year until we can close the gap between      expenditures and resources necessary to fight this pandemic.       The President's FY04 budget request amounts to an increase      of only 32 percent over the $1.4 billion the U.S. will spend      overall on global AIDS in 2003.       [This bull dog] I will be back, asking that at a minimum we      achieve a 50 percent increase in global AIDS funding each      year for the next few years.       We must continue to do more for the 42 million people      worldwide who are living with HIV/AIDS and prevent a good      portion of those that will become newly infected in 2003.       During the last ten minutes I have been speaking,      approximately 58 people have died from AIDS, 11 of those were      children.       A 15-year-old boy in Botswana faces an 80 percent chance of      dying of AIDS.       By 2010, it is estimated that sub-Saharan Africa alone will      be home to 20 million AIDS orphans; that's 20 million      children who have lost one or both parents due to AIDS.       We must act now to help those who today suffer from the      impact of HIV/AIDS as well as to change the future of today's      children.       We know the situation is dire. We have data to support what      program work. Now its time to fund the programs that work.       The 2003 appropriations bill helps us to take yet another      tiny step forward in fighting global AIDS.
