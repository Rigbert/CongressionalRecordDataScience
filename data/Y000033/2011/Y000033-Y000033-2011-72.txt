I made this announcement earlier in the day that I would allow the Member to have the 5 minutes to speak on the amendment even though it was subject to a point of order, if that courtesy was not abused. In recent points of order, that courtesy has been abused.  I will continue to show that courtesy to Members who do not abuse their 5 minutes and who do not abuse the point of order.  I yield back the balance of my time.
