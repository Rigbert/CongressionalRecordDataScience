 President, I say to my friend--I will make two points here. One is, it was not only the Senator from Delaware and Florida, but also the Senator from Indiana, the Republican chairman, who pointed out we made a mistake by dismissing the policy of engagement of the last administration. Even the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Mr. Powell, when Kim Dae Jong of South Koreacame, said we were going to continue engaging the North as Mr. Kim wanted us to and thought we should, as our Japanese friends thought we should, and the President summarily stopped that. I think that was another mistake.  I make another point about Iran. The neoconservative view of why we should have gone into Iraq alone is it would teach a lesson to the other malcontents in the world such as the Iranians. They were going to say, My God, look at the unilateral use of force; we better behave. I point out what my friend knows well and we talked about. Prior to our invasion of Iraq, Iran had a genuine democratic movement--not prowestern, democratic movement. It was the Majlis, their parliament, 195 people. There was a genuine movement.  You had the mullahs and the apparatus and the clerics who controlled security and controlled the intelligence apparatus, afraid of world opinion if they crushed that democratic movement.  What did they do? If, in fact, the neocons are correct, and having 140,000 troops in Iraq was going to teach Iran a lesson, in the midst of our greatest show of force in Iraq, the clerics in Tehran would have been afraid to touch the democratic movement, for fear of world reaction.  Obviously they were not frightened by our show of force. There is no democratic movement left. For instead the clerics crushed it. They disbanded it.  So that is another example of the two most dangerous states for the United States of America today if they spiral out of control--Iran and North Korea. Both present a greater threat to America today than they did 3 years ago.
