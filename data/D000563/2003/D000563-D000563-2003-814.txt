SANTORUM.--which is a standard D, which is the most common late-term abortion performed at hospitals, taught in medical school, and peer reviewed. This is not Rick Santorum talking. This is not the Senator from Tennessee talking. This is a variety of obstetricians.  The point is, they are giving a reason for keeping this procedure legal that is a red herring. This procedure is not taught in hospitals. It is not performed in hospitals. It is not done by advanced perinatologists who run into difficult pregnancies. Why? Because it is not safe. Why? Because there are better methods.  What we are trying to do here is protect women's health. We hear so much passion here about protecting women's health. We have a procedure that has been demonstrably proven is dangerous to women's health; that there are other procedures that are safer.  Why are we not concerned about women's health when we want to keep a procedure legal that is unsafe? Are we really concerned about women's health, or are we really concerned about eroding, chipping ever so slightly at this oracle of abortion in America? This is trying to stop something that is unsafe for women, that is obviously brutal for children, and is simply not necessary to protect the health of a woman.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
