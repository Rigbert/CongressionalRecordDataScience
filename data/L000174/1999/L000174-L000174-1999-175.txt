President, I want to congratulate Ray Fisher on his Senate confirmation. I will miss Ray and Nancy here in Washington, but know that the Ninth Circuit will greatly benefit from his service there.  Finally, I congratulate Ted Stewart on his confirmation and Senators Hatch and Bennett, who have worked hard to get him confirmed expeditiously. I trust that Mr. Stewart will honor the commitments that he made to the Judiciary Committee to avoid even the appearance of impropriety on matters on which he has worked while in State government.  I said on the Senate floor last night that this body's recent treatment of women and minority judicial nominees is a badge of shame. I feel that we added to that shame with today's vote of Justice Ronnie White.  In their report entitled ``Justice Held Hostage,'' the bipartisan Task Force on Federal Judicial Selection from Citizens for Independent Courts, co-chaired by Mickey Edwards and Lloyd Cutler, substantiated through their independent analysis what I have been saying for some time: Women and minority judicial nominations are treated differently by this Senate and take longer, are less likely to be voted on and less likely to be confirmed.  Judge Richard Paez has been stalled for 44 months, and the nomination of Marsha Berzon has been pending for 20 months. Other nominees are confirmed in 2 months.  Anonymous Republican Senators continue their secret holds on the Paez and Berzon nominations. The Republican majority refuses to vote on those nominations. In fairness, after almost 2 years and almost 4 years, Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez are entitled to a Senate vote on their nominations. Vote them up or vote them down, but vote. That is what I have been saying, that is what the Chief Justice challenged the Republican Senate to do back in January 1998.  I can assure you that there is no Democratic Senator with a hold on Judge Paez or Marsha Berzon. I can assure you that every Democratic Senator is willing to go forward with votes on Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon now, without delay.  Last Friday, Senator Lott committed to trying to ``find a way'' to have these nominations considered by the Senate. I want to help him do that.                          ____________________
