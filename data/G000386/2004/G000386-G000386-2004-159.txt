 President, today the Senate has approved the Tax Administration Good Government Act. This legislation is the first legislation addressing tax administration since the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.  The legislation contains five major components. First, it provides additional safeguards for taxpayers. Second, the legislation significantly simplifies the current interest and penalty regimes. Third, the act also includes the proposals passed out of the Finance Committee on April 2, 2003 and included in a bill introduced by Senators Hatch and Breaux to modernize the United States Tax Court.  Fourth, our legislation also includes several provisions, some of which were requested by the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation, to strike an appropriate balance in protecting taxpayer confidentiality through disclosure reforms. Finally, the legislation takes an important step toward simplification of the Tax Code through the elimination of obsolete provisions and unifying the definition of child within the Tax Code.  We have worked closely with the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the National Taxpayer Advocate, and the Joint Committee on Taxation to develop this package of proposals to promote good government in the administration of our Tax Code.  Congress's responsibility for the tax system does not stop after we pass tax law changes. We have an oversight responsibility to ensure that taxpayer rights are protected, that our tax laws are not administered counter to congressional intent, that the judicial body with primary jurisdiction over the tax laws has the tools necessary to provide independent review of controversies between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service, and to take steps to simplify the Tax Code whenever possible.  We are pleased to say that today, the Senate has taken a big step in that direction.                          ____________________
