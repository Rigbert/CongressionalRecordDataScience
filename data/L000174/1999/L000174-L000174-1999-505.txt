I am not sure the managers' package would even need a rollcall vote. If that is the case, the first rollcall vote will be on the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey, and the next one would be--well, it would be whatever order the distinguished leader has spoken. Again, based on the experience I have had managing bills, I tend to agree with the distinguished majority leader. This might be a good way to get us moving. I also suggest that it protects the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from Missouri, and the Senator from Tennessee. But it moves us forward.
