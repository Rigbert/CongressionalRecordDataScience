Speaker, I yield to the distinguished majority leader for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule for the following week.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, we expect to consider additional bills under suspension of the rules, as well as H.R. 1000, the Pension Security Act of 2003.  On Thursday, we plan to take up H.R. 1527, the National Transportation Safety Board reauthorization.  Finally, I would like to note for all Members that we are making a change to the schedule that we sent to all the offices at the beginning of the year. We do not plan to have votes next Friday, May 16.
