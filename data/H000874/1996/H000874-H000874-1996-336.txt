Speaker, I recently had the honor of presiding at the groundbreaking for the Lexington Park Corporate Center, a project undertaken by Millison Development. The groundbreaking ceremony signified the opening of a development which will be occupied by three companies--DCS, Semcor, and the Rail Co.--conveniently located to serve the Patuxent River Naval Base.  The companies that will occupy this new center were not here during the changes brought in the 1940's when this rural community was transformed from one dependent on farming and seafood, to one that is now technology driven.  A family that has been in St. Mary's throughout the expansion and that has played a significant role in what has become one of the broadest expansions of a military base in our country is none other than the Millison family. Theirs is a long and solid history of support of the Navy and small business entrepreneurship. The Millison's family story is worth sharing with my colleagues.  Israel ``Jake'' Levine was a native of Lithuania. He bought his peddlers' license from a man named Millison and soon changed his name to reflect the name atop the important document. Israel Millison, who is the grandfather of J. Laurence Millison, the current president of Millison Development, then purchased a store from a Mr. Pearson around 1925 and later sold the business to his sons, Samuel and Hiram.  Hiram Millison continued to operate the store as Millison brothers, even after his brother Sammie left the business, until 1943 when the Government purchased his store and other Cedar Point properties to build the naval base.  When the Navy moved in during the Second World War to consolidate several naval air test bases and establish Patuxent River as one of the premier such bases in the world, many families were very rapidly displaced from their homes and business. Most were forced to leave within 20 days of receiving their property appraisals and then it took 6 months or more to get their money.  Hiram used his money to build a store and restaurant outside the main gate of the new base and subsequently developed a number of properties in the town that became known as Lexington Park. Upon his death in 1965, Hiram Millison's obituary described him as a man who ``planted seeds of progress.''  Hiram Millison saw opportunity when others were reeling from the trauma of disruption. He proved to be a great visionary--serving as the first president of the Patuxent River Council of the Naval League. This council played an important role in providing the community support for the Navy and the start of a tradition that has become a key reason that consolidation of bases continue to redound to the benefit of Patuxent River today.  Today, we see this same support of the Navy with Hiram's son Larry, who has served as a county commissioner, as a member of the board of education, and, in his role as a businessman, in his support of organizations like the Navy Alliance. Now, another Millison--Rachelle--is involved in the family business and she has proven herself as a citizen with community spirit who will not only continue to reap the seeds sown by her family, but she will also continue to sow seeds for future generations, as her father and grandfather did in the past.  I know that the companies involved with the Patuxent River base are experiencing disruption as a result of consolidations. Employees may be relocating from Crystal City, VA or Warminster, PA.  Aaron Davidson is a native Pennsylvanian. He works for Semcor and along with his wife, will follow his job in Warminster down to Patuxent. In so doing, he has convinced many of his coworkers to follow suit. I want to assure Aaron, and the many other families relocating to this area, that this community is eager to have you and will do everything it can to make the transition for you and other families as smooth as possible.  In the transition and change brought on by this consolidation, I hope that you--like Hiram Millison--will come to find opportunities here and join with the Millisons and other proud families, planting seeds in this great community for future generations.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the Millison family. Their story of perseverance, community spirit, and patriotism is a shining example of what this great country can produce when opportunity is seized.                          ____________________
