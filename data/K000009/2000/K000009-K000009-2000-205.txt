Speaker, I rise in the strongest opposition to the proposal for permanent trade privileges with China. Trade does not bring freedom, only enforceable laws in democratic republics bring and carry and assure freedom. Trade does not build a middle class, only laws governing workers rights to organize undergird middle-class wages and benefits.  Before World War II, Nazi Germany's largest trading partner was England, and for the United States, Japan, did that stop totalitarianism's rise? Trade with Communist countries does nothing to assure that those doing the work reap any of the benefits; that is why the United States for so many years has held sacred its special laws governing trade with Communist nations. And now that the United States has been victorious in defeating Communist regimes in most corners of the world, some will choose to abandon the legal structure that we held in place called most favored nation replacing it with the toothless normal trade relations statute that we are about to debate tomorrow.  Trade with Communist countries does nothing to assure that those who do the work reap the benefits. Permanent trade status for China will only serve to lock in the exploitative system of agricultural and industrial servitude that is China today; this is not a fight about expanding America's export markets.  This is a fight about China becoming a vast export platform 12 times the size of Mexico, taking our markets in Asia's Rim and sending the glut of sweatshop goods back here to our shores.  When NAFTA passed, the proponents said it would result in a huge export market for the United States and Mexico and that Mexico's workers' wages would go up and there would be no downward pressure on wages and benefits in this country. Look what has happened, Mexico now exports more cars and trucks to the United States than the United States does to the entire rest of the world.  Our Nation has hemorrhaged tens of thousands of jobs, of living wage jobs, to Mexico, and now the China drain will accelerate if this measure passes. Mexico has turned into a major export platform, not an export market. Just look at the label on your television or your car engine or your truck or your electronic gismo, everything coming in here; the only thing America is exporting to Mexico is our middle-class jobs. And they are not getting paid middle-class wages.  In the end, this fight on China is a heroic fight. It is a fight for democratic values in the harsh countryside and in the industrial sweatshops where most Americans will never be allowed to travel in the Nation of China. It is a fight indeed for the Chinese people, and the fight most of all for American principals. Will we side with the chauffeured limousine class, the advertisers, the retailers, the global companies who soothingly tell us, Everything will be just fine? But by their shear power and money, they hold sway over the visual and printed media in this country.  For those fighting permanent trade privileges for China on the basis of democratic values, I say hurrah. Praise freedom lovers and the imprisoned China Democratic Party leaders for whom we speak here on this floor tonight.  For those fighting permanent trade privileges for China on the basis of religious freedom, I say God bless them. And for those fighting permanent trade privileges for China on the basis of freedom of assembly, whether it is for the Falun Gong or the murdered freedom fighters in Tiananmen Square, I say history will judge you as righteous.  America's values are freedom and valor. As we move into this Memorial Day week, let us renew our promise as the world's premier freedom fighters. Vote for freedom. Vote ``no'' on permanent normal trade status for China.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter sent by Wei Jinh Sheng, who spent nearly 2 decades of his life in Chinese prisons. Why? Because he fought to be an independent democratic political leader in his own country.  He says to us, ``Supporters of this agreement are wrong. The United States is giving up something of profound importance if they were to approve this agreement. Please help us fight Chinese tyranny.''  Please read his words in the Record, and tomorrow vote ``no'' on permanent trade status for China.       Supporters of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for      China tell us the US is giving up nothing in its trade deal      with the regime in Beijing, that China is making all the      concessions. This claim is false.       The US is giving up something of profound importance--its      ability to aid people everywhere in their struggle for human      rights and democracy. The US has enormous power, due to its      economic leverage. Although the US has been reluctant to use      this power against Chinese tyranny, the power exists; Beijing      recognizes this fully, even if the US does not.       The annual renewal of China's ``driver's license'' on trade      may have become routine, but the power to grant the license      remains critical. That is why Beijing is desperate to obtain      PNTR, and rid itself of this power. That is why both Rep.      Levin and Cox's proposals, no matter their very fine points,      are ``toothless'' if this power is not retained. The hope      that the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank      will place limits on China will amount to little, for      multinational financial institutions are woefully inadequate      to take over responsibility of the US Congress. It may not      follow the US lead in any event.       Framing the debate on WTO and PNTR as ``keeping the door      open'' is misleading. America's door is open. The door to      China is only half-open. However, the Chinese people have      learned that they lack the rights other people enjoy. If this      were not so, the enormous uprising in hundreds of Chinese      cities known as the 1989 Tiananmen movement would never have      occurred. Yet the door to China remains and will remain half-     closed, because that is the way to retain power under      tyranny.       Trade alone simply cannot open the rest of China's door. If      the US Congress grants PNTR now, it legitimizes this half-     open/half-closed status. To certify Communist China as      ``normal'' in its abnormal state would deprive reformers      within the government of needed pressure to push for change.       The claim that PNTR gives American access to the ``vast      Chinese market'' is specious, because it does not exist.      Simply put, we cannot construct the ``vast Chinese market''      without first the rule-of-law being instituted, as President      Lincoln put it, ``by a government of the people, by the      people, and for the people.''       In fact, the multinational business community is making an      unholy alliance with Chinese tyranny. The Communist      government uses brutality to subjugate Chinese workers while      U.S. corporations use the threat of moving their businesses      to undercut American workers' demands. Businesses in China's      neighboring countries--Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan,      and Hong Kong--will use ``slave labor'' to China to flood the      U.S. market. PNTR is a loss-loss proposition for most workers      in Asia and America, but especially for China's. The business      community should not be so complacent, because Chinese      tyranny will redirect Chinese people's anger against them      toward the outsiders.       The majority of pro-democracy organizations are against      PNTR, yet a few prominent individuals in China have announced      their support. Why such contradiction? The question we must      ask is how much can we credit the words of kidnaped victims      when they are at the mercy of their captors? The answer is      not much. We simply cannot take the current opinions of Bao      Tong and Dai Qing to represent their true thoughts, nor can      they represent the opinions of others, when Bao and Dai have      long been in the grip of a tyrannical government.       Those who have experienced brutal oppression and insidious      threats understand their quandary. We can, and must, express      sympathy for their deplorable and excruciating plight. My      criticism is not directed at them personally, but at the      tiresome propaganda regularly doled out by the Chinese      Communist Party and their supporters in the United States.       Still, the basic principle against PNTR is very simple: if      PNTR is granted, the US surrenders its power to be a force      for positive change in China--its power to promote human      rights, to deter China's increasingly aggressive military      posture, and as well, to compel the regime to live up to its      economic promises. How can anyone call this nothing?       Wei Jingsheng has spent 18 years in prison for insisting on      speaking the truth to power.       These comments are based on Chinese government honoring its      commitment that they will do, but they don't.                                comments       There are reports of ``dissidents'' in China who support      PNTR. First, we'll know that without freedom of speech and      press, the Chinese government controls what they want Chinese      people to know. Secondly, please put yourself into their      shoes--when the hostages speak kindly of their captors and      ask you to believe what the captors say that they will follow      their promises would you believe that?                          ____________________
