Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the language found at page 15, beginning on line 9 and continuing to line 14 which begins ``That of the funds available under section 104(a)(1)(A) of title 23, United States Code'' and ending on line 14 with the words ``border safety audits.''  The language is unauthorized earmark of $13.911 million of Federal Highway Administration administrative funds for Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in violation of clause 2 rule XXI of the rules of the House of Representatives.
