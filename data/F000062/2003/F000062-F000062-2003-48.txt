 The problem is that because of the severe conditions in the State, 7 nonattainment zones, this is 17 percent of mobile sources. If we do not deal with it, we cannot meet the clean air standards and we jeopardize our highway funds.  There is the rub, so to speak. States do not have to follow. Clearly, States have followed, a large number of them. I don't know what else to do. Every State's air, as we have discussed with forests, Senator, is different. Pollution comes from different kinds of sources in every State. That is why this ability of a State, particularly one as large as California, fifth largest economic engine on Earth, should have the right to protect its people.  The concern is that EPA, (a) won't move fast enough; (b) will not do enough to severely reduce the pollution to enable California to come within its containment standards.
