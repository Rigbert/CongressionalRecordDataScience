 President, on this recent Father's Day, Dr. JohnLogan's granddaughter wanted to publicly honor his lifetime of service and success in western Kentucky. I have had the privilege to call John a friend for more than three decades, and I enjoyed reading the stories of his youth, his early medical career, and his many contributions to his community and our Commonwealth.  Growing up, John's baseball talent was apparent at an early age. In fact, he was still in middle school when he caught the local high school coach's attention. As the varsity team's catcher, John quickly stood out. One sports reporter even called him the best catcher in all western Kentucky. His skill was matched only by his passion for the game, even a broken elbow didn't stop him from playing in the 1955 State tournament.  During his senior year of high school, however, John began to hear a calling to help other people. It was a drive that took him away from the diamond and into medical school. After graduating from Western Kentucky University, John earned a rural medical scholarship to study at Vanderbilt University. His career in medicine began with a commitment to serve rural Kentucky communities most in need.  As a doctor, John and his new wife Jackie made a home in Sebree, KY, where his gifts were in high demand. Caring for Kentuckians across three counties, John quickly honed his skills and provided quality care to those in need. During his time in this small community, John learned that a physician must treat more than a patient's body. He began getting involved in a number of community organizations, and has dedicated his efforts to projects through the years to make Kentucky a better place.  Moving to Henderson and opening a private family practice, John also began working with the Henderson Fine Arts Center, the Depot on the Riverfront, and the YMCA. He worked to help provide scholarships for young people to attend college, paying forward the aid he received to fund his studies years before.  Many of Henderson's landmarks simply wouldn't exist without John's leadership. One of them, the Henderson Riverwalk, gave me a chance to join John's team to get the project done. It now bears a plaque recognizing his lasting imprint on this community. When this honor was unveiled, I was proud to recognize his life spent working for others. As he enjoys his well-deserved retirement, John continues to inspire others to contribute to their communities and improve our beloved Commonwealth.  I would like to thank Ashton Brooks Logan, John's granddaughter, for sharing these stories about his many achievements. It is my pleasure to recognize my dear friend today. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. John Logan for his years of dedication to western Kentucky, which is better because of him.  The Gleaner in Henderson, KY, recently published a profile of John's remarkable life. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Gleaner, June 15, 2019]      John Logan Went From Chasing Home Runs to Making House Calls                        (By Ashton Brooks Logan)       In the summer of 1950, there wasn't much to do in      historical Edmonson County, Kentucky, other than get a few      local kids together and enter a baseball tournament, in      Bowling Green.       ``We didn't have equipment, we didn't have uniforms, and we      didn't have a coach, we just had nine guys,'' Dr. John Logan      said recently.       But John's quick arm attracted the eye of Louis Durbin, the      Brownsville High School's baseball coach, when the team was      short a catcher.       Logan was just in the sixth grade when Coach Durbin gave      him an offer to play on their varsity team in 1951.       ``I started without a mask and I still have the scar under      my left eye to prove it,'' Logan said. Logan's passion for      baseball, paired with an eye for throwing out players who      stole second base, led him to play for the Bowling Green      American Legion team.       Even now, his eyes brighten and cheeks lift with a smile as      he talks about his time on the team. He believes his claim to      fame was the 1955 state tournament when he played three games      with a broken right elbow--without ever letting the fact on      to the other team.       ``I couldn't even warm up the pitcher. I could barely step      in front of the plate and flip it to him,'' he said. ``The      coach and I had a little plan and it was unbelievable, but it      happened.''       To his advantage, his team had already faced its opposition      in the previous year's state tournament and won. He can't      remember how many runners tried to steal second in that first      go-round, but he recalls throwing out every one of them.       Apparently they were still scared of Logan's arm.       ``Now tell me somethin','' the opposing coach said a little      later in the hotel lobby, after Logan's team won the      tournament. ``I don't recall you throwin' a single ball to      second base, you got a problem or something?''       John simply looked at him, smiled and said, ``Well, just a      broken elbow, but other that I'm fine!'       Later that year, a sports reporter wrote in a local paper      that he believed Logan was the best catcher in all of Western      Kentucky.       Logan was at a crossroads. He had a passion to play ball      but a burning drive to help those around him.       Dr. Eugene Farmer, a family physician in Brownsville took      Logan under his wing, allowing him to shadow his work at a      young age. And after transferring to Bowling Green High      School his senior year, Logan buckled down on his studies.       A week following his graduation from BGHS, he was enrolled      in summer school at Western Kentucky University in 1955. He      then went straight through undergraduate, graduating in 1957      and that fall enrolled in medical studies at Vanderbilt      University.       He was on a rural medical scholarship that clearly stated      for every year he attended school, he must spend a year in      rural Kentucky. So he settled in Sebree, Kentucky, the      Webster County hometown of his new wife, Jackie Barnett      Logan, and opened his own practice.       ``I made house calls and took care of three different      counties . . . I admitted patients to hospitals that were 16      miles away on a two-lane road,'' Logan says. ``I must have      aged 15 years in that period of time.''       He recalls times that he had no idea what he was coming up      on.       Remembering a time that a woman called him to a car      accident outside of her house, he describes jumping in his      car and riding to the scene to see a car turned over in a      ditch and hearing a child's cries.       Working his way in the ditch, he immediately saw a child's      leg hanging out of the door and thought to himself, her limb      has been severed.       Finally, after laying the child on the bank and checking      her vitals, he looks at the child's face only to realize it      was his second eldest daughter, Sarah. His initial fears were      unfounded; she walked away that day with nothing more than a      few bruises.       ``Talk about something shocking,'' Logan said. ``We dealt      with things that you never thought would happen.''       After leaving his practice in Sebree in 1967, he and Dr.      Kenneth Eblen formed a partnership to open a private family      practice in Henderson.       In 1986 Logan moved to hospital administration at Methodist      Hospital where he held the position of medical director.       During his time as medical director he started and managed      the intern and resident program among various other duties      until he retired in the spring of 2018.       Dr. Logan still has an passion for playing ball, and those      who also share a love for the sport.       While still practicing medicine in Sebree, he was      approached by a man who was interested in baseball and wanted      to better the current field in the county. Almost 50 years      later and the baseball park is still functioning, seeing      hundreds and hundreds of ball players coming through its      diamonds in the years.       ``I feel strongly that professional people, too many times,      in their own community use the excuse of not helping out in      community organizations because they are too busy,'' Logan      said.       ``(But) these things made an impact. These things made an      impression. These things help people's lives. That is what      you feel good about as well as helping people, physically.''       Logan has been deeply involved in the community of      Henderson through major projects such as the Henderson Fine      Arts Center, the Depot on the Riverfront the Riverwalk, the      YMCA, and the Colonels to College scholarship that ensures      students graduating from Henderson County High School will      get to attend two years of college.       According to Logan, baseball taught him so much more than      how to throw out the runner at second base.       ``One of the biggest things, sugar, is discipline.      Sometimes you go when you feel like you can't go but you've      to do to get job done and baseball, to me was that'' Logan      said.       ``It was a team effort to reach a certain goal and my goal      in life and what I went into medicine for, was to help      people. I've done a lot in the community that has nothing to      do with medicine because it's the same thing. I think      everybody owes something back and that, I think, is a driving      force.''       Dr. Logan is now retired and resides in Henderson with his      wife Jackie. He still serves on various charitable boards and      loves to spend time in his garden when he isn't busy catching      crappie on Barkley Lake.                            ____________________
