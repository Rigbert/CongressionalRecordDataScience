President, I come to the floor today to speak about ObamaCare and what I have long believed is a march to rationing of health care.  The ObamaCare bill and the accompanying regulations now tower over 7 feet--1 foot above where I stand--when stacked together, and they have provision after provision that will deny patients the care they want, the care they need to ensure they get the life-sustaining and lifesaving treatments that are best for them.  These rationing elements in ObamaCare have been documented by a recent report of the National Right to Life Committee's Powell Center for Medical Ethics. This study is entitled ``The Affordable Health Care Act and Health Care Access in the United States.''  Perhaps most egregious about ObamaCare is that it directly inserts the Federal Government into the personal lives of Americans, their families, and their doctors.  We all know about the individual mandate that coerces people into purchasing a product they may not want by threatening to tax them. And I have often spoken about my personal nemesis in the rationing board that I am going to bring up--the Independent Payment Advisory Board, IPAB. This is a board made up of 18--15 voting and 3 nonvoting--all unelected bureaucrats who will decide what gets to stay and what must go in Medicare coverage. They will decide which treatments and services will be covered and which will not. And there is no accountability whatsoever. It would, in fact, take a two-thirds majority of the U.S. Senate to undo any of their actions. As a result, this board diminishes our constitutional responsibility.  This President has already raided half a trillion dollars from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare, and then he gave himself the ability to go after even more Medicare dollars without any accountability. This, my friends, is frightening. It is irresponsible. But there is more.  It is conceivable that the Independent Payment Advisory Board won't just limit Medicare access; it will also propose ways for the Federal Government to limit what Americans of all ages are allowed to spend out of their own private money--not taxpayer funds--to save the lives and health of their families.  Shocking but true: ObamaCare tells bureaucrats on the board to make sure we are not even allowed to keep up with medical inflation. Further, it is conceivable that the board will suggest ways for the Federal Government to impose so-called quality and efficiency standards on doctors and hospitals with the purpose of limiting the health care we can get.  So here is the deal: If a doctor dares to give her patient treatment beyond what those standards allow, the doctor will be punished. That doctor will be excluded from all of the health insurance plans qualified under ObamaCare. Unbelievably, under ObamaCare, Washington bureaucrats can dictate one uniform standard of health care that is designed to limit what private citizens are allowed to spend out of their own money to save their own lives.  But the Independent Payment Advisory Board isn't the only rationing provision in the ObamaCare or Affordable Healthcare Act. If only. ObamaCare also has a Cadillac tax for having too much health care coverage. Patients all across America need to know there is a provision of ObamaCare that punishes them and their employer if they provide coverage that is above the arbitrary limits imposed by the Federal Government. This is an additional 40-percent tax on individuals who need more expensive treatments and coverage oftentimes essential to battle life-threatening illnesses. Even worse, these ObamaCare limits were drafted in a way they will never be able to keep up with medical inflation. This means insurance companies will have to cut back even more on patient treatments and services or people will be forced to pay an incredibly higher tax.  What about those individuals who are already suffering from life-threatening illnesses who really need the care? This is why we should pass the legislation I am offering.  Do Americans know that there is a provision in ObamaCare that lets the Federal Government--not them and not their employer--decide if coverage is ``excessive or unjustified''? This isn't government-subsidized coverage in the exchanges, nor is it the federally funded Medicare and Medicaid coverage. This is their own and their employees' private money--their money. The Federal Government is given the authority to decide if the way it is being spent is excessive or unjustified, and they are going to do it through the provision of ObamaCare that allows the Obama administration to review premiums by pressuring private insurance companies to stop offering coverage or face adverse government consequences.  So far we have talked about the private coverage, but there are also similar provisions for seniors' coverage. It wasn't bad enough that the President diverted one-half trillion dollars from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare to begin with, he also granted the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to deny private market-offered coverage for services and treatments that could save your life. Before ObamaCare these private market programs such as the prescription drug program and Medicare Advantage could allow seniors to add their own money to purchase coverage they want and need beyond what the government will pay. ObamaCare allows Washington bureaucrats to deny that choice.  Folks, this isn't how we should be treating our seniors. It isn't how we should be treating people who need access to life-saving treatment and services. This isn't how we should be treating anybody.  That is why today I come to the floor to introduce the Repeal Rationing in Support of Life Act of 2014. My legislation repeals these provisions that allow the Federal Government to intercede on very personal decisions. It repeals the provisions that authorize rationing boards to deny patients the ability to access the care that may save their lives.  This legislation is relatively simple and should be supported by all of my colleagues to address some of the egregious changes from the Affordable Care Act that patients should be aware of but that many don't even know exist. This is down the road. We are trying to stay ahead of the curve. That is why I am introducing this legislation.  This legislation builds upon my Restoring Access to Medication Act. This bill repeals the provision of ObamaCare limiting a patient's right to purchase over-the-counter products with their own money. It is also a continuation of my efforts that I discussed when introducing the Four Rationers Repeal Act many times on this floor. It repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board. It repeals the euphemistically but misleadingly named Innovation Center. It repeals the changes made to the Preventive Services Task Force and makes sure any comparative effectiveness research is used by the doctor and the patient, not coverage providers or CMS, to determine the best care for patients, not simply try to lower costs.  I really believe that in order to protect this all-important doctor-patient relationship we need to repeal and most importantly to replace ObamaCare with the real reforms that work for Kansans and all Americans. However, until we can accomplish full repeal we at least need to ensure we are protecting the life-saving care and treatment that Americans need by attacking the elements of ObamaCare that ration care, and passing the Repeal Rationing and Support of Life Act of 2014. I urge my colleagues to support this proposal and take the steps necessary to protect the lives of their constituents.                                 ______                                       By
