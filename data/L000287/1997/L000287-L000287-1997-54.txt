Mr. Speaker, the Republican con games continue, convincing the American people they are getting a tax cut by giving a majority of the tax breaks to the richest people in America; complain that the Democrats are engaged in class warfare, while the Republicans practice it.  Yesterday I spoke about Al. He works in a factory, supports his wife and two kids on his $25,000 salary, and he gets absolutely nothing from the Republican tax bill.  Today I want to tell Members about Mary. Mary is a single mom. She will struggle to raise two kids on her own. Mary works 40 hours a week as a secretary for $12 an hour. That is a little less than $25,000 a year. Mary works hard and pays thousands of dollars in taxes. What does Mary get under the Republican tax bill? Nothing. Zero. Zip.  What do Speaker Gingrich and the Republicans say about Mary? They say Mary is on welfare. Huge tax breaks for millionaires, nothing for Mary, nothing for Al. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans should come clean with the American people and tell the truth.                          ____________________
