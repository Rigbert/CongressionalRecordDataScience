Mr. Speaker, last night, in his State of the Union Address, President Clinton spoke about the ``age of possibility.'' He focused on the real issues affecting our Nation's families. Perhaps most importantly, the President extended his hand to the Republican majority and asked them to work with him, to lay down partisanship, to build a better America.  Yes, President Clinton's budget has created almost 8 million new jobs in the last 3 years and the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation rate since the 1960's. Yes, the Clinton budget has cut the deficit in half. And yes, the crime rate, the poverty rate, and the teen pregnancy rate are all down. But, President Clinton knows there is still more to be done.  President Clinton has offered a balanced budget which protects the Democratic priorities of Medicare and Medicaid, education, and the environment.  Last night, President Clinton asked the Republicans to join him to help build a better America. I hope they will heed his call.                          ____________________
