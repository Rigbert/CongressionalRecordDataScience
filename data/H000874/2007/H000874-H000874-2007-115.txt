I don't know where the other 35 Members were or are. I know there's a very important hearing going on, I haven't looked at the list expansively, a very important hearing going on that people don't want to have go on. I understand that.  But if we delay the vote, then we might as well delay the bill because we will not get it moving towards the Senate and allow the Senate to act in a timely fashion. That's the problem.
