Speaker, I rise today to mark the 75th anniversary of the Patuxent Research Refuge--established in 1936 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the nation's only National Wildlife Refuge created to support wildlife research.  Over the past 75 years, the Patuxent Research Refuge has been the site of countless advances in wildlife and applied environmental research. Scientists working on the refuge have been international leaders in natural resource conservation and their work has improved the health of animals and humans alike. Pioneering work in the field of environmental contaminants undertaken at Patuxent served as the backbone of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and research efforts at the refuge ultimately led to the banning of DDT.  Patuxent's research community has also made important contributions in the areas of migratory birds, wildlife population analysis, waterfowl harvest, habitat management, wetlands, coastal zone and flood plain management, endangered species recovery, urban wildlife, ecosystem management, and management of national parks and national wildlife refuges.  For those of us who live in this region, the Patuxent Research Refuge is more than a center for the advancement of science. It is an oasis in between two major cities--a site that gives all visitors the opportunity to immerse themselves in nature and reflect on the importance of preserving our environment. Indeed, among my proudest achievements in the Congress is helping to enable increased public access to Patuxent through the expansion of the facility from its original 2,670 acres to its present 12,841 acres.  I want to thank the staff and scientists of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey for their continued efforts to preserve this marvelous asset and advance our understanding of our environment. And I urge my colleagues to join with me in congratulating all of those gathered at Patuxent this weekend to celebrate this important milestone.                          ____________________
