 Vermont is very proud of all of the work Pat Leahy has done.  As we all know, Senator Leahy has been a champion on agriculture issues, on protecting family farmers, especially in dairy and organics. He has been a champion in fighting for civil liberties in this country. He has been a champion on environmental issues, making sure the planet we leave our kids is a clean and healthy planet. He has been a champion on women's issues, and on so many other issues.  Senator Leahy, on behalf of the people of Vermont, I want to thank you so much for your years of service.  (Applause, Senators rising.)
