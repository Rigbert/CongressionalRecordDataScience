Speaker, on April 26, President Bush stated in his weekly radio address, ``My jobs and growth plan would reduce the tax rates of everyone who pays income tax,'' ``everyone who pays income tax.''  On May 29, after the GOP tax bill, which included the provision of the President's plan, in full or in part, had been passed by Congress, now, one ought to understand that it was delivered at 8:45 p.m., a very large tax bill,all sorts of provisions that had never been seen in full by any Member of this House reported out at 8:45. We were called back at approximately 10:30. It was passed at 1:55 a.m. in the morning, in the dark of night because in my opinion the majority wanted to hide this bill. They wanted to take credit for the tax cut, but they wanted to hide the specifics of the bill.  It was signed by the President. The White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleischer, stated, ``This certainly does deliver tax relief to people who pay income taxes.''  Now, my friend, the gentleman from Texas, not the gentleman who just came on the floor but who previously spoke, a new Member of the House, reiterated that mantra, that everyone who paid taxes was going to get a reduction.  Let there be no mistake, these statements are blatantly and unabashedly wrong. As the Tax Policy Center has reported, more than 8 million lower- and middle-income taxpayers who pay billions of dollars in taxes a year will receive absolutely no tax reduction under the GOP tax bill. That figure, Mr. Speaker, includes 1.8 million taxpayers who pay more than $1,000 in income tax. They will receive no relief.  In the unkindest cut of all, 6.5 million minimum-wage families with nearly 12 million children will not receive the $400 per child increase in the child tax credit in the GOP bill. Why did that happen? It happened because they said that they were going to leave their bill at a $350 billion cut. Why? Because they needed to get some Republican members of the Senate to vote for it, and they could not get them to vote for any number larger than that.  So who do they look to to cut out? Did they look at Warren Buffett? Frankly, did they look at the gentleman from Maryland (Steny Hoyer)? I could have afforded it. No, they did not look at us. They did not look at the wealthy; they looked at the poorest Americans and cut them out of this bill.  As a matter of fact, most of us probably did not know that, and the President has now said he is going to fix it. But frankly, he did not offer it in his tax bill. The Republicans did not offer it in their tax bill that passed the House. It was a Democratic amendment offered by Senator Lincoln, adopted, and was in the conference. We all thought it was going to stay in the conference, but it was dropped in the dead of night without any Democrats in the room and unbeknownst to most Members.  Mr. Speaker, we could have extended the child tax credit to all families, as we sought, simply by limiting the reduction in the highest marginal income tax rate to 35.3 percent rather than 35 percent. We needed to pay for it, and we could have done it.  Now, that same gentleman from Texas observed that we needed to reduce the taxes because we needed to get the economy moving. We had a plan. It was fast-acting, fair to all Americans, and fiscally responsible. It did not harm us in the long term.  That plan was not allowed to be offered. The plan that was offered, however, was not fair, was not fast-acting, and is not fiscally responsible. In fact, we have gone from $5.6 trillion purported surpluses that the President told us we had to a, now, almost $3 trillion deficit, and we are going to be facing what they say is a $44 trillion deficit in the future. That will be a substantial tax increase for many children in America and many children unborn who will have to pay the interest on that incredible debt that we are incurring.  But lo and behold, in the clearest possible demonstration of the majority's values and priorities, the GOP has shown once again that when push comes to shove, it will fight for the Bush class over the working class every single time. The GOP's mantra really ought to be, leave no millionaire behind.  Mr. Speaker, on April 26th, President Bush stated in his weekly radio address: ``My jobs and growth plan would reduce the tax rates of everyone who pays income tax.''  And on May 29th, after the GOP tax bill--which included the provisions of the President's plan in full or in part--had been passed by Congress and signed by the President, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer stated: ``This certainly does deliver tax relief to people who pay income taxes.''  Mr. Speaker, let there be no mistake: These statements are brazenly, blatantly and unabashedly false. As the Tax Policy Center has reported, more than 8 million lower and middle-income taxpayers who pay billions of dollars a year in income taxes will receive absolutely no tax reduction under this GOP tax bill.  That figure includes 1.8 million taxpayers who pay more than $1,000 in income tax. What do they receive? No tax relief whatsoever. Nothing. Not a thing.  And the unkindest cut of all, 6.5 million minimum-wage families, with nearly 12 million children, will not receive the $400-per-child increase in the child tax credit in the GOP bill.  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: We could have extended the child tax credit to all families--as Democrats sought--simply by limiting the reduction in the highest marginal income tax rate to 35.3 percent rather than 35 percent.  But lo and behold, in the clearest possible demonstration of Republican values and priorities, the GOP has shown once again that when push comes to shove it will fight for the ``Bush class'' over the working class every single time. The GOP's mantra really ought to be--Leave no millionaire behind!  While minimum wage workers and their children get left out in the cold under the Republicans' tax bill, the Grand Old Party ensured that 184,000 taxpayers with incomes of more than $1 million would receive an average tax cut of $93,500.  Ladies and gentlemen, in the Republican vision for America, apparently that's what passes for compassion. And if you don't agree, well the GOP vilify you, charging that you're practicing class warfare.  Mr. Speaker, let's be honest.  Class warfare is precisely what the Republican Party has been practicing on working men and women in this country on issue after issue after issue.  The failure to provide the Child Tax Credit to minimum wage workers while fattening the bank accounts of millionaires is only the tip of the iceberg.  In this report session of the 108th Congress, the Republican majority passed a budget resolution that betrays our values and fails to meet our needs. It would take hot lunches out of the mouths of poor children; force the elderly out of nursing homes as the result of Medicaid cuts; and slash veterans' health care.  This Republican majority had to be dragged kicking and screaming not once but twice to extend unemployment insurance benefits--even as we face the highest unemployment rate in nine years and the loss of nearly 3 million private-sector jobs since George W. Bush took office.  This majority passed a Welfare Reform bill that would force mothers with children under the age of 6 to double the number of hours they must work every week. It passed a medical malpractice bill that would compound the pain of patients with the worst injuries while failing to reduce physicians' insurance premiums.  And it loaded up legislation such as the Defense Authorization bill--legislation that traditionally is overwhelmingly bipartisan--with extraneous, partisan measures that would harm the environment and strip Federal workers of their rights.  And of course, this majority has refused to close tax loopholes for offshore corporate tax havens.  It has refused to consider Democratic legislation to raise the minimum wage, which has not been increased since 1997.  And it even has refused to give the Members of this House the opportunity to vote on a Democratic amendment to increase funding for Homeland Security by $2.5 billion--a pittance compared to the costs of the GOP's unaffordable and unfair tax bill.  Meanwhile, this Republican majority refuses to address the most pressing unmet needs in America today:  The 41 million Americans who have no health insurance;  The millions of children who are eligible for Head Start but have no seat at the table; and  The millions of seniors who need and deserve a prescription drug benefit under Medicare.  On issue after issue after issue, this Republican majority has sided with powerful special interests over the interests of working Americans.  Mr. Speaker, that is certainly not the Democratic Party's vision for America. And we will never stop fighting for a positive agenda that meets the needs of all our citizens.                          ____________________
