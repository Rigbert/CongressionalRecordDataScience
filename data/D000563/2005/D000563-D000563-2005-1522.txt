President, I rise today to introduce the Welcome Home G.I. Bill. Similar to the GI Bill for soldiers returning from World War II, this Welcome Home G.I Bill establishes a program of benefits designed to reward returning veterans and ease their transition into civilian life.  These benefits would be available to troops who deployed for six months or more outside the United States for combat, contingency, peacekeeping or humanitarian operations after September 11, 2001. The bill also covers troops who do not meet the six-month service requirement because they were discharged earlier for medical or hardship reasons.  This bill provides our returning heroes with improved health care, education and job training assistance, and help with a down-payment on a home.  Returning troops deserve better health care coverage. Currently, upon separating from the military, active duty service members receive six months of healthcare coverage as a ``transition'' benefit and thereafter may enroll for an additional 18 months under the Continued Health Care Benefit Program provided they pay required premiums. Reservists released from active duty can pay premiums to obtain a year of coverage for every three months they were mobilized.  Under the Welcome Home G.I. Bill, a returning veteran who is unable to secure health care coverage from an employer would be entitled to exactly the same medical care they received while in the service. Veterans would be entitled to this benefit for up to five years.  Our troops also deserve better medical screening before and after deployments. Current law establishes a system of pre-deployment and post-deployment medical examinations, including an assessment of mental health and the drawing of blood samples, to accurately record the medical condition of members before and after their deployment.  The Welcome Home G.I. bill improves the quality of pre-deployment and post-deployment medical screening by requiring that the pre-deployment exam include disease screening and the collection of clinical data such as vital signs, immunization history and past physical or mental health conditions. It also requires post-deployment medical screening to include a self-administered survey in which the service member may report information about any relevant exposures during the period of deployment. These provisions will help identify war-related ailments so the information will be available to answer any future questions about the ailment's connection to military service.  Returning warriors need access to educational opportunities that can enhance their employment prospects in civilian life after they depart military service. Currently active duty troops have the option of enrolling in the Montgomery G.I. Bill education benefits program, under which the service member contributes $100 per month for 12 months while in service and then later may receive up to $1,004 per month in education benefits for up to 36 months. Currently, mobilized reservists receive some portion of the active duty benefit depending on the length of their activation. Under the Welcome Home G.I. Bill, our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans both active duty and mobilized reserve component troops would receive education or job training benefits worth a maximum of $75,000 over 48 months. So this bill basically adds a little more than $500 per month to the current benefit and extends it for an extra year. The benefit could also be used to repay student loans. In addition, qualifying troops who previously enrolled in the Montgomery G.I. Bill program would have their contribution refunded.  Finally, the Welcome Home G.I. Bill helps our returning veterans realize the American dream of owning their own home. For a 5-year period after completion of their qualifying service, returning veterans may receive a tax-free $5,000 down payment for the first-time purchase of a home.  Our veterans who have endured the burdens of war, under the most trying conditions, at tremendous personal risk and sacrifice, deserve more than they are currently provided by this Nation upon their return. They deserve the improved health care, education and job training, and home-ownership assistance which this bill provides. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.                                 ______
