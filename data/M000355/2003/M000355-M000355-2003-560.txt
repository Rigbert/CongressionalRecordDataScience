 LOTT. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator raises an important point on the Berzon and Paez nominations. I can remember the Senator, in his capacity as Majority Leader, encouraging us to support cloture on two judges about whom none of us were very enthusiastic. I remind my colleague that 75 percent of the Republican Senators voted for cloture.
