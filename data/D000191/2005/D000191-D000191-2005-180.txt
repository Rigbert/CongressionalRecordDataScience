Speaker, for 2 years, the Democrats in the House have been saying that the veterans budget is underfunded. It has been denied by the Bush administration. Last year we were joined by the Republican chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) who knew that the veterans budget was underfunded. For supporting us in the effort to increase veterans spending to help meet the promises and the obligations of our government and the American people to those who have served our country in its time of need, he was removed from the committee chairmanship. He was torn out of that position because he had the temerity to say there was not enough money to meet the obligations to America's veterans.  As recently as yesterday, the Republican leadership resisted a Democratic amendment on a party-line vote to increase funding for veterans benefits because they said there was no problem.  Now, today they are scrambling to find $2.6 billion that they admit the budget is underfunded, and they say, well, no, we blame the actuaries. The political hack that Bush appointed to be head of the Veterans Administration, the former Republican National Committee chair, said they did not realize there was a war in Iraq or Afghanistan. The estimates were made in 2002, and he had not read the paper since. So he did not know there were any veterans coming home who had lost their limbs, who were grievously injured. So they did not revise those things until just yesterday, when they realized they are $1 billion short for this year and $2.6 billion short for next year.  Come on. Do you think the American people believe that the Bush administration does not read the papers, does not realize we are at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, when there are tens of thousands of Americans coming home who are only asking one thing: you made me a promise when I signed up and put my life on the line. You promised you would take care of me if I was wounded, and you promised you would take care of my family if I died. That is a pretty simple promise. We have made that to every person who signed up in an all-volunteer military, and this administration has broken that promise.  I have veterans who have been waiting 6 months for an initial appointment, veterans in pain who cannot get operations, and they say, come back in 2 years, 2 years. This has been going on for years now. Two years this has been going on with this administration as they slash the veterans budget, and they deny there is a problem and suddenly they say, it was their actuaries who were wrong because they made a prediction in 2002 and the Bush administration did not notice that we were at war since then and that we had a whole lot more veterans.  This is extraordinary. An administration that wants to wrap itself in the flag and talk about supporting the troops who is not willing to put up the money to deliver on the solemn promises that we have made to these veterans and to their dependents and to their families. This is outrageous. And just yesterday, they defeated, on a party-line vote, an amendment just to put $1 billion back in and take that money from the millionaires and billionaires in America, to reduce their tax cuts from $141,000 to $129,000 a year. Most Americans do not even earn that, but the Republicans could not even vote to reduce the millionaires' tax cuts that much to fully fund for this year, not next year, veterans benefits. We are going to need a lot more money next year for veterans who are going to need services. It is going to be very expensive to meet our promises and our obligations.  It is time that this administration and this Republican-led Congress acted in good faith to fully fund those benefits. No more denial of medical services and benefits to veterans because we say we do not have enough money. We have the money if we can restrict the permanent tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires to give to our Nation's veterans, those who have given so much in service to our country.                          ____________________[Page H5470]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]         IN SUPPORT OF FULLY FUNDING THE NEEDS OF OUR VETERANS
