President, I rise today together with my distinguished colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, to introduce legislation to designate the United States Post Office facility at 3750 North Kedzie Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, as the ``Daniel J. Doffyn Post Office Building.''  This legislation honors the service and heroism of Daniel Doffyn, a 40-year-old rookie officer with the Chicago Police Department, who was fatally shot in the line of duty two years ago.  On the afternoon of March 8, 1995, Daniel Doffyn and his partner, Milan ``Mike'' Bubalo, who had just completed their regular shift, responded to a report of a burglary in progress. What they encountered, in broad daylight, just a few steps away from the Austin precinct house on Chicago's West Side, were three gun-wielding gang members hiding in an apartment. Believing the officers to be there to arrest them for their involvement in an earlier gang shooting, the trio panicked and tried to escape through a window.  After capturing one suspect, Doffyn was shot in the head and chest by a second man, who opened fire with a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol, one of the 19 assault weapons banned under the 1994 Federal law. Officer Doffyn died in surgery later that evening. In the barrage of gunfire, Officer Bubalo was seriously wounded in the thigh, and has an artificial left hip as a result of the shooting.  Officer Doffyn tragically lost his life in the course of performing a job that he truly loved, less than a year after graduating from the Chicago Police Academy, following a three-year quest to fulfill a dream to protect and serve his community. If someone needed help, Danny Doffyn was the first one there. In the words of District Commander LeRoy O'Shield, ``he exemplified the very finest the police department has to offer. He was not assigned this job but responded to it.''  The post office sought to be designated is in the neighborhood where Officer Doffyn, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor for his ultimate sacrifice, resided with his parents, bicycled and roller skated with his eight-year-old daughter, Brittany, and donned his blue uniform and police star #14030 with pride.  We trust our colleagues will agree that this designation is a worthy tribute to salute the life and courage of Daniel Doffyn, and to pay respect to the thousands of men and women in law enforcement careers who risk their lives every single day striving to keep our citizens, streets, and sidewalks safe.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1886       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
