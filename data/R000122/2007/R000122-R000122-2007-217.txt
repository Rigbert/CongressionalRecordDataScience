President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Coleman, in introducing the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act.  This bipartisan legislation seeks to achieve several important goals in our battle against childhood cancer. Specifically, it will expand support for pediatric cancer research, foster the career development of more pediatric oncologists, establish a population-based national childhood database, and provide essential information and support to help families dealing with this devastating disease. Childhood cancer impacts thousands of children and their families each year. While we have made great strides in treating cancer, we have made relatively little progress in advancing our understanding of the most common forms of pediatric cancer. This legislation will provide the focus and resources to hopefully one day find a cure.  Each year, more than 12,500 children are diagnosed with cancer, and more than 2,300 of them lose their courageous battle with the disease. Pediatric cancer not only takes a toll on the child, it affects the entire family--the parents, siblings, friends, and extended family all suffer when a child has cancer. I have had the honor of meeting one such family from Warwick, RI who has taken the pain and devastation of losing their nine year old son to neuroblastoma, a very aggressive childhood cancer, and turned their tragedy into a message of hope. The Haight family is committed, in memory of their son Ben, to providing education, advocacy, and support to other families going through a similar struggle with pediatric cancer. I never had a chance to meet Ben Haight but his mother Nancy has told me of his passion for life and his tremendous sense of strength and courage. Ben fought every day during his four and a half year battle with this disease and his tragic story highlights the importance of this legislation.  It is my hope that the bill we are introducing today will help to step up our efforts with regard to childhood cancer so that one day Ben's story, and thousands of other children like him, will be one of survival. In Rhode Island alone, about eight children each year succumb to various forms of childhood cancer. Each of these children had hopes, dreams, and desires that will never be fulfilled and one cannot quantify the impact each of these children could have had on their communities and on society as a whole. We need to be doing more to give these children a chance to grow up and reach their full potential. It is expected that by 2010 one out of 350 adults will be a survivor of childhood cancer.  The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act will build the foundation necessary to enhance federal efforts in the fight against childhood cancer and will also complement the incredible work of the network of organizations around the country dedicated to the prevention and cure of pediatric cancer.  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward swift passage of this important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 911       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Conquer Childhood Cancer Act      of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Cancer kills more children than any other disease.       (2) Each year cancer kills more children between 1 and 20      years of age than asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and      AIDS, combined.       (3) Every year, over 12,500 young people are diagnosed with      cancer.       (4) Each year about 2,300 children and teenagers die from      cancer.       (5) One in every 330 Americans develops cancer before age      20.       (6) Some forms of childhood cancer have proven to be so      resistant that even in spite of the great research strides      made, most of those children die. Up to 75 percent of the      children with cancer can now be cured.       (7) The causes of most childhood cancers are not yet known.       (8) Childhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood      cells (leukemias), brain, bone, the lymphatic system, and      tumors of the muscles, kidneys, and nervous system. Each of      these behaves differently, but all are characterized by an      uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells.       (9) Eighty percent of the children who are diagnosed with      cancer have disease which has already spread to distant sites      in the body.       (10) Ninety percent of children with a form of pediatric      cancer are treated at one of the more than 200 Children's      Oncology Group member institutions throughout the United      States.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       It is the purpose of this Act to authorize appropriations      to--       (1) encourage and expand the support for biomedical      research programs of the existing National Cancer Institute-     designated multicenter national infrastructure for pediatric      cancer research;       (2) establish a population-based national childhood cancer      database (the Children's Cancer Research Network) to evaluate      incidence trends of childhood cancers and to enable the      investigations of genetic epidemiology in order to identify      causes to aid in development of prevention strategies;       (3) provide informational services to patients and families      affected by childhood cancer;       (4) support the development, construction, and operation of      a comprehensive online public information system on childhood      cancers and services available to families; and       (5) establish a fellowship program in pediatric cancer      research to foster clinical and translational research career      development in pediatric oncologists in the early stages of      their career.     SEC. 4. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH AND AWARENESS.       Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the Public Health      Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by adding at      the end the following:     ``SEC. 417E.
