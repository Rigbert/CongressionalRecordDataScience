Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the chairman, Chairman Shuster, from Pennsylvania; subcommittee chairman Mr. Denham; and the ranking member serving on our side, Mike Capuano, for a bill that is an okay bill.  This is in the tradition, the greatest tradition, of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which we have differences, as the chairman pointed out, over the future of rail and the funding levels that are needed, but there is consensus that this is important to the country, and we can continue that debate as we continue to improve the operations of Amtrak.  An awful lot of the focus is on the Northeast corridor. That is essentially the ``cash cow.'' In the Northeast corridor now in the rail-air market, 78 percent of the D.C.-New York travelers are now using the train. That is a success story. There is a lot of focus on that, but Amtrak is bigger than that. We are a large nation.  I remember after 9/11, when I had a Federal official here from my region, head of the Bonneville Power Administration, and he needed to get back for some important meetings in the West, he took the train. There was no plane option.  Maintaining a national network, I believe, is essential. We need to keep that perspective in mind as we look at Amtrak as a whole, not just a corridor in one of the most populated parts of the country.  In the West, we have two long-distance trains: the Coast Starlight from Seattle through Portland, Eugene, down to Los Angeles; and the Empire Builder, which starts in Seattle and Portland, converges in Spokane--kind of a unique route--and continues on to Chicago.  We also have a State-supported route in Oregon, which is an international route. It goes from Eugene, Oregon, to Vancouver, British Columbia. Ridership last year was almost up to 1 million on that route, as Interstate 5 becomes more and more problematic and congested, particularly over the line in Washington State. These are essential assets to give people an alternative.  I would also say that we need to be planning for a better future. Last year, Oregon did get about a $20 million grant through the Intercity Passenger Rail grant program to finish planning and preliminary engineering work for the possibility of a higher-speed route--not high speed. Unfortunately, that is not in the cards in the near future.  We have a wonderful train set, an Acela train set, which can travel a lot faster than it can now because of the current routing and congestion. We are planning on doing that, working cooperatively with the freight railroads and also looking at some alternative routes for at least part of that train.  I would also point out that this bill, the railroads themselves, the freight railroads, which the chairman mentioned, are investing a phenomenal amount of money in upgrading their track, their systems, and their power; but there are still a lot of projects that are undone and don't have potential revenue sources, particularly for the short lines.                              {time}  1245  I am really pleased that this bill streamlines the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program, RRIF. It sounds like something my dog would say. In any case, this is sort of a very infinitely bureaucratic and lengthy process. The bill requires that the loans be done within 45 days of getting a complete application, and it also contains strong Buy America provisions. It will be all American steel, iron, and manufactured goods. I think that is an improvement on two levels, and that is a needed change.  Finally, as the chairman said, there are some of us on this side of the aisle who believe we should be making more investment so that Amtrak can have a program to acquire more power, so it can make improvements on some of the very aged and decrepit parts of the Neck here and in other places where they have critical infrastructure needs around the country. That was not to be in this bill, but this bill does leave us that option in the future. I strongly--and I believe most on this side of the aisle will strongly--support this legislation.  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.
