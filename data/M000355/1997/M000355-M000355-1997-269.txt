 President, let me say again we are not going to set the time for the Smith amendment now until we have had further consultation with the Democratic Cloakroom, but in all likelihood there would be two votes at 12:30, one on the Smith amendment and the other on final passage of energy and water.                 Amendment No. 889 to Amendment No. 888
