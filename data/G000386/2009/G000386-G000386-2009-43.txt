  We have to pass the Defense appropriations bill.  We have to decide what is going to happen with the death tax. The estate tax is going to end at the end of this year. Next year, there is not going to be any estate tax. I don't think anybody wants that situation to happen because it is only going to happen for 1 year, so we need to do something on estate tax.  The highway bill needs to be reauthorized or extended.  The PATRIOT Act has to be extended because at least three parts of it expire, and if they are not reinstituted, a lot of the work of the FBI tracking terrorists is going to be impossible.  We have several tax provisions--73, to be exact--that are extended from time to time. They need to be extended.  Doctors are going to take a 23-percent cut in their reimbursement under Medicare if we don't do something about it.  The Federal Aviation Administration needs to be reauthorized, and maybe the Satellite Home Viewers Act needs to be reauthorized, all between now and the end of the year.
