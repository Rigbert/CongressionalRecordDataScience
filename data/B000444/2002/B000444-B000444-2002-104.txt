S. Senator. He has stuck me in the mud, dirtied by political campaigns. He has sketched me swimming in an inner tube fighting for NATO's involvement in Bosnia. He has put me in my place in, an over-sized Chair to characterize my position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has donned me in a wizard's robe next to a giant cooking pot simmering over a fire.  Yes, today I rise to salute a man whose signature is a talking frog.  Today I rise to salute a man who has made me laugh nearly every morning that I have opened my local newspaper for nearly the past 40 years and flipped to the editorial page.  Today I rise to salute long-time News Journal editorial cartoonist Jack Jurden.  After nearly four decades of his whimsical, witty, thought-provoking, light-hearted, good-natured sketches, Jack Jurden is retiring. He is not quite putting his pencils and paper in a drawer permanently. Fortunately for us in Delaware, he has promised to produce a few editorial cartoons a year. But I and so many daily readers of Delaware's largest newspaper will miss his black and white sketches that have added so much color and laughter to our lives.  Jack joined the News Journal in 1952 as a photo engraver. His real love was drawing, so the News Journal decided to take a chance on him as the editorial Cartoonist. In my opinion, that is the best decision that newspaper ever made.  Jack's start in the newspaper business started long before his career with the News Journal. Like many of us, as a kid growing up, Jack was a newspaper delivery boy. Fresh out of high school in Allentown, PA, he put his artistic talents on hold to serve his country in World War II. As an army soldier, he was stationed in the Philippines and in occupied Japan.  Over the years, I am very fortunate to have gotten to know Jack well. His love for his craft, his country and his community are surpassed only by his love and loyalty to his family: his wife of 50 years, Faye; his daughter Jenifer and his daughter Jan, who is a Superior Court Judge in Delaware. These days Jack's true love is his grandchildren.  I realize this is not your typical Senate tribute. But I so admire this man and his talent that I have many of his cartoons lampooning me framed in my office and in my home. So I will miss him. And I think I speak for thousands of others in Delaware who have laughed heartily every morning with their coffee, their coworkers and their family as they scan his take on events in our State and our world, always looking for that little talking frog in the corner to offer some words of wisdom.  My very best wishes to him and his family.                          ____________________
