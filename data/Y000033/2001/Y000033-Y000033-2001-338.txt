Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I regret that I had to reserve the point of order on this good amendment. I am not opposed to this amendment. As a matter of fact, I could identify to the Members of the House far more needs in our national defense than even the Skelton amendment covers.
