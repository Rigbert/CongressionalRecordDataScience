 President, I rise today to pay tribute to our colleague, our friend, and a great statesman, Senator Ted Stevens.  It is a somber day in the Senate Chamber as we continue to mourn his loss.  Senator Stevens' service to our Nation began during his military service during World War II as a ``Flying Tiger,'' and spanned six decades.  During his 41 years in the Senate, Senator Stevens has been chairman of four full committees and two select committees, assistant Republican whip, and the President pro tempore Emeritus.  As one of the most effective Senators, Senator Stevens was an ardent supporter of our national defense, serving as either Chairman or Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee from 1980 to 2005. A champion of our Armed Forces, he ensured that our servicemembers have the equipment, training, and pay necessary to be prepared to take on those who threaten our national security.  Senator Stevens was not only my distinguished colleague but someone I considered a friend. He was a man of purpose whose life touched all those with whom he came in contact. His commitment to the people of Alaska was remarkable, making him a legendary advocate for the State. No one has done more for Alaska than he did. His many contributions to both Alaska and our Nation will not soon be forgotten.  He will be remembered as a dedicated American, World War II warrior, a public servant, and the quintessential American statesman who gave so much of his life in service to the Nation.  I offer my thoughts and prayers his family and friends during this difficult time.
