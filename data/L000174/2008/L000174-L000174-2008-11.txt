President, I rise today to highlight an emerging rural economic model that some say serves as the perfect example of how rural America can survive and thrive in today's global markets.  My good friend Marian Burros recently wrote an article in the New York Times highlighting the sustainable agricultural economy of Hardwick, VT, and Hardwick's surrounding communities. These Northeast Kingdom communities have begun attracting the attention of local, regional and national media after the area began attracting some unique characters with great ideas. From a community-owned restaurant to renowned cheese makers, Hardwick and its surrounding towns are at the center of an experiment in social agricultural entrepreneurship.  I ask unanuimous consent that the text of Marian Burros October 8, 2008, New York Times article entitled ``Uniting Around Food to Save an Ailing Town'' be printed in the Record to allow my colleagues an opportunity to hear about the future of Vermont.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Uniting Around Food To Save an Ailing Town       Hardwick, VT--This town's granite companies shut down years      ago and even the rowdy bars and porno theater that once      inspired the nickname ``Little Chicago'' have gone.       Facing a Main Street dotted with vacant stores, residents      of this hardscrabble community of 3,000 are reaching into its      past to secure its future, betting on farming to make      Hardwick the town that was saved by food.       With the fervor of Internet pioneers, young artisans and      agricultural entrepreneurs are expanding aggressively,      reaching out to investors and working together to create a      collective strength never before seen in this seedbed of      Yankee individualism.       Rob Lewis, the town manager, said these enterprises have      added 75 to 100 jobs to the area in the past few years.       Rian Fried, an owner of Clean Yield Asset Management in      nearby Greensboro, which has invested with local agricultural      entrepreneurs, said he's never seen such cooperative effort.       ``Across the country a lot of people are doing it      individually but it's rare when you see the kind of      collective they are pursuing,'' said Mr. Fried, whose firm      considers social and environmental issues when investing.      ``The bottom line is they are providing jobs and making it      possible for others to have their own business.''       In January, Andrew Meyer's company, Vermont Soy, was      selling tofu from locally grown beans to five customers;      today he has 350. Jasper Hill Farm has built a $3.2-million      aging cave to finish not only its own cheeses but also those      from other cheesemakers.       Pete Johnson, owner of Pete's Greens, is working with 30      local farmers to market their goods in an evolving community      supported agriculture program.       ``We have something unique here: a strong sense of      community, connections to the working landscape and a great      work ethic,'' said Mr. Meyer, who was instrumental in moving      many of these efforts forward.       He helped start the Center for an Agricultural Economy, a      nonprofit operation that is planning an industrial park for      agricultural businesses.       Next year the Vermont Food Venture Center, where producers      can rent kitchen space and get business advice for adding      value to raw ingredients, is moving to Hardwick from Fairfax,      40 miles west, because, Mr. Meyer said, ``it sees the benefit      of being part of the healthy food system.'' He expects it to      assist 15 to 20 entrepreneurs next year.       ``All of us have realized that by working together we will      be more successful as businesses,'' said Tom Stearns, owner      of High Mowing Organic Seeds. ``At the same time we will      advance our mission to help rebuild the food system, conserve      farmland and make it economically viable to farm in a      sustainable way.''       Cooperation takes many forms. Vermont Soy stores and cleans      its beans at High Mowing, which also lends tractors to High      Fields, a local compositing company. Byproducts of High      Mowing's operation--pumpkins and squash that have been      smashed to extract seeds--are now being purchased by Pete's     Greens and turned into soup. Along with 40,000 pounds of      squash and pumpkin, Pete's bought 2,000 pounds of High      Mowing's cucumbers this year and turned them into pickles.       For the past two years, many of these farmers and      businessmen have met informally once a month to share      experiences for business planning and marketing or pass on      information about, say, a graphic designer who did good work      on promotional materials or government officials who've been      particularly helpful. They promote one another's products at      trade fairs and buy equipment at auctions that they know      their colleagues need.       More important, they share capital. They've lent each other      about $300,000 in short-term loans. When investors visited      Mr. Stearns over the summer, he took them on a tour of his      neighbors' farms and businesses.       To expand these enterprises further, the Center for an      Agricultural Economy recently bought a 15-acre property to      start a center for agricultural education. There will also be      a year-round farmers' market (from what began about 20 years      ago as one farmer selling from the trunk of his car on Main      Street) and a community garden, which started with one plot      and now has 22, with a greenhouse and a paid gardening      specialist.       Last month the center signed an agreement with the      University of Vermont for faculty and students to work with      farmers and food producers on marketing, research, even      transportation problems. Already, Mr. Meyer has licensed a      university patent to make his Vermont Natural Coatings, an      environmentally friendly wood finish, from whey, a byproduct      of cheesemaking.       These entrepreneurs, mostly well educated children of baby      boomers who have added business acumen to the idealism of the      area's long established hippies and homesteaders, are in the      right place at the right time. The growing local-food      movement, with its concerns about energy usage, food safety      and support for neighbors, was already strong in Vermont, a      state that the National Organic Farmers' Association said had      more certified organic acreage per capita than any other.       Mr. Meyer grew up on a dairy farm in Hardwick and worked in      Washington as an agricultural aide to former Senator Jim      Jeffords of Vermont. ``From my time in Washington,'' Mr.      Meyer said, ``I recognize that if Vermont is going to have a      future in agriculture we need to look at what works in      Vermont, and that is not commodity agriculture.''       The brothers Mateo and Andy Kehler have found something      that works quite well at their Jasper Hill Farm in nearby      Greensboro. At first they aged their award-winning cheeses in      a basement. Then they began aging for other cheesemakers.      Earlier this month they opened their new caves, with space      for 2 million pounds of cheese, which they buy young from      other producers.       The Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese at the University      of Vermont is helping producers develop safety and quality      programs, with costs split by Jasper Hill and the producers.      ``Suddenly being a cheesemaker in Vermont becomes viable,''      Mateo Kehler said.       Pete Johnson began a garden when he was a boy on his      family's land. Now his company, Pete's Greens, grows organic      crops on 50 acres in Craftsbury, about 10 miles north of      here. He has four moveable greenhouses, extending the growing      season to nine months, and he has installed a commercial      kitchen that can make everything from frozen prepared foods      and soup stocks to baked goods and sausages. In addition he      has enlarged the concept of the C.S.A. by including 30      farmers and food producers rather than just a single farm.       ``We have 200 C.S.A. participants so we've become a fairly      substantial customer of some of these businesses,'' he said.      ``The local beef supplier got an order for $700 this week;      that's pretty significant around here. We've encouraged the      apple producer who makes apple pies to use local flour, local      butter, local eggs, maple sugar as well as the apples so now      we have a locavore apple pie.''       ``Twelve years ago the market for local food was      lukewarm,'' Mr. Johnson added. ``Now this state is primed for      anything that is local. It's a way to preserve our villages      and rebuild them.''       Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Stearns of High Mowing Organic Seeds      in Wolcott, who is president of the Center, knew he wanted to      get into agriculture when he was a boy. His company, which      grew from his hobby of collecting seeds, began in 2000 with a      two-page catalog that generated $36,000 in sales. Today he      has a million-dollar business, selling seeds all over the      United States.       Woody Tasch, chairman of Investors Circle, a nonprofit      network of investors and foundations dedicated to      sustainability, said: ``What the Hardwick guys are doing is      the first wave of what could be a major social      transformation, the swinging back of the pendulum from      industrialization and globalization.''       Mr. Tasch is having a meeting in nearby Grafton next month      with investors, entrepreneurs, nonprofit groups,      philanthropists and officials to discuss investing in Vermont      agriculture.       Here in Hardwick, Claire's restaurant, sort of a clubhouse      for farmers, began with investments from its neighbors. It is      a Community Supported Restaurant. Fifty investors who put in      $1,000 each will have the money repaid through discounted      meals at the restaurant over four years.       ``Local ingredients, open to the world,'' is the motto on      restaurant's floor-to-ceiling windows. ``There's Charlie who      made the bread tonight,'' Kristina Michelsen, one of four      partners, said in a running commentary one night, identifying      farmers and producers at various tables. ``That's Pete from      Pete's Greens. You're eating his tomatoes.''       Rosy as it all seems, some worry that as businesses grow      larger the owners will be tempted to sell out to companies      that would not have Hardwick's best interests at heart.       But the participants have reason to be optimistic: Mr.      Stearns said that within one week six businesses wanted to      meet with him to talk about moving to the Hardwick area.       ``Things that seemed totally impossible not so long ago are      now going to happen,'' said Mr. Kehler. ``In the next few      years a new wave of businesses will come in behind us. So      many things are possible with collaboration.''                          ____________________
