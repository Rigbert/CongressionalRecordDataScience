 President, the appropriation measure before us includes $363 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service. In addition, the Committee recommendation allows for the administration's proposed increased of 58 full-time equivalents [FTE's] for the National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS]. The Committee directs the NMFS to use as many available FTE's as are needed to ensure the full and timely implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Magnuson-Stevens Act was reauthorized in the 104th Congress after a long and difficult process of negotiation and compromise. It includes many new provisions to improve the conservation and management of this Nation's fishery resources. I appreciate the tremendous task the NMFS faces in fully implementing all of the new provisions and requirements we placed on the NMFS and share the committee's desire to see adequate FTE's allocated to this important task.  I am also concerned, however, about the very real need for FTE's to implement the requirements of the Endangered Species Act [ESA], particularly in the Pacific Northwest. With several salmon species already listed under the ESA and an elaborate recovery plant currently being implemented with a critical decision point rapidly approaching, with habitat conservation plans being negotiated with public utility districts in central Washington, and additional ESA listings likely coming in the future, the NMFS is in desperate need of both resources and personnel to meet its obligations. I appreciate the committee's willingness to fund NMFS efforts in these areas at or above the President's requested levels. These funds will go along way toward salmon recovery efforts throughout the entire Pacific coast. I would like to emphasize the need for adequate FTE's to be provided to this important effort. While the committee has correctly directed FTE's to the implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, this allocation should not come at the expense of the agency's ability to undertake salmon recovery efforts in the Pacific Northwest. Both of these responsibilities of the NMFS are vitally important to Washington State and the Pacific Northwest. I urge the NMFS to meet the real need for FTE's in both of these areas.                          ____________________
