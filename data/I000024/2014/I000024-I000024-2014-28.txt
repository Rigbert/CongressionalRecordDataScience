President, with all the things that are going on right now, I am particularly interested in the hearing we had yesterday on ISIS. It was a big deal. I applaud General Dempsey for his honesty in talking about how serious this war is that we are embarking on right now. The fact is that we have a mess, and ISIS has tripled in the last 3 months, up to now well over 30,000 troops, with tanks, heavy artillery.  This is not--I know the President has tried to make people believe this is just another rag-tag terrorist operation like Al Qaeda or the Taliban. It is not. This is war. This is a real serious thing that we are in the middle of.  I do applaud General Dempsey and also Secretary Hagel for their honesty in the committee hearing. It was difficult for them when the President talks about no troops on the ground, no troops on the ground. We know we already have troops on the ground.  I think the American people have had a wake-up call. I believe they understand how serious it is. In fact, there were two polls out last week. One of them was a poll that 70 percent of the American people know how serious this is and that ISIS could affect and would affect and is affecting our homeland. That was a big thing, that 70 percent of the people in America understand that. Just yesterday the Wall Street Journal poll came out, along with ABC, and they said the same thing: 70 percent of the people know this is something that affects our homeland.  When they talk about troops on the ground--I remember asking the question during the hearing yesterday. I said to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey: If the President said no troops on the ground, what if your airstrikes--if something happens to one of those planes and we have the problem that one of the pilots is bailing out. Are you saying that we do not have troops on the ground to ensure his or her safety?  He said: Absolutely we will.  So the point is that has been a question that people have to understand, that this is war. We have to win it. We can't take another chance.                     The Economy And Overregulation  But that is not why I am here. I think because of the distraction of ISIS and all of these other things, a lot of people have forgotten the serious problems that are hampering our economy; that is, what this President has done through the overregulation that takesplace. Since he first took office and failed to achieve his signature cap-and-trade legislation, he has been working tirelessly to try to do what he couldn't do through legislation with regulation. The regulations received most of the attention because they are the most expensive.  I first started in 2003, and I remember so much in the Senate. In 2003, at that time Republicans had a majority. I was the chair of the committee that had the jurisdiction. They started off in 2003 with the first cap-and-trade legislation, and we defeated it. We defeated it ever since that time. One reason we defeated it was I was able to find out--and I didn't know this in the beginning--that people said: Global warming is real, there are all these bad things, and we are all going to die.  Yet from the costs we determined--and this came not just from me but from others who were interested, but universities such as MIT came out with a study, the Wharton School of Economics came out with one, and Charles River Associates. They all had the cost of this cap-and-trade somewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.  Every time I hear a large figure, I look at the population in my State of Oklahoma and see what that cost means to a family. In my State of Oklahoma, $300 billion to $400 billion a year would be a permanent tax increase for the average family in Oklahoma--that files a Federal income tax--of $3,000 a year.  When we get to these numbers, we look and we realize this is going to be very expensive and no one wants anything to do with greenhouse regulations when the cost is so high.  I will show later on that it wouldn't accomplish anything, anyway. That is probably why the recent polls, such as the Gallup poll on global warming, have it on the bottom of the national priority list. Their last poll is a poll of 15 things to be most concerned about, and global warming and climate change registered No. 14 out of 15.  The people have understood--it is as if they understand now what is going on with ISIS. They know what the truth is.  The Pew Research Center showed that 53 percent of Americans either don't believe that global warming and climate change are occurring or they say if it is, it is natural causes.  This has been going on. This is what has bothered me. I can remember--and I am going from memory now--but I used to use the example, back when we first started looking at this subject, as to how this is a cyclone that has been going on for recorded history.  In 1895, we were in a cooling period, basically. They were referring to it as the little ice age at that time--I could be wrong. But, anyway, that endured until 1918. Then in 1918, it turned into a warming time and that went all the way up through 1945.  This is what is significant. In 1945, we started another cooling period. It happened that 1945 was the year that was recorded as the year when it had the highest amount of CO2 emissions, and that precipitated not a warming period but a cooling period. Of course, that went on up to about 1975 when we went to the other side, where we have actually entered into a cooling area. Everybody knows that.  God is still up there. We have always had these seasons. People would like to think somehow it is man who is doing it. They don't want any progress. They don't want people to be able to generate electricity and energy to take care of our needs.  While my friends on the other side of the aisle act as though public debate has been settled on the issue, obviously it is just the opposite of that. It probably explains why it has been difficult for Tom Steyer to raise the full $100 million he promised to help Democrats win elections this fall.  We remember in February that he announced he would put up $50 million of his own money--and then he did--and that he would raise another $50 million. It would be $100 million that he would put in campaigns for incumbents who would agree to try to resurrect the global warming issue--because it has died in the eyes of the American people--and try to stop the pipeline.  He did this, and the trouble is he is not able to raise the other $50 million. The last count was it is only $1.7 million he has been able to raise from outside donors. Nonetheless, of course, he has his own $50 million. Regardless, we know he is spending the money he has, even though he hasn't raised other money.  We can see on this chart a quote where he said--that is a picture of Tom Steyer. He is not a bad guy and all of that, he is just far left, and he has a lot of money. He said:       It is true that we expect to be heavily involved in the      midterm elections. . . . we are looking at a bunch of . . .      races. . . . My guess is that we'll end up being involved in      eight or more races.  So Tom Steyer's goal is, as I said, to try to resurrect the global warming issue and try to stop the Keystone Pipeline.  I think it is an appropriate time to talk about the hypocrisy on the left over political spending. We spent all of last week debating a constitutional amendment to limit political speech that is currently protected under the First Amendment. Democrats are talking about the Koch brothers, and people are not aware that this type of activity was from a man named Tom Steyer, by his own admission.  Someone asked me the other day--I think we were on the floor. I was the only Republican to come down. It was kind of fun. They were having their all-night session. I made the statement: If there is anyone with insomnia at home who is not asleep yet, this is a good way to do it. I made the comment that this is something we know is going on.  I stated that with all these races that are out there, they are trying to do something in order to elect people to try to go back to what they failed to be able to get. I think it is an appropriate time to get through that hypocrisy.  Recent news reports have surfaced and described the Democracy Alliance. That is an organization that aims to organize the policy objectives and funding streams of the leftwing liberal establishment.  According to an internal memo that was leaked to the press a few weeks ago, the Democracy Alliance for the past 9 years ``has aligned donors, leaders in the progressive movement, [that is liberal] and political infrastructure in order to achieve victories at the ballot box and in policy fights including those for comprehensive health care reform, Supreme Court confirmations . . . ''  This influence is estimated to be between $600 million and $700 million.  The Washington Post recently had this chart. It is kind of hard to read, but in the Post it was obvious because each one of those dots is a liberal political organization. They all joined together and that is called the Democracy Alliance.  Again, this was 161 plus 21--182 organizations are part of this alliance. It details all of their agendas and how they are being coordinated by the political Democratic agenda by the Democracy Alliance. We will recognize most of the names on the list. It includes the Center for American Progress, Media Matters for America, America Votes, and even Organizing for Action which, incidentally, is President Obama's political campaign arm.  In April, this group convened a secret meeting in Chicago to huddle with its deep-pocketed donors to craft a strategy in messaging for this coming year's elections. It was shrouded in secrecy, and the memo prepared for attendees--all the people on this list who were coming in to meet in Chicago--warned them of interacting with political reporters. In fact, it included a pages-long list of reporters who are expected to try to crash the conference, along with the photos, so folks could be on the watch for these people.  The names of the people attending and involved were not going to be disclosed to the public, nor would any details be released about the discussions that were taking place.  Tom Steyer and the Democracy Alliance are acting like a cult, even as the Democratic left pushes for the institution of a new constitutional amendment. We now know that initiative was nothing more than a political sham.  At the end of the day, the liberal left wants an aggressive, secretive, political machine operating on its behalf, and it looks as though they have what they need in the Democracy Alliance.  The key selling point for the Democracy Alliance pitch to its contributors is the inseparable link to the deep connections with the Obama White House administration. The Democracy Alliance firmly believes it is in the driver'sseat when it comes to setting policy for liberals in Washington, and it wants its donors to know it.  There is nothing wrong with this. We have had differences of opinion and philosophy, and that is why we have political parties. This is more extreme than anything I have seen and more organized.  One of the key goals of the Democracy Alliance is to promote ``an environment that keeps our kids safe.'' This explains why the administration continues to push an extremist agenda of environmental mandates that will crush our economy.  This is where Tom Steyer has really succeeded in being part of the Democracy Alliance. He has managed to convince Democrats in the Senate to hold more than one all-night vigil on global warming, and these have come as the United States has been enduring one of its coldest years yet.  Just this month so far, NOAA, of the Commerce Department, has reported 246 record cold temperatures. Wyoming already has right now 20 inches of snow in some places, and it is unseasonably cold in Washington, DC.  One of these colder areas, my city of Tulsa, OK, on Saturday set a record cool high temperature. It only reached 65 degrees. It has never happened before, so it is not cooperating very well with trying to convince people the world is coming to an end because of global warming.  It also explains why the President is continuing to aggressively try to implement greenhouse regulations after failing to accomplish this goal legislatively. These regulations will effectively prevent any coal-fired powerplant from being constructed and force our Nation into relying substantially on expensive renewable resources.  Regulations such as these would take us in the direction of Europe, which in many instances has experienced electricity prices three times as high as they are in the United States. They have been ahead of us in trying to stop fossil fuels and in trying to stop nuclear energy. The rates their people are paying are now three times higher than ours.  If anyone doubts these rules will have a negative impact on our economy, just look at Australia. Australia imposed a carbon tax on their economy a few years ago and it caused horrendous damage. It caused $9 billion in lost economic activity per year and destroyed tens of thousands of jobs. This is in Australia. This just happened. It was so bad that the government in Australia recently voted to repeal the carbon tax. Remember all the talk about the fact: Oh, Australians are leading the way and they are going to have a carbon tax, we should be following them. Now they have repealed that by an overwhelming vote and their economy is now better for it. In fact, it was announced last week that Australia experienced record job growth last month of 121,000 jobs. They said this is because they have repealed this carbon tax they had passed. They credit this success to the repeal of the carbon tax in addition to these greenhouse regulations.  I think it is important for us to recall the many other regulations this Obama administration has already imposed on the American people and discuss all of the new regulations that have not yet come out, but they are working on it. Some of these regulations they are holding off until after the elections so the people would not know the cost of the regulations and how many jobs are going to be lost.  The first we need to remember is Utility MACT. By the way, MACT means maximum achievable controlled technology. In other words, what technology has told us we could do to try to control these releases.  Utility MACT was the first one they successfully passed. In this case, the EPA established a standard that was impossible for utilities to actually meet.  This regulation is inappropriate under the Clean Air Act, and it is having a $100 billion annual impact on the economy and destroying 1.65 million jobs. They have already done it. They were able to pass it along party lines.  The EPA has already finalized similar regulations for industrial boilers and cement kilns. Together, those regulations are having an impact of more than $63 billion on the economy and they have destroyed 800,000 jobs and may result in the shutdown of 18 cement plants around the country. No one has refuted these figures.  In another section of the law, the EPA put a rule together, knowing it would increase the cost of gas. The rule is known as the Tier 3 rule, and it regulates the amount of sulfur that can be in gasoline when it leaves the refinery.  Tier 2 standards were put in place back in the early 2000s. That resulted in a 90-percent decline in the sulfur content of gasoline by 2010. That is already behind us, and it had a positive, measurable impact on the environment.  The need for a Tier 3 standard is not articulated very well. In fact, EPA did not have any unique scientific data to support the key benefits of this rule, and the EPA ignored the fact that it would actually increase greenhouse gas emissions. So they are going to increase greenhouse gas emissions with the rule they are still putting forth and be counterproductive. Talking about the Tier 3 rule, EPA stated that ``this rule will increase the cost of gasoline.''  Furthermore, the EPA recently finalized a rule called the 316(b) water rule. This rule regulates the cooling water systems used by powerplants and other major industrial facilities to prevent their operations from overheating. So they use water. The EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service were worried about the impact these facilities were having on fish, and so they put out a rule to help. In the rulemaking, EPA again states that ``the final rule will increase electricity costs.''  Worse is the fact that EPA could not even fudge its numbers enough to present a positive cost-benefit ratio. In its final rule, the stated costs are $300 million, which is about 10 times the estimated benefits of the rule, which are only $28.6 million. This violates the President's own Executive Order 13563, which states that agencies must ``propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that its benefits justify its costs.''  That is another problem we have with this administration. They will add rules, they will add laws, and they violate these laws--just like when he turned loose the five terrorists from Gitmo. We had passed, in fact, knowing he was going to try to get rid of people in Gitmo--and he took the five who were the very worst--we had passed a law saying he can't do that until he gives the Senate Armed Services Committee 30 days' notice and gives us a chance to respond and stop him from doing it. He totally ignored it, just as he ignored these regulations.  Worse yet, this rule has no human health benefits. Its only beneficiaries are fish. So EPA is putting out a rule that will increase electricity costs, including for those who live on fixed incomes, all for the sake of saving a few fish.  Another rule EPA has done since President Obama began his administration is the regional haze rule. These regulations were established to improve the visibility of national parks, and States were instructed to develop their own plans--known as State implementation plans--in order to comply. My State of Oklahoma did this, but EPA overturned it because of a technicality associated with its economic analysis. When EPA did this, it instituted a Federal implementation plan, and in this case it cost over $1 billion to execute or nearly 10 times the amount of the State-based plan that had been developed cooperatively with our utility companies. This is the kind of uncooperative relationship we have come to expect when working with the EPA.  Beyond the greenhouse gas regulations, the one receiving the most attention is the waters of the United States rule. Nearly every group from Oklahoma is talking about this rule because it would extend the powers of the Federal Government over millions of new acres of land.  Just last week I was in Guymon, OK; El Reno, OK; and Boise City, OK. Boise City is the farthest west, largest city out in the panhandle. It is kind of sandwiched between Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, and Texas. They are all in western Oklahoma. This is an arid part of the country. They are in their third year of their drought right now, but the new rule would declare much of this area as a Federal waterway subject to the onerous Federal regulations. This would impact every industry--farming, ranching, oil and gas,construction, transportation--everything.  Tom Buchanan happens to be the president of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau. I asked him a question in a kind of townhall setting that we had not too long ago.  I said: What is the biggest problem we have in agriculture in Oklahoma?  He said: The biggest problem has nothing to do with the farm bill. The biggest problem we are facing right now is the overregulation by the EPA and what they are doing with endangered species, what they are doing with the containment of fuel on farms, what they are doing with the water rules they have. That is the biggest problem.  I was with Terry Detrick, president of the American Farmers and Ranchers, and he agrees that the biggest problem farmers in America are having right now is the overregulation of the EPA.  The EPA has said it will work with industries to make sure it works for them, but we know from experience this won't be possible. It is not going to happen. Their goal is to take over, to control and leave no room for negotiation.  Another devastating regulation being developed by the EPA is the ozone NAAQS standard. NAAQS means national ambient air quality standard. It was last set at the end of the Bush administration at 75 parts per billion. The EPA has been working since President Obama took over the White House to lower this standard.  In 2011 the President cancelled EPA's plans to lower the ozone standard because it was going to hurt his reelection chances. But now that he has secured that reelection, he is ready to start it up again.  The EPA staff and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee--CASAC--recently recommended that the Administrator propose to lower the NAAQS level to between 60 and 70 parts per billion.  This chart shows how much of the Nation would be out of attainment if EPA lowers the standard to 60 parts per billion. In Oklahoma, all 77 counties would be out of attainment. What does that mean? I was mayor of the city of Tulsa once when it was out of attainment. We were not able to increase populations in many of our businesses.  It essentially means the EPA will have to issue a regulatory permit for any business expansion plans that could increase emission levels. It would make business expansion enormously expensive and would dramatically increase the power of the EPA. All told, this rule would put nearly 94 percent of the counties' populations of the United States of America out of attainment zones and would cede our economic superiority to the likes of China and India.  Zooming in to more industry-focused regulations, the EPA has been the main culprit in the President's war on fossil fuels. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have opened up dramatic new oil and natural gas resources in this country that no one thought we would ever be able to profitably extract.  By the way, hydraulic fracturing was actually developed in my State of Oklahoma, in Duncan, OK, in 1949. So this is something that is going on. In spite of this, they are trying to use hydraulic fracturing to stop the successful increases we have been able to have in the wells.  Lisa Jackson was the first EPA Administrator under Barack Obama. I remember asking her the question: If we were to do something with hydraulic fracturing, has there ever been a documented case in the United States that hydraulic fracturing is damaging to groundwater?  She said: No, it is not. There has never been--her actual exact words--any proven case where the fracking process itself has affected water.  So if we eliminate this, it is not going to save anything because it is not going to create any problems. And this doesn't come from me; it comes from the Administrator of the EPA, appointed by President Obama. Regardless, the EPA is moving full force to regulate hydraulic fracturing. At one point during the administration, there were a total of 13 different agencies working to do this. The Bureau of Land Management is one of them. It is my understanding that their regulations are being finalized, and it could cost producers as much as $100,000 per well. Keep in mind that every time they talk about what it is going to cost industry or business, that is passed on to the public.  The EPA is also working to regulate methane emissions from across the oil and natural gas industry. Whether it is the upstream producers during the drilling and completion process, the midstream pipeline operators, or the downstream retail distributors, EPA is convinced that the industry is willingly allowing their valuable product to seep into the atmosphere without any concern or awareness of where it is.  EPA's methane strategy is part of the President's overall climate change action plan, and the Agency recently published white papers outlining its understanding of methane leaks in the industry, and they were not very impressive.  I recently wrote EPA and the White House to express my concern with these papers. I was shocked that the papers seemed to lack any comprehensive understanding of the industry's operational practices. I was also disappointed that EPA didn't consider many of the regulatory hurdles in place which actually prevent producers from installing the technology and infrastructure that would reduce methane emissions. I am hopeful that EPA will take my recommendations seriously before moving forward.  So we have two problems. Right now we could be totally independent of any other country. All we have to do is do what every other country in the world does; that is, exploit our own resources. This President has made it impossible for us to get into public lands and to get this done.  Then, of course, we have the problem of overregulation. In all, the administration's regulatory agenda is intended to shut down the engine of America's economy. They have already shut down coal. Now they are working on oil and natural gas.  What they have done so far is just a preview. But the liberal environmentalists--Tom Steyer, Bill McKibben, Democracy Alliance--must all be frustrated by what is going on right now. Temperatures are not going up, they are going down. Nobody seems to care. No one has any desire to implement the policies they want. Polling is all showing they have lost this battle. That is exactly why they are willing to spend between $600 million and $700 million on this year's elections--to convince the American people to elect Members who will support the President's regulations, which will shut down the economy.  One more thing, going back to global warming. Earlier I said that back in 2002 when we discussed the costs of it, being between $300 billion and $400 billion, as the largest tax increase in history, a permanent tax increase, I asked the question to Lisa Jackson--again, she was the Administrator of the EPA, appointed by Barack Obama--I said: If we were to pass these cap-and-trade regulations or bills or do it by regulation, would this have the result of lowering CO2 emissions?  She said: No, because this isn't where the problem is. The problem is in China, it is in India, it is in Mexico, it is in other places.  In fact, one could use the argument that it would actually have the effect of increasing emissions because as we chase away our base, the manufacturing base will go to countries like China and India, where they don't have any restrictions on emissions at all.  I think it is important to remind the people that even though that era is almost gone and people realize that is something that was very popular at one time, now the polls show that people have caught on. But keep in mind that what the President could not do through legislation he is now doing through regulations, and regulations, as we pointed out, are the greatest problem our economy is facing today, and this is something we are going to have to change.  With that, I yield the floor.
