President, I strongly support the disaster relief package that is before us today. It is going to provide much needed assistance to the thousands of families and communities who were devastated by Hurricane Harvey. As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I looked at it very carefully, and I know it provides a short-term increase to the debt limit to ensure the U.S. Government has access to the resources it needs. It funds the government with a continuing resolution through December 8, enabling Congress to work to complete the fiscal year 2018 appropriations bills. It is a responsible approach to addressing the needs of our Nation.  As a Vermonter, as a human being, it was heart-wrenching to watch the devastation march through Texas as Hurricane Harvey made landfall, only to see it turn toward Louisiana. Now, Hurricane Irma has struck Puerto Rico and continues on its path toward Florida and the east coast. Hurricanes Jose and Katia are swirling in the Atlantic.
