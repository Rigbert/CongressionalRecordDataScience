President, first, let me respond to my colleague and friend from the State of Missouri which adjoins my home State of Illinois.  I say to him, I do not disagree with many of the things he said. This debate over Miguel Estrada should not be about the person. I have met him. I sat down in my office with him. He has a very impressive life story to tell having come to the United States as an immigrant when he was about 17 years old, with a limited command of English. The man had some extraordinary achievements. He went on to become the editor of the Law Review at Harvard, served as a member of the Department of Justice, worked at the Supreme Court as a clerk. He is with a major, prestigious law firm. You would really be hard pressed to find anything in his background that is anything short of impressive. That is not the issue.  The fact that he is Hispanic, I say to my friend from Missouri, in my mind, is a plus in many respects. It certainly is not a minus. I was honored to name a Hispanic to the district court in Chicago when I had that opportunity a few years ago. I believe our judiciary should reflect the diversity of the United States. And if this is an example of affirmative action by the White House to put a Hispanic on the DC Circuit court, I say: Three cheers. I think it is the right thing to do.  It has nothing to do with his Hispanic heritage. As I said, that is a plus. There is nothing negative about that in any respect. What is at issue, and the reason the Senate has been tied up with this nomination, is the fact that Mr. Estrada has not been forthright in explaining who he is in terms of what he believes. And that is a fair question.  If we are going to give someone a lifetime appointment to the DC Circuit court--which is not just another court for the District of Columbia, but a major court in our Federal judicial system--I think it is not only reasonable, it is imperative that the Senate ask basic questions of Mr. Estrada. And we did. Time and time again, he stopped short of answering because that is now the drill at the Department of Justice.  The nominees go through this very rigorous training about how to handle a Senate judicial hearing. I am told they have videotapes and play them back and they ask them the questions most often asked of nominees. They school them in the answers to give to not reveal, at any point, what they really think, trying to get away with saying as little as possible, trying to get through the hearing with a smile on their face and their family behind them, and trying to get through the Senate without any controversy.  There is nothing wrong with that if a person has a history that you can turn to and say, well, this man or this woman has been on the bench for so many years and has handed down so many opinions. And we have read them. We know what they believe. They have expressed themselves over and over again. Or if they have published law journal articles, for example, that explain their point of view, that is all there for the record. You could draw your own conclusions.  But in the case of Mr. Estrada, none of that is there. He has not done that much in terms of publications nor involvement in cases. We said to him: Help us understand you. If you will not answer the question directly, let us at least look at the legal documents you prepared so we can see how you analyzed the law.  That has been done before. Other nominees have offered that information. Mr. Estrada said: I would be happy to share it with you as well. But the Department of Justice stepped in and the White House stepped in and said: No, we will not let the Senate see what Mr. Estrada has written as an attorney.  Why? Why would they want to conceal this information, unless, in fact, there is something very controversial and worrisome.  So we come here today not with any personal animus against Miguel Estrada. To the contrary, on a personal basis, he is a very extraordinary individual personally, academically, and professionally. But we have a right to ask these questions. Let me restate that. We have a responsibility to ask those questions, to make certain that each man and woman headed for this awesome lifetime appointment, this awesome position of responsibility, really is the person we want in that position.  Now, make no mistake, with President Bush in the White House, the nominees are more than likely to be Republican, more than likely to be conservative, more than likely to be members--proud members--of the Federalist Society. I know that. That is the nature of this process, the nature of politics. Yet it is still our responsibility to make certain they are just conservative and not extreme in their positions. We cannot draw that conclusion on Miguel Estrada because he has carefully concealed what he really believes. And that is why we are here.  So as a result of focusing on this nomination for 3 straight weeks, we have ignored so many other issues that should be brought to the Senate. We could resolve this issue tomorrow morning easily.  Senator Bennett, a Republican, of Utah has come to the floor and made a suggestion that I think is eminently reasonable. Let Miguel Estrada turn over his legal writings so they can be reviewed by Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy. And if they find anything in there of moment, of consequence, or of controversy, let them follow through with the questions or, if necessary, a hearing, and let's be done with it, a vote up or down.  Senator Daschle came to the floor today, the Democratic leader, and said that would be perfectly acceptable. We would have the information, and then we could reach our conclusion. And in the process we could be protecting our responsibility as Members of the Senate.  It has nothing to do with Miguel Estrada personally, but it does have something to do with our constitutional authority and responsibility to review each nominee.                                Ephedra  Mr. President, I would also like to address another issue that is totally unrelated.  On February 14, a Friday, I stood in this spot and spoke about an issue, one that has been on my mind for almost 6 months, an issue which worries me, concerns me, because it relates to the health and safety of American families.  On that day, I challenged the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, under his authority to protect American families, to protect them against a nutritional supplement known as ephedra. You will find this supplement in a lot of diet pills, pills that are being sold over the counter as a supplement or vitamin or food product. They are sold as a way to lose weight or increase your energy or performance.  People come in and buy them, with no restriction on how old you have to be or what your health is or what might interact with these supplements. And people buy those and find out, in many instances, that not only don't they work, they are dangerous.  I have challenged Secretary Thompson for 6 months--6 months--to take these dangerous products off the market, and he has not done so. That was February 14.  On February 16, a pitcher from the Baltimore Orioles dropped dead during training. He had cardiac arrest, and the coroner who examined his body afterwards--those who did the autopsy--disclosed the fact that he had used these supplements with ephedra. That was 2 days after I had given that speech.  Time has run out for Steve Bechler and for many like him when it comes to protection from the harm of dangerous dietary supplements containing ephedra. We cannot bring Steve Bechler or my own constituent in Lincoln, IL, Sean Riggins, back. But we can fight to make sure this dangerous product is taken off the market immediately.  Sean Riggins was a 16-year-old boy. And about 4 weeks after I held a hearing in Washington, he went into a convenience store in Lincoln, IL, a small town, and bought--off the counter, with no identification, no check--a pill that was supposed to help him to perform better as a football player. The pill had ephedra in it. As best we can determine, Sean Riggins--this healthy football player, 16 years old--washed down that pill with Mountain Dew or some other product with caffeine in it and went into cardiac arrest and died. This healthy young man died, after taking a pill sold over the counter that contained ephedra.  I cannot think of another product that has generated so many adverse events, so many bad results--some extremely serious, even fatal--and yet has failed to generate any response from this Government to protect families and individuals buying these products.  The Food and Drug Administration has received over 18,000 reports of adverse events, serious health consequences, from those using ephedra and within those 18,000 over 100 deaths. Yet the Food and Drug Administration and Secretary Thompson refuse to act. They want to study the issue. And as they study, innocent people die.  Last August, I wrote to Secretary Thompson and urged him to ban these products. At that time, Lee Smith, an airline pilot from Nevada, had not yet suffered the debilitating stroke that cost him his health and his job due to ephedra.  I again wrote to Secretary Thompson on August 22. At that time, when I sent him a letter begging him to do something about these products, my constituent, Sean Riggins--that healthy 16-year-old boy in Lincoln, IL, who played football and wrestled for his high school team--was still alive. He died September 3, after consuming an ephedra product called yellow jacket. You will find those by cash registers at gas stations and convenience stores across America--kids popping them because they think they make them better performers when it comes to sports or, even worse, taking these pills and drinking beer, craziness that leads to terrible health consequences. And those pills are sold over the counter, with no Government control.  I wrote again, and I spoke directly to Secretary Tommy Thompson in September and October. My Governmental Affairs Subcommittee had hearings on the dangers of ephedra in July and October.  I again urged the Secretary, in a letter sent to him less than 1 month before Steve Bechler of the Baltimore Orioles died. Incidentally, did you see the followup articles in the sports pages, as other athletes, professional baseball players such as David Wells came forward and told his story about how he wanted to lose some weight, and he took an ephedra product and his heart was racing at 200 beats a minute. He flat-lined. He was almost in cardiac arrest before they finally brought him back.  These are not sickly individuals. These are healthy athletes who are taking these products sold over the counter and risking their lives in the process.  Yet the most we can get from Secretary Thompson in response is a suggestion that maybe we need a warning label. When the reporters asked him this past weekend about Steve Bechler of the Baltimore Orioles, his death because of ephedra, the Secretary was quoted as saying: ``I wouldn't use it, would you?''  Well, I must say to the Secretary, this is not a matter of his personal preference. It is not a matter of whether as a consumer he would buy the product. It is a matter of his personal responsibility, his responsibility as Secretary of Health and Human Services to get this dangerous product off the shelves of American stores today and to protect families.  I am not the only person calling for this ban on ephedra products. The American Medical Association, representing over 200,000 doctors, called on Secretary Thompson to ban ephedra products. They didn't do it last week after Steve Bechler died. No. They did it over a year ago after Canada had banned this product for sale in their country. They went to Secretary Thompson and said it is dangerous to sell in the United States. He has done nothing.  Let me tell you another thing you might not know. The U.S. Army has banned the sale of ephedra in their commissaries worldwide after 33ephedra-related deaths occurred among American servicemen. Does this make any sense? We believe as a government that we need to protect the men and women in uniform and so we ban the sale of these products at commissaries across the world, and yet the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration will not ban the sale of these products in convenience stores and drugstores and gas stations across America.  When you ask him about it, the Secretary says: I am studying it. I have a group called the RAND Commission that is going to study it.  With all due respect, we don't need another study. The Food and Drug Administration has received over 18,000 adverse reports about ephedra. The FDA could do followup on the most serious ones. In fact, the FDA did commission a review of adverse reports several years ago. That review by Drs. Haller and Benowitz established that 31 percent of the reports were definitely or probably related to ephedra and an additional 31 were deemed to be possibly related.  We understand what we are up against. Ephedra is a danger. It is so dangerous that when it was used in its synthetic form with caffeine, that was banned over 15 years ago. They said you couldn't sell a drug in America, nor could you sell an over-the-counter drug product in America that contained ephedra and caffeine because, put together, it is a dangerous and sometimes lethal combination. But yet if you step back from the over-the-counter drugs and call it a nutrition supplement, a vitamin, a food, you are totally exempt from that prohibition. You can combine those two lethal substances, ephedra and caffeine, and sell them with impunity. Does that make any sense? Is that protecting consumers across America? Is that what you expect from your government?  Certainly it is not what I expect. Many of these companies say it is a natural product. Ephedra is naturally occurring. That is no defense. Arsenic is a natural product. Hemlock is a natural product. That doesn't mean that they are safe. In fact, they are dangerous.  We have seen a lot of studies that have come out about ephedra. We know what needs to be done. Many States have already taken action. Because the Federal Government has failed to act, over 20 States have enacted restrictions on the sale of ephedra-containing products.  Incidentally, if you think these products are something you have never heard of, the leading sales of ephedra products are under the brand name Metabolife 365. You have seen them advertised on television and in magazines. Every time you walk into a drugstore and convenience store, you find: Metabolife tablets help you lose weight. Look carefully. Many of them contain ephedra, this lethal drug which has killed so many people.  Suffolk County, a week or so ago in New York, decided to ban this product as well after a 20-year-old named Peter Schlendorf died in 1996, and others suffered serious consequences. They understood, as the U.S. Army, Canada, Britain, Australia, and Germany, that action had to be taken to protect the residents. The National Football League, the NCAA, and the International Olympic Commission have reached the same conclusion, banning the use of this product by athletes.  I wrote to the Baseball Commissioner, Bud Selig, last week and to the Baseball Players' Association urging them to follow suit. The question isn't whether these individual organizations will show responsibility. The question is whether this Government will accept its responsibility.  I don't know Secretary Thompson that well. I have met him a few times. He is a very likable person. He certainly has had a distinguished public career in the State of Wisconsin, serving as a legislator and Governor of the State for many years, one of the most popular elected officials in its history. Everyone tells me this man really understands public service. I believe it.  This really seems to be a blind spot. When I talked to Secretary Thompson on the phone about these products, he said: How are we going to stop these fellows from selling these products and endangering people? I said: Mr. Secretary, you can stop them. You have the authority to stop them.  Time passes and nothing happens. I understand this industry is powerful. I have heard from them. I have heard from my colleagues in the Senate and House who have said: Don't take on these folks in the vitamin and nutritional supplement industry. They really have a lot of political clout. They do. But for goodness' sakes, if you can't stand up to an industry that is selling a lethal product to protect American families, why in the world would you take the oath of office to serve in the Senate? I think every Member understands that responsibility. It goes beyond political fear. It goes right to the heart of your political responsibility, the oath of office we all take and one we all value so much.  In closing, I say to Secretary Thompson, you have another chance now. It is a chance which I pray you will take. The last time I made a speech on the floor of the Senate about this issue, Steve Bechler of the Baltimore Orioles, a man in his early twenties, a promising athlete with a great future ahead of him, was still alive. Sadly, he is not alive today. He took this product and he died as a result. Others will, too.  That story, that tragic story of Steve Bechler, Sean Riggins, and so many others will be repeated over and over again. This industry may have political clout, but it does not have a conscience. It is up to the Secretary, as head of the Health and Human Services Department, to accept his responsibility to protect American families. A warning label is not enough. You cannot get by with putting a label on this product, saying: Caution, use of this product may cause stroke, a coronary event, or death. Why in the world would you allow such a product to be sold over the counter, unregulated in terms of the age of the buyer, unregulated in terms of the dosage? How in the world can you justify that kind of a thing?  The Secretary needs to accept his responsibility, and if he does, I will be the first to applaud him. But until he does, stay tuned. You will continue to hear these speeches on the floor from me and others while helpless victims across America fall because of their consumption of this deadly product.
