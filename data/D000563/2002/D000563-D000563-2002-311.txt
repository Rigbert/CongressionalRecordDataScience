 I have to say to the Senator from California that I am taken aback by the fact that people have not come forward to condemn the violence and terrorism on both sides.  When I was in Egypt and faced the press, they looked at me incredulously when I described to them that we saw happening in the Middle East as the same kind of violence as September 11. They could not understand the connection. I think Americans understand that connection.  I hope with this amendment we can move toward a peaceful outcome in this sad and bloody chapter of the violence in the Middle East.  I yield the floor.
