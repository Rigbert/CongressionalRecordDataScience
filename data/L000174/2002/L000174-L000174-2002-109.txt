I read a list of all those who support it. This is probably as broad a spectrum--National Association of Manufacturers to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. It sure encompasses a lot.  We have a charter change for the Veterans of Foreign Wars in here; a charter change for AMVETS; a charter change for the American Legion. All of those organizations support it.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I pushed that through.  This is something that the AMVETS and Veterans of Foreign Wars discussed and asked for, this charter change. They all support it. All the Republicans and Democrats on the committee support it. We ought to pass it.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
