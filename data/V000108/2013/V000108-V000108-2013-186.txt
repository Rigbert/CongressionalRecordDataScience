Speaker, on October 8, 2013, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 529 and 530.   Had I been present for rollcall vote 529, on the motion to table the appeal of the ruling of the chair regarding H.J. Res. 84, making continuing appropriations for Head Start for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes, I would have voted ``No.''   Had I been present for rollcall vote 530, on passage of H.J. Res. 84, making continuing appropriations for Head Start and for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes, I would have voted ``No.''                          ____________________
