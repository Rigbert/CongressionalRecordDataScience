Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  First of all, the gentleman from Florida protests too much; $300 million in cuts in veterans benefits.  Last year we cut 40 programs. We have downsized, cut 400 of them, reduced their spending. This Congress has been about the business of reducing in the last Congress a trillion dollars in debt.  The fact of the matter is this is not serious business that we are about today. This is fiscally and personally irresponsible. There is not one on the other side of the aisle that does not know that this bill is dead, dead, dead. The President has said he is going to veto it.  I have served in this body since 1981. Almost every year that side of the aisle has strongly from all of the microphones in all of the committees urged this body, if it was going to pass a CR, a funding bill to keep Government going while the political disputes on this Hill continue, has strongly urged a clean CR. Democrats, do not lard it up. Do not force Reagan and Bush to sign something. Make it clean. In fact the Committee on Appropriations, for the large part, supported that effort and did that.  The fact of the matter is, until they took control, until their extremist agenda could not see the light of day in this House, they cannot pass bills. So what they want to do is put it in a continuing resolution and say, if you do not do it my way, then shut down the Government and put at risk the credit of the United States of America.  As I said, that is fiscally irresponsible. It is personally irresponsible. It is far, far less than the American public expects of this body and of each of us. Vote no on this rule.
