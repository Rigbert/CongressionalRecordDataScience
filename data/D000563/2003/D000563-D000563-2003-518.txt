We are not leaving it to the States to decide, for example, that wrongdoers of medical malpractice cases would be treated more strictly, more severely? If there is a stricter provision in the treatment of those individuals, it would be preempted by this act? Is that the way we have explained it?  Mr. McCONNELL. Again, to ensure the availability of health care services, the states are allowed to provide greater or additional protections to health care providers than are contained in this bill.
