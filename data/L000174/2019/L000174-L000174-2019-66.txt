Her works have made hers a unique and highly sought-after brand, one which beautifully depicts Vermont's landscape. Her prints, made by hand using woodblocks, are a premier example of how Vermonters harbor a deep commitment to creating and providing high-quality goods, made with passion. Her work has promoted Vermont, and I could not be more proud to recognize this acclaimed artist.  Sabra enrolled at Middlebury College in 1953, where she was inspired by Piero della Francesca's painting ``The Flagellation of Christ.'' One of her instructors instilled a belief within her that, in her words, made art ``seem like a noble calling.'' Sabra has followed this calling over the last 50-years, creating beautiful works of art that portray Vermont's landscapes. Born in Oklahoma and raised in neighboring New York, Sabra believes that her professional career began when she moved to Vermont. She recalled in a Vermont Digger article that ``Vermont was beautiful and Vermonters unpretentious, generous, and understood `home occupation.' I was free to be me.'' This environment made Vermont an ideal work and home location for Sabra.  Sabra's achievements are impressive. Her work has been featured on the cover of Vermont Life magazine. It is showcased in a stained glass window at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire. It has been printed on 250,000 UNICEF Cards. And Sabra's work was featured on 60 million postage stamps commemorating Vermont's 1991 bicentennial. Sabra's work has gained popularity far and wide over the last five decades. Marcelle and I have several of her prints in our home as well.  I am proud to recognize the contribution and achievements that Sabra has made over her 50 years in Vermont. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Vermont Digger article titled ``Sabra Field marks 50th year making Vermont Art.'' It describes the hard work that goes into making each piece of art and highlights Field's commitment to capturing Vermont's picturesque landscape.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Vermont Digger, July 7, 2019]             Sabra Field Marks 50th Year Making Vermont Art                          (By Kevin O'Connor)       East Barnard.--Sabra Field recalls the moment a half-     century ago when she made her first woodblock print in      Vermont.       ``No one said I couldn't,'' she says, ``and I was too naive      to realize the odds.''       The Oklahoma-born and New York-raised artist didn't know      her ink-on-paper images of red barns, green hills and blue      skies would land on the cover of Vermont Life magazine, an      annual namesake calendar, a stained glass window at      neighboring New Hampshire's Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical      Center, 250,000 UNICEF cards and 60 million postage stamps      commemorating Vermont's 1991 bicentennial.       This coming weekend, the 84-year-old printmaker will      celebrate her 50th year making iconic Vermont art.       ``When people ask what piece means the most to me,'' she      says, ``I answer, `The one I'm going to do next.' ''       Field's Green Mountain story began in 1953 when she      enrolled at Middlebury College (``there was no math      requirement,'' she explains) and had an epiphany while      studying Piero della Francesca's 1450s painting ``The      Flagellation of Christ.''       ``I saw that great art is composed from what we see,'' she      recalls, ``but it is not a replica of what we see.''       Field's watercolor teacher made art ``seem like a noble      calling.'' But she yearned less for a brush than for      woodblocks, which she discovered upon further schooling at      Connecticut's Wesleyan University.       ``Prints are for everybody,'' she says of the easily      reproducible medium. ``I wanted to spend all my time making      images and I was willing to take the risk. I felt, in a      sense, that I had no choice.''       ``Over the course of her career she has received any number      of accolades, and has been variously described as `the Grant      Wood of Vermont,' `the artist laureate of Vermont,' and as      someone who `has touched more lives than any Vermont artist      in history,' '' Richard Saunders, a Middlebury College      professor and director of its Museum of Art, wrote in the      catalogue of the 2017 retrospective ``Sabra Field, Then and      Now.''       Yet every peak in this artist's world is framed by valleys.      The mother of two young sons moved from Connecticut to a      former 19th-century tavern in the White River valley village      of East Barnard after her first marriage ended in 1969.       ``When I arrived, people were unsure,'' she recalls. ``Is      she just here for the summer?''       Field soon contacted the secretary of state's office to      register a printmaking business.       ``Somehow I knew I wanted the legitimacy of being      validated.''       Tallying initial sales on her children's toy cash register,      Field began to design, draw and cut the woodblock images that      have sustained her ever since.       ``My life as a professional artist really didn't begin      until I moved,'' she says. ``Vermont was beautiful and      Vermonters unpretentious, generous, and understood `home      occupation.' I was free to be me.''       Field soon met her second husband, Spencer, who became her      business manager. But her work wasn't always seen as      marketable. Take the story behind her 1977 four-print      ``Mountain Suite.''       ``Vermont Life requested a seasonal suite to sell,'' she      recalls. ``Then they declined to buy them.''       The artist went on to distribute the images herself. The      magazine has since folded. But log onto her website and      you'll see the passed-over prints remain in circulation for      $250 each.       Field's resulting career has been chronicled in two books--     2002's ``The Art of Place'' and 2004's ``In Sight''--and the      2015 documentary ``Sabra.'' Middlebury College, for its part,      has an archive copy of every one of her prints.       Field can share stories of private struggle as well as of      professional success. She rewinds back five decades to inking      her first works.       ``I hung them outside to dry.''       The wind wasn't the only thing that got carried away that      day.       Field has weathered bigger changes ranging from the advent      of new reproduction technology for the prints she continues      to create by hand to the 2010 death of her husband. Now      assisted by fellow printmaker and neighbor Jeanne Amato, she      still works with woodblocks, be it for a recent children's      book ``Where Do They Go?'' with Addison County writer Julia      Alvarez or a coming nine-piece suite of prints she conceived      after President Donald Trump's election.       ``I decided we needed to look at it as a challenge and we      couldn't let him manipulate our emotions,'' she says of the      Trump-inspired prints. As for exactly what they picture, she      adds only: ``They will be somewhat mysterious. But when you      get it, you get it.''       Field is marking her 50th year in Vermont with a special      poster and open house at her East Barnard studio July 13 and      14 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with more information available on      her website.       ``The career highs that sustain me are not glamorous by the      standards of the wider world, but they confirm that I made      the right decision and that this wonderful place is home,''      she says. ``I've never fallen out of love with my medium. I      couldn't be happy otherwise.''                          ____________________
