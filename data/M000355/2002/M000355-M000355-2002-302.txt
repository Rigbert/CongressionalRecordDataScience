 1929. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security to permit Kentucky to operate a separate retirement system for certain public employees; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to add Kentucky to the list of States that are permitted to offer ``divided retirement'' plans under the Social Security Act.  Three weeks ago, I was contacted by Brian James, president of the Louisville Fraternal Order of Police, FOP, and Tony Cobaugh, president of the Jefferson County FOP. These two law enforcement leaders called my attention to a problem that could jeopardize the retirement security of many of our community's police, fire, and emergency personnel.  In November of 2000, the citizens of Jefferson County and the City of Louisville, KY voted to merge their communities and respective governments into a single entity, which will be known as Greater Louisville. As one might expect, combining two large metropolitan governments in such a short time frame cannot be done without encountering a few difficulties along the way. Jefferson County and the City of Louisville currently operate two very different retirement programs for their police officers. When these two governments merge on January 6, 2003, current Federal law will require the new government to offer a single retirement plan that could dramatically increase the cost of retirement for both our dedicated public safety officers and the new Greater Louisville government.  Thankfully, when the FOP's leaders called this problem to my attention, they also suggested a simply solution, let the police officers and firefighters choose for themselves the retirement system which best meets their needs.  I rise today to offer legislation that will provide retirement stability to our public safety officers by allowing Kentucky to operate what is known as a ``divided retirement system.'' I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Congressman Ron Lewis and Congresswoman Anne Northup who will soon introduce similar legislation in the House of Representatives.  With passage of my legislation and similar legislation by the Kentucky General Assembly, Louisville's and Jefferson County's police officers would decide whether or not they want to participate in Social Security or remain in their traditional retirement plan. While future employees will be automatically enrolled in Social Security, no current officers would be forced into a new retirement system as a result of the merger without their approval.  Current Federal law allows twenty-one states the option of offering divided retirement systems. Unfortunately, Kentucky is not one of these twenty-one States. The legislation I am offering today would change that by adding Kentucky to list of states designated in the Social Security Act.  It is critical that the Senate provide this retirement stability to the brave men and women who protect the citizens of Louisville and Jefferson County everyday. There is extensive precedent for granting Kentucky this authority, and my legislation enjoys the broad, bi-partisan support of policemen, firefighters, local and state officials. I look forward to working with this coalition, as well as my colleagues in the Senate, to see that this urgently needed legislation is enacted into law this year.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the Louisville FOP, Jefferson County FOP, Louisville Firefighters Union, and State Finance and Administration Cabinet, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Fraternal Order of Police,                                           Louisville Lodge 6,                                  Louisville, KY, January 7, 2002.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Louisville, KY.       Dear Mr. McConnell: Following a referendum held      approximately one year ago the voters in our community      approved a government merger of the City of Louisville and      Jefferson County Kentucky. Currently officers employed by the      City of Louisville working for the Louisville Division of      Police do not pay into Social Security, due to having been      exempted from making such payments by a previous law. On      January 06, 2003 when our new government become effective the      Louisville Police Officers who I am elected to represent will      no longer be excused from Social Security participation.       I would like to see our new government offer a ``Divided      Referendum'' vote that would allow each individual officer      the opportunity to choose his or her own preference in      participating in Social Security. This would make for a      smoother transition as it relates to our members and the new      government. For this to be possible there has to be federal      legislation sanctioning Kentucky as a ``Name State''. There      are currently twenty-one states that have such designation.      Also there has to be changes in the Kentucky. Revised      Statutes to allow for the ``Divided Referendum'' vote.       It is my hope that you would assist our organization in      making the necessary changes at both the federal and state      levels during this years Congressional Session as well as      Kentucky's Legislative Session.       If you have any questions regarding this issue please do      not hesitate to call me. Thank you in advance for any      consideration you can give this matter. I am looking forward      to seeing you in 2002.           Respectfully,                                                      David James,     President.                                  ____                                        Fraternal Order of Police,                                Jefferson County Lodge No. 14,                                 Louisville, KY, January 15, 2002.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Louisville, KY.       Dear Mr. McConnell: The voters of Louisville and Jefferson      County approved the referendum for a consolidated government      over one year ago. Now the monumental task of organizing that      future government is quickly upon us. As the leader of this      labor organization, I must focus on those labor-related      issues that affect my membership.       The biggest issue raised to this point is the area of      social security. Louisville police officers do not      participate in Social Security. However, Jefferson County      police officers do participate. Both FOP lodges are working      closely on the very probable police merger that will most      likely follow the government merger.       Both FOP lodges believe that the members should have the      opportunity to decide their futures in reference to Social      Security through a ``divided referendum''. It is our      understanding that a change must occur on the state and      federal level. Will you help us by changing Kentucky to a      ``Name State''? Hopefully, we can count on your support for      enabling changes at the state or federal level during the      2002 United States Congress or at the Kentucky General      Assembly.           Respectfully,                                               Anthony J. Cobaugh,                                                        President.                                      Louisville Professional Fire                                     Fighters Union Local 345,                                     Louisville, January 28, 2002.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Louisville KY.       Dear Mr. McConnell: Following a referendum held      approximately one year ago, the voters in our community      approved a government merger of the city of Louisville and      Jefferson County, Kentucky. An issue has come up concerning      Social Security, involving police and fire fighters. Due to a      previous law exempting fire fighters, we do not pay into      social security. On January 6, 2003 when our new government      becomes effective, the members of the Louisville Professional      Fire Fighters, Local #345 will no longer be excused from      Social Security participation.       I would like to see our newly formed metro government offer      a ``Divided Referendum'' vote that would allow each      individual the opportunity to choose his or her own      preference in participating in Social Security. For this to      be possible there has to be federal legislation sanctioning      Kentucky as a ``Name State''. There are currently twenty-one      states that have such legislation. In addition,there has to      be changes in the Kentucky Revised Statutes to allow for the      ``Divided Referendum'' vote. If ``Name State'' status is not      obtained, the new government will be forced to match the      Social Security, contribution made by more than 1,300 of its      employees, including the fire fighters, who currently do not      pay into the Social Security, System.       It is my hope that you would assist the Louisville      Professional Fire Fighters in making the necessary changes at      both the federal and state levels during this years US      Congressional Session as well as Kentucky's Legislative      Session.       If you have any questions concerning this issue; please do      not hesitate to call me. Thank you in advance for any      consideration you can give this matter.           Respectfully,                                  Michael J. ``Howdy'' Kurtsinger,     President.                                  ____                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,                                     Office of the Controller,                                  Frankfort, KY, February 6, 2002.     Hon. A.M. ``Mitch'' McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: The Kentucky Division of Social      Security is responsible for administering the social security      and Medicare program for all public employees in the      Commonwealth. This includes not only state employees, but      also the employees of all political subdivisions such as      school boards, counties, cities, libraries, water districts,      etc.       Those public employees who are participating in an employer      provided retirement system and not covered for social      security and Medicare may join the program via an employee      referendum. There are several steps that must be taken during      this process, but, under current federal and state statutes,      it boils down to a simple majority of the eligible employees      approving coverage for all employees of a coverage group.       There is, however, a second mechanism available to certain      states that are specifically named in the federal Social      Security Act. A referendum of the employees is also      conducted, but the outcome of the election differs in that      those employees voting for coverage become eligible for      participation in the social security and/or Medicare program.      Those employees voting against social security coverage are      exempt. This is referred as ``divided coverage''.       Last November, the voters of Jefferson County voted to      merge the governments of the City of Louisville and Jefferson      County, effective January 6, 2003. The success of the merger      efforts, however, also present a problem that must be      resolved, that is, the social security and Medicare coverage      of several groups of public servants.       Some of the City of Louisville Police and firefighters      contribute only the Medicare program, not social security.      Other city police and firefighters contribute to neither. The      Jefferson County Police and corrections employees contribute      to both social security and Medicare. When the merger become      effective next year all these coverage groups will be      considered as a single group for social security coverage      purposes.       The new government, under the current legal situation, will      face the dilemma of adversely affecting the employee benefits      (eliminating social security coverage) of some of these      public servants or bring an additional financial burden on      the second group (forcing them to contribute to social      security) as well as on the new government (additional      employer contributions to social security).       The preferred remedy to this situation is to utilize      divided coverage. This would allow each employee to decide      for his or herself whether to pay into social security. All      new employees hired after a divided referendum is conducted      would automatically be enrolled in social security.       The Commonwealth of Kentucky is not included as a ``named''      state in the Social Security Act and, therefore, its public      employers cannot utilize the divided coverage option. We      requesting support for federal legislation amended 42 U.S.C.      418 to include Kentucky as a ``named'' state and enable      Greater Louisville and their employees to take advantage of      the divided coverage concept. This would add Kentucky to a      list of 21     states included in section 218(d)(6)(C) of the Social      Security Act that are currently permitted to conduct divided      referendums. The Kentucky General Assembly is proceeding with      amendments to the Kentucky Revised Statutes to authorize a      divided referendum, contingent upon federal legislative      changes.       If should also be noted that providing the Commonwealth      with the ability to conduct divided coverage would in no way      effect the members of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement      System. State statutes prohibit social security coverage      under the Commonwealth Section 218 agreement with the Social      Security Administration to any individual covered by KTRS.       The Commonwealth of Kentucky and the citizens of Jefferson      County need your support for designating Kentucky as a      ``Named State'' by the Congress. I will be glad to answer any      questions you may have.           Sincerely,                                                 Patrick L. Doyle,     Director, Kentucky Division of Social Security.                                  ____                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,                                      Office of the Secretary,                                  Frankfort, KY, February 6, 2002.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     U.S Senate, Senate Russell Office Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Last November, the voters of      Jefferson County voted to merge the governments of the City      of Louisville and Jefferson County, effective January 6,      2003. The success of the merger efforts, however, requires      that certain issues involving the social security and      Medicare coverage of several groups of public servants be      resolved.       Some of the City of Louisville Police and firefighters      contribute only to the Medicare program, not social security.      Other city police and firefighters contribute to neither. The      Jefferson County Police and corrections employees contribute      to both social security and Medicare. When the merger becomes      effective next year all these coverage groups will be      considered as a single group for social security purposes.       The preferred remedy to this situation is to utilize what      is termed a ``divided referendum''. This would allow each      employee to decide for his or herself whether to pay into      social security. All new employees hired after a divided      referendum is conducted would automatically be enrolled in      social security.       Before the new government can conduct a divided referendum,      the federal Social Security Act must be amended to designate      Kentucky a ``Named State''. This would add Kentucky to a list      of 21 states included in section 218(d)(6)(C) of the Social      Security Act that are currently permitted to conduct divided      referendums. The Greater Louisville Merger Transition Office      has recommended this option and is pursuing legislation with      the Kentucky General Assembly to authorize divided      referendums, contingent on Federal legislative changes.       We support the Greater Louisville Merger Transition Office      recommendation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the      citizens of Jefferson County need your support for      designating Kentucky as a ``Named State'' by the Congress. I      will be glad to answer any questions you may have.           Sincerely,                                                 T. Kevin Flanery,                                                        Secretary.                                 ______                                       By
