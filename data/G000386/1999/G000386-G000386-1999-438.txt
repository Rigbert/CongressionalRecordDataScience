 President, it may be human nature to overlook thehardships of previous generations. We don't think about suffering we don't have to endure. This is the way it should be. And this is the hope of America's innovators, who work to ease misfortune for our children and grandchildren.  One of those innovators is a 101-year-old woman from Sioux City, Iowa. Louise Humphrey was a leading light in the battle against polio, one of the most terrifying illnesses of our century. Because of her work, and the work of others devoted to finding a cure, polio is virtually non-existent in our country.  It's hard for anyone who didn't live through the 1940s and 1950s to understand fully the fear of polio. The disease was highly contagious and sometimes fatal. It attacked the lungs and the limbs. It immobilized its victims, made them struggle for breath and often forced them to breathe through mechanical iron lungs. Parents wouldn't allow their children to go swimming, or to drink out of public fountains, for fear of contagion. Those children fortunate enough to escape the illness saw their classmates return to school in leg braces and watched news reels of people in iron lungs.  At the height of the epidemic, during the late 1940s and early 1950s, polio struck between 20,000 to 50,000 Americans each year. In one year--1952--58,000 people caught the disease. Most of them were children.  Mrs. Humphrey of Sioux City became interested in polio before the height of the epidemic. In the 1930s, according to the Sioux City Journal, she saw firsthand the ravaging effects of polio after meeting a man who had been disabled by the disease. She and her husband, the late Dr. J. Hubert Humphrey, a Sioux City dentist, became leaders in the fight against polio. They headed the Woodbury County chapter of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Mrs. Humphrey was elected state chairman of the woman's division of the foundation.  The Humphreys raised thousands of dollars for equipment and therapy to battle the disease. They enlisted entertainers and circus performers in the cause, hosting these individuals at fund-raising parties. Their guests included Bob Hope, clown Emmett Kelly and a ham sandwich-eating elephant.  Their work contributed to a climate in which Jonas Salk developed the first polio vaccine. His vaccine, and another developed by Dr. Albert Sabin, soon became widely available. Polio is virtually non-existent in our country, although it remains a Third World threat.  Mrs. Humphrey has said she has no secret for living such a long life. She advises people to ``just be happy and be well.'' She has never had an ache or pain. What she did have in abundance was empathy, kindness, generosity and devotion. Because of her contributions, millions of American children will live without a debilitating disease.  On June 3, Mrs. Humphrey will turn 102. In advance of her birthday, during Older Americans Month, I want to thank Mrs. Humphrey for helping to make our country strong. Mrs. Humphrey, with her clear vision and compassionate concern for America's children, perfectly illustrates the theme of Older Americans Month: ``Honor the Past, Imagine the Future: Toward a Society for All Ages.''                          ____________________
