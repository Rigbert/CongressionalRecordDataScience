  I understand there is a suggestion that there may be political concerns on the President's part, and we all know that most environmental groups are very much on the Democratic side. But is it not the case that there are a number of unions in the country--most of which, certainly, do not support Republicans anywhere I know--that also feel passionately about this issue and would like to get to work? Is that not the case?
