  Russell Marion Ross was a professor of political science for more than 40 years at the University of Iowa. He died on Tuesday, April 27, at age 88.  Dr. Ross was an Iowan through and through. Born in Washington, IA, he received his bachelor and master degrees, and Ph.D. in political science from the University of Iowa. He served as chairman of the department for many years. In 1987, he wrote a book on the department's history for the Iowa State Historical Society. Following his retirement, he continued to teach long-distance education classes until the time of his death. Dr. Ross began his association with long-distance education while serving in the Navy on the aircraft carrier USS Manilla Bay.  He was an expert on local government and politics. He wrote several books in his field, served as executive assistant to Governor Norman Erbe in the 1960s, and was the mayor of University Heights for more than 10 years.  Dr. Ross influenced numerous students over the years. Online condolences included postings by two city managers who said Dr. Ross guided their vocations. Other postings came from those with fond memories of Dr. Ross' friendliness, approachability, and honesty.  As Joel and Sandy Barkan of Washington, DC, wrote: ``He was devoted to the University, a good steward, and a straight shooter in the Iowa tradition. He will be missed.''  That is exactly the sentiment I have about Dr. Ross.  In 1957 and 1958, Dr. Ross was my professor at the University of Iowa when I was pursuing course work toward a doctorate in political science. As an authority on state and local government, he would have been my adviser on my dissertation topic, which was the reorganization of state government to save money.  Professor Ross was an expert and very well-regarded in his field, sought after for decades by the news media for his sharp insight into Iowa politics. He combined his significant knowledge with a plain-spoken common sense that cut to the chase. For example, in assessing the Democratic Presidential caucus fight in 2000, Dr. Ross was quoted as saying of candidate Bill Bradley, who was slow to respond to attacks from Al Gore, ``He muffed it pretty badly.'' That was the bottom line in just five words.  So Professor Ross was generous with his insight. He also was generous with his time. To a 23-year-old graduate student, as I was, an accomplished scholar can be intimidating and hard to approach. Dr. Ross was the opposite. He always had time for his students, and all of these years later, that's the first impression that comes to mind when I think of him.  I didn't finish my doctoral program, but that had nothing to do with Dr. Ross. I ran for the State legislature instead. With his generosity of spirit and knowledge, Dr. Ross helped me to find my calling, as he excelled at his. Iowans are fortunate to have had such an outstanding person in our lives.                          ____________________
