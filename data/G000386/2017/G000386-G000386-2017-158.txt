 President, we have a very bad regulation that has been put out by the Social Security Administration that needs to be obliterated, so we are using a process called the Congressional Review Act to show Congress's displeasure with the Social Security Administration and to get this regulation off the books.  Now, there has been a lot of talk about how the Congressional Review Act is the wrong vehicle to repeal the disastrous regulation. So I want to quote a contrary opinion from the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery saying this:       The CRA--  Meaning the Congressional Review Act--     is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory overreach,      and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In this      particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of      people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their      basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that      utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only      warranted, but necessary.  I would add to it that it is obviously necessary.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            National Coalition for                                       Mental Health Recovery,                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2017.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      I write on behalf of the National Coalition for Mental Health      Recovery (NCMHR) regarding the final rule the Social Security      Administration (SSA) released on December 19th, 2016,      implementing provisions of the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of      2007, 81 FR 91702.       In accordance with our mandate to advise the President,      Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,      programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with      disabilities, NCMHR submitted comments to SSA on the proposed      rule. In our comments, we cautioned against implementation of      the proposed rule because there is no causal connection      between the inability to manage money and the ability to      safely and responsibly own, possess or use a firearm. This      arbitrary linkage not only unnecessarily and unreasonably      deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional      right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their      disabilities, may need a representative payee.       Despite our objections and that of many other individuals      and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed      rule, the final rule released in late December was largely      unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional      right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule      legitimizes, NCMHR recommends that Congress consider      utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this      rule.       NCMHR is a nonpartisan, is nonpartisan nonprofit with no      stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control      other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun      possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual      disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to      whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to      themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.      Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction      on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only      after the individual has been afforded due process and given      an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not      able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her      disability. NCMHR believes that SSA's final rule falls far      short of meeting these criteria.       The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory      overreach, and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously.      In this particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the     essential mission of an agency that millions of people with      and without disabilities rely upon to meet their basic needs.      Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that utilizing the      CRA to repeal the final rule is not only warranted, but      necessary.           Sincerely,                                        Daniel B. Fisher, MD, PhD,                                                      Chair NCMHR.
