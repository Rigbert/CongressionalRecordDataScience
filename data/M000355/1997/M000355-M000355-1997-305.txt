 President, I rise today to salute an outstanding group of young women who have been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Award. The Gold Award is the highest achievement a Girl Scout can earn and symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The award can be earned by girls aged 14-17, or in grades 9-12.  The young ladies from the Kentuckiana Council who will receive this honor are: Jodi M. Akin, Millie M. Cook, Miranda S. Der Ohanian, Alicia M. Franken, Julie W. Goodwin, Meghan K. Horan, Jean E. Hiter, Tricia J. Johnson, Casey J. Lightfoot, Susan D. Martin, Sarah J. Pershke, Leslie A. Rowland, Amy E. Shelton, Tiffany L. Skeens, Melissa C. Smith, Whitney A. Sylvester, Molly D. Taylor, Catherine T. Tomassetti, and Andrea D. Warwick.  The young ladies from the Licking Valley Council are: Kelly Buten, Mary Jane Hendrickson, Alyssa Hensley, Mandy Radle, and Becky Thomas.  The young ladies from the Wilderness Road Council are: Carlye Ann Burchett, Stephanie Ann Eads, Ericka Lee Harney, Adrienne Mira Winkler, Cassie Domek, Tina Gelgleln, Lela Nichole Woods, Sabra Goble, Valerie Ann Petty, Tracey Lynn Isaacs, and Elizabeth Anne Van Orden.  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, aGirl Scout must earn four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to these outstanding young ladies. They deserve recognition for their contributions to their community and their country, and I wish them continued success in the years ahead.                          ____________________
