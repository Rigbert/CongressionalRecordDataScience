I want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Arizona and give special thanks to Gen. Sonny Montgomery. A finer friend of the military and our veterans our Nation has never seen.  My father, Wes Roberts, who was a Marine Corps major, who lied about his age at 42 to join the Corps and at age 43 was on Iwo Jima, took part in the 36-day assault on this very key island. Fifteen years later, Lieutenant Pat Roberts, yours truly, went back to Iwo Jima with Lieutenant General Worsham and a contingent of survivors and veterans, and we toured the island. We not only toured Mount Suribachi and the caves and the end of the island, but also the Japanese cemetery to pay homage to those brave veterans as well.                              {time}  2040  And we were standing on top of Mount Suribachi. I will never forget this. All of the veterans of the people who were there at that particular time during the assault looked down at where we had cliffs and then Mount Suribachi and then knee-deep ashes on the beach. And the gentleman turned to me, tears streaming down his face and he said, it is a wonder that anybody ever really made it. It is a wonder anybody was really alive.  We toured the island, and we toured those caves where still the dead Japanese are there. And it was an amazing feat in terms of a military victory. Somehow, by persevering, somehow, by uncommon valor and at great cost both to Americans and Japanese, we saved lives and the end result by bringing this war to its proper conclusion.  I would like to say, as a former Marine, Semper fi, Dad. Semper fi, Marine Corps. Semper fi, America. God bless the United States Marine Corps.
