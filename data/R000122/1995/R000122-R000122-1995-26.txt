Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 117, the Senior Citizens Housing Safety and Economic Relief Act of 1995.  All too often, I have spoken with residents of my State's senior housing complexes who are concerned about their safety and quality of life. For too many, expectations of a quiet, all-elderly environment have gone unfulfilled because of a few drug abusing neighbors who are so disruptive that seniors are afraid to leave their apartments. Instead of enjoying the golden years of life with their contemporaries, our older citizens have been unable to live in the type of peaceful environment that was promised to them.  This legislation will clarify the current discrepancy in the mixed population language for section 8 housing. H.R. 117 will allow public housing officials to deny admission to persons whose use and abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs causes a severe threat to the security and well-being of our senior citizens. It establishes specific terms and conditions for leases with respect to termination of tenancy. The bill also provides for an expedited grievance hearing process before local public housing authorities, allowing these potential problems to be solved much quicker.  I believe that this legislation is an important step toward resolving this issue. For many, public or subsidized housing is the only opportunity for decent, affordable housing. We must continue to expand the supply of such housing for all Americans. Indeed, the root of the mixed-population issue is really the lack of affordable housing options in many of our communities. The final solution to this problem will come when we are able to provide adequate, decent, safe, and affordable housing for Americans of all ages.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and make our senior housing complexes safe again.
