Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions of a great educator, community leader, and good friend to all of Southwest Michigan, Dr. Charlotte Wenham. After thirty years of dedicated service to the students and community of St. Joseph, Michigan, Char is stepping down from her position as Assistant Superintendent of St. Joseph Public Schools.  Since 1968, Dr. Wenham has helped to shape young minds in the St. Joseph Public Schools. First at the head of the class as teacher, then at the head of a school as principal, finally spending the last few years heading an effort to develop innovative and creative programs, curriculum, and policies for the district.  While her talents will be missed, I am happy to report that she will be pursuing other interests in our community and will continue to lend her vast knowledge. While she may be changing roles, her dedication to students, to learning, and to creating a brighter tomorrow won't change.  Mr. Speaker, I know that all of my colleagues join me in wishing her many more happy and healthy years. On behalf of southwest Michigan, I would like to thank her for all of her service, dedication and commitment to St. Joseph.                          ____________________
