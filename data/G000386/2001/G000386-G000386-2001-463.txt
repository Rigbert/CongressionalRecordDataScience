 President, I yield myself the rest of the 18 seconds.  Remember, our amendment uses Medicare money for Medicare. Part A Medicare money is going to be used for Medicare. Part B Medicare money is going to be used for Medicare. We are even going to put general fund money in there to use for Medicare.  How much more do you want? We're putting medicare money aside for Medicare and we're putting extra money aside for Medicare. How much plainer can it be?
