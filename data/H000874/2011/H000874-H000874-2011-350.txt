Speaker, today, Senator Barbara Mikulski, my colleague from the State of Maryland, becomes the longest-serving woman Senator in American history. It's a fitting milestone for a public servant who has been a trailblazer for her entire career. From her beginnings as a social worker and community activist, Senator Mikulski's career has always been motivated by a deep commitment to open doors of opportunity, to serve the people of Maryland, and to carry their voices to Washington.  In 1986, Senator Mikulski became the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right, as well as the first woman elected to statewide office in Maryland's history. Since then, her constituents have returned her to office four times--a sign of the seriousness and skill she brings to her work in the Senate. For decades, Barbara Mikulski has been an inspiration and a role model to women in public life, mentoring generations of women leaders. I congratulate her on today's important milestone, and I wish her all the best in her continuing service to our State and its people.                          ____________________
