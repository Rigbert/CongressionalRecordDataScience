Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2366, the Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2000. In my view, the American tort system is a disaster. It resembles a wealth redistribution lottery more than an efficient system designed to compensate those injured by the wrongful acts of others. Our current system raises the prices of goods made in America, forces State and local governments to expend precious resources, and causes unwarranted personal anguish and damages reputations. Companies should be held responsible for truly negligent behavior resulting in actual harm. But a civil justice system that perpetuates the concept of ``joint and several liability'' and has no effective mechanism, such as a loser pays rule, to deter frivolous lawsuits is simply not just. I am pleased that H.R. 2366 takes the first step toward alleviating this problem. H.R. 2366 would eliminate joint and several liability of small business defendants for non-economic damages, such as pain and suffering, but would retain if for economic damages, such as medical expenses. This would partially relieve the situation where a small business defendant is held liable for damages far in excess of its actual responsibility.  I have been a longtime supporter of legislation to set uniform standards for product liability actions brought in State and Federal court. Inconsistencies within and among the States in rules of law governing product liability actions result in differences in State laws that may be inequitable with respect to plaintiffs and defendants, which, in turn, impose burdens on interstate commerce. Establishing uniform legal principles of liability for product seller, lessors, and renters will provide a fair balance among the interest of all parties in the chain of product manufacturing, distribution, and use, reduce costs and delays in product liability actions, and reduce the burdens on interstate commerce.  Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of this long overdue legislation.
