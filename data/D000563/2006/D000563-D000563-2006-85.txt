President, I rise today to join with my colleagues Senators Chambliss, Conrad, and Bayh in introducing the Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act.  Our bill would make it unlawful to intentionally disrupt the funeral of a U.S. military servicemember or veteran. Sadly, we have seen at least 129 such disruptions over the past 16 months by a group nominally calling itself a Christian church.
