 President, the present law states that deportation notices will be sent out in Spanish and English. The bill coming out of committee deletes this. So deportation notices would be sent out in English, essentially. There is no requirement in the law.  What we would do in this amendment is strike what is recommended and go back to present law, so that deportation notices are required to be sent out in Spanish and English. The reason is because the great majority of illegal immigrants penetrating across the Southwest border speak Spanish, and the overwhelming bulk of them do not speak English. Therefore, when they receive a deportation notice, they should be able to read it. So we would retain the language of present law.
