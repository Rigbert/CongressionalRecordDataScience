It is late at night. People do not want to talk about this. They want to go home. Some of us will go home and eat tuna salad. And if you eat tuna in your household, you bear some responsibility. You hope that your children will have that opportunity, and you hope that the fisheries around the world are going to be handled responsibly.  We passed a law here in 1997 and said: We are going to do what we can to conserve the dolphin which have become victims of those who are fishing for tuna--international convention, international agreement, dolphin conservation. And we said: If you happen to be one of the countries fishing for tuna that may endanger the dolphin, we are going to make you participate, spend some money to make sure this program works based on the percentage of your catch. That is a very reasonable program, conserving the dolphin, saying to each country: Pay your fair share based on what you catch.  I live in the Midwest. I do not live near an ocean. But I get it. I understand this. I just cannot understand why in this bill--before the amendment by the Senator from California--that we are suggesting the United States should pay more than its share.  There are countries here, for example, that are paying nothing.
