 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  Mr. Chairman, let me just make a couple of points. According to the Republican Committee on the Budget, the fossil fuel research program is largely corporate welfare and ineffective. According to the CBO, let me quote, ``The appropriateness of Federal Government funding for such research and development is questionable,'' CBO.  Mr. Chairman, I can understand why some of my good friends want to see this research, fossil fuel research, expanded. Thirty-eight percent of the money goes to two States. Weatherization goes to 50 States. The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that we are increasing funding for weatherization desperately needed. Hundreds of thousands of Americans cannot get into a program which saves them money and protects the environment. We are expanding money for other energy conservation programs, and we are putting more money in to programs that compensate local governments when the Federal Government is using their property, the PILT program.  Mr. Chairman, we are in the midst of a major energy crisis, the worst crisis this country has experienced in over 25 years. Let us stand with lower-income people all over this country. Let us help them weatherize the homes in which they are living. Let us stand with small communities all over this country who deserve fair PILT funding. Let us stand with those people who say we are doing nowhere near enough in terms of energy conservation.  This is a good amendment, and I urge its passage.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
