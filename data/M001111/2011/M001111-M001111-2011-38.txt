 President, as we celebrate the U.S. Navy's centennial of aviation, I would like to personally recognize the exceptional contributions of the men and women, past and present, who have served at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island.  From the base's commissioning day on September 21, 1942, to the present, it has been the mission-ready men and women of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island who have protected the skies of the Pacific Northwest and projected power throughout the world.  A long tradition of excellence began on Whidbey Island during World War II when it was named Ault Field, in memory of Commander William B. Ault who was missing in action following the Battle of the Coral Sea. During the war, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island's patrol planes flew long-range navigation training missions over the North Pacific to protect the Pacific Northwest from the real threat of attack that gripped Alaska and the region. During this period, the earliest squadrons of F4F Wildcats, PV-1 Venturas, F6F Hellcats and SDB Dauntless's, also etched their place in U.S. Navy's distinguished history.  Naval Air Station Whidbey Island continued their legacy of excellence throughout each subsequent conflict. Their patrol planes proved to be paramount to successful operations during the Korean War and their initial deployments to Southeast Asia in 1972. Today, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island remains the premier naval aviation installation in the Pacific Northwest.  Currently the proud home of the EA-6B Prowlers, EA-18G Growlers, P-3 Orions and the EP-3E Aries, I know Naval Air Station Whidbey Island will continue to protect not only the Pacific Northwest, but the whole United States, for the next 100 years.  In recognition of the past century's naval aviation achievements, I would truly like to thank the men and women both in and out of uniform and the veterans of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island for their service and sacrifice.                          ____________________
