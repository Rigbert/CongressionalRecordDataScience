 President, David Packard is a legend in California, and will forever remain a treasured part of California's proud history.  A man of humble beginnings, through sheer ingenuity and determination, David Packard became one of the most influential entrepreneurs in American business.  One of the original cofounders of computer giant Hewlett-Packard, he was considered the patriarch of hi-tech's famed Silicon Valley. His innovation sparked the technology revolution that put California on the map as the information leader of the world.  But it was his leadership that inspired generations of hi-tech wizards to break new ground and reach new heights. He truly believed that nothing was impossible if the spirit to succeed was there. And David Packard believed in the American spirit.  David Packard set a standard of excellence for business schools all over the world with his ideas of ``management by objective'' and ``management by walking around.''  And he put a human face on success by never climbing out of the reach of the people who worked for him. ``The HP Way'' broke barriers between management and employees, fostering teamwork and a pride of ownership that reached every level of his company.  David Packard also served his country as Deputy Secretary of Defense under President Nixon, and, with his wife Lucile, was unmatched as our Nation's most dedicated and generous philanthropist. The David and LucilePackard Foundation last year distributed more than $116 million to more than 700 recipients.  His contributions to Stanford University, my alma mater, leave a legacy that will touch many future generations, who will stand on his shoulders and continue to lead this Nation to new heights of excellence, compassion, and greatness.  David Packard will be sorely missed.
