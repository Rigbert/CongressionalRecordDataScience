Chairman, I have 3\1/2\ minutes left and understand I have the right to close. What I would like to do is to yield that 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York before he seeks recognition, and would simply emphasize to the membership that I am doing this as a courtesy. I am in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. But I would yield my remaining time to the gentleman from New York.
