President, as in legislation session, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 1615; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
