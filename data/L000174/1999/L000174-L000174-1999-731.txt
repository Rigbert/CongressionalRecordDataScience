President, this past Sunday marked the beginning of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year to focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims. I am pleased to take this opportunity to introduce legislation with my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and our cosponsors, Senators Sarbanes, Kerry, Harkin, and Murray. Our ``Crime Victims Assistance Act'' represents the next step in our continuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of crime.  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont, and witnessed first hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized.  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution to provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past 15 years, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have included: the Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982; the Victims of Crime Act of 1984; the Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act; the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996; the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997; and the Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act.  Also, on the first day of this session, we introduced S.9, a youth crime bill. In that legislation, which we have identified as a legislative priority for the entire Democratic caucus, we included provisions for victims of juvenile crime so that their rights to appear, to be heard, and to be informed would be protected. The recent tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, was only the most recent reminder of the urgent need to enhance protections for these victims, to ensure that their voices are heard.  The legislation that we introduce today, the ``Crime Victims Assistance Act,'' builds upon this progress. It provides for a wholesale reform of the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime.  Particularly, the legislation would provide crime victims with an enhanced: right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention; right to be heard on plea bargains; right to a speedy trial; right to be present in the courtroom throughout a trial; right to give a statement at sentencing; right to be heard on probation revocation; and right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison.  The legislation goes further than other victims rights proposals that are currently before Congress by including: enhanced penalties for witness intimidation; an increase in Federal victim assistance personnel; enhanced training for State and local law enforcement and officers of the Court; the development of state-of-the-art systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments in their cases; the establishment of ombudsman programs for crime victims; the establishment of pilot programs that implement balanced and restorative justice models; and more direct and effective Federal assistance to victims of international terrorism, including victims of the Lockerbie bombing and other terrorist acts occurring prior to passage of the Victims of Crime Act.  These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year with a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not overcome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to amend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of implementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of crime victims.  The Judiciary Committee has already held another hearing this year on a proposed constitutional amendment regarding crime victims. Previous hearings on this proposal were held in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Unfortunately, the Committee has devoted not a minute to consideration of legislative initiatives like the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which Senator Kennedy and I have introduced over the past years to assist crime victims and better protect their rights. Like many other deserving initiatives, it has taken a back seat to the constitutional amendment debate that continues.  I regret that we did not do more for victims last year or the year before. Over the course of that time, I have noted my concern that we not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing exclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I mustnote that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and many opportunities for progress have been squandered.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can most effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and State legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights over the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make additional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice and rights that crime victims deserve.  I would like to acknowledge several groups and individuals who have been extremely helpful with regards to the legislation that we are introducing today: The Office for Victims of Crime at the Justice Department; the National Network to End Domestic Violence; the NOW Legal Defense Fund; the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women; the National Victim Center; the National Organization for Victim Assistance; Professor Lynne Henderson of Indiana Law School; and Roger Pilon, Director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute.  While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs and made advances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have more to do. That is why it is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, supporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment on this issue, will join in advancing this important legislation through Congress. We can make a difference in the lives of crime victims right now, and I hope Congress will make it a top priority and pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act before the end of the year.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 934       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, amounts collected pursuant to sections 3729 through 3731      of title 31, United States Code (commonly known as the      ``False Claims Act''), may be used by the Office of Victims      of Crime to make grants to States, units of local government,      and qualified private entities for the establishment of pilot      programs that implement balanced and restorative justice      models.       (b) Definition of Balanced and Restorative Justice Model.--     In this section, the term ``balanced and restorative justice      model'' means an approach to criminal justice that promotes      the maximum degree of involvement by a victim, offender, and      the community served by a criminal justice system by allowing      the criminal justice system and related criminal justice      agencies to improve the capacity of the system and agencies      to--       (1) protect the community served by the system and      agencies; and       (2) ensure accountability of the offender and the system.     SEC. 208. VICTIMS OF TERRORISM.       (a) In General.--Section 1404B of the Victims of Crime Act      of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10603b) is amended to read as follows:     ``SEC. 1404B. COMPENSATION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS OF                    TERRORISM OR MASS VIOLENCE.       ``(a) In General.--The Director may make grants, as      provided in either section 1402(d)(4)(B) or 1404--       ``(1) to States, which shall be used for eligible crime      victim compensation and assistance programs for the benefit      of victims described in subsection (b); and       ``(2) to victim service organizations, and public agencies      that provide emergency or ongoing assistance to victims of      crime, which shall be used to provide, for the benefit of      victims described in subsection (b)--       ``(A) emergency relief (including compensation, assistance,      and crisis response) and other related victim services; and       ``(B) emergency response training and technical assistance.       ``(b) Victims Described.--Victims described in this      subsection are victims of a terrorist act or mass violence,      whether occurring within or outside the United States, who      are--       ``(1) citizens or employees of the United States; and       ``(2) not eligible for compensation under title VIII of the      Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.''.       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by this section      applies to any terrorist act or mass violence occurring on or      after December 20, 1989.                                  ____     Section-by-Section Summary of the Crime Victims Assistance Act             TITLE I--VICTIMS RIGHTS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM       Title I reforms federal law and the federal rules of      evidence to provide enhanced protections to victims of      federal crime, from the time of the defendant's arrest      through sentencing, including post-sentencing hearings.     Subtitle A. Amendments to Title 18       Sec. 101. Right to be Notified of Detention Hearing and            Right to be Heard on the Issue of Detention       Section 101 amends federal law to establish a victim's      right to be notified of a detention hearing, to attend the      detention hearing, and be heard on the issue of detention. No      such right currently exists in federal law.       In cases where identification of the defendant remains at      issue, section 101 provides flexibility to the presiding      judge to protect the integrity of the identification.       Sec. 102. Right to a Speedy Trial and Prompt Disposition            Free From Unreasonable Delay       Section 102 amends the Speedy Trial Act to require the      Court to take into account the interests of the victim in the      prompt and appropriate disposition of the case, free from      unreasonable delay when considering a motion to continue a      trial.       Sec. 103. Enhanced Right to Order of Restitution       Section 103 amends federal law to ensure that the victim      has the right to attend a sentencing hearing and to make a      statement to the court at sentencing.       Sec. 104. Right to be Notified of Escape or Release from            Prison       Section 104 amends the Victims Rights and Restitution Act      of 1990 to expand the victim's right to be notified of an      offender's release or escape from custody. Specifically, this      section clarifies that a victim has the right to be notified      of the offender's escape or release from a psychiatric      institution. Current law does not address this potentially      critical issue.       Sec. 105. Enhanced Penalties for Witness Tampering       Section 105 amends a federal witness tampering statute (18      U.S.C. Sec. 1512) to raise the statutory maximum penalties in      witness tampering cases involving the use or threatened use      of physical force from 10 years to 20 years.     Subtitle B. Amendments to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure       Sec. 121. Right to be Notified of Plea Agreement and to be            Heard on Merits of the Plea Agreement       Section 121 (a) amends Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of      Criminal Procedure (governing pleas) to require the      government to make a reasonable effort to notify the victim      of an upcoming plea hearing, and of the victim's right to be      heard at the plea hearing. In cases involving more than 15      victims, the Court, after consultation with the government      and the victims, may appoint a number of victims as      representatives of the victims' interests.       Section 121 (b) provides a timetable for the implementation      of the amendments to Rule 11, taking into consideration the      recommendations of the United States Judicial Conference.       Sec. 122. Enhanced Rights of Notification and Allocution at            Sentencing       Section 122 (a) amends Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of      Criminal Procedures (Sentencing) to provide for enhanced      opportunities for victims to participate in the criminal      sentencing process. Specifically, section 122(a) amends Rule      32 to require that presentence reports contain very specific      information about victim impact. Probation officers are      required to make reasonable efforts to notify the victim      about the preparation of the presentence reports, and must      provide victims with an opportunity to submit oral or written      statements, including statements on audio or videotape,      describing the impact of the offense on the victim. In      addition, Rule 32 is amended to require the government to      make a reasonable effort to notify the victim of the time and      place of sentencing, and the victim's right to be heard at      sentencing. These provisions are intended to insure that      victims remain actively involved throughout the criminal      process.       Section 122(b) provides a timetable for the implementation      of the amendments to Rule 32, taking into consideration the      recommendations of the United States Judicial Conference.       Sec. 123. Rights of Notification and Allocution At a            Probation Revocation Hearing       Section 123(a) amends Rule 32.1 of the Federal Rules of      Criminal Procedure (Probation Revocation or Modification of      Supervised Release) to provide enhanced opportunities for      victims to be notified of and participate in revocation      hearings. Often times, when a defendant is taken into custody      for violating conditions of release or conditions of      probation, a victim is unaware of these important      developments. Section 123 (a) amends Rule 32.1 to direct the      government to make a reasonable effort to notify the victim      of the impending revocation hearing, and to notify the victim      of his or her right to attend the hearing and address the      court.       Section 123(b) provides a timetable for the implementation      of the amendments to Rule 32.1, taking into consideration the      recommendations of the United States Judicial Conference.     Subtitle C. Amendment to Federal Rules of Evidence       Sec. 131. Enhanced Right to Be Present At Trial       Section 131 amends Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of      Evidence (Witness Sequestration) to establish a statutory      right for crime victims to attend court proceedings,      including trials. Currently, victims are routinely prevented      from being present at trials, except during their own      testimony. Section 131(a) amends Rule 615 to permit crime      victims to attend trials and other court proceedings, unless      the court makes a finding that the testimony of the person      will be materially affected by hearing the testimony of other      witnesses, and the material effect will result in unfair      prejudice to any party, or that due to large numbers of      victims or family members of victims who may be called as      witnesses, permitting attendance in the courtroom when      testimony is being heard is not feasible.       Section 131(b) provides a timetable for the implementation      of the amendment to Rule 615, taking into consideration the      recommendations of the United States Judicial Conference.     Subtitle D. Remedies for Noncompliance       Sec. 141. Remedies for Noncompliance       Section 141 establishes a mechanism for addressing      violations of the newly created statutory rights of crime      victims. Section 141(a) clarifies that no party can file a      civil action for damages or injunctive relief against the      U.S., any employee of the U.S., any officer of the court, nor      any entity contracting with the U.S., for failure to comply      with any amendment in this Act.       Section 141(b) directs the Attorney General and the Chair      of the U.S. Parole Commission to establish a workable      regulatory scheme that will permit the effective      administrative enforcement of victims rights. These      regulations must contain disciplinary sanctions, including      termination for employees of the Department of Justice who      willfully violate or refuse to comply with Federal provisions      pertaining to the treatment of victims of crime. These      regulations must also include an administrative procedure      through which formal complaints with the Department of      Justice alleging violations of this title can be filed. Under      the proposed administrative scheme a complainant is      prohibited from recovering any monetary damages against the      United States.       This subsection states that the Attorney General is the      ultimate arbiter of the complaint, and there will be no      judicial review of the final decision of the Attorney      General.                TITLE II--VICTIM ASSISTANCE INITIATIVES       Title II contains a series of provisions designed primarily      to assist victims of state crime, and to ensure that victims      participate in the criminal process to the maximum extent.       Sec. 201. Increase in Victim Assistance Personnel       Section 201 authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may      be necessary to enable the Attorney General to provide grants      through the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) to qualified      private entities to fund 50 victim-witness advocate      positions, who can assist victims of state crimes.       This section also authorizes to be appropriated such sums      as may be necessary to enable the Attorney General to hire 50      full-time (or full-time equivalent) employees to serve as      victim-witness advocates to provide assistance to victims of      any federal criminal offense investigation.       Sec. 202. Increased Training for State and Local Law            Enforcement, State Court Personnel, and Officers of the            Court to Respond Effectively to the Needs of Victims of            Crime       Section 202 provides that funds collected pursuant to the      False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731) may be used by OVC to      make grants to States, units of local government, and      qualified private entities, to provide training and      information to prosecutors, judges, law enforcement officers,      probation officers, and other officers and employees of      Federal and State court in order to assist them in responding      effectively to the needs of victims of crime.       Sec. 203. Increased Resources for State and Local Law            Enforcement Agencies, Courts, and Prosecutors' Offices            to Develop State-of-the-Art Systems for Notifying            Victims of Crime of Important Dates and Developments       Section 203 amends subtitle A of title 23 of the Violent      Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-322;      108 Stat. 2077) by authorizing to be appropriated such sums      as may be necessary to OVC to fund grants to State and local      prosecutors' offices, State courts, county jails, State      correctional institutions, and qualified private entities, to      develop and implement state-of-the-art systems for notifying      victims of crime of important dates and developments relating      to the criminal proceedings at issue.       Section 203 authorizes funds collected pursuant to the      False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731) to be used for these      grants.       This section also amends Section 310004(d) of the Violent      Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to permit funds      from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund to be used for      grants outlined in this section.       Sec. 204. Pilot Programs to Establish Ombudsman Programs            for Crime Victims       Section 204 authorizes pilot programs designed to establish      innovative programs to assist victims of both federal and      state crime in vindicating their rights. All too frequently,      victims do not have a sufficient voice during the criminal      process. Some localities have responded to this problem by      creating ombudsman programs wherein independent officers are      established whose function is to represent the victim's      interests. These ombudsmen will educate prosecutors and      judges as to their victim-related responsibilities, and will      provide helpful guidance and support to crime victims      themselves. These programs have shown considerable promise in      a number of cities.       Section 204 authorizes the creation of these ombudsman      programs. Subsection (a) sets out definitions of the terms      ``director,'' ``office,'' ``qualified private entity,''      ``qualified unit of State or local government,'' and ``VOICE      Centers'' for the purposes of this section.       Subsection (b) provides that within a year after the      enactment of this Act, the Attorney General (acting through      the Director of OVC) will establish pilot programs to operate      Victim Ombudsman Information Centers (``VOICE'' Centers) in      Iowa, Massachusetts, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, and Vermont.       This subsection also authorizes the Attorney General to      enter into agreement with and provide for a grant to assist a      qualified private entity or unit of State or local government      in carrying out the pilot program. The agreement shall      specify that the VOICE Center shall, excepting applicable      requirements of this section, operate independently of OVC,      and OVC shall have no supervisory or decision making      authority over the day-to-day operations of a VOICE Center.      The purpose of this provision is to ensure that VOICE centers      operate independently.       Subsection (c) provides that the mission of each VOICE      Center shall be to ensure that victims of Federal or State      crimes are fully appraised of the rights of victims and that      the victims participate in the criminal justice process to      the fullest extent of the law.       This subsection also sets out the duties of the VOICE      Centers. The duties include providing information to victims      concerning their right to participate in the criminal justice      process; identifying and responding to situations in which      rights of victims of crime may have been violated; attempting      to rectify violations of victims' rights; educating police,      prosecutors, court officials, and employees of jails and      prisons about the rights of victims; and taking measures to      ensure victims are treated with respect, dignity, and      compassion during the justice process.       Subsection (d) authorizes OVC to provide technical      assistance to each VOICE Center. Each pilot VOICE Center      shall submit an annual report to the Director of OVC      detailing the activities of the VOICE Center and the      strategic plan for the following year.       Subsection (e) provides that within two years of each VOICE      Center's pilot program establishment, the Comptroller General      of the U.S. shall review their effectiveness in carrying out      their mission and duties as described in subsection (c). This      subsection also requires that within two years of each VOICE      Center's pilot program establishment, the Attorney General      shall have private entities study the effectiveness of the      VOICE Centers in carrying out their mission and duties as      described in subsection (c).       Subsection (f) states that the pilot program shall      terminate 4 years after the date of enactment of the Act. If      the Attorney General determines that any of the pilot      programs should be renewed for an additional period, they may      be renewable for up to two years.       Subsection (g) authorizes an amount not to exceed      $5,000,000 of the amounts collected pursuant to the False      Claims Act to be used by the Director of OVC to make grants      to fund the pilot programs.       Sec. 205. Amendments to Victims of Crime Act of 1994       Section 205 provides for various improvements in the      program of federal support for victim assistance and      compensation under the Victims of Crime Act.       Subsection (a) authorizes the receipt of private donations      to the Crime Victims Fund. It also provides that unobligated      funds transferred to the judicial branch for the      establishment of the (now defunct) National Fine Center are      to be returned to the Crime Victims Fund and may be used for      the benefit of federal crime victims. Moreover, it requires      states to return to the Crime Victims Fund amounts for which      they are reimbursed under subrogation provisions as a result      of third party payments to victims, or where the state has      received supplemental funding for incidents of terrorism or      mass violence. This will help replenish the funds available      for assistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence.       Subsection (b) changes the minimum threshold for the annual      grant that the Director shall make from the Fund to an      eligible crime victim compensation program. The change is      from 40 percent of the amounts awarded during the preceding      fiscal year to 60 percent.       Subsection (b) also enhances authority and support for      demonstration projects, training, technical assistance, and      program evaluation, and clarifies that compensation will not      be denied to any victim because the identity of the offender      was not determined beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal      trial or because criminal charges were not brought against      the offender.       Subsection (c) clarifies that the Director may enter into      cooperative agreements in addition to making grants; that      such cooperative agreements or grants may be for evaluation      purposes and training and technical assistance that address      the significance of and effective delivery strategies for      providing long-term psychological care; that the Director may      use funds for fellowships, clinical internships, and programs      of training and special workshops for the presentation and      dissemination of information resulting from demonstrations,      surveys, and special projects. Subsection (c) also tightens      some of the definitions in the Victims of Crime Act.       Sec. 206. Services for Victims of Crime and Domestic            Violence       Section 206 directs that a specified statute not be      construed to prohibit a recipient from using funds derived      from a source other than the Legal Services Corporation to      provide related legal assistance to any person with whom an      alien has a relationship covered by the domestic violence      laws of the State in which the alien resides or in which an      incidence of violence occurred.       Sec. 207. Pilot Program to Study Effectiveness of            Restorative Justice Approach on Behalf of Victims of            Crime       Section 207 authorizes the use of funds collected under the      False Claims Act by OVC to make grants to States, units of      local government, and qualified private entities for the      establishment of pilot programs that implement balanced and      restorative justice models.       Sec. 208. Victims of Terrorism       Section 208 clarifies the intent of the antiterrorism      amendment to the Victims of Crime Act by enabling OVC to      assist the victims of terrorist acts or mass violence      occurring outside the United States and authorizing it to      provide funding directly to non-profits and other Federal      agencies, medical and mental health organizations and others      in response to such victims' needs.       Section 208 will also enable OVC to provide assistance to      the victims of terrorist acts or mass violence occurring      prior to the passage of the Victims of Crime Act, but on or      after December 20, 1989. This will allow OVC to assist the      family members of those killed in the bombing of Pan Am 103.      These family members reside in various states around the      country including Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut,      Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,      Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,      Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia,      Washington, and West Virginia.
