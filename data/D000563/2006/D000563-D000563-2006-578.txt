President, I ask another question of the minority leader. I would like to do something that is maybe unprecedented in the modern history of the Senate. We might even meet on Monday. How about a Friday? How about giving 12 hours of our life on a Friday for the millions of Americans who are desperate for this medical research to bring hope to their families and their children. It would be unprecedented, would it not--I ask the minority leader from Nevada--for us to actually say: All right. This is so important that we will take 12 hours on a Friday or 12 hours on a Saturday. How about that? The Senate would actually meet for 12 hours straight on Saturday and send this bill to the President, if we could muster the 60 votes on a bipartisan basis. I can't speak for our caucus, but I am prepared to stay. Pick the day. Let us take the 12 hours, let us meet at 9 o'clock in the morning and stay until 9 o'clock at night and get it finished.  Would the leader from Nevada believe that to be a radical suggestion?
