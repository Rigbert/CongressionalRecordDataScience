Speaker, I rise today to give recognition to Erich Seehafer for his 23 years of service to the United States House of Representatives.  Hired by the Doorkeeper's Office in April 1978, Erich began as a Congressional liaison for the House Publications Distribution Service. In addition to orienting new members and their staffers to available services, he was responsible for allotment and distribution of various books and publications to all House Members.  In 1991 he was selected to be part of the new mail list processing office. This role was an ideal opportunity for a detailed-oriented person like Erich to serve the House Members by processing and expediting their mass mailing requests. Erich has processed over 6,000 mailing lists totaling over 350 million addresses without error.  Born at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, DC on July 23, 1951, Erich is the son of Erich Seehafer Sr. and Charlotte Hennessy Seehafer. He has three sisters, a wife of sixteen years, one stepson and two grandsons. He and his wife have resided in Waldorf, Maryland since 1985.  A motorcycle accident in 1970 resulted in a spinal cord injury that left Erich a paraplegic. Erich's determination and cheerful outlook have endeared him to many in the Hill community. His sense of humor has always been a welcome asset to all who have worked with him.  A musician of thirty-five years, Erich has played music in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and the District of Columbia. He is looking forward to traveling around playing music again with the extra time he will endure during his retirement. We wish him well and a long happy retirement.  I submit the following for the Record.                                                     Office of the                                 Chief Administrative Officer,                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2001.     Hon. Steny Hoyer,     Longworth House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Hoyer: Thank you for taking the time to      include this in your extension of remarks to recognize Erich      Seehafer for his 23 years of service to the U.S. House of      Representatives.

In 1991 he was selected to be part of the new Mail List      Processing Office. This role was an ideal opportunity for a      detailed-oriented person like Erich to serve the House      Members by processing and expediting their mass mailing      requests.
