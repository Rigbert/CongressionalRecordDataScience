 President, my good friend, the majority leader, should feel good about this. We are on the cusp of a very significant piece of legislation worked out on a bipartisan basis. I, too, feel grateful to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for their endless number of hours in crafting this truly bipartisan compromise.  So I think it is something the Senate can be proud of achieving. We are set up to reach that achievement on Tuesday.  I yield the floor.
