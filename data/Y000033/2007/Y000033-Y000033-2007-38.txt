I am thankful for the comments of the previous speaker, and of course the ranking member. I'm disappointed in those that are offering this amendment.  The supporters of this amendment and the proposer of this amendment like to believe that Chicken Little threats have been thrown about. Instead of the sky falling, it's the Earth warming, and bears are in extreme danger of extinction and we must act now. I just heard that speaker from Washington say that.  Let's take care. Polar bears are not threatened; they're not endangered. The worldwide population of polar bears is around 30,000. While there may be polar bear populations feeling the effects of a warming climate, and I say ``may,'' we need to remember these species have survived past warming cycles.
