I wish the gentleman would not take down the chart, because I want to read from his very beautiful chart. He read 1990, 51; 1991, 36 days; 1992, 57 days; 1993, 5 days; 1994, 41 days, then came 1995 which, of course, we passed in 1994, the last year the Democrats were in charge. And he gave correctly the credit to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) for having 0 days, but then he stopped.  As I read the gentleman's chart, the next year, which was the first year that the Republicans were in charge, the gentleman, of course, was not chairman of the Committee on Appropriations at that point in time, we were at 208 days, which was more than all the other years combined that the gentleman read. I wondered why the gentleman stopped at that.
