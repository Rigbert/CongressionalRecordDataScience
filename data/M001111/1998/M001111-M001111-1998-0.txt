 President, earlier today, we passed an Omnibus Appropriations bill that expressed importantCongressional intent regarding the education of American children. By passing legislation to reduce class size in public schools, we are doing something concrete, common-sense, and effective to improve the quality of education across America. I am very proud of this Congress today.  But although there has been plenty of attention this last week devoted to the issue of class size reduction through helping local school districts to hire qualified teachers, I feel we are in danger of overlooking the true significance of the policy and funding we have passed here today.  By making this investment, which we will be increasing over the next several years, we are sending an important message to every community in this nation. The message is ``we have been listening. We have heard you. You've been saying that class size reduction is important because it makes a tangible difference in real-world public schools.''  This new law will not solve every problem in every school in America; that is not the appropriate federal role. Local communities make the decisions that improve local schools. The federal role is to support local decisions. I want people to know that Congress is finally listening; this place is starting to ring with your voice. This class size effort will help jump-start discussions in every local community and every state legislature--where the class size decisions that affect all schools will be made. And, this appropriations bill puts us all on the road to doing something tangible to helping the students in America's schools.  Some in Congress have made the argument: ``who do you trust to make decisions regarding the education of your children, your local educators and school boards, or some faceless bureaucrat in Washington, D.C.?''  For 5 years, I was a school board member in the Shoreline School District. I saw first-hand how every decision gets made in a school district, including how many teachers get hired, and what the budget will be for supplies, and what changes will be made to the bus schedule. And in those years and all the years since, I have heard local citizens say about the laws that affect their schools that they want their government to learn how to listen to the people it represents.  I have not heard people say that the government should walk away from its responsibilities, to support the children in public schools across America. I have not heard people advocate that the federal government should ignore its responsibility to prevent unfair treatment, or that it should ignore national priorities.  I have heard many times, however, parents and other local citizens ask very loudly for government to set goals, to get us on the right path, to do what works, to streamline its efforts, and to invest in common-sense solutions.  At the top of this list is class size reduction. Class size is common-sense, and it does work.  The research shows it:  A 1989 study of the Tennessee STAR program, which compared the performance of students in grades K-3 in small and regular-sized classes, found that students in small classes (13 to 17 students) significantly outperformed other students in math and reading, every year, at all grade levels, across all geographic areas.  A follow-up study of the STAR program in 1995 found that students in small classes in grades K-3 continued to outperform their peers at least through grade 8, with achievement advantages especially large for minority students.  Other state and local studies have since found that students in smaller classes outperform their peers in reading and math, perform as well or better than students in magnet or voucher schools, and that gains are especially significant among African-American males.  A 1997 national study by Educational Testing Service found that smaller class size raises average achievement for students in fourth- and eighth-grade math, especially for low-income students in ``high-cost'' regions.  Particularly of note in the 1997 ETS study was the finding that in eighth-grade, the achievement effect comes about through the better discipline and learning environment smaller class size produces. As policy-makers try to make decisions that will affect students in the critical years of middle-school, class size makes a difference in terms of both behavior and academic achievement.  In addition, state organizations representing thousands of local educators know that hiring more high-qualified teachers to reduce class size works:  Larry Swift, Executive Director Emeritus of the Washington State School Directors' Association says it well:       As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for all      of our students, it becomes increasingly important that all      of our resources be used efficiently and effectively. The      most valuable resource in today's schools is the people who      devote their time and effort to make schools successful--the      teachers. Reducing the ratio of students to adults is      particularly critical for youngsters with a variety of      learning challenges that must be overcome if those students      are to meet the new, higher learning standards.  Kenneth Winkes, with the Washington Association of School Principals says:       It is increasingly evident that students entering our      schools have diverse and unique needs which can only be      addressed by principals, teachers, and support personnel who      are not overwhelmed by crowded classrooms. Rather, educators      must be able to devote attention to each student in smaller,      more manageable classes.  Lee Ann Prielipp, President of the Washington Education Association says: ``When educators have too many students in a class, it is hard for them to give each student the individual attention that students need. It is this individual attention that is at the heart of the learning process, and it is crucial in helping our students succeed.''  And, as I've pointed out before, students themselves have thoughts about the importance of class size reduction:  Brooke Bodnar, age 16, recently moved from a school with larger classes to Olympia High School, which has smaller classes. She says: ``. . . with smaller classes I'm learning so much more. Class is going so much faster.''  Jared Stueckle, age 16, a junior at Selah High School, believes that education should be a higher priority in funding, and that class size is a good investment. Jared says: ``The classes in which the number (of students) is lower I generally do better, but in a crowded class, the teacher does not give us enough individual attention.''  Meghan Sullivan, age 15, a 10th grader at Tumwater High School, says: ``. . . reduction is needed especially at the K-5 grade levels. This is the beginning of their education and this is where they form study habits and learning skills, so it's more important to get some one-on-one contact with teachers.''  Antonella Novi, age 18, a senior at Anacortes High School, says:  ``Smaller class sizes enrich the learning experience for the student and the teaching experience for the teacher.''  Jaime Oberlander, age 16, a junior at Tumwater High School, says:  ``I know that I have learned more in smaller classes. I have a stronger relationship with the teacher. I am less intimidated to participate in class discussions or ask for help when I need it. I also receive more feedback from my teacher . . . my teacher can spend more time critiquing my work and helping me to learn.''  The American people have said over and over how important class size reduction is to them. When students start school in the fall, parents usually ask two questions: ``Who is my child's teacher?'' and ``How many students will be in my child's class?'' This is because, next to parents and family, the teacher is one of the most important adults in every child's life. We want that teacher to be the best-trained, most-qualified person available. And, we want the number of students in class to be manageable, so each student has access to the teacher, and the teacher is not reduced to doing ``crowd control.''  Qualified teachers in small classes can provide students with more individualized attention, spend more time on instruction and less on discipline and other tasks, cover more material more effectively, and work more closely with parents. Today Congress has done something significant and important--taken the first step to helping local communities increase the number and quality of the teachers in America's schools.  I want to thank all those who helped this happen, from the President and his staff, to Secretary Riley and those who work so diligently, to Senator Daschle and our Democratic Leadership in both the Senate and the House. I want to particularly thank Senator Harkin, who worked with me on a strategy to turn the early defeat of the Administration's larger class size proposal into a one-year version, funded through an existing program--a clear victory for every student in America. I also want to especially thank Senator Ted Kennedy for his stalwart efforts to negotiate the final elements of this bill in consultation with me. His work is always excellent, here particularly so.  And I'd like to single out the people who joined me as co-sponsors of my bill, the Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Improvement Act of 1998: Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Daschle, Moseley-Braun, Boxer, Levin, Robb, Lieberman, Reed, Lautenberg, Landrieu, Torricelli, Bryan, Kerry, Akaka, Glenn, Bingaman, and Mikulski. And I would like to thank Senator Russ Feingold who has given so much time and attention to the issue of class size reduction, and recognizing local efforts.  Finally, I would like to thank a few key staff people who worked on this issue all year: Marsha Simon, Ellen Murray, and Bettilou Taylor from the Appropriations Committee staff and Bev Schroeder with Senator Harkin, Joan Huffer with Senator Daschle, and Danica Petroshius with Senator Kennedy and Amy Abraham with the Budget Committee. I would also like to thank Greg Williamson, Micki Aronson, April Graff, Kennie Endelman and Minerva Lopez with my staff.  As with all things, the class size legislation would not have passed without the efforts of many, many people all working with determination, willing to make compromises on details and get to the important goals.  On other educational issues, we have also made progress this year. The funding levels for adult and family literacy programs have seen modest improvement--something I've worked hard for, and something that needs more improvement. And children's literacy has seen an important first step, in passage and funding for the Reading Excellence Act. Reading efforts around the country and in my state should look on this national attention to reading as the first step to further support.  On education technology, we have made such important investments. Not only did we fund $75 million for teacher technology training for pre-service teachers, but this year we passed the Higher Education Act, which includes my Teacher Technology Training bill, and we have provided another $75 million to fund the partnerships that will make the new law possible in every local community.  On funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, we have included the $500 million I asked for in my budget amendment earlier this year, and we did not have to jeopardize other educational priorities to do it. In addition, by including special education teachers in the class size proposal, we have taken important steps to helping local communities deal with the important educational needs of all students.  There were also mis-steps in this bill--cuts to our schools that did not need to happen, negative language that will stir up unnecessary ill-feelings, or funding shifts, such as the one under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, that should have been done in a way more reflective of local expertise. But all in all this is a good bill for education, and puts us on the right path.  The Americans I talk to about education funding usually cannot believe that education is really a priority in Congress. After all, only 1.8 percent of overall education spending goes to education. This is the next great challenge. People want Congress to live up to its responsibilities, to look at its priorities, and to listen to people in communities across this great nation. This year, we made some important investments. Next year, we reauthorize the major K-12 education laws. We must look to all of these processes with respect for local knowledge, with bipartisanship, and with a steadfast determination to making education better for all students.
