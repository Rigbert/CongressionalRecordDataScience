 President, today I would like to recognize the accomplishment of a particularly talented student from my home State of Iowa. Rebekah Frese has been chosen to present her National History Day documentary, ``Boarding the Freedom Train: The Underground Railroad in Iowa,'' at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. I congratulate her on this achievement and commend her for her hard work and determination in creating such a wonderful project.  Rebekah's documentary highlights the significant role Iowa and Iowans played in the effort to ensure the safety of escaped slaves prior to the American Civil War. She is a student at the Lenihan Intermediate School in Melbourne, IA and was selected as one of 22 presenters out of 2000 finalists that attended the National History Day national contest at the University of Maryland June 10 to 14.  In Iowa, we take great pride in our educational system, and it is personally rewarding when one of our students sets themselves apart at the national level. Programs such as National History Day give students opportunities to succeed through hard work and determination, encouraging what is at the heart of the American spirit. I appreciate National History Day and its commitment to improving the teaching and learning of American history in our schools.  I would also like to take this opportunity to make special mention of teachers Millie Frese and Karen Roessler, who offered their assistance and encouragement to Rebekah while undertaking this difficult project. Quality teachers like these motivate and inspire students to push themselves to realize their potential. By helping to shape citizens and future leaders, teachers like Millie Frese and Karen Roessler are indispensable parts of our democracy. Once again, congratulations, Rebekah, for your first-class work bringing greater awareness to Iowa's role in the Underground Railroad.                          ____________________
