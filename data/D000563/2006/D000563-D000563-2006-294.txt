President, I am going to ask unanimous consent, but I will make it clear that if there is any modification at a later point that Senator Allen suggests, I will be glad to work with him. I believe this is our understanding based on the colloquy we had.  I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4883, Senator Allen's amendment, be shown as the Allen-Durbin amendment and that my cosponsors be added as cosponsors to this amendment. My amendment No. 4884 and Senator Allen's are identical.
