It turned out there were teachers in so-called ``core academic subjects'' without college degrees. Those subjects include English, reading, and language arts, math, science, foreign language, civics and government, economics, art, history, and geography. That is the definition of core academic subjects. And the teachers in many voucher schools did not meet those requirements.  I might also say to the Senator from Nevada that my wife and I made a personal decision to send our children to Catholic schools, knowing we would be paying public property taxes in my hometown of Springfield, IL, to support public education, and we had an additional financial burden on our family to pay for tuition, as you have. We accepted that burden, and I believe it is part of the bargain. We support public education, but we made a family decision to pay for our kids to go to Catholic schools.  I have supported public school referenda throughout my time in my hometown. I believe public education is the core when it comes to the development of the community. In my hometown of East St. Louis, when the public schools went to Haiti, the Catholic schools followed quickly behind. They are all in this together.  Madam President, I know we have run out of time.                          ____________________
