  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that Section 2202 of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act was not included because the Senate wants to cut substance abuse treatment, prevention, education and research programs. After all, when the Senate unanimously passed S. 304, the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act, which Senators Hatch, Leahy and I introduced, it went on record supporting an increase in funding for demand reduction programs, including providing treatment for some of the 3.9 million people in this country who need it but are not receiving it. I know that the President does not want to shrink these programs either. Recall that when he announced Mr. Walters' nomination to be drug czar, he said that ``the most effective way to reduce the supply of drugs in America is to reduce the demand for drugs in America'' and he pledged that his administration ``will focus unprecedented attention on the demand side of the problem.'' As I see it, the study is meant to assess current programs in order to identify where there may be duplication of effort and where we need to increase effort.  The belief that demand reduction programs are a valuable part of our national drug policy needs to guide this report. That does not mean that the authors should be afraid of recommending ways to deliver services more efficiently or to suggest that there is duplication of effort that needs to be streamlined. What it means is that the report should not be interpreted as a directive from Congress to decrease the level of effort dedicated to demand reduction.  Increasing access to treatment is critical. Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. And as with other chronic relapsing diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma, there is no cure, although a number of treatments can effectively control the disease. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, the rate of adherence to treatment programs and relapse rates are similar for drug addiction and other chronic diseases. That means that treatment for addiction works just as well as treatment for other chronic relapsing diseases. I hope these facts will be reflected in the drug czar's report, particularly in terms of relapse. We should not be skimping on the amount of time a patient spends in treatment because someone thinks that would be more efficient. In truth, it would be less efficient. Studies have shown that the longer a patient spends in treatment the more likely that patient is to stay off drugs. But even with the best treatment protocol, patients relapse. That does not mean that treatment does not work, however.  Research is another area where returns on investment are not always linear or predictable. But I believe that we need to be doing more research on new forms of treatment, particularly when it comes to developing new anti-addiction medications. In the last Congress, I worked with Senators Levin and Hatch and former Senator Moynihan to pass a law to allow qualified doctors to prescribe certain anti-addiction medications from their offices rather than requiring patients to pick them up at special clinics. The bill helps to move drug treatment using anti-addiction medications into the medical mainstream. And buprenorphine, the first medication that could be prescribed under the system created by the bill, is expected to be approved any day now. We need to develop additional medications for this new system to treat cocaine and methamphetamine addiction as well as to curb the cravings associated with addiction.  The last item that I would suggest that the drug czar keep in mind when drafting his report is the importance of prevention, particularly school-based prevention programs. After several years of a stable level of drug use in the United States, this year drug use is up 11 percent among 12 to 17-year-olds and 18 percent among 18 to 25-year-olds. It is vital that we increase our current efforts at preventing drug use among teens and young adults. After all, we know that if we can get a child through age 21 without abusing drugs, they are unlikely ever to do so.  My goal is not to dictate what the drug czar writes in his report. Rather, I want to make clear that when Congress directs that the drug czar write a report on how to ``streamline, consolidate, coordinate, simplify, and more effectively conduct and deliver'' Federal drug and substance abuse treatment, prevention, education and research programs, it does not mean that we are trying to minimize the importance of these programs. We are merely looking for guidance on how they could be delivered more effectively and more efficiently.                          ____________________
