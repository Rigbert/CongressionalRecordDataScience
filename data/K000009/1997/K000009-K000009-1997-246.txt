Speaker, although the end of the Second World War occurred over a half-century ago, Americans still honor and continue to remember the hundreds of thousands of men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice in this, the greatest conflict of all human history.  I would like to take this time to honor the brave men who served on the U.S.S. Bullhead (SS-332). The U.S.S. Bullhead was the last major vessel lost by the United States in World War II, and with it went the lives of 84 American sailors.  On August 6, 1945, the U.S.S. Bullhead was plying the waters of the Java Sea when it was suddenly attacked by Japanese aircraft, which proceeded to drop 500-pound bombs on the American submarine. Although presumed to have been sunk, the actual fate of the U.S.S. Bullhead could not be determined.  On August 23, 1945, the U.S. Navy announced that ``The U.S.S. Bullhead is overdue and presumed lost.'' The U.S.S. Bullhead was the 52d U.S. submarine lost during World War II. It wasn't until long after the end of the war that the fate of the U.S.S. Bullhead and its crew was learned following the release of Japanese records.  Mr. Speaker, in honoring the crew of the U.S.S. Bullhead, I wish to extend special appreciation to Mr. Richard L. Henshaw of Toledo, OH, who has strived to maintain the memory and honor of this submarine and its gallant crew.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to include for the Record the following official history of the U.S.S. Bullhead:       Bullhead (SS-332) was laid down on 21 October 1943 at      Groton, Conn., by the Electric Boat Co.; launched on 16 July      1944; sponsored by Mrs. Howard Doyle; and commissioned on 4      December 1944, Comdr. Walter T. Griffith in command.       Following a month's shakedown cruise in Narragansett Bay,      the submarine sailed on 9 January 1945 for Key West, Fla.,      where she received two weeks of additional training before      pushing on to Panama. She emerged from the canal on 11      February and headed for Hawaii. On the first day out, a near      disaster occurred. During a practice dive, the main induction      failed to close rapidly enough because of low hydraulic      pressure, and tons of water flooded in before it could be      shut. The ship was saved by shifting ballast, pumping out      water, and continuing the dive. She proceeded on without      incident and reached Pearl Harbor on 26 February.       At the end of her voyage repairs, Bullhead left Pearl      Harbor on 9 March. Ten days later, she paused at Guam to      refuel and then got underway on the 21st for the northern      port of the South China Sea and her first war patrol. The      submarine hunted off Formosa through 30 March without      encountering any enemy ships before shaping a course for Hong      Kong. En route, she shelled targets on enemy-occupied Pratas      Island. While off Hong Kong, she also provided lifeguard      services for Allied aviators. On 8 April, an American      ``Liberator'' mistakenly bombed Bullhead. All the bombs      missed her, fortunately, by at least 75 yards and, while      severely shaken, she sustained no damage.       On 16 April, four miles off the China coast, the submarine      recovered the crew of a downed Army aircraft, taking on board      three survivors and the bodies of three casualties. The      submarine terminated the patrol on 28 April in the      Philippines when the safely arrived at the newly constructed      base at Subic Bay, Luzon.       Upon completion of her refit there, Bullhead spent eight      days in training exercises off the coast of Luzon before      getting underway again on 21 May for her second war patrol.      This time, the submarine operated in a wolf pack with Bergall      (SS-320) and Kraken     (SS-370) in a coordinated sweep of the Gulf of Siam and the      Java Sea.       Bullhead entered the patrol area on 25 May but encountered      no suitable targets until 30 May, when she made a machinegun      attack on a 150-ton schooner and claimed to have sunk the      Japanese vessel. On 4 June, the submarine moved to a new      station south of Anabas Island, but this area proved to be      barren.       On the 16th, she entered the western end of the Java Sea,      Bullhead discovered her next victim on the 18th. Once again,      she trained her machine guns on a maru, a 700-ton vessel      which sank soon after suffering a hit at the waterline. Later      that day, the submarine sighted a small convoy of two      merchantmen and two escort vessels but was unable to attack      because the ships took shelter along the Java coast.       On the morning of the 19th, Bullhead engaged in a surface      battle with two subchasers and two picket boats and took      credit for sinking one 700-ton subchaser and damaging a      smaller one of some 500 tons. The remaining Japanese vessels      tried to take cover behind a point of land, but Bullhead      closed the shore and continued firing on the boats. The      encounter did not end until the submarine exhausted her      supply of 5-inch ammunition.       On 25 June, Bullhead opened fire with her 40-millimeter gun      on a small Japanese vessel, set the boat ablaze, and believed      that the Japanese boat had been sunk. She completed this      patrol on 2 July when she moored at Fremantle, Australia.       Despite claiming to have sunk several vessels, Bullhead was      not officially credited with destroying any Japanese shipping      during this patrol. During a brief refit period, the      submarine received another 5-inch gun. The submarine left      Fremantle on 31 July to begin her third patrol. She was to      transit Lombok Strait and patrol in the Java Sea with several      other American and British submarines.       Bullhead rendezvoused with a Dutch submarine, O-21, on 2      August and transferred mail to her. Four days later, the      submarine reported that she had safely passed through the      strait and was in her patrol area. No further word was ever      received from her; and, on 24 August, she was reported      overdue and presumed lost.       Postwar analysis of Japanese records revealed that a      Japanese army plane depthcharged a submarine off the Bali      coast near the northern mouth of Lombok Strait on 6 August.      The pilot claimed two direct hits and reported a gush of oil      and air bubbles at the spot where the target went down. It      was presumed that the proximity of mountains shortened her      radar's range and prevented Bullhead from receiving warning      of the plane's approach. The submarine went down with the      loss of all hands. Her name was struck from the Navy list on      17 September 1945.       Bullhead won two battle stars for her World War II service.                                 ____________________
