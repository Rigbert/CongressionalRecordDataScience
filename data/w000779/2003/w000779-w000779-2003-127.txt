President, as the Senate considers the fiscal year 2004 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, I want to bring to the Senate's attention a national program operating in my home State of Oregon that promises to provide important training for our Nation's State and local civilian officials who oversee first responders.  The National Center for Disaster Decision Making, or NCDDM, is a strong partnership of public and private entities seeking to provide leaders with the skills necessary to combat terrorism.  Although Congress and the administration have provided significant funds for first responder training, we have not emphasized the importance of preparing our State and local leaders who oversee and coordinate first responders. When a crisis occurs, the people who command first responders will be required to make critical decisions that we hope will mitigate loss of life and property. These leaders need to have comprehensive training and education that best prepares them to respond to any crisis or disaster that may occur in their local communities.  I want to confirm that it is the committee's intent that entities, such as the NCDDM, are eligible for funding from the Department of Homeland Security now, and that under the fiscal year 2004 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, the NCDDM will also be eligible to apply for competitive grant funding for ``emerging'' training available from the Office for Domestic Preparedness.
