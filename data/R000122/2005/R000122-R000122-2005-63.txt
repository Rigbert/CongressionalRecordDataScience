President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Rhode Island's brave soldiers, Lance Corporal Holly A. Charette, who was killed in Iraq on June 23, 2005. In honor of her sacrifice, I am introducing a bill, along with Senator Chafee, to name the post office at 57 Rolfe Square in Cranston, RI, the ``Holly A. Charette Post Office.''  Twenty-one year old Holly Charette died when a suicide bomber in Fallujah attacked the military convoy in which she was riding. This was the deadliest attack on women in the U.S. military since the start of operations in Iraq, and yet another example of the violence that continues to plague our soldiers serving in this conflict.  Those who were close to Holly describe her as a happy and positive young woman loved by all those who knew her. She was a cheerleader at Cranston East High School, where she worked hard in college-prep courses. Her teachers remember her as a ``bright, shining star.''  Holly had dreams of becoming a postal worker. Instead, in 2002, she made the choice to serve her Nation by joining the U.S. Marine Corps.  She was deployed to Iraq in March of this year with her unit from Camp Lejeune, NC, and assigned to Headquarters Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force. It was here that Holly was able to combine her dreams of postal service with that of serving her Nation.  During her service in Iraq, Holly utilized her strong organizational skills to take on and complete various administrative tasks, including that of mail delivery to the troops. She became known as the ``Marine who brought the good news.'' Holly never forgot a name, and would often stop Marines in the mess hall to let them know that they had mail.  The day that Holly was killed, she was working with Iraqi security forces to prevent insurgents from gaining a foothold in that country.  Her tragic passing has touched the lives of Rhode Islanders. Holly's presence will be deeply missed by all those who knew and loved her.  This legislation will pay proper tribute to this remarkable young woman, and commemorate her valor for future generations. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Lance Corporal Holly A. Charette by supporting this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation to name the post office in Cranston after Lance Corporal Charette be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1989       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. HOLLY A. CHARETTE POST OFFICE.       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal      Service located at 57 Rolfe Square in Cranston, Rhode Island,      shall be known and designated as the ``Holly A. Charette Post      Office''.       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,      document, paper, or other record of the United States to the      facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be      a reference to the ``Holly A. Charette Post Office''.                                 ______                                       By
