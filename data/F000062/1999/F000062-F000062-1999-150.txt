 Boxer) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 132       Whereas Zinfandel grapes have historical significance among      agricultural products of the United States, in that the      origins of Zinfandel grapes in the United States date back to      the 1830s;       Whereas Zinfandel grape vines are a living link to the time      when gold was discovered in the Sierra Nevada mountains and      many people in the United States moved west to seek their      fortunes;       Whereas some Zinfandel grape vines in the Sierra Nevada      foothills are at least 125 years old and still producing      grapes;       Whereas Zinfandel grape vines were an integral part of the      Gold Rush of 1849 and the agricultural cultivation of the      West;       Whereas Zinfandel wine is an excellent representative of      the agricultural community of the United States because its      development and production range from the hot houses and      nurseries of New England and Long Island to the hills and      valleys of the Pacific Coast and Southwest;       Whereas Zinfandel grape vines are planted in 14 States and      distributed to every major community in all 50 States, and      have worldwide recognition by scholars, growers, and      consumers as being a quintessential creation of the United      States;       Whereas Zinfandel grape products are used in products as      diverse as jams, pasta sauce, and wine;       Whereas the Zinfandel grape, a principal component of an      important agricultural sector in the United States, has been      the leading red grape from the 1880s to the present in terms      of acres planted and wine produced, and is accordingly a      crucial part of an industry that, in 1996, produced      approximately $41,000,000,000 of direct and indirect economic      activity and $3,000,000,000 in State and local revenue, and      provided permanent employment for 554,630 people;       Whereas Zinfandel wine has been winning first prize and      similar recognition in competitions since 1859 against      domestic and internationally produced wines, and brings great      credit to the quality of agriculture in the United States;       Whereas Zinfandel vines grown in the United States serve as      the source of vines grown elsewhere in the world and set the      standards for Zinfandel vines worldwide;       Whereas only Zinfandel wine, among the wines of the world,      is recognized as being a product that is uniquely from the      United States;       Whereas the Zinfandel grape is an embodiment of the history      and heritage of the United States, and, in particular, of the      settlement and agricultural cultivation of the West; and       Whereas for the reasons described above, the Zinfandel      grape is a national treasure: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,That the Senate--       (1) designates the week beginning January 21, 2001, as      ``Zinfandel Grape Appreciation Week''; and       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling      on the people of the United States to celebrate the week with      appropriate ceremonies and programs.
