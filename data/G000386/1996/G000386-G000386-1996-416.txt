 President, since March 19, I have been delivering a series of statements on the Senate floor. The common thread of my statements is my observation of the President's performance in office. I have concluded that he is not setting a good example for the people whom he serves. Basically, I mean that he does not perform in office commensurate with the rhetoric.  This also soon becomes an issue of the failure to show moral leadership, which basically means that you do what you say you are going to do. It is the single most important attribute of any President. I have quoted Franklin Delano Roosevelt on the floor of this Senate on this issue many, many times. One of his President leadership flaws is the fact that he says one thing and yet does another.  Last night, I had an opportunity to talk about a clue that I discovered as to why the President of the United States might say one thing and do another. I quoted from last week's Time magazine article, which quoted the President's senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos. His quote was just three words: ``Words are actions.'' So if the President says something, that means that is what people know he is going to do. In other words, you say something, the President either thinks it is happening or he wants us to think it is happening. I have not quite discovered which one it is, Mr. President.  Yesterday provided a further case in point to illustrate what I am saying. Yesterday, we celebrated Earth Day across the country. There is nothing wrong with celebrating Earth Day. There has been great progress made in this country on the environment, and maybe it would not have been made without annually remembering the things that come about through Earth Day and the movements connected with them.  Also, it has become kind of a political event, as well. The TV news shows were full of slick photo ops of President Clinton and Vice President Gore cleaning up the C&O Canal outside of Washington and visiting a national park. They also took the opportunity to campaign against Republicans on the issue of the environment.  Never have I seen an Earth Day used for such pure politics as it was yesterday by the President. The President would have us believe that the only thing standing between the public and dirty air and dirty water is President Clinton himself. If you would listen long enough to the President, you would think that his environmental record is unblemished. Unfortunately for the President, the facts belie the image that he is trying to present.  I want to briefly show this by discussing two items that were brought to my attention yesterday that clearly illustrate that President Clinton's deeds are different from his rhetoric. First, the director of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Mr. Larry Wilson, sent a letter to my office regarding President Clinton's fiscal year budget proposals for the Army Corps of Engineers. The letter states: ``The President's proposal will have substantial adverse impacts on several environmental programs important to my State. One of these programs focuses on habitat restoration, which is vital to supporting endangered species. This program will be shut down due to the President's administration budget proposals.'' This is an environmental issue, and the President is cutting the budget. That belies the fact that yesterday he was out saying the great things he was doing about the environment.  As President Clinton demagogs against Republican programs to reform the Endangered Species Act, he is shutting down an existing program that has actually been successful in saving endangered species. Again, his rhetoric does not match his words.  Other programs that will be shut down affect the wetlands in my State. There are several wetland restoration and enhancement projects that will be terminated if the President's budget is adopted. According to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, these projects not only provide critical habitat for wildlife, but they also provide hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreational opportunities for all Iowans. As the President talks about his initiative to protect national parks, he is jeopardizing these same resources in Iowa with his budget proposals.  The second item that I will discuss concerns an article in this morning's Washington Post. It says that the President, out on the C&O Canal, talking abut the good he does for the environment, is saying one thing, but there is an Agency of his Government, in his administration, that is causing environmental damage in another place.  This is where the Sierra Club alleges that the U.S. Government is responsible for illegal dumping of PCB's, lead, mercury, and arsenic in the Anacostia River right here in Washington, DC. The Sierra Club is a group that often supports the President on his environmental initiatives and is often critical of Republican proposals. So, it is very unusual that this organization would question this administration on an environmental issue.  Yet, the Sierra Club is alleging that the Washington Navy Yard and Southeast Federal Center are violating the Clean Water Act and polluting this local river.  Mr. President, I can tell you that if a family farmer was thought to have violated the Clean Water Act, that farm would be shut down immediately. I know of cases in Iowa where the EPA showed up armed and without warning to close down small businesses because of potential violations of environmental laws. Yet, the Federal Government remains the biggest polluter in the country and is not subject to the same rules that apply to small businesses and family farms. This is hypocrisy. This is a double standard.  President Clinton should stop playing politics with the environment. The public health is too important to be used as a campaign issue. The more politics he plays, the less he is able to bring fairness and uniformity to our Nation's environmental laws. I urge the American people to look behind the political demagoguery that was characterized on Earth Day and take a good look at the deeds of this administration. You my find that, once again, President Clinton's action falls short of his rhetoric.  This country is suffering from a severe bout of cynicism. That is exactly why we have this legislation on the floor regarding term limits, because term limits are the people's expression of dissatisfaction with Washington, DC, with the Congress, and with other institutions of Government. The cause of this is that politicians say one thing and do another. This has reflected an absence of moral leadership over time of our elected officials. Usually the public does not discover this until they have come and gone. I want to lay the record out right now because we need accountability right now. We need leadership right now.  What we do not need now is the same old ``say one thing and do another'' routine. To stop the growth of cynicism and the fact that we must restore trust of the American people in our institutions of Government, we in Washington need to show the American people that they can trust our words, that our words not only can be trusted, but our words are followed up by actions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two documents I referred to be printed in the Record, the newspaper article and the letter from the director of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                [From the New York Times, Apr. 23, 1996]      New Medicare Trust Fund Data Show Unusually Large Shortfall       Washington, April 22,--Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust      Fund lost $4.2 billion in the first half of the current      fiscal year, according to new Government data, which suggest      that the financial condition of the program is worse than      projected by Administration officials last year.       The trust fund, which pays hospital bills for the elderly      and disabled, lost money last year for the first time since      1972. But the loss for all of last year was only $35.7      million.       The new data show that the losses are growing. In the first      half of the current fiscal year, from October 1995 through      March of this year, the trust fund spent $60.5 billion and      took in $56.3 billion, a shortfall of $4.2 billion, the      Treasury said.       There is little chance that the trust fund will actually      run out of money. It still contains more than $120 billion,      and Congress would almost surely act to rescue the program      before it ran out of money. But the new data provide fresh      evidence that, after months of acrimonious debate between the      White House and Congress, Medicare remains a budget problem      of immense and growing proportions.       Chris Jennings, a special assistant to President Clinton      for health policy, said today that the new numbers were not      surprising. ``They indicate the need to move forward, balance      the budget and enact some changes in Medicare that will      strengthen the trust fund,'' he said. ``Republicans and      Democrats should work together to address the problem.''       In a letter to Congress last week, Treasury Secretary      Robert E. Rubin suggested that Congress and the      Administration resume discussions to reach an agreement on      Medicare and the budget.       Republicans proposed many changes in Medicare last year to      help control costs, but President Clinton said the changes      would hurt beneficiaries. Republicans may hesitate to put      forward new proposals after they were bloodied in that      battle. Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who      is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ``The      President preferred to scare seniors and play politics      instead of saving Medicare.''       It is not entirely clear why the hospital trust fund is      running out of money faster than expected. One factor,      Administration officials said, is an unanticipated      increase in the number of admissions of Medicare patients      to hospitals, but that does not explain all of the      discrepancy.       The new losses accelerate a trend that started several      years ago, when spending by the hospital trust fund began to      increase faster than the money coming into the fund. The      Administration had predicted that the amount of money in the      trust fund would increase by $4.7 billion in the 1995 fiscal      year, which ended Sept. 30, but instead the trust fund spent      $35.7 million more than it took in.       Likewise, the Administration predicted last April that the      trust fund would take in     $45 million more than it would spend in the current fiscal      year. But that now appears highly unlikely. Treasury      Department data show that the trust fund has lost money in      five of the last six months.       In the first half of the last fiscal year, from October      1994 to March 1995, the trust fund lost $135 million.       Any trust fund money not immediately needed to pay hospital      bills is invested in Government securities. The amount of      such holdings has declined, to $126.1 billion on March 31      from $129.9 billion on Oct. 1, 1995.       If nothing is done to change the financing and design of      Medicare, losses from the trust fund are expected to grow      from year to year. Payroll taxes account for most of the      trust fund's income, and no tax increases are scheduled under      current law. Unless President Clinton and Congress arrive at      a long-term budget deal, Federal officials said, there is no      reason to expect a significant reduction in the rate of      growth of Medicare spending.       But no such deal is in sight. In this election year,      lawmakers and Administration officials are wary of any action      that might offend elderly voters by restricting Medicare      spending.       Last year, Republicans proposed vast changes in Medicare to      slow the program's growth. But the proposals were included in      a bill to balance the Federal budget, and Mr. Clinton vetoed      that bill in December, saying it contained ``the biggest      Medicare and Medicaid cuts in history.''       Republicans said their proposals were needed to prevent      Medicare from going bankrupt, but Democrats said the changes      would devastate the program and push beneficiaries into      health maintenance organizations.       The new Treasury data do not indicate when Medicare's      Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will run out of money. In April      1995, the Administration predicted that the trust fund would      be depleted at some point from October to December 2002, but      it now appears that the money could run out earlier because      the trust fund is spending more than expected and is taking      in less than expected.       Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is      chairman of the Budget Committee, said he believed that the      trust fund would run out of money by May 2001.       Roland E. King, former chief actuary of the Health Care      Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said today      that he believed the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund ``will run      out in late 2000 or early 2001.'' Richard S. Foster, who      succeeded Mr. King as chief actuary, said he could not      discuss the financial condition of Medicare without      permission from top officials at the Department of Health and      Human Services, and such permission was not given today.       Under Federal law, the trustees of the Medicare trust fund,      including four Administration officials, were supposed to      submit a report to Congress on the financial condition of the      program by April 1. But Administration officials say that      report has been delayed because of Government shutdowns and      snowstorms last winter and will probably not be issued until      late May or early June.       Some Democrats have played down the significance of the      losses from Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.      Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said,      ``The past is littered with inaccurate forecasts of      Medicare's demise.'' Moreover, he said, ``The Democrats will      not let Medicare go insolvent.''       Hospital executives and Medicare officials said they were      puzzled by the recent increase in admissions. James D.      Bentley, senior vice president of the American Hospital      Association, said tonight, ``Hospital admissions of Medicare      patients are rising more than could be explained by growth in      the number of beneficiaries--but not enough to account for      all of the unexpected increase in Medicare spending.''                                 ______   [From the U.S. Senate--Republican Policy Committee, Apr. 23, 1996]  Today's New York Times Demonstrates Urgent Need to Solve Medicare's                          Impending Crisis, Now       Today's New York Times front-page article (on the reverse      side) once again reveals the Medicare Part A trust fund's      uncontrolled hemorrhaging. It remains uncontrolled because      the Clinton Administration decided to play ``Medi-Scare''      with Medicare last year. Clinton vetoed the plan from      Congress that would have allowed it to grow at twice the rate      of inflation and would have kept it solvent for the next      generation. In contrast, President Clinton's latest      unbalanced budget--his ninth, scored last week by CBO--would      barely keep the current trust fund solvent through fiscal      year 2002.       Medicare's Hospital Insurance trust fund, commonly known as      ``Part A,'' has lost $4.2 billion in the first half of FY 96      [says the New York Times, citing government data].       This compares with a loss in the first half of FY 95 of      $135 million, and the Clinton Administration's prediction      that Part A would run a $45 million surplus for FY 96.       These losses indicate that Medicare's bankruptcy is even      closer than the 2002 date the Administration reported April      3, 1995.       Because the Administration has still not produced a report      this year, we must rely on outside estimates. Budget      Committee Chairman Domenici has stated Part A could be      bankrupt by May of 2001; former chief HCFA actuary Roland      King predicts bankruptcy as soon as late 2000.       Clinton's latest budget would only push bankruptcy back a      year beyond its last year's estimate. According to CBO under      his budget--without utilizing for gimmick of cost-shifting      $60 billion to the taxpayer--Part A would be barely solvent      in FY 2002 ($1.5 billion) and would be bankrupt by FY 2003.       In contrast, Congress' Balanced Budget Act would have      preserved Part A beyond 2010--when Baby Boomers begin      retiring--while allowing spending to grow at twice the      inflation rate.       While the Republican party in Congress wants to protect      Medicare for the next generation, Clinton wants to abandon it      to the next Administration.                                                                    ____                                                     Department of                                            Natural Resources,                                  Des Moines, IA,, April 10, 1996.     Re Mississippi River Environmental Management Program (EMP)          and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife (F&W) Mitigation--         Affects in Iowa of the President's FY 1997 Budget          Request.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I want to alert you to the impacts      that the Administration's FY 1997 budget proposal will have      in Iowa with regard to two programs administered by the U.S.      Army Corps of Engineers: (1) Missouri River Fish and Wildlife      Mitigation and (2) Mississippi River EMP. The President's      proposal will have substantial adverse impacts on both of      these programs which in recent years have been operating at      close to full authorized funding and providing long-awaited      benefits to Iowans. I urge you to do whatever you can to      restore the appropriations in FY 1997 to levels that equal or      at least come closer to the amounts available in prior years.       The Corps has explained their priorities for funding which      are navigation, flood control, and environment projects.      While we understand how the Corps developed these priorities,      their application results in a disproportionate impact on      projects that are important to Iowa. For example, funding of      only $100,000 for mitigation projects on the Missouri in the      Omaha District, means projects on hold for years while      habitat restoration is viewed as a key way to resolve      historic conflicts between uses while enhancing support for      endangered species. The Mississippi River EMP is slated for      cuts of nearly $4 million in FY 97, and projections are for      cuts of about $7 million for FY 98 and nearly $11 million in      future years. These levels will delay projects for years      while threatening the viability of an essential long-term      monitoring effort.       It has been difficult for us to obtain information as to      whether the Administration's budget cuts are greater for the      North Central and Omaha Divisions than for other regions. If      these divisions suffered proportionally greater reductions      than other divisions, it could help to explain the difficulty      that they have had trying to meet all of their obligations      and ensure the timely completion of Iowa projects.              missouri river fish and wildlife mitigation       Mitigation was authorized in the Water Resources      Development Act of 1986 to satisfy the federal requirement to      mitigate for the loss of fish and wildlife habitat with the      construction of the navigation and flood control works on the      river in Iowa and the other lower basin states.      Appropriations commenced in 1989. While the program includes      land acquisition, that has been less important in Iowa      than habitat development. The state already owns numerous      sites along the river that can be improved by the      mitigation program. The Corps of Engineers has purchased      some land adjacent to existing public land as required to      make the habitat development projects work. Mitigation is      critical on the Missouri River if the Corps is going to      make progress in supporting endangered species. There is a      terrible shortage of fisheries habitat in the lower river.      These conditions have economic consequences as well, since      the lack of habitat reduces the quality of the fishery.      The net result is less recreational opportunity on the      river, which impacts businesses that provide goods and      services along the river.       Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Mitigation has received as      much as $8 million a year, which was fairly evenly split      between the Kansas City and Omaha Corps Districts. The      administration's budget for FY 1997 includes $1.6 million for      mitigation, of which $1.5 million is programmed for the      Kansas City District and only $100,000 for the Omaha      District. Iowa projects are in the Omaha District, so      Missouri River fish and wildlife mitigation will essentially      come to a halt in Iowa. The discrepancy among the two      districts is based upon individual district priorities. Fish      and wildlife mitigation requires more than a token $100,000      in the Omaha District.       The following are the specific projects programmed for work      in FY 97 that will not happen if current funding levels      remain:       Blackbird/Tieville/Decatur Bend near Onawa is an $8.8      million project that includes 3,500 acres and 11.8 miles of      wetlands and river side channels. The definite project report      (DPR) is complete, design and engineering is near completion,      and construction was programmed in begin in Fall 1996 and be      completed during FY 97.       California Bend near Missouri Valley just north of Council      Bluffs is a $785,000 project to restore a running side chute      connected to the Missouri River. The plans and specifications      are close to completion and construction was scheduled for FY      96 and 97.       Winnebago Bend near Sloan is a $1.3 million project to add      water into a rapidly disappearing wetland. It too was      programmed for FY 96 & 97 construction.       In addition to the improvement or creation of critical      habitat, all of these projects would provide hunting, angling      and outdoor recreation opportunities to Iowans along the      Missouri River.       The Corps' report proposing these projects was completed in      1981. With nearly two decades of delays, the lack of habitat      continues to frustrate efforts to maintain several fish      species. It would be most unfortunate to lose the momentum      that has developed as these projects have moved this close to      construction.        mississippi river environmental management program (emp)       EMP was also authorized in the Water Resources Development      Act of 1986 and has become a model program for the      restoration of fish and wildlife on big rivers.      Its authorized funding is $19.4 million per year and it      has been receiving that amount in recent years. It too is      a program that has taken a long time to attain solid      momentum, but is now providing increasing benefits. EMP      contains two primary components; (1) habitat      rehabilitation and enhancement projects (HREP) and (2)      long-term resource monitoring (LTRM). The Administration's      budget contains $15.6 million for EMP in FY 97, which is      not devastating in itself. Our concern lies with the      Corps' projections in FY 98, 99, and 00, which are $12.4      million, $8.7 million, and $9.8 million, respectively.      Reductions of that magnitude will have serious adverse      implications in Iowa.                Examples of completed HREPs in Iowa are:       Bussey Lake dredging near Guttenberg--Dredging will improve      the fishery by providing deeper water, diversity of habitat      and wintering-over areas.       Brown's Lake restoration near Green Island--This area has      been protected from sedimentation by dike improvements and a      water control structure. A deeper channel through the project      and dredging in the lake have improved the fishery, while the      dredge spoil was collected on site to create terrestrial      habitat. This project along with the improvements at Green      Island will be beneficial for both hunting and fishing.       Big Timber backwater rehabilitation and pothole creation      near Muscatine--Dredging at this site restored an area that      was nearly completely filled in with sediment.       Lansing Big Lake side channel closures--This project is      designed to decrease sedimentation and flow rates in the lake      to maintain its currently very popular panfishery. We are      currently proposing some follow-up work in Lansing Big Lake      to further assure project objectives are obtained.       Iowa's Princeton HREP project near Princeton is hit the      hardest by the proposed change in funding. This project is      designed to create new wetlands and improve the dike system      for waterfowl management. The construction contract was close      to being let to a minority contractor. Our local DNR      biologist was ready to issue a news release explaining to      local hunters that Princeton would be closed this fall due to      construction. The Corps is considering delaying construction      until late 1997. Making this decision at the last minute is      inefficient and will cost time and money if the Corps decides      to shelve the project. Because of great interest in this      project by local hunters and others who live along the river,      the delay will cause many to become extremely upset.       Iowa's Lake Odessa EMP project near Wapello is currently      undergoing planning, engineering, and design. The Corps has      informed us that it will complete this work, but will not      construct the project under current EMP authorization. The      Lake Odessa HREP project would therefore only become reality      if authorization for EMP is extended beyond 2002.       HREP projects for Huron Island near Burlington, Molo Slough      near Dubuque, and Peosta Channel also near Dubuque were also      programmed to be completed under the current EMP      authorization. The Corps is now considering deletion of      these projects completely from EMP.       The Long-Term Resource Monitoring (LTRM) element of EMP is      collecting data on Mississippi River water quality, aquatic      and floodplain habitat, microinvertebrates, and fisheries.      LTRM also evaluates the physical, chemical, and biological      responses of habitat projects. This program was designed to      identify trends and support decisions about river management      including such projects as the current navigation study.       Iowa DNR operates one of six monitoring stations that are      located throughout the river. Iowa's station is in Bellevue      and is staffed by six permanent employees and typically hires      up to five seasonal workers during summer months. These are      all state employees, but funding for their salaries and      operations comes totally from federal EMP dollars. Reductions      in the LTRM budget will likely occur because of overall EMP      cutbacks, which means that Iowa's station in Bellevue and its      employees will be affected. It is important that data      gathering not be curtailed to the extent that the integrity      of the data base created over the past several years is      jeopardized. In addition, the loss of jobs at the station      will impact the economy in Bellevue due to the loss of      employment. Bellevue along with other cities along the      Mississippi will see reduced recreational activity as the      maintenance of the natural resources of the river are      neglected.       Budget reductions are difficult, and we understand that      there will be some impacts on programs that we believe to be      important to the long term viability of the natural river      systems. It appears that the Missouri River Fish and Wildlife      Mitigation and Mississippi River Environmental Management      Programs are expected by the Administration to bear      proportionally greater budget reductions than other programs.      We also fear that the North Central and Missouri River      Divisions are taking a greater share of cuts than those in      other parts of the country. This further harms Iowa projects.      If budget reductions that are currently being proposed      happen, Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Mitigation in Iowa      will come to a complete halt, Mississippi River EMP habitat      projects in Iowa will be delayed and some will be eliminated.      The Bellevue monitoring station will face cuts that could      mean its demise with the added cuts proposed in future years.      As noted above, reductions in these efforts will have      economic as well as natural resource consequences that should      not be underestimated given the Corps' own study showing an      annual value of recreation in the Upper Mississippi River      basin of over $1 billion. We ask for your help to do whatever      you can to assure these programs and their respective      projects in Iowa are not forced to take on more than their      fair share of setbacks.           Sincerely,                                                  Larry J. Wilson,                                                         Director.
