President, first, let me salute my colleague from Ohio for bringing up trade adjustment assistance. Because even if you are a proponent of expanding trade in the United States, you know the ebb and flow of the economy is going to take away some jobs in this country as other suppliers arrive.  What the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Oregon, Ron Wyden, are trying to achieve is to make sure trade adjustment assistance is there to help these workers make a transition to another job in another area that is expanding in our economy. That is the thoughtful thing to do for their lives and the future of our economy. It is also a necessary part of any conversation about the future of trade in the United States.                          ____________________
