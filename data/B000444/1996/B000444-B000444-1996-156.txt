 President, my colleagues will know this is the last motion I have.  I offer a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions to delete the section relating to the study of Federal law enforcement. Senator Kohl of Wisconsin wishes to be added as a cosponsor as does, I believe, although I am not certain, Senator Nunn. I will check that. But Senator Kohl for certain.  I send a motion to recommit the conference report to the desk.
