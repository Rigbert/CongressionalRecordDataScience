 I ask the Senator if he would consider including stem cell research, which we have been waiting for for a year. Senator Frist has promised he would bring it before the Senate.  There are millions of Americans suffering from afflictions such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, and spinal cord injuries who are counting on us. Will the chairman of the HELP Committee, as part of Health Care Week, amend his unanimous consent request to include a vote, after an adequate debate, on stem cell research?
