 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Iowan and a great American. It is with a sense of sadness but also pride that I must call to the attention of the Senate the sacrifice of Marine GySgt. Jeff Bohr of Ossian, IA, who was killed April 10, 2003, while participating in the liberation of Baghdad. Jeff Bohr is the second Iowan to have died in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and hopefully the last. Jeff Bohr served his country in the military for 20 years and had no reservations about putting his life on the line to protect American freedom and to give freedom to the Iraqi people. His loss will be felt throughout Iowa, and particularly in his hometown of Ossian. My thoughts and prayers are with Jeff's wife Lori as well as his father Eddie and mother Jeanette, his brothers, and all his family and friends. As they mourn his loss, they can know that they are not alone. Many people in Iowa and across the country share their grief and reflect on the life of Jeff Bohr, whether they knew him or not. At the same time, Jeff's family can be very proud of his service to his country. Jeff Bohr's sense of patriotic duty is a source of inspiration to us all, and his sacrifice will not be forgotten. He paid the ultimate price for our freedom and security. Words can scarcely convey the debt of gratitude that we all owe Jeff Bohr, but I want to take this opportunity to express my deepest respect and admiration for Jeff and what he did for America. Although his loss is tragic, Jeff Bohr died fighting for his country and he died a true patriot.                          ____________________
