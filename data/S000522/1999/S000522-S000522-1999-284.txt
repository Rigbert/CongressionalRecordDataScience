Mr. Speaker, today I am joined by my friend and colleague, Representative Bill Pascrell and 14 other cosponsors in introducing a resolution which declares the conviction of this Congress that Slobodan Milosevic is responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in the former Yugoslavia. His actions in that region cannot be excused by anything which Serbia's neighbors or the international community has done. His victims demand justice. Unfortunately, the United States Government may not be doing all that it can to provide evidence to the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague to have Milosevic publicly indicted.  In the 105th Congress, there was near unanimous support for H. Con. Res. 304 and its Senate companion, S. Con. Res. 105. But in the past year little has been done to advance the just cause of ascribing blame to this man. Instead, we have had to watch as more atrocities have been committed in Kosovo, but no evident attempts to hold Milosevic personally and fully responsible for his actions. This is the reason that this resolution, which updates those passed last Congress, must again be considered by this body.  During the Bosnian phase of the Yugoslav conflict, from 1992 to 1995, Slobodan Milosevic was able to incite extreme nationalist feelings among Serbs, and he used that as basis to commit acts of genocide against non-Serb civilians. From early 1998 to the present, the same thing has been happening in Kosovo. As the resolution points out, about 4 million people have been displaced during the Yugoslav conflicts, including 1.5 million Kosovar Albanians, most of the latter since late March. Hundreds of thousands have been killed, some by mass executions and others by reckless shelling of towns and villages. Tens of thousands have been raped and tortured, often in detention centers and concentration camps. Vestiges of a people's daily lives, from their mosques to their local registration papers, are destroyed. Read the definition of genocide from the Genocide Convention itself, and read what happened in Bosnia and what is happening today in Kosovo.  Clearly, this is genocide.  The Helsinki Commission, which I Chair, has heard testimony from many witnesses--including lawyers, doctors, humanitarian relief aid workers, and diplomats who have had extensive firsthand experience in the region--and they have testified to this fact. As a result, in addition to last year's resolution, I recently wrote to President Clinton urging that prosecution of war criminals not be placed on the negotiating table as a bargaining chip to be thrown away, and urging that the U.S. Government use the resources at its disposal to help the Tribunal issue an indictment of Milosevic. Just two weeks ago, the Commission held a hearing on a variety of legal actions stemming from the genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.  Many of us in this body have witnessed firsthand stories from ethnic Albanians who escaped their homeland into Macedonia and Albania. These traumatized people now sit in refugee camps, their entire lives left behind, with an uncertain future.  Mr. Speaker, all those involved in war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in the former Yugoslavia must be held accountable for their roles. The evidence is overwhelming. As the head of his country, Milosevic must be among them. We must ask ourselves why he has done nothing other than give medals to those who have engaged in terrible crimes in Kosovo if he himself is not responsible for those crimes. He is at minimum responsible as Head of State for stopping these crimes from occurring. He is at least responsible for giving soldier the license to get away with raping, killing and cleansing the people of Kosovo. And he is likely responsible for directing his security forces and paramilitary associates to commit such acts.  Mr. Speaker, with this resolution we are putting the House on record as saying: The ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo was no accident but part of Belgrade's policy. There can be no true peace in the Balkans that excludes justice. It is in U.S. national interest to assist those who can provide justice, and that our government must therefore do more to help the Tribunal develop a case against Slobodan Milosevic.  As Mark Ellis of the American Bar Association's Coalition for International Justice, who provided testimony at one of our hearings on Kosovo, recently stated, ``Inevitably, lasting peace will be linked to justice, and justice will depend on accountability. Failing to indict Milosevic in the hope that he can deliver a negotiated settlement makes a mockery of the words `Never Again.' '' Let's affirm that we really do mean ``Never Again'' by again passing a resolution which states our belief that Milosevic is responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and, yes, genocide.  For the Record, Mr. Speaker, I want to submit an article by Mark Ellis from the May 9, 1999, Washington Post and the letter I sent to President Clinton which further illustrate the culpability of Slobodan Milosevic.                                            Commission on Security                                     and Cooperation in Europe                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1999.     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,     President of the United States, The White House, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. President: I request that you direct all federal      agencies that may hold information relevant to a possible      indictment of Slobodan Milosevic, President of Serbia and      Montenegro, to provide the evidence of war crimes, crimes      against humanity, and genocide to the International Criminal      Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. The      United States should make it a high priority to assemble this      information, review and where necessary declassify it, and      provide the documentation in the most expeditious manner      possible to the prosecutor's office at the Tribunal. I      respectfully suggest that you should include in your      directive instructions to agency heads to reprogram funds and      reassign personnel as necessary to permit immediate and      effective implementation of this requested directive.       As the sponsor of H. Con. Res. 304, expressing the sense of      the Congress regarding the culpability of Slobodan Milosevic      for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in the      former Yugoslavia, that was adopted by the House by a record      vote of 369 to 1 on September 14, 1998, I was startled and      surprised to learn that the United States has not made an      effort to gather information on Milosevic as the House and      Senate requested. The attached article entitled ``CONFLICT IN      THE BALKANS: THE TRIBUNAL; Tactics Were Barrier To Top Serb's      Indictment,'' by Raymond Bonner, appeared in the March 29,      1999, edition of The New York Times. The article notes:       The Clinton administration could hardly have taken the      initiative to build a case against Milosevic, one senior      administration official explained Sunday, after it adopted      the policy in late 1994 of working with the Serbian leader to      bring about an end to the war in Bosnia. ``We, the United      States government, have been the largest source of      information for the tribunal, but we have never compiled      dossiers with the aim of indicting Milosevic, or any specific      individual,'' said this official, who spoke on condition of      anonymity. ``The indictment of Milosevic would require a      policy change by the United States,'' he added.       If this report is accurate, it is past time for U.S. policy      to include the pursuit of a public indictment of Milosevic by      the ICTY. Issuance of a Presidential directive establishing      such a policy, supported by adequate resources to assure its      immediate and effective implementation, is clearly justified      by the reports of the Helsinki Commission has received about      actions by Yugoslav Army, paramilitary, and police forces      under Milosevic's command in Kosovo that probably constitute      war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Congress      has already expressed its overwhelming support for such a      course of action by adopting both H. Con. Res. 304 and S.      Con. Res. 105 (copy attached) last year.       I look forward to learning what direction you have given      the policy-level officers of the United States government      concerning this issue.           Sincerely,                                         Christopher H. Smith,                                                         Chairman.                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 1999]           War Criminals Belong in the Dock, Not at the Table                           (By Mark S. Ellis)       Just a few weeks ago, I stood among a sea of 20,000      desperate people on a dirt airfield outside Skopje,      Macedonia, listening to one harrowing story after another. I      had come to the Stenkovec refugee camp to record those      stories and to help set up a system for documenting      atrocities in Kosovo.       As I collected their accounts of rape, torture and      executions at the hands of Serbian troops, I was struck by      the refugees' common yearning for justice. They wanted those      responsible for their suffering to be held accountable. Their      anger was not only directed at the people they had watched      committing such savagery, but at the political leaders--and      Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in particular--who had      orchestrated the misery and continue to act with impunity.       The means exist to hold Milosevic and his underlings      accountable. In recent weeks, there have been calls from      members of Congress for his indictment by the International      Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and      Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering has said that the      United States is gathering evidence that could lead to his      indictment. And there is plenty of evidence. In the Kosovo      town of Djalovica, for example, residents carefully      documented the Serbian barbarity for investigators, recording      the details of each murder, each rape, each act of violence,      before they fled the city. The time has come to act on the      testimony of these and other witnesses.       To do so, of course, flies in the face of last week's much      ballyhooed optimism about reaching a negotiated settlement      with Milosevic. However eager the Clinton administration      might be to reach a political and diplomatic solution, we      should remember that those who have recently suffered under      Serbian attacks reject outright the notion that justice must      sometimes be forfeited for the sake of diplomatic expediency.      During the Bosnian conflict, accountability was sacrificed on      the dubious premise that negotiating with someone who is      widely regarded as a war criminal is a legitimate exercise      in peace-making. We shouldn't make that mistake a second      time around. Milosevic's broken promises still echo among      the charred ruins and forsaken mass grave sites that      defile the landscape of Bosnia.       If Milosevic had been indicted for the mass killings and      summary executions that the Bosnian Serbs--with backing from      Serbia--are accused of carrying out, would he have acted so      brazenly to ``cleanse'' Kosovo of its ethnic Albanians?      Nobody knows. At the very least an indictment would probably      have deterred him; and apprehension and a trial would have      stopped him. But there should be no uncertainty about what      occurs when Milosevic is allowed to act unencumbered. The      time has come for the international war crimes tribunal to      help put an end to that.       Inaugurated by the United Nations on May 25, 1993, and      based in The Hague, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has, to      date, tried just 16 defendants. With a staff of more than 750      and an annual budget of more than $94 million, it has the      resources--and the authority--to indict Milosevic. Indeed,      failure to indict would reveal the tribunal's impotence in      the face of political controversy, and prove that this      institution of international law and justice is merely an      expensive and irrelevant relic.       How difficult would it be to indict Milosevic? Not      difficult at all. Under the tribunal's statute, the office of      the prosecutor need only determine ``that a prima facie case      exists.'' that's to say that the prosecutor must gather      evidence sufficient to prove reasonable grounds that      Milosevic committed a single crime under the tribunal's      extensive jurisdiction.       With this in mind, the chances of Milosevic being held      accountable increase with the arrival of each new group of      refugees driven from their homes in Kosovo. Their remarkably      consistent testimony is providing crucial information--now      being gathered by representatives of the tribunal as well as      by human rights organizations--about what has actually taken      place in Kosovo. These firsthand accounts are indispensable      in building a case against Milosevic--and the refugees I      interviewed during the days I was there are willing to      testify about what they saw.       But with refugees flooding out of Kosovo and some being      relocated in distant countries, the prosecutor's office must      ensure that testimony is taken swiftly, legally and      professionally. The lack of access to Kosovo by independent      journalists and human rights monitors and the extreme      instability of refugee life heighten the importance of      collecting these accounts while they are still fresh in      people's minds. Yet the prosecutor's office was slow to act.      A full five weeks went by before the tribunal sent a corps of      investigators to the region.       What crimes should the Yugoslav president be indicted for?      The tribunal's statute provides jurisdiction over ``serious      violations of international humanitarian law'' including both      ``crimes against humanity'' and ``genocide,'' the most      abhorrent of all. Milosevic should be indicted for both.       Crimes against humanity are defined as ``systematic and      widespread'' and directed at any civilian population; they      include murder, extermination, imprisonment, rape and      deportation. They are distinguished from other acts of      communal violence because civilians are victimized according      to a systematic plan that usually emanates from the highest      levels of government.       In Kosovo, the forced deportation of ethnic Albanians by      the Yugoslav army and the Serbian Interior Ministry police      force is an obvious manifestation of such crimes. The      refugees with whom I spoke described being robbed, beaten,      herded together and forced to flee their villages with      nothing but the clothes they were wearing. By confiscating      all evidence of the ethnic Albanians' identity--passports,      birth certificates, employment records, driver's licenses,      marriage licenses--the Serbian forces also severed the      refugees' links with their communities and land in Kosovo.      This attempt to make each ethnic Albanian a non-person is      itself a crime against humanity. Emerging evidence of mass      killings, summary executions and gang rape lends further      credence to the widespread and systematic nature of these      crimes.       As to the crime of genocide, the tribunal's statute rests      on the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of      Genocide, which defines genocide as ``acts committed with      intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical,      racial or religious group.'' Arising as it did from the      extermination of the Jews in Nazi Germany, the convention      invites comparison with the Holocaust and is intended to      prevent such heinous crimes from happening again. This      tragedy has not reached that perverse level of brutality but,      like earlier efforts to eliminate an entire people--whether      the Jews, the Armenians or the Tutsis--it should be      prosecuted as a crime of genocide.       The convention addresses intent, and stipulates that acts      designed to eliminate a people--in whole or in part--     constitute genocide. Among other acts covered by the      convention, crimes of genocide include ``(a) killing members      of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to      members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the      group conditions of life calculated to bring about its      physical destruction in whole or in part.''       In the former Yugoslavia, acts of genocide have been      perpetrated through the abhorrent policy of ethnic      cleansing--that is, making areas ethnically homogenous by      expelling entire segments of the Kosovar population and      destroying the very fabric of a people.       Ethnic cleansing does not require the elimination of all      ethnic Albanians: it may target specific elements of the      community that make the group--as a group--sustainable. The      abduction the execution of the intelligentsia, including      public officials, lawyers, doctors and political leaders, for      example, is part of a pattern of ethnic cleansing and could      constitute genocide, as could targeting a particular segment      of the population such as young men. It is clear from the      refugees who have been interviewed that these acts are being      systematically committed in Kosovo.       An often overlooked but important element of the 1948      convention is that an individual can be indicated not only      for committing genocide, but also for conspiring to commit      genocide, inciting the public to commit genocide, attempting      to commit genocide or for complicity in genocide. The Point      is that criminal responsibility extends far beyond those who      actually perform the physical acts resulting in genocide. In      short, the political architects such as Milosevic are no less      responsible than the forces that carry out this butchery.      There is no immunity from genocide.       Prosecuting Milosevic will require relying on a legal      strategy based on the concept of ``imputed command      responsibility.'' Under this theory, Milosevic can be held      responsible for crimes committed by his subordinates if he      knew or had reason to know that crimes were about to be      committed and he failed to take preventive measures of to      punish those who had already committed crimes.       Since it is unlikely that Milosevic has allowed documentary      evidence to be preserved that would link him to atrocities in      Kosovo, the prosecutor's office will have to rely heavily on      circumstantial evidence to build its case. This means      identifying a consistant ``pattern of conduct'' that links      Milosevic to similar illegal acts, to the officers and      staff involved, or to the logistics involved in carrying      out atrocities. The very fact that atrocities have been so      widespread, flagrant, grotesque and similar in nature      makes it near certain that Milosevic knew of them; despite      his recent protestations to the contrary, it defies logic      to suggest that he could be unaware of what his forces are      doing.       What will the consequences be if the Yugoslav president is      indicted? First an indictment would send a clear message that      the international community will not negotiate or have      contact with a war criminal. It is current U.S. policy not to      negotiate with indicted war crimes suspects. And so it should      be. Milosevic would be stripped of international statute      except as a fugitive from justice. This might, in turn, open      an avenue for Serbians to once again distance themselves from      their leader's regime. Second, an indictment would likely      result in an ex parte hearing in which the prosecutor's      office could present its case in open court--without      Milosevic being there. By establishing a public record of      Milosevic's role in the crimes committed, such a hearing      would be cathartic for both victims and witnesses, and also      for citizens long denied access to the truth. Finally, the      tribunal would issue an international arrest warrant making      it unlikely that Milosevic would venture outside his      country's borders.       When I watched the bus loads of new arrivals enter the      Stenkovec camp, I saw a small girl's face pressed against the      window. Her hollow eyes seemed to stare at no one. History      was being repeated. In his opening statement at the Nuremberg      trials in 1945, U.S. chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson said,      ``The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so      calculated, so malignant, and so devastating that      civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it      cannot survive their being repeated.'' Jackson was expressing      the hope that law would somehow redeem the next generation      and that similar atrocities would never again be allowed.      Today, we must hold personally liable those individuals who      commit atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. To negotiate with      the perpetrators of these crimes not only demands the      suffering of countless civilian victims, it sends a clear      message that justice is expendable, that war crimes can go      unpunished. Inevitably, lasting peace will be linked to      justice, and justice will depend on accountability. Failing      to indict Milosevic in the hope that he can deliver a      negotiated settlement makes a mockery of the words ``Never      Again.''                               ____________________
