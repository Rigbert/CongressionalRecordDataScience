 President, I expect shortly my amendment will be tabled. That will be further evidence that there is not a majority of the Senate willing to confront the issue of either union corruption as we discovered yesterday or, in the case of the amendment about to be voted on, plaintiff's lawyer misconduct.  The underlying amendment, the Edwards-Enzi amendment, addresses the issue of corporate counsel, defense counsel misconduct, and it seemed only appropriate to me that we deal with the other side of the equation; that is, the lawyers who represent plaintiffs in Federal claims and in Federal courts.  This is a long overdue matter to be dealt with. If not now, when? My good friend from Maryland said this is an inappropriate bill to deal with it, so I suggested maybe he would support me in bringing up my matter freestanding with a time agreement; he smiled, but clearly the answer was no.
