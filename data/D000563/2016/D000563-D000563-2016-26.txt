President, I want to take a few moments to acknowledge Bernarda ``Bernie'' Wong, founder and president of the Chinese American Service League, CASL--and Esther Wong, cofounder and executive director of CASL. Earlier this year, Bernie and Esther announced they would be retiring on December 31, 2016.  Nearly 40 years ago, along with eight Chinese American friends, Bernie and Esther gathered over potluck dinners to discuss the needs of the Chinese community in Chicago. These discussions led to the creation of the Chinese American Service League, commonly referred to as CASL. CASL began with the goal of teaching English as a second language to Chinese immigrants. But today, because of Bernie's leadership, CASL has become one of the largest Asian American social service organizations in the country, providing social support services from early childhood development through elder care.  Born and raised in Hong Kong, Bernie moved to the United States in 1962 at the age of 18. Like many immigrants, Bernie came to the United States to further her education. She was awarded a full scholarship to attend Briar Cliff University in Sioux City, IA, and graduated in 1962 with a degree in social work. Before moving to Chicago, Bernie received her master's degree in social work from Washington University in St. Louis. Social work was in her blood. Her mother used tell her, ``Share and give. Even if you don't have much, you share it . . .'' And that is exactly what Bernie did, but it didn't come easy. When Bernie first came to Chicago, she faced push back from community leaders. They didn't want an outsider coming in and shining a light on their problems. Some considered it shameful. But that didn't stop Bernie. She went to the United Way and explained what she was trying to do. In 1979, they awarded her a special grant. She used it to start CASL.  Today Bernie's vision for Chinese immigrants in Chicago has grown from an annual budget of $32,000 to $13 million and a handful of employees to 450, serving more than 17,000 of the community's most vulnerable. She once said, ``It's my job to know what the people in this community need. Then we can make a program available that will help them.'' That guiding principle has led Bernie and Esther to launch and oversee each of CASL's programs giving immigrants the tools to succeed in America, such as senior and child care services, family counseling, financial education, and employment training.  Bernie has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the Champion of Change Award given by President Obama for her extraordinary leadership in the community. Her other awards include United Way of Chicago's Executive of the Year Award; Crain's Chicago ``100 Most Influential Women of Chicago;'' and the Chicago Historical Society's Jane Addams Making History Award. Bernie also chaired the Chicago mayor's advisory council on Asian affairs and was the first Asian appointed to the boards of United Way of Chicago and the Chicago Public Library. And just last month, her years of service were recognized with her very own street: Bernarda ``Bernie'' Wong Way, right outside the Chinese American Service League. What an honor.  Since CASL's beginning, Esther Wong has been a faithful founding member. For more than two decades, she has served as chair of the program committee. Esther has been integral in CASL's success. So much so that, in 2002, Esther was recruited to assume the newly created executive director position. In this role, Esther has been responsible for expanding CASL's programs to include housing and financial education. She has also overseen several significant infrastructure improvements that have allowed CASL to provide critical safety net programs to the Chicagoland community. As a recipient of the mayor's Commission on Women's Affairs' Woman of the Year Award and the Asian American Coalition of Chicago's Community Services Award, Esther served on countless boards in the Asian American and immigrant community. She continues to serve on the boards of the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development, the Coalition for Limited English Speaking Elderly, and the Chicago Jobs Council.  I will close with this. A few years ago, the Chicago Tribune interviewed Bernie. They asked how she would like to be remembered if she ever retired. She recalled a time when a janitor was sitting down eating lunch in the cafeteria. In China, you don't sit with your boss, so he was trying to leave. Bernie said, ``No, sit down.'' He told her, ``I've never seen a boss who wanted to include you.'' That is Bernie Wong's legacy. She simply wants people to know she cares and to make people feel included. After a career spanning nearly four decades at CASL, providing comprehensive and inclusive programs for immigrants and helping generations born in America realize their dreams, one thing is clear: Bernie and Esther care.  I want to congratulate Bernie and Esther on two wonderful careers and thank them for their service to our community. I wish them and their husbands, Albert and David, all the best in the next chapter of their lives.                          ____________________
