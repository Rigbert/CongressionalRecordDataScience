Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to his country and community is exceptional. The Inland Empire has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Mr. Arnold R. Dickson is one these individuals.  Arnold R. Dickson was bom in Auburn, California and moved to Riverside, located in my congressional district, in 1958. He graduated from Ramona High School in 1962 and joined the U.S. Air Force in 1965 in which he honorably served for four years. Upon his return from the military, he attended Riverside Community College where he earned his AA Certificates in the Supervision and Middle Management Program. He obtained his Bachelor's of Science from the University of Maryland and recently completed the Executive Management Program at the University of California, Riverside.  Arnold's exemplary career with The Gas Company began in 1970 as a serviceman in The Gas Company's old Eastern Division, which serviced most of Riverside County. Arnold was promoted into management in 1978 and held positions in critical areas of the company such as Pipeline Operations, Customer Service, Public Affairs and Staff Management. On July 1, 1994 Arnold was selected to be the Regional Public Affairs Manager in The Gas Company's Inland Empire Region.  Arnold has also been actively involved in the community as the Vice-Chairman of the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, a board member for the Riverside County Regional Medical Center Foundation, a board member for the Loma Linda University Children's Hospital Foundation and numerous other organizations that benefit the overall well-being of the businesses and residents of the Inland Empire.  Arnold has been married to his wife Priscilla for 34 years and has three wonderful children, the youngest of which resides with them in Redlands.  Arnold's tireless work as a community leader has contributed unmeasurably to the betterment of the County of Riverside. His involvement in community organizations in the Inland Empire make me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I am grateful for his efforts and service and salute him as he departs. I look forward to continuing to work with him for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
