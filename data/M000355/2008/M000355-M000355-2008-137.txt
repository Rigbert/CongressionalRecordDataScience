 President, reserving the right to object, as I understand it, this consent, if entered, would have the effect of moving us off of energy, and it is my view, and I think close to the unanimous view of my conference, that we ought to stay on this energy speculation bill, as it might be amended, and proceed to amendments such as we have in good faith discussed here a few moments ago. So I at this time would object to this.
