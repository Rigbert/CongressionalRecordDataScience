Speaker, today, I am joined by our colleagues, Representatives Charlie Stenholm, Calvin Dooley, and Tom Barrett, in introducing the Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1995. This legislation would put in place tough, new measures to reform the budget process and eliminate the Federal budget deficit by the year 2002.  I cosponsored the predecessors to this bill when they were introduced in the 102d and 103d Congresses by our former colleagues, Leon Panetta and Tim Penny. This Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1995 would force us to start now and begin bringing the budget into balance by the year 2002. It would do so by setting spending caps and using across-the-board cuts if the caps aren't met. Here's how:          The Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1995 Summary       (1) Deficit Reduction Targets (in addition to the amounts      required by current law) to reach balance in 2002.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      1996         1997         1998         1999         2000         2001         2002        Total   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Discretionary caps..............................         12.9         30.1         53.9         73.8         98.9        121.7        144.6        535.9Entitlement/revenue scorecard...................         31.9         59.6         80.6        105.6        125.3        147.4        169.4        719.9Debt service....................................          1.7          6.2         13.6         24.2         38.4         56.2         77.9        218.1                                                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Grand total...............................         46.5         95.9        148.1        203.6        262.6        325.3        391.9      1,473.9--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       (2) Setting Sound Economic Estimates: The President      appoints a ``Board of Estimates,'' consisting of the Chairman      of the Federal Reserve and four private citizens nominated by      House and Senate party leaders. The Board must choose either      CBO's or OMB's estimates of how much deficit reduction is      needed in that Session. The Board's choices would be binding      on the President and Congress, so that the deficit reduction      requirement for each would be identical. Finally, the Board      would meet again after adjournment to pick either CBO's or      OMB's estimates of how much deficit reduction was actually      accomplished by Congress during the Session.       (3) Requirement of President to Submit Balanced Budget: The      President must propose a budget that will reach balance by      2002. Further, the President's budget must use the      assumptions chosen      by the Board of Estimates, meet all discretionary caps and      entitlement/revenue deficit reduction targets, achieve      balance in 2002 and each year thereafter, and be voted on      by Congress.       (4) Requirement of Budget Committees to Report Balanced      Budget: Likewise, the congressional budget resolution must      lay out a plan to reach balance by 2002. Budget resolutions      also must use the estimating assumptions chosen by the Board      of Estimates, meet all discretionary caps and entitlement/     revenue deficit reduction targets, and achieve balance in      2002 and each year thereafter.       (5) Enforcement:       A. Discretionary savings--Appropriations. The discretionary      savings will be achieved by keeping appropriations bills      within a single annual cap, and enforced by across-the-board      sequestration of discretionary programs.       B. Entitlement/revenue savings--Reconciliation. The      entitlement/revenue deficit reduction priorities will be set      through the annual budget process. The budget resolution      (conference agreement) will include a reconciliation      directive targeting by committee the dollar amount of deficit      reduction to be achieved from entitlements and/or revenues      and will generate a ``spin-off bill'' (to be sent to the      President) putting those targets into law.       C. Sequestration: Overall reconciliation requirements will      be enforced by sequestration; the type of sequestration in      any year depends on whether a spin-off bill has been enacted.       (1) Targeted sequestration to enforce reconciliation:      (applies if a spin-off bill has been enacted, either as a      result of a budget resolution or, later, as a title in a      reconciliation bill). If a committee misses its entitlement      target, entitlement programs within that committee's      jurisdiction will be sequestered by a uniform percentage to      meet the target. If revenues do not meet the revenue target,      a uniform personal and corporate surtax will be imposed to      meet the target.       (2) Comprehensive sequestration: (applies if a spin-off      bill has not been enacted; this would generally occur if the      President first vetoes the spin-off bill, then vetoes a      reconciliation bill containing the committee targets). There      will be a comprehensive sequestration of entitlement spending      and some revenue provisions in the amount needed to hit the      overall target for entitlement/revenue deficit reduction. For      revenues, a surtax would be imposed upon personal annual      incomes greater      than $250,000 and corporate incomes over $10 million. This      formula will produce $4 in entitlement spending cuts for      every $1 in revenue increases.       (6) Tax cuts/Investment: Tax cuts and/or investment      policies can be enacted if they are paid for.  I believe that balancing the budget is our moral responsibility as Members of Congress. I have always supported a balanced budget, and the responsibility to achieve this is not one that I take lightly. Over the years, I have frequently taken the political road less traveled in the name of deficit reduction. When I am in northwest Indiana, I tell my constituents that I am opposed to cutting their taxes because it would undermine serious efforts to reduce the deficit. In March, I was one of only six Democrats to support the rescissions bill because I believe we need to start making tough spending decisions now. In January, I supported a constitutional amendment to balance the budget for the first time because I finally lost [[Page E877]] faith that the Congress has the resolve to balance the budget without being required to do so.  Regardless of the amendment's defeat in the Senate, we must not give up the fight for a balanced budget. We have the power to do this without a constitutional amendment, and it is critical that we now demonstrate the collective courage necessary to eliminate deficit spending. A majority of the House and Senate has demonstrated its support for balancing the budget, and it would be a cruel hoax on the American people to fail to do so simply because we do not have a constitutional imperative.  Nations, like families, have to plan for the future. As a nation, we have failed to plan. We have borrowed to achieve a false sense of security today, leaving the bills for our children to pay tomorrow. In 1994, alone, we spent $203 billion more than we had. This means that $783 was borrowed from every single person in America. Over the past 20 years, the average budget deficit has grown from $36 billion in the 1970's, to $156 billion in the 1980's, to the unprecedented $248 billion hole we have dug for ourselves so far in the 1990's. This irresponsible spending has resulted in a money pit so deep that this year's interest payment--$235 billion--will be larger than this year's deficit of $176 billion. The Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1995 would stop this destructive trend. It would set us on the path to achieve a balanced budget by 2002.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation. The sooner we begin a serious effort to balance the budget, the better off our children and grandchildren will be.                          ____________________
