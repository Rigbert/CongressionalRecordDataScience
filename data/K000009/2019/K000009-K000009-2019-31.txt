It honors the 20th century's greatest accomplishment, the victory of liberty over tyranny.  As the Representative who introduced the original legislation to construct the memorial, I rise tonight in support of the National World War II Commemorative Coin Act.  This bipartisan piece of legislation, which I am honored to introduce alongside my friend and colleague Representative Peter King from New York, authorizes the U.S. Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.  The coin will serve as an important emblem of the spirit, sacrifice, and commitment of the brave Americans who fought to defend our great Nation and its democratic allies and to advance peace and freedom throughout the world.  I ask all of my colleagues to look at our bill, and I urge them to support this legislation.                          ____________________
