He and I are of the same mind in terms of the authority and responsibility of Congress when it comes to a declaration of war. It is interesting to note that last year when a similar amendment was called on the defense appropriation bill, offered by a gentleman in the House, David Skaggs, only 15 Members of the Senate voted in favor of it, including the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Delaware, myself, and a handful of others. It will be interesting to see this debate now in the context of a real conflict.  I have seen a copy of this amendment, and I want to understand the full clarity and intention of the Senator. As I understand it, there are two paragraphs offered as part of this amendment. They use different language in each paragraph. I wish the Senator would clarify.
