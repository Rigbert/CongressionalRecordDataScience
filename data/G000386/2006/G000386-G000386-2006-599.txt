 President, I hope we just have one more rollcall vote--on final passage. It is my understanding that the Menendez amendment has been changed to a sense of the Senate, so that means the amendment I was going to offer on AMT will not be offered. Consequently, I am hoping we can get this amendment agreed to on a voice vote.
