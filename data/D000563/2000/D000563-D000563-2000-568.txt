I think it is a sharp contrast to some of the rhetoric we hear on the Presidential campaign trail from the Republican candidates. Some have suggested again this theory of massive tax cuts that go way beyond our ability to pay without raiding theSocial Security trust fund. I think that has become an accepted premise for all budgets on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat alike: We are going to say the Social Security trust fund is not going to be raided; we will set it aside. We hear candidates on the campaign trail calling for tax cuts that require raiding the Social Security trust fund.  The President does not. He says we will hold to that basic principle. I think in so doing, he is standing for principles Americans believe in: Protect Social Security and make certain we bring down the debt incurred by Social Security as a way of forcing fiscal discipline in the process.
