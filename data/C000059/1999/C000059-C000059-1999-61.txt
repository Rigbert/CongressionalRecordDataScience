Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 436 and the rule, the Government Waste, Fraud and Error Reduction Act.  Since 1995, Congress has worked diligently to send Federal money back to the States and communities, but Congress also has the responsibility to ensure that our tax dollars are spent wisely. We have trimmed the size of the Federal Government, reined in excessive spending and eradicated redundant programs. We have a balanced budget for the first time in 30 years and a budget surplus of $70 billion in 1998, with the prediction that it will be almost $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.  The next logical step is to combat fraud, abuse and errors that cost taxpayers their hard-earned money. The Federal Government has more than $50 billion in delinquent non-tax debts and gives up collecting on about $10 billion each year. This is government waste at its worst, and for taxpayers this is certainly an outrage.  H.R. 436 is responsible legislation. It collects delinquent debts owed to the government and ensures that benefits do not go to those who are ineligible. It places special emphasis on the worst delinquent debtors, those who owe taxpayers over $1 million.  This is common sense legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it and support the rule. I would like to thank my friend from Long Beach, California, (Mr. Horn) for bringing this legislation to the floor. His commitment to helping our taxpayers and improving the functions of government is to be commended.
