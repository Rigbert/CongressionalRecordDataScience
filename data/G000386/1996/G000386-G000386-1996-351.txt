 President, off of my time.  For those on the Budget Committee, this amendment attempts to do almost exactly what I did in the Budget Committee, somewhat lower numbers, but also the numbers are not fenced in the truest sense of the word because, under the budget resolution, that would be subject to a point of order, and we wanted to make sure the amendment was germane.  So to the Budget Committee members, we are still trying to reduce the deficit by the amount we are saving on defense. For the rest of the Senate, I want to say my approach is the same, the same goal, lower numbers. We arespeaking about reducing the defense numbers, and we are speaking about reducing the deficit when we save money on defense. The exception to that would be the President of the United States capability of declaring that he needs more money for defense and having that be considered, in an emergency, and not having to have offsetting numbers.  It strikes a balance, I believe, between administration proposals for defense spending and that proposed in the budget resolution.  The amendment would reduce the budget authority for defense for fiscal year 1997 by $8.3 billion below the budget resolution. Outlays for defense in fiscal year 1997 would be reduced by $2.3 billion. The savings are earmarked for deficit reduction.  Some of my friends might be concerned that down the road, we will need more funds for national security. In that case, this amendment allows the President to propose emergency spending for defense without requiring offsets.  I am pleased to be joined on this amendment as my main cosponsor by Senator Exon, a member of the Armed Services Committee and ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, as well as Senators Kohl, Kerry, Feingold, and my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin. I should note this amendment is supported by the National Taxpayers Union, one of the top deficit hawk groups in Washington, DC, and I ask unanimous consent to print that letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     National Taxpayers Union,                                     Alexandria, VA, May 15, 1996.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for contacting the      National Taxpayers Union (NTU) regarding the amendment you      plan to offer to the FY 1997 Budget Resolution in an effort      to control defense spending.       Your amendment would ``fence'' $11.3 billion in budget      authority and $2.9 billion in outlays (the difference between      the President's proposal and the Committee's mark for FY      1997), making the additional funding contingent upon the      President's certification that the funds are necessary for      national security. If the President fails to make that      certification the funds would be used to reduce the deficit.       America's taxpayers deserve a more fiscally responsible and      cost effective federal government, as well as the lower taxes      that should result from spending reductions.       Your legislation will be helpful in that regard, and      therefore NTU is pleased to endorse it and urge your      colleagues to support it.           Sincerely,                                                     Al Cors, Jr.,                                   Director, Government Relations.
