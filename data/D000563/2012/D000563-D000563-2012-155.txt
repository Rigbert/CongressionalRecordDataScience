President, it was 101 years ago when my grandmother came to this country with three small children and landed in Baltimore from Lithuania, and came down the steps into America for the first time. The year was 1911. I don't know how my grandmother managed to navigate her way to East Saint Louis, IL, to meet my grandfather with those three little kids and not speaking a word of English, but she did. So it is with some pride that I have displayed in my office right behind my desk my mother's naturalization certificate when she became a citizen of the United States.  I think the fact that her son became a U.S. Senator tells a great story about our Nation and the opportunity that is available.  I have always had a soft spot in my heart for immigrants because I am the proud son of an immigrant who came to this country and worked her way into citizenship and raised a good family. Our story is not unique. It is, in fact, the American story. And this election has really brought to the attention of many the need for us to deal with immigration reform. There are more than 10 million Americans out there who are undocumented, uncertain of their future. Some people mistakenly believe they live in homes full of undocumented people. In most cases, we find that four out of the five in a family are legally here in America and the fifth--maybe even mom--is undocumented. So it is a challenge for us to deal with these folks who have been here for so long in a fair and honest way. We can't turn our backs on them.  One can go into a restaurant or hotel in Chicago and by and large find many of these individuals working to clean the rooms and clear the tables. A family who has someone in a nursing home probably has an undocumented worker who is making sure their mother or father or someone they love has the basics they need every single day. So we need a realistic and reasonable approach to address the millions of undocumented immigrants living in America today.  In this year's election, the Republican Presidential nominee advocated what he called ``self-deportation.'' It doesn't make any sense. It would be wrong to force millions of hard-working immigrants who are contributing to our country to leave. Instead, we need a better solution--a path to citizenship for immigrants who will earn their way into that status by working hard, paying their taxes, learning English, and being a part of America's future. The American people agree. According to exit polls from last week's election, 65 percent of Americans--64 percent of Independents, 51 percent of Republicans--said that most undocumented immigrants working in the United States should be given a chance to apply for legal status, and 29 percent disagreed.  In my time in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to be involved in several bipartisan efforts to pass immigration reform. On the Democratic side, the late Senator Ted Kennedy was our leader, and Senator John McCain took the lead on the Republican side. President Barack Obama, then a Senator, was part of that effort. Unfortunately, we haven't moved forward since those days.  There is one part of immigration reform that is very important to me personally. It is known as the DREAM Act. Eleven years ago I introduced this legislation for the first time. It would allow a select group of immigrant students with great potential to contribute to this country. The DREAM Act would give these students a chance to earn their way to citizenship if they came to the United States as children, have good moral character, graduate from high school, and complete at least 2 years of college or serve in our military. Now, these young people grew up in America, and they have overcome great obstacles. They went to school with many of our own kids, and they are valedictorians, star athletes, and leaders in the ROTC. They are our future doctors, engineers, and teachers who will make America stronger. Why would we want to educate them and then lose their talents for the future of our country?  Last month a new report from the Center for American Progress and the bipartisan Partnership for a New American Economy concluded that passage of the DREAM Act would add $329 billion to our economy and create 1.4 million new jobs by 2030. In my home State of Illinois, by 2030 the DREAM Act would contribute $14 billion to the economy and DREAMers would create up to 58,000 new jobs, generating $461 million in tax revenue.  The young people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act call themselves DREAMers. Like the civil rights activists of past generations, they speak out. Now they are telling us their stories. I have been coming to the floor almost every week in the Senate to tell the story of another DREAM Act student. It is the best way for people to understand who they are.  I want to talk about Carlos Martinez today. Carlos and his brother were brought to the United States in 1991 when Carlos was 9 years old. When Carlos came to this country, he didn't speak a word of English. His father told him, ``Estudien para que no batallen en la vida como yo.'' Translated, it means, ``Study, so you don't struggle in life like I have.'' That was the advice he received from his dad, and Carlos took it to heart. At Cholla High School in Tucson, AZ, Carlos graduated ninth in his class. He enrolled at the University of Arizona. He had never owned a computer before he went to school, but he loved math and dreamed of being a computer engineer. Four years later, in 2003, Carlos graduated with a bachelor of science degree in computer engineering, with minors in computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, and Spanish. He was named the top Hispanic graduate in his class at the University of Arizona.  After Carlos graduated, reality set in. He received job offers from Intel, IBM, and a lot of top tech companies, but he couldn't work for them because he is undocumented. But Carlos didn't give up. He enrolled in a master's program for software systems engineering at the University of Arizona. He completed the 2\1/2\-year program in just a year and a half. He was nominated for the University of Arizona Graduate School Centennial Award, given to the school's top graduate student.  This is a hopeful time for DREAMers like Carlos. The Obama administration has granted temporary legal status to young people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act. The status--known as deferred action for childhood arrivals--will allow DREAMers to live and work legally in America, and they can renew it every 2 years. This will give these young immigrants the chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they have ever really known. It is a historic moment in the long struggle for equal justice in America.  The administration's new deportation policy will make America stronger by giving the DREAMers a chance to be part of it. Carlos Martinez submitted his application on August 15, the very first day forms were available, and he was one of the first to receive deferred action for childhood arrivals. Thanks to President Obama's new policy, Carlos will finally be able to use his bachelor's and master's degree in computer engineering. He had to wait 7 years after receiving his master's degree, but the day has finally come when he will get his chance.  As soon as he received the notification, Carlos went to a career fair at his alma mater and handed out resumes to IBM, Intel, and the other tech companies that had tried to hire him years earlier. In a letter he wrote to me, Carlos said:       It was the best news of my life. Finally I would be able to      work as a software engineer or own a business and create      jobs.  According to recent polls, the American people clearly support the new DREAM Act policy. For example, a Bloomberg poll found that 64 percent of likely voters--including 66 percent of Independents--support the policy, compared to only 30 percent who oppose it. The American people understand it makes no sense to deport these talented young people. They grew up in America, and they can make us a better nation.  As America learns more about the DREAMers in our midst, such as CarlosMartinez, who are ready to contribute their talents to getting our economy back on track, support will build for passing the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform. President Obama has given temporary protection to DREAMers. Now let's pass the law. Let's do the right thing for people just like Carlos all over the United States.  Mr. President, I have listened carefully to some of the statements made after the elections by those on the other side of the aisle, many of whom have opposed the DREAM Act from the start, and I have been heartened and encouraged that so many are now speaking out in favorable terms about doing something finally for young people like Carlos. Let's get this done. This used to be a very bipartisan measure, but filibusters have stopped it year after year. We can pass it, and we should pass it. In 2007, the first time the DREAM Act came to a vote on the floor of the Senate, 52 Senators--a bipartisan majority--voted for it, but still the Republican filibuster stopped us. We didn't get the 60 votes we needed. Three years later, in December of 2010, the DREAM Act was again considered on the floor of the Senate. The gallery was filled with DREAMers in their caps and gowns. It was an inspiring sight to look up and see them in those seats. That day 55 Senators voted for the DREAM Act. It was a majority but not enough; we needed 60 to overcome another Republican filibuster. The President and the vast majority of Democrats continue to support the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform.  Let me add that the DREAM Act is very important to me, but equally if not more important is comprehensive immigration reform to help not only Carlos but many like him--their parents and members of their family--who may not qualify under the DREAM Act but deserve a chance as well.  I believe most of my Republican colleagues understand that immigration is good for America. Immigration is America. We are all immigrants but for the Native Americans who welcomed to the shores the occupants of the Mayflower. Former President George W. Bush led the attempt to reform legislation, and he said, ``Family values don't stop at the Rio Grande.'' I disagree with George W. Bush on many things, but on the issue of immigration, he was genuine and committed, and I agree with what he said. I have been heartened by comments from Speaker Boehner and others in the last week. I believe Democrats and Republicans of good will can come together across the aisle, roll up our sleeves, and do something good for America and fix our broken immigration system so that it is true to our American values as a nation of immigrants.                          ____________________
