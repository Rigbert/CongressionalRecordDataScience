Speaker, last month as a cochair of the Jobs and Fair Trade Caucus, I proudly presented our group's first monthly Golden Eagle Award to Malden Mills in Methuen, MA.  If you will recall, the Gold Eagle Award recognizes fine U.S. companies that exemplify the best that is in us as a nation, companies which treat their workers with dignity while making decent profits, companies which contribute to strengthening their communities, companies which charge a reasonable price for their products and remain and prosper in these United States. When all of these practices are undertaken by one company, that company deserves our praise as a Golden Eagle U.S. company.  On the other hand, the Corporate Vulture designation, like the scavenger it represents, is given to a company in need of vast improvement, a company which exploits our marketplace yet downsizes its work force in America and outsources most of its production to foreign countries using sweatshop labor abroad. These firms then import their transhipped products back to the United States while keeping their prices high here at home and maintaining all of the benefits of being called an American company.                              {time}  2130  Corporate vultures deserve the consumers' disdain. Now, let me acknowledge this month's Golden Eagle company. The March 18 issue of Business Week detailed the unprecedented stock ownership of the company we all know as United Airlines, our Nation's leading airline company. Tonight, the Jobs and Fair Trade Caucus awards the employee owners of United Airlines our Golden Eagle Award and this new U.S. flag flown over the Capitol for your leadership, your rising productivity, and the example you set for all other companies in these United States.  United Airlines and its employee owners fit our description of a golden Eagle company in every respect. In the 18 months since United employees bought 55 percent of their company for $5 billion, United Airlines has confounded all the skeptics by their success. The Nation's No. 1 airline is outperforming most of its rivals, gaining markets share from the other top two airlines. The company is posting fatter operating margins and higher stock gains, with the stock price more than doubling since the purchase of the company.  The American workers of United and its chief executive officer Gerry Greenwald have made the company the success it is. By taking a huge risk in accepting pay cuts of 15 percent or more in the short term, United employees have shown that hard work over the long haul pays dividends. Operating revenue per worker jumped by 10 percent last year. Employee complaints, down by over half, have turned into new ideas about how to better work together with management. And unlike many large corporatios these days, which relentlessly downsize their work force, United is a job creator, hiring 7,000 new people since the buyout.  In marked contrast to our Golden Eagle Award, this month's Corporate Vulture designation goes to Hershey Foods, a company no longer so sweet to America. Hershey Foods, America's largest producer of chocolate, continues to outsource its production to countries like Mexico and cut its U.S. work force. Last fall, Hershey Foods announced layoffs of approximately 500 workers and then announced the company was moving the production line of its giant kiss from Hershey, PA, to its plant in Guadalajara, Mexico, which employs approximately 260 workers. The U.S. workers laid off were earning $15.40 an hour, and as one old-timer stated, as a part of that enjoyed health insurance, dental, eye, along with a pension plan.  Hershey's Mexican workers are paid 50 cents an hour with almost no benefits. The chief executive officer of Hershey Foods, Chairman Kenneth Wolfe, says he understands the pain he has caused the workers and their families in Hershey, PA. I frankly find that hard to believe. Chairman Wolfe earned an annual compensation of $1.2 million in 1994, not counting his stock options. Moreover, Hershey Foods is earning increased profits. The latest annual report shows that Hershey Foods enjoyed a net profit of $184 million, while total sales have increased to $3.6 billion. A company and a chief executive officer earning millions of dollars every year have no idea what it means to lose your job and worry about your family's future.  Economists will claim that Hershey's move to Mexico is good for American consumers. After all, when you are only paying your Mexican workers a few cents an hour and earning millions of dollars, your product will be cheaper, right? Take a look at the shelf. Hershey prices on chocolate have gone up in bars. So this evening, this month, Hershey Foods definitely fits the bill as this month's Corporate Vulture, May 1996.
