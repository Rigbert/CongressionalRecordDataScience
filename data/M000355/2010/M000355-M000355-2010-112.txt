 I would say to my friend the majority leader, I would be willing to consider that. The point I am trying to make here and the Senator from Alabama has tried to make is we are unaware of anybody on our side who does not expect a vote on Kagan on Thursday. As you and I have discussed on and off the floor, the thought was that we would have the Kagan vote. That would be the last vote prior to the August recess. That is the scenario under which we have been operating, and I am perplexed as to why my friend the majority leader feels this is a step he needs to take.
