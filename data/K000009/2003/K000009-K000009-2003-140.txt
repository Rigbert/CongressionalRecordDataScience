Speaker, I wanted to say to the gentleman, if one looks at the last 25 years, it is very important to point out that our last four recessions were all related to rising oil prices going back to the 1970's, the 1980's, and now the new 21st century. And if we do not learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it; and what has happened over a period of time is that there has been more and more military presence placed around the world in order to guard the oil lanes coming in here, and it truly would be destabilizing to our country if those paths were eliminated, but the answer for America is not to become more and more dependent on foreign supplies but rather to use not just the short-term stimulus package but the long-term economic growth strategy for our country to create energy independence so that we are not so vulnerable, and every time some oil baron or king wants to make it a little tough on America, they raise prices and then we are thrown into recession. They know they do not want us to go into deep, deep depression because then they lose some of their revenue, but the point is we are like a puppet on the end of a string and we are not controlling our own destiny. So I would hope that as we move forward, pass this short-term stimulus package that the Democratic Party has offered, and then move into long-term economic growth, that we really look at energy independence as a major pathway to new job creation and investment here at home.
