Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the United States Civil Rights Trail System Act of 2009. I would like to commend my colleagues and friends, Congressman William Lacy Clay and Congressman Zach Wamp for championing this important legislation.  The fight for civil rights was one of the most significant social and cultural movements in our nation's history. Because of the hundreds and thousands of ordinary people with extraordinary vision who participated in the Civil Rights Movement, we witnessed a nonviolent revolution under the rule of law, a revolution of values and ideas that changed this nation forever. We must ensure that the next generation, and the current generation, learn and do not forget the story of the Civil Rights Movement and the ideals that it strove to achieve. This proposed system of trails, would mark the geographic locations in the United States of historically significant events tied to the struggles for racial equality. I saw firsthand the struggle and the pains that ordinary citizens endured at many of these sites to help break down the walls of segregation and their efforts must be memorialized and never forgotten. It is my hope, and belief, that this trail system will help to educate and inspire the next generation of Civil Rights leaders who still have many fights ahead of them. This act will help to preserve and protect the legacy and the story of the Movement for future generations and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.
