Con. Res. 145) expressing the sense of Congress on the propriety and need for expeditious construction of the National World War II Memorial at the Rainbow Pool on the National Mall in the Nation's Capitol.  The Clerk read as follows:                            S. Con. Res. 145       Whereas World War II is the defining event of the twentieth      century for the United States and its wartime allies;       Whereas in World War II, more than 16,000,000 American men      and women served in uniform in the Armed Forces, more than      400,000 of them gave their lives, and more than 670,000 of      them were wounded;       Whereas many millions more on the home front in the United      States organized and sacrificed to give unwavering support to      those in uniform;       Whereas fewer than 6,000,000 World War II veterans are      surviving at the end of the twentieth century, and the Nation      mourns the passing of more than 1,200 veterans each day;       Whereas Congress, in Public Law 103-422 (108 Stat. 4356)      enacted in 1994, approved the location of a memorial to this      epic era in an area of the National Mall that includes the      Rainbow Pool;       Whereas since 1995, the National World War II Memorial site      and design have been the subject of 19 public hearings that      have resulted in an endorsement from the State Historic      Preservation Officer of the District of Columbia, three      endorsements from the District of Columbia Historic      Preservation Review Board, the endorsement of many Members of      Congress, and, most significantly, four approvals from the      Commission of Fine Arts and four approvals from the National      Capital Planning Commission (including the approvals of those      Commissions for the final architectural design);       Whereas on Veterans Day 1995, the President dedicated the      approved site at the Rainbow Pool on the National Mall as the      site for the National World War II Memorial; and       Whereas fundraising for the National World War II Memorial      has been enormously successful, garnering enthusiastic      support from half a million individual Americans, hundreds of      corporations and foundations, dozens of civic, fraternal, and      professional organizations, state legislatures, students in      1,100 schools, and more than 450 veterans groups representing      11,000,000 veterans: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) it is appropriate for the United States to memorialize      in the Nation's Capitol the triumph of democracy over tyranny      in World War II, the most important event of the twentieth      century;       (2) the will of the American people to memorialize that      triumph and all who labored to achieve it, and the decisions      made on that memorialization by the appointed bodies charged      by law with protecting the public's interests in the design,      location, and construction of memorials on the National Mall      in the Nation's Capitol, should be fulfilled by the      construction of the National World War II Memorial, as      designed, at the approved and dedicated Rainbow Pool site on      the National Mall; and       (3) it is imperative that expeditious action be taken to      commence and complete the construction of the National World      War II Memorial so that the completed memorial will be      dedicated while Americans of the World War II generation are      alive to receive the national tribute embodied in that      memorial, which they earned with their sacrifice and      achievement during the largest and most devastating war the      world has known.
