Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support President Bush's policy on Cuba. The Bush Initiative, which says the United States will work with Cuba once Fidel Castro takes concrete measures to improve the abysmal human rights situation and lack of freedoms granted to his people, is the correct course for us to take.  The Bush policy clearly places the ball in Castro's court. Unlike comments made by former President Jimmy Carter last week, the Bush policy recognizes that Castro is a dictator who represses his people and that he, therefore, must take the first steps if he is serious about normalizing ties to the U.S.  I concur completely with the President that Castro must free his political prisoners, legalize political activity, permit free elections, and cease discriminating against Cuban workers before Congress can begin to even consider lifting the economic embargo. Until the Cuban people are free, trade and other favorable relations with Cuba will not help the people. Rather, it will enrich and empower Castro and his cronies so they can maintain an iron clasp on freedom.  Until Castro makes a lasting commitment to freedom, the U.S. cannot engage in activity that would prop him up                          ____________________
