President, today, on behalf of the Greek Cypriot population of Rhode Island and Greek Cypriots around the world, I recognize the 33rd anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.  At 5:30 a.m. 33 years ago today, heavily armed Turkish troops landed on a narrow northern beachhead in Cyprus 5 days after Greek Cypriot nationalists ousted then-President Archbishop Makarios. The invasion and subsequent occupation was described by Turkey as a ``peace operation'' to protect the minority Turkish population living in Cyprus from being victimized in the aftermath of the coup.  However, during the next 2 months, over 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled south or were expelled by Turkish forces. The Turkish Cypriots took over 37 percent of the island and then called a ceasefire, leaving the Greek Cypriots, 82 percent of the population, with under two-thirds of Cyprus. In 1983, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared itself a country. Currently, Turkey is the only nation that recognizes this self-declaration of statehood.  Despite international efforts over the last 30 years to reunify the island, Cyprus has remained divided with more than 40,000 Turkish troops occupying its northern third. The United Nations Security Council and General Assembly have worked to determine an equally agreeable solution, but talks between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north consistently end in a stalemate.  A survey completed in February 2007 by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus found that a majority of both Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities view the United Nations' presence on the island as a positive. Both see any withdrawal scenario involving the U.N. departing before restoration of normal conditions and a settlement being reached as a negative. We must applaud the continued efforts of the United Nations and the focus of Cypriot leaders to reunite a divided Cyprus and remain, ourselves, committed to ushering the settlement process forward. Cypriot, Mediterranean, and United States interests will benefit from a settlement that addresses all legitimate concerns of both sides and promotes the stability of a hostile region.  Sirens wailed across the southern half of Cyprus today, in memory of the day known as ``black anniversary'' among the Greek Cypriots. Cypriot leaders, on both sides of the divide, must take forward steps to wash away the darkness of this day and replace it with peace and tolerance.                          ____________________
