Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those comments.  Mr. Speaker, I would say to the majority leader and to the chairman of the Committee on Rules, this legislation was introduced less than a week ago. It has been marked up this week. It will be on the floor next week. That is a very rapid progression.  I think, Mr. Leader, respectfully, that that calls for even greater opportunity for Members to work their will on the floor, with the ability to offer such amendments as they deem to be appropriate and would include the opportunity to offer an entire package in the form of a substitute. I would hope that that would happen.                          ____________________
