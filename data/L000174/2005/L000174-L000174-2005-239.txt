President, I strongly support Senator McCain's amendment to provide clear guidance for the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. This administration has steadfastly refused to address the black mark on our Nation caused by its interrogation policies and the resulting abuse of detainees. Congress needs to take action.  Our credibility and reputation as a world leader in human rights suffers from our unwillingness to openly address the flaws in our system. More importantly, the failure to provide clear guidance on the treatment of detainees puts our own troops at risk and undermines their efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. I commend my colleagues across the aisle who are attempting to address this problem, despite resistance from members of their own party and the strong opposition of the White House.
