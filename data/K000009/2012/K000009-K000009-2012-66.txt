He is a true leader in protecting American manufacturing jobs and businesses from unfair free trade agreements and works tirelessly to promote jobs and economic development here at home.  I want to say to our dear colleague from Kansas, when you look across America--and I realize this may be just your first term--but, you know, the whole State of Kansas is held up by the Federal Government, all those agricultural subsidies, CRP, rural development, wetlands reserve, etc. When one takes a look at the whole Farm Credit Administration, for heaven's sake, not every community in America has those sorts of props under them. And agriculture is a success story. Agriculture is doing very well. We, in Ohio, understand that. But there are parts of Ohio that aren't covered by programs like your State benefits from. And that's where you need Agencies like the Economic Development Administration, in those corners of America that actually manufacture but may not grow things.                              {time}  1540
