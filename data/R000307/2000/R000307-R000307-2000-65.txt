OASIS is a system of records containing data on the physical, mental, and functional status of Medicare and Medicaid patients receiving care from home health agencies.  HCFA tried to implement OASIS as a tool to help the agency improve the quality of care and form the basis for a new home health care prospective payment system. The problem is--and my colleague chaired the subcommittee and asked all the very pertinent questions--the collection of data is so burdensome and expensive for agencies, it invades the personal privacy of the patients. It must be collected for non-Medicare patients as well as those served by Medicare.  Just yesterday, I learned that the whole OASIS information system in Kansas is not working; the computer system has failed. Agencies across the State are having a lot of difficulty in transmitting any kind of data. This burden is being felt by agencies all over the country. The question I have for the Senator is, Does she have any idea how long it takes? She has already spoken about this to some degree. Can we put a timeframe on it? Can we get more specific as to how long it takes for nurses to collect this information for HCFA? What does it cost in terms of nurse time?
