Mr. Speaker, the Washington Post recently published a very interesting and revealing story by Peter Baker that describes how the authoritarian government of Uzbekistan has allowed a personal family dispute with an American citizen from New Jersey to spill over into the realms of international diplomacy. The problem has gotten so bad that the government of Uzbekistan is now abusing one of the most important international institutions used to fight crime and apprehend terrorists--the Interpol Red Notice system.  Mr. Mansur Maqsudi is an American citizen who lives in New Jersey. Shortly after Mr. Maqsudi asked his wife Gulnora Karimova--who happens to be the daughter of Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov--for a divorce in July of 2002, she left their home in New Jersey to Uzbekistan and illegally brought along their two young children (both of whom are American citizens). In defiance of a U.S. custody order and a U.S. arrest warrant against Ms. Karimova, Mr. Maqsudi has been denied the right to visit his children for more than 2\1/2\ years.  The vendetta waged by the Government of Uzbekistan against this American citizen has grown into far more than a mere child-custody dispute. Three of Mansur's family relatives in Uzbekistan were--and still are--imprisoned on nebulous charges. Despite their eligibility for a general amnesty, they remain in captivity. Twenty-four other relatives were deported from Uzbekistan at gunpoint in the middle of the night in the dead of winter into a war zone in Afghanistan.  Then his family's businesses in Tashkent were expropriated and seized without just compensation (or any compensation in some cases). Flimsy criminal charges were then filed against him, his brother, and his father (all of whom are American citizens). Most outside observers of Uzbek politics, including the U.S. State Department in testimony before Congress, have concluded that these charges were political and not supported with valid evidence.  The Uzbek government then placed all three U.S. citizens on the Interpol Red Notice list. Fortunately, the U.S. Government has studied these cases and decided not to act on any of them because the evidence was so weak. However, when any of those listed travels abroad, they are subjected to the risk of arrest and even possible extradition to Uzbekistan. Instead of focusing law enforcement efforts on apprehending real criminals and terrorists, the bogus Red Notices issued by Uzbekistan are now diverting scarce police attention towards the furtherance of a personal family feud.  This is an outrage, Mr. Speaker. I urge the Executive Branch of our Government to make it clear to Uzbek President Karimov that his country's status as an ally in the War against Terror does not give him carte blanche to totally disregard the 2002 bilateral agreement between the United States and Uzbekistan and abuse the rights of American citizens.  The Interpol Red Notice system is a critical element in the War on Terrorism. And yet here, the Government of Uzbekistan is pulling at the loose threads which make up the fabric of an entire international system that has worked well for years. The end result of Uzbekistan's actions will cause more governments around the world to question the legitimacy of other countries' Red Notice submissions. Countries will now have to decide which arrest warrants to obey, and which warrants to ignore. To the extent that member countries fill the system with garbage warrants that are purely political and violate Article 3 of the Interpol Constitution, it undermines the respect and reciprocity that are at the very heart of Interpol's effectiveness. Interpol is far too important in the fight against drug traffickers, terrorists, and criminals to allow it to be undermined by autocratic regimes who want to harass their political and personal enemies around the world.  I believe the issues at stake in this family dispute go way beyond child custody and divorce. The very heart of a major international institution that is vital to the War on Terrorism is being openly challenged. Nations that flagrantly violate Article 3 of the Interpol Constitution--like Uzbekistan is doing in this particular case--need to pay some kind of diplomatic penalty for doing so. If countries can undermine Interpol at will and without penalty, reproach, or criticism, what is to prevent the system from being flooded with political Red Notices issued by repressive regimes against their enemies? How do we avoid nations refusing to honor each others' requests?               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 13, 2004]Battle Royal--The Daughter of Uzbekistan's President Took Her Children     and Ran, Opening a Custody War That Has Entangled Two New Allies                            (By Peter Baker)       Moscow.--The day she left for good, she packed up her      things and decamped from their New Jersey home with her two      children, two nannies, two bodyguards and a driver.       On a table she left a note for her husband. She mentioned      an old movie playing on cable--``The War of the Roses,'' the      1989 dark comedy featuring Michael Douglas and Kathleen      Turner as hate-driven spouses whose divorce turns into an      orgy of revenge. She jotted down the time the show would air      and pointedly suggested he watch.       Whether that was prophecy or threat, a war soon broke out.      It turns out that divorcing Gulnora Karimova, known as ``the      Uzbek princess,'' is no simple matter. Her father is Islam      Karimov, president of Uzbekistan and autocrat nonpareil, who      rules over a repressive Central Asian country where prisoners      have been boiled alive. He also happens to be a key ally in      America's war on terrorism.       Karimova took the kids in 2001 and has been ducking an      arrest warrant issued by a New Jersey judge ever since,      hiding out in Moscow, where she knows officials won't cross      her father. As for her husband, Mansur Maqsudi, an Afghan      American businessman, he has learned the price of crossing      his powerful father-in-law. Since Maqsudi and his wife split      up, the Uzbek government has effectively taken away his Coca-     Cola bottling plant, imprisoned three of his relatives and      deported 24 more of them at gunpoint to war-torn Afghanistan.       ``She said if I do divorce her she was going to destroy my      family, destroy my business and make sure I could never see      my kids,'' Maqsudi, 37, says by telephone from New Jersey.      ``And if you look at it, that's exactly what happened.''       Karimova, 31, offers the mirror-opposite interpretation.      She only stayed with Maqsudi so long, she says, because she      feared he would use a breakup against her family politically.      ``He said that it would be a huge scandal and all this would      come to your father and his name would be abused,'' she says.      ``I never want to disappoint my father.''       This tabloid drama threatens to complicate U.S. relations      with its important new friend in a volatile region. The State      Department, Justice Department, Internal Revenue Service,      Interpol and various courts, embassies and congressional      committees have all been drawn into the fray. Teams of      American lobbyists have been recruited to fight the ground      war. As New Jersey Superior Court Judge Deanne M. Wilson said      at a court hearing last year, ``This is not just a garden-     variety custody case.''       The allegations fly back and forth--kidnapping, tax      evasion, forgery, smuggling, embezzlement, blackmail, money      laundering and fraud. She accuses him of illegally selling      Saddam Hussein's oil. He accuses her of shipping Uzbek girls      to prostitution rings in Dubai. She describes him as a      moralistic Muslim who once warned her she would burn in Hell      for wearing a bikini. He depicts her as a spoiled rich girl      who partied until the middle of the night, stumbling home      drunk.       ``It was a simple question of divorce,'' she says, in a      considerable understatement, ``but it was politicized from      the very beginning.''                         No Fairy-Tale Romance       She slips into the restaurant, statuesque and fashion-model      thin, wearing boots a bit too stylish for the Russian snow      and a skirt     a bit too short for the Russian winter. Her bodyguard, tall      and imposing, checks out the room in an instant, then      discreetly disappears.       She rarely does interviews. Only after months of      negotiations brokered by her father's foreign minister does      she finally agree to talk, in hopes of rebutting the most      sensational allegations flying around Washington that can      only hurt her father's ties with the world's only superpower.       In person, Gulnora Karimova does not come across as the      hardhearted, domineering figure her husband's partisans      depict. ``That's not me,'' she insists over tea. Speaking      softly, she presents herself as a Harvard-educated diplomat      and businesswoman, albeit one with a black belt in karate.      She tells the story of her marriage and its collapse from the      standpoint of a hurt woman.       The two met at her birthday party in Tashkent, the Uzbek      capital, in July 1991. Karimova was turning 19. ``The world      had just opened up for me,'' she recalls. ``I'd just      graduated from school and started the university, and      everything was sort of pink skies.'' Mansur Maqsudi was 24,      an Afghan native who immigrated to the United States as a      child and became a naturalized citizen. ``He was from a      different world, he spoke a different language,'' she says.       It wasn't much of a romance. They met in person only one      other time before they got married, the night he asked for      her hand. Maqsudi insisted their parents negotiate the      marriage, she recalls, and declined at first to share a drink      to celebrate. They married in Tashkent a month later, in      November 1991, followed by a reception she now describes as      ``quite boring.'' A week later, they went to New Jersey,      where they married again.       As she was starting a new life, so was her homeland.      Uzbekistan was emerging from the wreckage of the Soviet Union      as an independent state, and her father, the republic's      Communist boss, made a seamless transition to president of      the new nation within weeks of Karimova's wedding.       An arid, cotton-producing country where Tamerlane once      ruled a mighty empire, Uzbekistan with its 25 million people      is the most populous and politically muscular of the five      Central Asian states. Tashkent still feels Soviet, a well-     ordered, uninspiring capital filled with drab, boxy apartment      buildings and barely a taste of the dynamic new economy of      far-away Moscow.       Under President Karimov, it has also become a terrifying      place for some people, particularly observant Muslims who      eschew government-controlled mosques. While Gulnora Karimova      was at Harvard in 1999, a radical group called the Islamic      Movement of Uzbekistan set off bombs in Tashkent that killed      16 people. Her father's secular government cracked down on      political Islam, targeting even ordinary Muslims whose only      crime appeared to be wearing a beard as a sign of faith.       About 7,000 people remain in prison for political or      religious beliefs, and often they are beaten, choked, raped      and punished with electric shocks, according to the State      Department's human rights report. A U.N. special rapporteur      has concluded that ``torture or similar ill treatment is      systematic.'' Human Rights Watch has found ``human rights      abuses on a massive scale.''       At the notorious Jaslyk prison camp, built for religious      prisoners in a desert where temperatures rise to 120 degrees,      two men were submerged in boiling water and killed in 2002.      The 62-year-old mother of one was arrested after protesting      her son's death and sentenced to six years of hard labor for      ``attempted encroachment on the constitutional order.'' After      an international outcry, Uzbekistan released her in February      just hours before a visit by Secretary of Defense Donald      Rumsfeld.       Rather than snuff out Islamic extremism, however, Karimov's      tactics may have only radicalized more young Muslims. A      series of suicide bombings and other attacks two weeks ago      left 47 people dead, a wave of violence tied by the      government to al Qaeda-trained Uzbeks.       Karimova offers no apologies for her father. ``He came from      the strong old system with his own views, with his own      standpoint and with his own rules of the game. So you can      argue about new vision, new ability, but he is a professional      and I prefer to think about him as a professional,'' she      says. ``Some people might like it, some people might not. But      in the situation where we are geopolitically and      geographically . . . you have to be strong to be able to      rule.''                            Meet the In-Laws       The newlyweds split their time between New Jersey and the      presidential residence in Tashkent. A year after the wedding      they had a son, Islam, named for his grandfather. A few years      later, a daughter, Iman, came along.       Maqsudi's place in the presidential family certainly didn't      hurt his expanding business empire. Soon he was running the      lucrative Coca-Cola bottling factory in Uzbekistan as well as      other enterprises.       But from the beginning, there were problems with the in-     laws.       Two or three times a week, she says, they would go to his      mother's house, where Karimova found traditional Afghan      family life stultifying. ``It was really difficult because I      was from a small family and used to more open relations, and      in their family it's more like, if this one talks, you are      not supposed to talk, that one is a relative of this      relative, you are not supposed to speak with the aunt.''       At New Year's, the most festive holiday in former Soviet      republics, the Maqsudis barely celebrated. ``They sat on the      floor and ate on the floor,'' she says. When midnight came      and no one got excited, ``I sat and cried next to the TV.''       If she found his family too quiet, he found hers too noisy.      ``When you argued with him,'' Maqsudi says, referring to      President Karimov, ``the loudest would win the argument. It      wasn't about facts, it wasn't about arguments. It was about      who could shout the loudest.''       As he describes it, the Karimovs were flush with power and      money. In the office next to the president's bedroom, Maqsudi      says, was a five-foot safe. He walked in once, Maqsudi says,      and ``I saw the first lady sitting on the floor counting a      lot of cash.''       During a trip to London, he says, Karimova decided to buy      $230,000 worth of jewels. ``I told Gulnora this is very      expensive,'' he says. ``She said she could buy them herself .      . . She unzipped her bag and pulled out a few hundred      thousands dollars, cash. I was shocked. I asked her, `Where      did you get this?' She said, `Oh, it's from my mother.' ''       For all the money, Karimova grew restless. ``I was crying      nonstop,'' she says. ``Imagine, you sit all day alone, and      with my very active life, when I used to go not just to the      university but for languages, sport--I was dying.'' That's      not how Maqsudi remembers it. ``She would come home at 3 in      the morning, sometimes drunk. Sometimes she wouldn't remember      where she was.''       Finally, she enrolled in Harvard for graduate studies on      Central Asia. She says she had to persuade him to let her go      back to school. He says he hoped ``it would have a positive      impact'' and end her partying ways, but it didn't. They      fought over other things. ``I was not supposed to swim in the      pool with my son because I was in a separate swimming suit,''      she says, meaning a bikini. ``And he was, like, `If you ever      enter this swimming pool, you are not my son. And she will be      burnt [in Hell] and you be burnt.'. . . He would make my son      swim in a T-shirt.''       Maqsudi angrily denies this. ``Was she drunk that morning      when you saw her?'' he asks. ``Was she sober? Honestly, these      comments are so ridiculous, they don't deserve a reply.'' He      says he objected to his wife's skimpy swimwear only when the      hired help was around. ``Gulnora was swimming with a G-     string, not even a bathing suit, and these two bodyguards      were lying there sunbathing.''       But he rejects the implication that he is a religious      fundamentalist. To prove it, Maqsudi e-mails pictures of his      son scampering around outside without a shirt and another      showing his wife in a virtually see-through shirt, noting her      visible nipples. ``I go to tailgate parties on Sundays to New      York Jets football games,'' Maqsudi adds. ``That should cover      that.''       In the summer of 2001, they were in Tashkent and preparing      to head back to New Jersey, but the end was near. ``The last      months we were completely leading our own lives,'' she says.      ``It was clear that we were strangers by that time.''       ``That,'' he says, ``was when all hell broke loose.''                              the breakup       Maqsudi knew it was serious when his wife's bodyguards had      him pinned against the wall. It was July and Karimova was      furious. She had taken the children to Six Flags Great      Adventure amusement park in New Jersey in a chauffeured car      from the Uzbek U.N. delegation, only to discover at the      ticket booth that her husband had canceled her credit cards.      ``When I came back home, he was there having tea as always in      a big room with a happy face looking at us,'' she recalls.      ``I said that we could not carry on. That was the end.''       Maqsudi acknowledges suspending the credit cards. ``Every      time Gulnora and I would have an argument, her retaliation--I      guess she learned it from watching TV--she would put $20,000      to $30,000 in shopping charges on the credit cards.''       As the fight escalated, he says, her bodyguards blocked him      from leaving. ``They had me cornered in a room and Gulnora      was threatening, saying whatever she could at the time. She      was throwing things around the room.'' He managed to bolt,      spent the night at his mother's house and came home for a few      hours the next morning to play with the children while      Karimova slept. ``That was the last time I saw the kids,'' he      says. A few hours later, she telephoned from the airport as      she and the children were leaving the country.       He says it was child abduction and a New Jersey court      agrees. She denies it. ``He knew perfectly that I was leaving      with the kids,'' she says. He considered her note about ``The      War of the Roses'' a threat. She says she only meant they      should avoid the craziness that consumed the movie      characters. ``I wrote it with tears,'' she says. ``It was a      very personal letter.''       Within days, Maqsudi's Afghan emigre family in Tashkent      felt repercussions. A cousin and an uncle were arrested and      thrown into prison. Maqsudi's businesses were raided, workers      at his Coke plant harassed, the firms eventually confiscated.      By October 2001, another uncle was behind bars. His parents      were strip-searched at the airport.       Then one night in December, security forces raided three      family houses and rounded up 24 relatives at gunpoint,      including     Maqsudi's 85-year-old grandmother, an Uzbek citizen. The      relatives, nearly all women and children, were driven 13      hours to the Afghan border and dumped on the other side.       ``They said, `None of you will live in this country. This      is our country,' '' Maqsudi says.       Karimova denies any involvement and says that officials may      have simply taken advantage of the moment because Maqsudi's      family had long flouted passport requirements. ``Most of his      relatives--and there were a lot of them--did not have proper      papers,'' she says. If it were her choice, she added, ``I      could have deported them later. I would have been much more      sophisticated.''       Both of the estranged spouses went to court. An Uzbek judge      granted Karimova a divorce, while a New Jersey jurist granted      one to Maqsudi. Maqsudi faces arrest if he sets foot in      Uzbekistan and Karimova if she sets foot in the United      States. Since both warrants are filed with Interpol, neither      can safely travel to Europe. ``A civilized divorce,'' Danny      DeVito's character says in ``The War of the Roses,'' ``is a      contradiction in terms.''                        the larger relationship       In recent months, both sides in the Uzbek divorce war have      enlisted lobbyists and lawmakers in Washington to hurl      charges and deflect countercharges. Karimova's camp accuses      Maqsudi's firms of import-export shenanigans and various      illegal practices. The most sensational allegation is that      Maqsudi family companies snipped oil from Iraq while Saddam      Hussein was in charge.       One key witness for Karimova, however, was former Maqsudi      employee Farhod Inogambaev, who has since fled Uzbekistan and      recanted his statements. ``Everything was lies,'' he says now      in an interview from New Jersey.       After her separation from her husband, Karimova sent for      him, Inogambaev says, and told him, ``Forget about Mansur.      Now let's do business together.'' Afraid for his family, he      says, he went to work for her. She sent over men to have him      swear out affidavits against her estranged husband. ``I      blindly signed, I blindly typed whatever they said. I just      wanted them to leave me.''       Not only does Inogambaev now disavow the charges, he also      alleges that Karimova siphoned tens of millions of dollars      out of Uzbekistan through various channels, including her own      Citibank account. And he claims that she took over a tourism      firm that arranges visas for Uzbek travelers and used it to      control the flow of Uzbek prostitutes to Dubai.       Karimova dismisses the allegations, calling them ``more      than crazy and more than stupid,'' and contends that      Inogambaev only ``says that for money.''       Maqsudi's Washington lobbyists, led by Richard A. Zimmer, a      Republican former congressman from New Jersey, have gained      some traction. Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.) raised the      Interpol arrest warrant against Maqsudi during an October      hearing, calling it ``an abuse of power by the Uzbek      president.'' In February, Rep. Christopher Smith (R-N.J.)      asked Secretary of State Colin Powell to look into the      prostitution allegations, saying, ``We ought to be following      it up very rigorously.''       On the other side, Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) has taken up      Karimova's cause, requesting that Attorney General John      Ashcroft investigate allegations made against Maqsudi in      Uzbekistan.       Asked about the case in private, uncomfortable U.S.      officials decline to say much. For the record, they call it      ``an international child abduction case'' and say they have      told Tashkent ``that these issues are unnecessary irritants      in the U.S.-Uzbek relationship,'' according to a written      State Department response to congressional inquiries last      year.       Uzbek officials appear no more eager to talk about it.      ``It's a very complicated issue, and I think we should be      very sensitive in touching this very delicate issue,''      Foreign Minister Sadyk Safayev said in an interview in      Tashkent last fall. The two countries' relationship has      burdens enough. The United States wants to keep the military      base it opened in Uzbekistan after the terrorist attacks of      Sept. 11, 2001. Yet under increasing pressure from human      rights groups, the Bush administration warned recently that      it may cut off financial aid if Karimov's record does not      improve.       It's possible the question may ultimately fall to his      daughter. Analysts in Tashkent suspect that the 66-year-old      president is ill and speculate that Karimova is positioning      herself to succeed him. Others assume she is setting herself      up in business with assets abroad in case the family has to      flee.       Maqsudi believes that his ex-wife has the ambition to try      to take over the country. ``She's tasted power and what power      can bring in Uzbekistan,'' he says. ``At times I would say to      her, when we would have arguments, `You're drunk with your      father's power.' They don't want to relinquish or give up the      power they have.''                          ____________________
