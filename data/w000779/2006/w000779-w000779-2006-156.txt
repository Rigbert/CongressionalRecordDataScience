President, I rise to propound a unanimous consent request. Late last night, right before the Senate adjourned, I offered an amendment to roll back the oil royalty payments that the companies get unless prices come down or there is a supply disruption. We didn't have an opportunity to debate it at any length. This morning I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl and Senator Lieberman be added at this time as cosponsors of my amendment.
