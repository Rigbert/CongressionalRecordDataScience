Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 at the request of the Alaska Federation of Natives. This bill is the result of the work of the Legislative Council of the Alaska Federation of Natives to correct existing technical problems with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act [ANILCA]. I am introducing an identical version of that which passed the House during the 103d Congress. It is my intention to move this bill early this year based on agreements reached last year.  This bill makes a number of technical changes to ANCSA and ANILCA. It also makes a number of substantive additions which address issues not anticipated at the time of passage of ANCSA. Because of Alaska's relative youth as a State of the Union and the unprecedented amount of Alaska-specific Federal legislation passed since statehood, it is imperative that we respond to occasional oversights and/or quirks in the overlapping laws to ensure that unintended consequences do not occur. This effort is designed to rectify such instances.  The legislation is designed to resolve specific problems. To offer a flavor of the nature of the legislation, a few illustrations are in order.  For example, the bill would make it possible for the Caswell and Montana Creek Native groups to receive approximately 11,520 acres of land pursuant to a February 3, 1976, agreement and subsequent March 26, 1992, letter of agreement with Cook Inlet Region Inc. [CIRI]. This will fulfill their land entitlement from CIRI under the ANCSA.  Another provision would relieve ANCSA corporations of liability for hazardous wastes or contaminants left in, or on, ANCSA lands prior to their conveyance to Native corporations. It also directs the Secretary of the Interior to remove all contaminants left by the United States, an agent of the United States, or lessees prior to conveyance of these lands to the Native corporations. In some instances, the Government has conveyed lands and property interests to Alaska Natives which have been rendered valueless because of such contamination. It was clearly not the intention of ANCSA to extinguish Native claims by conveying contaminated property to recipients.  The Chugach Alaska Kageet Point land selection provision would allow Chugach Alaska Native Corp. to select a specific tract of land at the edge of its own current boundaries.  Mr. Speaker, I hope the spirit of cooperation which was reached last year will continue so we can move this noncontroversial piece of legislation early in this session.                          ____________________
