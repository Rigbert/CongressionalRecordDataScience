 President, this is an alternative to the Durbin sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The Durbin amendment in essence says certain taxes should be extended and that money ought to be used to provide health care and insurance for children.  We agree that more needs to be done to help uninsured people. But we believe that the pretax policy in place is such a good tax policy--for instance, Chairman Greenspan saying that the tax policy has been good for the recovery and the extended growth, bringing in $274 billion this year over last year. We think we need to do all the things--expanding the economy and everything else--because it is through an expanding economy that middle-income people advance themselves; that we have an opportunity then for more people through more income to be able to buy health insurance. We have to do all those things. We can't change tax policy and count that as doing it.  I urge this as an alternative to Senator Durbin's amendment.
