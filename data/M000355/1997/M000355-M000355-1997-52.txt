 FEINGOLD. I will yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. The question is, whether the Senator wants to--I am sure he does not want to put an item into the Record that is simply inaccurate. What I would hope the Senator would permit me to do, even though he has the floor and it is his insert, is to include into the Record a letter from Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, simply correcting that story. It was simply inaccurate. And obviously the Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.  It seems to me that for those who might be reading the Congressional Record it would be best to have the correct data inserted at this time. But I will be happy to do it later if the Senator from Wisconsin feels better.
