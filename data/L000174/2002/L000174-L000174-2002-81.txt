President, Monday in Boston and Tuesday in New York there will be tribute concerts in memory of Timothy White, the editor of Billboard Magazine who recently died at the young age of 50. Tim is survived by his wife Judy Garlan and twin sons Christopher and Alexander. I understand that these concerts includes performances by some of my favorite musicians, performers, and recording artists, including Sheryl Crow, Don Henley, John Mellencamp, Sting, Billy Joel, James Taylor, Jimmy Buffett, and Roger Waters. These are people with big hearts as well as talent.  Tim White loved his family and he loved music. He wrote:       Music entered my world on a summer morning in 1956, in the      tough mill town of Paterson, N.J., when a band of Italian      street musicians ambled down East 27th Street and paused in      front of my family's tiny Cape Cod-style house. . . . What      still moves me most about musicians--about all creative      people who disclose the depths of their better selves--is      that same thing that touched me on that otherwise torpid      August afternoon--that these people would be willing to trust      another stranger with the open expression of such inner      truths.  He was an editor, a writer, an observer and a person of conviction and commitment. In addition to his family and friends, those who care about music will miss him.                          ____________________
