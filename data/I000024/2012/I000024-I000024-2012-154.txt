President, today I am pleased to introduce the reauthorization of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, NAWCA. This bill has overwhelming bipartisan support, and I am pleased to have Senators Boxer, Vitter, Landrieu, Cochran, Johnson, and Klobuchar as original cosponsors.  In fact, this is a conservation program that has long enjoyed support on both sides of the aisle. Back in 2006, I worked with my colleagues to pass the last reauthorization of this program by unanimous consent and was pleased that President Bush signed the bill into law.  This bill also has the support of many conservation and hunting groups including: Archery Trade Association, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Boone and Crockett Club, Bowhunting Preservation Alliance, Catch-A-Dream Foundation, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Conservation Force, Dallas Safari Club, Delta Waterfowl, Ducks Unlimited, Izaak Walton League of America, Mule Deer Foundation, National Assembly ofSportsmen's Caucuses, National Rifle Association, National Trappers Association, National Wild Turkey Foundation, North American Bear Foundation, North American Grouse Partnership, Orion-The Hunters' Institute, Pheasants Forever, Pope and Young Club, Public Lands Foundation, Quail Forever, Quality Deer Management Association, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Ruffed Grouse Society, Safari Club International, Texas Wildlife Association, The Conservation Fund, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Whitetails Unlimited, Wildlife Forever, and Wildlife Management Institute  NAWCA was first enacted in 1989 and incentivizes non-federal contributions to maintain and restore wetland habitat throughout North America. Since its inception, each Federal dollar has been matched, on average, by $3.20 in state and private funds. Not only do these funds help to support waterfowl populations that were once nearing all time lows, these voluntary projects also support nearly 7,500 new jobs annually.  The success of this program lies in the fact that these projects are not top down regulations coming from the Federal Government. These projects involve multiple partners from private organizations and the Federal Government who work together voluntarily to protect and restore millions of acres of wetlands.  In my home State of Oklahoma, NAWCA currently has 12 projects either completed or underway. These projects have conserved 26,869 acres of wildlife habitat and leveraged $11.3 million in partner contributions. These projects benefit outdoor recreation, hunting and fishing, as well as boosting local economies.  NAWCA is a great example of how environmental conservation should be achieved. This program should put to rest the notion that voluntary efforts aren't successful. I would argue that these voluntary programs have been more successful and more cost effective than other mandatory Federal regulations.  I look forward to this reauthorization moving quickly through the Senate. Thank you.                          ____________________
