This is such a leap to argue that if this man, who is not a resident of the United States--if I am not mistaken, he is Tanzanian--that somehow if he is found not guilty in the courts of the United States, he is qualified to be released into our population. That is a statement--I don't know anyone could draw that conclusion. He would have no legal status to stay in the United States unless we gave him one.  By what basis does the Senator from Kentucky suggest that this man, who may have been involved in the killing of 12 Americans among 224 other people, is going to be released by President Obama into our communities and neighborhoods?  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator asking me a question?
