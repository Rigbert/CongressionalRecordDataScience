 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Montpelier High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. Blais: Congressman Sanders, in the early days of the      Government, debt was considered to be a last resort. The only      justification for debt of any kind was by war. In 1849, the      Government had $70 million in the bank;     after the Civil War we were down to about negative $3      billion. Ever since then it has gone down.       Debt is not really serious compared to the total assets of      the country. That is from Congressman Peter Starke.       Mr. Bousquet: Good afternoon, Congressman Sanders. The      remark by Congressman Starke is not true.      $5,403,449,382,255.58 is a problem. This country knows it      just as well as I do that this country is in trouble.      Although the national debt has gone down in the 1990's, it is      still very, very high.       Some of the facts: There are 267,204,471 people roughly in      America. The debt increases $722 million everyday. At this      rate each citizen's contribution to the debt to make it go      away is $222,000.15, and that means a baby, a child and a      man, and infant, whatever.       Mr. Blais: What we are asking is why is it our      responsibility to pay for Government debts and what is      Congress doing honestly to bring us out of debt and what is      the future for our kids going to be like? From what I have      gathered there has been a lot of--I do not how to explain it      but there have been many attempts to bring the debt down, and      yes, it has gone down some by cutting budgets and whatnot,      but in the last roughly 55 years there hasn't been any major      decrease in the debt that we have.       Mr. Bousquet: It is obviously going down, and I see that.      Why cannot we keep on going down and try to get it to a      reasonable $50 million or a reasonable $25 million. The debt      is still going up but it is not increasing as rapidly. The      only possible solution that I can come up with is cutting      back on something and it could be a number of things. The      budget is divided up into sections, right? One of the highest      is armed forces. We need defense, granted, but it is too      high, I think, and that is my personal opinion. I do not know      the background behind it.       Mr. Blais: Well I have to say like Government funding for--     I mean, I cannot give you exactly but I know a lot of things      that are Government-funded aren't going anywhere and haven't      been going anywhere in the last I do not know how many years,      and I would take a deep look at what everything is producing      and how much money you are giving them and look at it from      there.                               ____________________
