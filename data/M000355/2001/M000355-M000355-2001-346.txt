 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his fine work on this amendment again this year. We have had this debate a few times, I say to my friend from Utah.  Let me just sum it up. This is a unique opportunity for a large majority of the Senate to vote against a proposal and be in concert with the Washington Post, Common Cause, Senator Feingold, and Senator McConnell. That is truly a unique opportunity in the course of this debate.  I commend the Senator from South Carolina. His intentions are clear and honorable. He understands that in order to do what is sought in McCain-Feingold you need to amend the first amendment for the first time in over 200 years, or the first time ever--carve a niche out of it to give both the Congress and State legislatures an opportunity to get complete control of all of this pernicious speech that is going on out there that offends us. That is at the core of this debate.  This is a constitutional amendment. It should be overwhelmingly defeated, as it was last year when we had the same vote. There were 67 Senators who voted against it and only 33 Senators who voted for it. I thought the 67 Senators exercised extraordinarily good judgment. I hope that will be the case again when the roll is called at 6 o'clock.  I do not know if anyone else wishes to speak.  Mr. President, is all the time used on this side?
