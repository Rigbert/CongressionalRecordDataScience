Speaker, regular order is having hearings and witnesses, is it not?  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, for the last three decades, we have done that, and I don't think the American people want to continue to wait.  I know we go through this every week, time and again, and so I can quote you back the number of hearings. I can quote you back what people even ran a campaign on and put out to the American public. But what is most important that I can quote to you is the lack of growth that has happened, how much people have to pay in taxes, the trillions of dollars that are sitting overseas.  What I have found time and again, and I know we have talked about this before, but just by the introduction of our bill, I was sitting in the Oval Office last week and there was a company there, Broadcom, that was created in America, but because of our Tax Code, they were forced to leave America to try to be competitive.                              {time}  1130  They looked at this bill, and they told me a couple of days before: If you really believe this bill is going to pass, we will come back.  When they come back, that is $20 billion in revenue each year. They will spend another $3 billion each year on R&D. Then they will spend $6 billion in manufacturing.  The gentleman and I have had so many discussions about how to bring manufacturing jobs back. That is why I am so excited about this bill coming to the floor the next week.
