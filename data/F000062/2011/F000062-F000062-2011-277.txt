 President, I rise to congratulate my friend and colleague, Barbara Mikulski, who is now the longest-serving woman in the history of the U.S. Senate.  Barbara has been a forceful advocate for the people of her beloved Maryland and a role model for women everywhere--beginning with her election to the Baltimore City Council in 1971, to her election to the House of Representatives in 1976, to her election to the Senate in 1986.  Barbara is a pace-setter in the fight for equality for women. When I first ran for the Senate in 1992, Barbara reached out to me to offer her support, for which I am grateful, and she welcomed me when I joined the Senate.  Barbara is indomitable, not only in the fight for equality for women but in the broader fight for human rights for all mankind. I am proud to have worked alongside Barbara in opposing tyranny in Burma, in pushing to restrict cluster munitions that pose a grave threat to innocent people around the world, and in pushing to free Burmese democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi.  And I am proud to work with her on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which I chair, where I know I can count on Barbara to do the hard work required to oversee America's intelligence agencies and keep America safe.  Any discussion of Barbara would be incomplete without acknowledgment of her effort to improve bipartisanship in the Senate--something sorely needed right now--an effort aided by her monthly bipartisan dinners for women Senators.
