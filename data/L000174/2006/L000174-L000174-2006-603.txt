President, I will not speak for long. I do this because I wish to speak about the severe humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan.  It has been almost 2 years since the Congress, in a bipartisan effort of both the House and Senate, declared the atrocities in Darfur, Sudan, to be genocide. That is a word not passed around easily in these halls.
