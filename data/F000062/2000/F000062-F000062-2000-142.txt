 I think then you have to monitor government, and it would take a whole new bureaucracy to monitor government to see every notice was sent out and every change of address and that kind of thing. But I want to read a statement from someone who you do respect. I know you respect Professor Tribe. In addition, I know you respect the Attorney General of the United States. Just before you leave, I want to read a statement:       Unless the Constitution is amended to ensure basic rights      to crime victims, we will never correct the existing      imbalance in this country between defendants' irreducible      constitutional rights and the current haphazard patchwork of      victims' rights. While a person arrested or convicted of a      crime anywhere in the United States knows he is guaranteed      certain basic protection under our Nation's most      fundamental law, the victim of that crime has no guarantee      of rights beyond those that happen to be provided and      enforced in the particular jurisdiction where the crime      occurred.  This is similar to the discussion of how many angels dance on the head of a pin. I supported the first State constitutional amendment in 1982. It is now 18 years later. Even by constitutional amendments, what Senator Kyl said about 60 percent and 40 percent of victims being responded to is really correct. We believe it is never going to be enforceable, it is never going to be carried out. The bureaucratic inertia is too great, the system is too ingrained, and the Constitution of the United States should not be so static and so immutable that people who have suffered violence do not have a right in a court of law. That is what we are about. Thank you.
