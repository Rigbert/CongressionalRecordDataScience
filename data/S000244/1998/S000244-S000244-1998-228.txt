Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Joe McDade, the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, as he prepares to retire after 36 years of service to the country and his constituents. Throughout his 18 terms, Joe McDade played key roles in areas ranging from energy and the environment, to America's highways and national defense, all the while displaying grace and dignity under sometimes adverse circumstances.  In the 10th District of Pennsylvania, Joe McDade is known as a friend to his constituents, a man whose work as a Member of this House always aimed to help the individuals who sent him here. Among other things, he fought to create better opportunities for small business, to help former coal miners re-train for new careers after many mines closed, and to ensure that local hospitals, highways, and schools were the best that they could be.  As a member of the Appropriations Interior Subcommittee, he addressed issues including alternative sources of energy in order to limit dependence on foreign oil. He devoted considerable effort to funding environmental infrastructure improvements such as sewage treatment facilities and flood control.  Joe McDade's contributions reach the national level as well. As a member of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee during the 1980s, Joe played a key role in crafting defense and national security legislation. It is in no small part a result of his work that the U.S. was able to achieve a peaceful end to the Cold War from a position of strength and readiness.  I join my colleagues today in congratulating Joe McDade on a distinguished career. He has been a positive force for this nation and for this House. I wish him continued success in his endeavors and a long and productive retirement.                          ____________________
