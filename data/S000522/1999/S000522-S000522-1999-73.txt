Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I offer this on behalf of myself, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Barcia); the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Myrick); the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen); the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Shows); the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar); and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde).  Let me begin by telling Members what this is not about. The amendment before us is not about family planning funding. The bill before us provides up to $385 million for international family planning programs. If the amendment passes, this amount will remain exactly the same, $385 million for family planning. The amendment does not cut that amount by one penny.  Second, the vote on this amendment is not about some of the cartoon illustrations that have been conjured up in some of the faxes and fliers being put out by pro-abortion organizations. This amendment already has a track record. It is substantially identical to the antilobbying provision of the Mexico City Policy, which governed all U.S. foreign family planning programs from 1984 until 1993.  During those 9 years, the antilobbying provision was interpreted according to a rule of reason. We gave population assistance to literally hundreds of organizations during those 9 years, and we never cut off funding to a single organization because an officer of the organization gave a speech. Not even once. In fact, during the whole 9 years, only 2 organizations were ever denied Federal funding under the Mexico City Policy, and it was because they themselves refused to agree not to perform or actively promote abortion except to save the mother's life or in cases of rape or incest.  That is what this vote is really all about. The question is simple: Do we want our chosen representatives in foreign countries to do family planning and only family planning, or do we want them working overtime trying to topple pro-life laws in those countries?  Mr. Chairman, in over 100 countries around the world, the lives of unborn children are still protected by law. But in country after country, we find that the biggest U.S. population grantees are also the most prominent advocates--sometimes the only prominent advocates--of legalizing abortion on demand.  Mr. Chairman, the abortion promoters never tire of reminding us that they promote abortion with what they call ``their own money,'' but this argument deliberately misses the point.  First, it ignores the fact that all money is fungible. When we pay an organization millions of dollars, we cannot help but enrich and empower all of that organization's activities, all that they do, even if the organization keeps a set of books that says it uses its money for one thing and our money for something else.  Even more important, this argument totally ignores what it means to be an agent of the United States in a foreign country. When we choose our representatives abroad, we have a right, and I would submit we have a duty, to ensure that certain minimum standards are met.  I would just point out to my colleagues that overwhelming numbers of Americans support the rights of unborn children, and we do not want our agents acting in such a way as to promote something that we find so offensive, the killing of unborn children on demand.  Mr. Chairman, if the United States decided--and I just say this as an example--to give a grant for an antismoking campaign directed at children in a developing country, it might decide not to give the grant to a tobacco company that also planned to run pro-smoking advertisements in that same country, even if the company promised to use its own money for the cigarette ads.  Mr. Chairman, it is exactly the same way with abortion and family planning. If the reason we fund family planning programs in a foreign country is really to provide contraceptives and counseling in order to reduce the number of abortions in the country, then we are well within our rights if we choose not to run the program through an organization that is also working hard to increase the availability of abortion in that same country. Everyone has a right of freedom of speech, but nobody has an absolute and unconditional right to represent the U.S. overseas or to receive multimillion dollar subsidies in exchange for that representation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1800
