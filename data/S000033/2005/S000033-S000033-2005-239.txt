 Speaker, on Monday, January 31st, 2005, I held a town meeting at the Vermont Law School on the state of civil liberties in America. Joining me at the meetingwere Professor Cheryl Hanna of Vermont Law School; Professor Stephen Dycus of Vermont Law School; Trina Magi, Past President of the Vermont Library Association; and Ben Scotch, the Former Executive Director of the Vermont American Civil Liberties Union. Well over 200 people participated in the meeting.  Mr. Speaker, in the United States today there is a great concern about terrorism. Our country suffered a horrendous tragedy on September 11th, 2001--and there is no doubt in my mind that there are people on this earth who would like to attack us again.  Is terrorism a serious problem? The answer is ``Yes, it is.'' Should the United States and the rest of the world do all that we can to protect innocent people from terrorist attacks? The answer, once again in my view, is ``Yes, we should.''  But the question that we are struggling with in Congress and throughout our country is: ``Do we have to sacrifice our basic liberties and constitutional rights in order to protect ourselves from the threat of global terrorism?'' And in my view, the answer to that question must be a resounding ``No.''  Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit an article that ran in the Rutland Herald on Tuesday, February 1, 2005, about this town meeting.                    Panel Discusses Civil Liberties       Royalton.--Big Brother might not be watching just yet, but      many believe George Orwell's nightmare is becoming more      plausible by the day.       ``We need to be aware that a cancer is threatening our      basic civil liberties, our constitutional rights and our      privacy rights,'' Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., said Monday      night to a crowd of more than 200 people at Vermont Law      School.       The audience filled the Jonathan B. Chase Community Center      for the panel discussion on civil liberties and national      security with Sanders, VLS professors Stephen Dycus and      Cheryl Hanna, former Vermont Library Association president      Trina Magi and former Vermont American Civil Liberties Union      president Ben Scotch.       Much of the discussion centered on the USA Patriot Act,      passed in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001.       Sanders said the issue alone was not just the Patriot Act,      which broadened the powers of law enforcement and the federal      government, but also how those who want to keep track of      people are gaining more ways of doing so.       Sanders said there was an effort in Congress last year to      require trackable computer chips in all drivers' licenses.       ``Someone with the right kind of device could track your      every movement,'' he said. ``George Orwell, here we are. In a      few short years, unless we change it, every single thing we      do, every place we go, every person we meet could be recorded      in a database.''       Hanna said the provisions of the Patriot Act that civil      libertarians find most troublesome and unconstitutional have      been difficult to challenge in court because of the secrecy      with which the law allows the government to operate.       ``In order to challenge something, you have to have a      case,'' she said. ``You need someone who has been harmed.      With the Patriot Act, so much of the harm has been      clandestine. You might not even know if you were the target      of an investigation.''       Scotch argued that the real dangers of the Patriot Act were      its vagaries and the ways in which it challenged established      legal language.       Scotch presented provisions of a bill he called ``The Free      Speech Enhancement Act of 2005,'' that would outlaw several      forms of speaking out against the government during wartime.      He then revealed that the law had been passed, under another      name in 1918 and had since been repealed.       ``Bills that restrict freedom are more and more subtle and      more and more clever,'' he said. ``That's what we're seeing      in the USA Patriot Act. When the Sedition Act of 1918 says      we're going to ban disloyal speech, it comes out and says      it.''       Magi said she was worried that the provisions allowing      investigators to look at the records of any business,      including libraries, without a warrant would destroy the      effectiveness of libraries.       ``As an academic librarian, it is my job to help students      really dig deeper,'' she said. ``In order to do that,      students must feel that the library is a safe place to seek      information.''       Dycus challenged the notion that ``normal Americans'' who      are not terrorists don't need to fear the Patriot Act.       ``It would be a terrible mistake to believe none of this      concerns you,'' he said. ``You might be right to think that      you will never be taken away in the night and detained in a      military brig . . . but you shouldn't be so sure. Besides,      what our government does with our knowledge it also does in      our name.''       The floor was opened to questions from the audience, which      ranged from angry rants against the Bush administration to      questions about what can be done.       One student challenged the one-sidedness of the discussion.       ``I was a little surprised the Vermont Law School would      have only one side presented,'' she said. ``I would think      they would want both sides presented so we, as law students,      could learn.''       Sanders said the make-up of the panel was his doing and not      the school's.       The student went on to challenge some of the assertions      about the Patriot Act, saying her understanding was the      ``sneak and peek'' provisions merely expanded capabilities      that law enforcement already had.       Scotch replied that the earlier law on which those      provisions were based included a requirement similar to      probable cause, but the Patriot Act does not.       One man asked how to best strike a balance between      preserving civil liberties and vigilance against terrorist      threats. Magi said it was something people would have to      decide for themselves.       ``I think it's really legitimate to be afraid of      terrorists,'' she said. ``We can also be afraid of an      overreaching government that stretches too far into our      lives. There are plenty of examples of lives that were ruined      by a government that was not restrained.''       Sanders said there was more to the issue than a simple      tradeoff and that reductions in privacy don't necessarily      lead to increases in security.       Sanders cited the deportation of people advocating trade      unions in the 1920s, the internment of Japanese citizens      during World War II, the McCarthyism of the 1950s and      government surveillance during the 1960s as examples of how      the government can be just as much of a threat to the people      as those from whom it is supposed to protect them.       ``We have got to be vigilant,'' he said.       Sanders said people need to put as much effort into      defending their civil liberties as the Republican Party      leadership has put into promoting the policies of the Bush      Administration.       ``Tom Delay works day and night, fighting for what he      believes in,'' he said. ``You have to begin to think about      changing the political culture. All of us are going to have      to roll up our sleeves and talk to our neighbors.''       The key, Sanders said, lies not in just organizing      liberals, but reaching out to conservatives.       ``It is not moderate Republicans, it is conservative      Republicans, people who love their guns and don't want their      guns taken away, who are going to join you,'' he said. ``Do      you talk to them and or just think they're jerks who aren't      as bright as you? Well, that's what they think about you.''       Sanders said nobody on the left has the luxury of being      depressed or defeatist.       ``On issues like this, I believe that once people hear the      issues, they understand we can deal with terrorism without      the provisions of the Patriot Act,'' he said.                          ____________________
