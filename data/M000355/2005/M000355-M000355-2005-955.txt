 President, today I rise to express my condolencesto the victims and their families after last Thursday's depraved and savage terrorist attacks in London. I also rise to pledge my, and I am sure the entire U.S. Senate's, steadfast support for the people of London and the United Kingdom as they stand resolute--as they always have--in the face of terror.  On July 7 of last week, bombs exploded in three subway trains of the London Underground. A fourth ripped open a city bus. At least 52 are dead, and hundreds are wounded.  Just as a personal note, I have a daughter living in the London area. Just a month ago, I put her on the subway right near where one of the bombs went off. So I was among the many Americans who were frantically interested in getting word on our own relatives after the attacks, which is another indication of just how closely tied the United States and the United Kingdom are.
