 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce Committee be discharged from further consideration and the Senate proceed to the consideration of PN1999; that the nominations be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate then resume legislative session.
