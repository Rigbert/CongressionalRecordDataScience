 President, it gives me great pride and pleasure today to rise and honor a Delaware jurist who is a recognized leader not only in his native State of Delaware, but throughout this country and around the world. His name is Randy Holland.  Justice Holland has served on the Delaware Supreme Court since 1986, with the distinction of being the youngest person ever to serve on my State's highest court. And for the past four years, he has served as the National President of the American Inns of Court. His second term ends next week, and I rise today to commend his leadership to this prestigious legal society.  Justice Holland's stewardship of the American Inns of Court, with its roots dating back to England in the 1400s, has earned him an extraordinary, rare and high honor.  He is only the third American judge to recently receive this prestigious award. The other two are United States Supreme Court Justices.  Lincoln's Inn of London, England, announced that Justice Holland has been elected an Honorary Master of the Bench. The Honorary ``Benchers'' are persons of distinction selected from common law countries around the world. The only American judges to receive this high recognition and distinction are Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and John Paul Stevens of the United States Supreme Court and now Justice Holland.  In commenting upon Justice Holland's election, William Blair, a distinguished Barrister, President of the Commercial Bar Association in England, and brother of Prime Minister Tony Blair, stated ``We feel that this is an important mark of friendship between the Inns of Court of England and the American Inns of Court. What is most gratifying for us is that the common aims of the organization are ethics, civility, professionalism and legal excellence--which are surely more necessary now than ever. My fellow Benchers were greatly impressed by Justice Holland's distinguished judicial record.''  To put this honor in context, Lincoln's Inn is the oldest of the four Inns of Court in London. Its formal records date back continuously to 1422. For six centuries, the Inns of Court in London have educated English trial lawyers, who are known as Barristers.  St. Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, joined Lincoln's Inn in 1496. The chapel bell at Lincoln's Inn came from Spain in 1596 as part of the spoils of Cadiz. When Dr. John Donne was Preacher to Lincoln's Inn in 1624, he wrote his famous poem ``for whom the bell tolls.''  Along with this international honor, Justice Holland has been recognized by his fellow jurists and attorneys in this country. His numerous awards include: the 1992 Judge of the Year Award from the National Child Support Enforcement Association, the 2002 Alumni Award of Merit from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, the 2003 American Judicature Society's Herbert Harley Award, and the 2004 Widener Law School Adjunct Professor Distinguished Service Award.  Ethics and mentoring are the hallmarks of Justice Holland's service on the bench and his call to his fellow attorneys in the bar. He chaired the national Advisory Committee to the American Judicature Society's Center for Judicial Ethics and currently he chairs the American Bar Association national Joint Committee on Lawyer Regulation. Justice Holland is also a member of the American Law Institute and is an adjunct professor at several law schools.  In addition to these many accomplishments, Justice Holland has published three books on the history of the Delaware Constitution and the Delaware Supreme Court.  Of course, Justice Holland will tell you that he derives his greatest pride from his family--his wife and friend since grade school, Ilona, and his son, Ethan.  Justice Holland deserves a tremendous thank you for his leadership on the bench and bar--from Delaware, attorneys throughout this country, and indeed from jurists and barristers worldwide. Congratulations.                          ____________________
