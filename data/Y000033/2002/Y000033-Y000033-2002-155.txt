Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to suggest to my good friend from California, the experts which he referred to do not know squat. I have 60,000 and over of pilots who want this legislation. Again, as a captain myself, I know how it feels not to be armed. As history will show us, the protection of the wheelhouse and the cockpit are vitally important. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) mentioned this.  The reality is that now there is an order to shoot down the airplane. If there is a hijacking with passengers aboard, to me that is a ridiculous solution when it can be stopped at the cockpit.  As was said before, this is nothing new. Until it became politically correct, the pilots armed themselves as they have done through history to defend that cockpit and defend that plane and defend those passengers. And now we have experts. Who are they? A man that belonged to the ATF, an individual very frankly that is being told very frankly what he should be saying. This is incorrect.  This is my bill. This is a bill for the American people. This is a bill, in fact,to defend those people that fly every day. By the captain of the ship, they are his responsibility. If there is an infringement upon that cockpit by a terrorist, he has a right to eliminate that individual, to defend his passengers.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cunningham).                              {time}  1200
