Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee regarding an important project at Toledo Express Airport.  The air traffic control facility at the Toledo Express Airport has experienced several equipment and structural problems during the last few years. There have been several near misses. The tower is now nearly 50 years old and at 57 feet, it is 43 feet shorter than towers at similar airports. Visibility is inadequate and the facility needs relocation.  Rather than waiting for the FAA to address this problem, the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority has taken the initiative and proposed to construct a tower meeting FAA specifications. Construction would be financed by bonds issued by the Port Authority, and the FAA would move into the tower under a leaseback arrangement. This proposal would cut 3 years off of the time it would take the FAA to construct a tower under its normal procedures and save significant interest costs.  We have discussed this proposal. The chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], as well as the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Coleman], have been most gracious and helpful.  It is my understanding that the gentleman supports the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority proposal for the construction and leaseback of a Toledo Express Airport tower, is that correct?
