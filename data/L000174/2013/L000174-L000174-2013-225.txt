President, I would note that there are some in this body, I am sure, who want no immigration bill. I get the feeling that is a smaller and smaller group. I imagine they would love to just keep killer amendments going for weeks and weeks and hope the bill might die.  On the other hand, we have some very legitimate requests made on both sides of the aisle. I have been told that some of the ones we might want to bring up that we would pass probably unanimously, the other side will not allow them to come up unless we allow these other amendments.  I would hope that during the next 2 days both sides would allow the distinguished ranking member and me to sit down and go through and accept--as we normally do on a bill such as this--a package of amendments that are acceptable.  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be equally divided.
