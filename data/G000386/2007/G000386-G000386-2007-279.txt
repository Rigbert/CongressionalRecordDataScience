 President, I am introducing legislation today along with Senator Johnson that will take a bold step in reducing our dependence on fossil fuel and foreign oil. It is the 10 by 10 Act.  The 10 by 10 Act will require that 10 percent of each gallon of motor fuel sold beginning January 1, 2010, contain at least 10 percent renewable fuel. The 10 by 10 Act is a signal that Congress remains interested and adamant in seeking energy independence by promoting the development of renewable fuels in the United States.  Because the U.S. imports more than 60 percent of the crude oil we need, we have become dangerously reliant on foreign sources of energy. It is a threat to our national security for the United States to be dependent upon countries like Iran and Venezuela for our energy needs. It's also a threat to our economic security to be dependent on foreign countries for the energy that drives our economy.  It is up to our farmers and ranchers to help liberate our consumers and our economy from the stranglehold of OPEC and other foreign countries on our energy needs. I am here to say to America's agriculture community that we are serious and we are going to do something about it.  This legislation will demonstrate to consumers, in a common sense way, that each and every gallon of gasoline will contain at least 10 percent of domestically produced renewable fuel. It'll show that we're serious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and it will show in a tangible way that we're working to reduce that dependence.  The 10 by 10 Act is a commitment to our constituents that we're working to lower that dependence, and reduce our consumption of foreign oil in every gallon of fuel they pump. With this legislation, Americans would know with certainty that 10 percent of each gallon of motor fuel was home-grown by farmers and ranchers right here in America.  Today, ethanol, a renewable fuel produced primarily from corn, is blended in nearly 50 percent of the gasoline sold in the United States. There are currently 116 biorefineries producing nearly 6 billion gallons of ethanol annually. By the end of 2009, it is projected that we will have the capacity to produce over twelve billion gallons annually.  It is important for consumers to recognize that for the vast majority of cars on the road today, no modifications are necessary to operate on a 10-percent renewable fuel blend. No significant changes are required to the fuel distribution network to allow for a 10-percent blend. The only thing standing in the way of reduced dependence on foreign oil is a signal from Congress that we recognize the virtue of home-grown alternatives to foreign oil.  With this legislation, we would ensure the use of approximately 14 billion gallons of renewable fuels in our Nation's automobiles. The ethanol use would be distributed around the country in each gallon of gasoline. In this way, we will ensure the use of the fuel even if an extensive E-85 market is not yet in place. This effort could very well be a stepping stone if it's determined that ethanol could be blended in higher ratios, such as 15 or 20 percent. By blending in each gallon of gasoline, we ensure the benefits of homegrown, renewable fuels reach all consumers without the immediate need for additional fueling infrastructure or alternative fuel vehicles.  We owe it to the American people to pursue aggressive policies to free our country from our foreign oil dependence. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to replace 10 percent of each gallon of gasoline with homegrown, environmentally friendly, renewable fuel.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1358       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
