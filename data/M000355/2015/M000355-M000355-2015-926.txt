 President, every July 24, we commemorate a solemn anniversary. We honor the sacrifice of J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson, Capitol Police officers who fell in the line of duty this day in 1998.  I hope it comforts the family and friends who loved these officers to know that their memories continue to live on.  Their memories live on in the Capitol Police Headquarters that is named in their honor, and they live on within the Capitol itself: on a commemorative plaque, inscribed indelibly; in the service of every officer who wears the badge today, evoked daily.  Indeed, Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson may rest just beyond the Potomac in Arlington National Cemetery, but the ideals they gave everything to defend endure in this symbol of democracy every day,carried forward by the brave men and women of our Capitol Police force. May they continue to do so, and may that bring some measure of comfort to every American mourning the loss of these brave officers again today.
