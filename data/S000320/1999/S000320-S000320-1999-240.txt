 President, I recently introduced legislation that would amend our estate taxation laws to correct a highly unjust situation that regularly occurs throughout our country. The problem I am referring to is the difficult situation persons who inherit valuable timberland often find themselves. Because the timberland is usually the major estate asset, the estate frequently lacks the liquidity to pay the hefty tax burden. Therefore, many times persons are forced to harvest the timber or even worse, to sell portions of the land, just to be able to meet this large tax liability.  Besides essentially invalidating many testamentary gifts, such a tax policy creates numerous economic and ecological problems. As estate taxes are due nine months after a decedent's death, the current law strongly encourages persons to harvest the timber regardless of it's maturity, prevailing price or demand. Encouraging such behavior not only leads to economic waste, but also discourages responsible use of a valued natural resource. The decision of if and when to harvest timberlands should be made by the individual landowner after he has considered the current market, tree maturity and other relevant factors. It certainly should not be based on an uncompromising tax code that completely disregards these critical factors.  Mr. President, the decision to sell the land is in no way a viable alternative to premature harvesting. Selling portions of a contiguous tract leads to fragmentation of the land, which in turn can lead to legal disputes and other inefficiencies. Furthermore, wildlife and forestry conservation efforts by earlier landowners are often ignored by new owners who look to exploit the land in order to turn a quick profit. But most importantly, our tax code should never place someone in a position where they must sell a testamentary gift just to be able to pay the taxes on the transfer. Besides being inherently unfair, such a tax tramples upon the property rights of American landowners.  Mr. President, we must not allow the tax code to perpetuate these injustices. My bill, the Timberland Conservation and Tax Relief Act of 1999 eliminates these problems by removing mechanical and unthinking tax laws from the decision of when it appropriate to harvest American timberlands. It introduces a flexible deferred payment provision into the estate taxation scheme that will allow timberland owners to exercise their own good judgment in deciding what the most efficient use of their land would be. Furthermore, the Timberland Conservation and Tax Relief Act promotes the responsible use of our environment by no longer placing persons in a position where they must harvest immature or unneeded timber. For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1370       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
