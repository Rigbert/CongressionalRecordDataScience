 In fact, several people, who would like to have us believe that--referring to the privatization in place--very conveniently leave out one sentence when they talk about realigning Kelly Air Force Base, including the air logistics center.

Do not privatize excess capacity where you maintain the problem of having five locations, each operating at 50-percent capacity. It is very, very clear.
