There are indeed serious concerns surrounding chemical demilitarization, but Oregonians are committed to working with the Army and the Chemical Demilitarization Program to meet the obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The future and success of the Chemical Demilitarization program will depend on the communication we enter into, and the cooperative solutions that we produce. This is a very challenging program for both the Army and the good people of the depot states. We acknowledge and appreciate all the hard work that has been done thus far, and very much look forward to the completion of the chemical demilitarization project in Oregon.
