President, thank you for observing how beautiful it is outside and how wonderful it is to serve the Senate. Like yourself, I feel honored to represent the fine people of my State.  I also am honored to ask unanimous consent that when I finish my remarks, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr Byrd, be recognized to take the floor.
