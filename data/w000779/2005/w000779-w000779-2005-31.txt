President, December 1, was World AIDS Day, and I wanted to take this time to both acknowledge the good work that is done around world to prevent and treat this disease and to acknowledge the need is still great around the world and in our own country to fund prevention, treatment, and support.  AIDS kills 3 million people each year, and 13,500 people are newly infected each day. AIDS has already left 15 million orphans in its wake. The theme of World AIDS Day 2005 was ``Keeping the Promise.'' To date, the United States has led the world in contributions to the Global Fund, providing one-third of all contributions. However, the statistics tell us that while we have come far, we still have far to go in preventing this tragic disease, including here at home.  We have experienced many medical miracles in the form of drugs that help people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS live healthier longer. Yet, we seem to be able to fund less and less of the services that help individuals stay healthy and maintain the structure of their lives.  I was recently visited by constituents who were either HIV positive or had full-blown AIDS. They told many moving stories about how their lives had been made better by programs that help them get health services, pay for their drugs, rent and provide other support services. Many of these programs are through the Ryan White Act.  The unmet need grows daily. For example, in Portland, the Russell Street Dental Clinic provides about $60,000 worth of services to HIV patients each month compared with about $15,000 a month 3 years ago. In 2003, a study was released that documented the service gaps in Oregon. The list of services for which there is not enough funding to meet the need is long and includes dental care, help with legal affairs, counseling, housing and help in paying rent or utilities, and transportation.  Despite an increased number of people living with HIV/AIDS, Ryan White funding has decreased. Many of the programs my constituents tell me help them are through Title I of the Ryan White Act. This title provides the vital core services of Medical care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, dental care, and case management.  The Oregon AIDS Drug Assistance Program has had to change eligibility and take other steps to limit enrollment because of budget constraints. This program helps individuals with their drug costs. I view it as a wise investment because it helps people stay healthier, working, and productive.  What I have heard from my constituents is sheer frustration that the programs they know work are yet again on the chopping block. I share their frustration. An investment in health care, whether abroad or in our own country, an investment in a community and in making that community healthier. I hope Congress keeps this in mind as we face difficult decisions about funding in the future.  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record.                          ____________________
