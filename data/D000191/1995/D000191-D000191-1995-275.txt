Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, we are going to have to live with these laws for a very long time, as are all of the American people. Is it too much to ask that any duly elected representative from any of the 435 districts in this country be given, say, 5 minutes on the floor to express their concerns and enter into a colloquy to get questions answered regarding the intents of this legislation or offer an amendment? I do not think that is too much. You may say well, this is the law required by Speaker Gingrich's contract, and it must prevail.  What will prevail here today is the law of unintended consequences. Is it the intention of the majority to allow the factory fleet, the trawlers out of Seattle, WA, to take all of the whiting off the Oregon coast and put local processors and small boats out of business? I do not believe the Republican majority wants to do that, but that is what this bill will do if we do not have a rule setting the allocations for that season, and this bill will prohibit that.  Is it the intention of the majority to overrule and suspend part of the crime bill that was just passed, part of the contract? What about compensation for crime victims? It cannot happen if we do not have an administrative rule, and what you are doing here today will prevent your part of the contract to give overdue compensation to crime victims, their just due.                              {time}  1140  Is it your intention? I do not believe so. If it is not your intention, then, to do these unintended consequences, you must give us more time to discuss this. You must give us more time to offer amendments for these things because I cannot say that the majority whip or others really intended to do these things. But that is what will happen if we pass this bill today as written in the contract. The law of unintended consequences will prevail and we will have to live with it for an awfully long time.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
