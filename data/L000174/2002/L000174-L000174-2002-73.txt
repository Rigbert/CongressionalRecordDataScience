Now, some relief organizations have already been told that they may have to shut down programs for lack of funds. This is happening in a country that desperately needs the most basic staples such as water, education and medical care.  I agree with those who point out that many other nations have yet to fulfill pledges of assistance to Afghanistan. But, if the President is serious about a Marshall Plan, and I believe he is right, then we need to do much more to help rebuild that country.
