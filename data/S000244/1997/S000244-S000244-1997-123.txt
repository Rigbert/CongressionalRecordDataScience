Chairman, I rise today to present H.R. 1274, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Authorization Act of 1997.  I would like to thank and congratulate the subcommittee chairwoman, the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella] and the ranking member, the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Gordon] for crafting such a fine bill.  H.R. 1274 authorizes all the programs under the Technology Administration in the Department of Commerce that require appropriations for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. The Technology Administration includes the Office of the Under Secretary and the Office of Technology Policy in NIST, which is responsible for the vast majority of programs that make up the Technology Administration.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1274 is a fiscally responsible bill. It authorizes $609 million for fiscal 1998, a decrease of over $92 million, or 13 percent from the administration's request.  In fiscal year 1999 the bill authorizes a total of $628 million, again $116 million or 16 percent below the administration's projected budget.  While spending less than the administration requested, the bill manages to do more. In authorizing NIST programs, the bill prioritizes funding for NIST laboratory functions, increasing their funding by 5 percent for fiscal 1998 and 3 percent for fiscal 1999, while reducing funding for lower priority programs such as the advanced technology program, and providing no funding for new administration initiatives such as the experimental program to stimulate competitive technology, or EPSCOT, for short.  Specifically, the bill authorizes $278.6 million for NIST laboratory activities in fiscal 1998 and $286.9 million in fiscal 1999. The NIST laboratories have been called the crown jewel of the Technology Administration, and H.R. 1274 will help ensure that they have sufficient funding to continue their vital work of safeguarding the accuracy of standards necessary for domestic and international commerce.  H.R. 1274 includes $117.8 million for the manufacturing extension program in fiscal 1998 and $111.3 million in fiscal 1999. These totals will allow for full funding of all 75 existing MEP centers and will cover the administrative costs associated with running the program.  The bill also reforms and authorizes reduced funding for ATP in fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1999. ATP is authorized at $185 million in 1998 and $150 million in fiscal 1999. These levels represent decreases of $40 million and $75 million, respectively, from the fiscal year 1997 appropriated total of $225 million. The bill further reforms the program's match requirements, requiring a 60 percent match from all joint venture grant recipients and non-small business single awardees.  To ensure that ATP grants are not simply displacing private capital, the bill also contains language requiring a review of ATP applications to ensure that an ATP grant is actually required in order to enable the project to go forward.  Finally, the bill authorizes funding for NIST critical maintenance and construction needs for fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1999. In order to ensure that construction funding is used in the most appropriate manner, H.R. 1274 includes a certification requirement precluding the Department from obligating any money to new construction unless it meets the requirements of NIST's new facilities plan.  Accordingly, the authorization language includes provisions to reduce scientific research earmarks, to require the Committee on Science to receive notice of any reprogramming of NIST funds, and to express the sense of Congress that NIST should address the year 2000 computer date field program.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1274 is a sound bill. It is fiscally responsible, and will help ensure that NIST programs, whichare some of our Nation's most important technology research and development programs, receive the funding they require during the next 2 fiscal years.  I encourage all my colleagues to join me in supporting the National Institute of Science and Technology Authorization Act of 1997.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
