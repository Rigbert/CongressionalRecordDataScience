 Our views on the immigration issue are much different. I happen to believethe current immigration system is a disaster. It is unfair to the people of America to allow 800,000 or more undocumented people to come into our country each year, three-fourths of whom will remain in our country, as they have over the last 20 years.  Today there are about 12 million undocumented people. We have to stop the flow of undocumented across the border. The underlying immigration bill focuses on enforcement. The version that will be before us this week for the very first time invests $4 billion in enforcement. Those who argue we need to have stronger borders instead of broken borders, those who argue we should have enforcement in the workplace, should support this bill. It creates the laws and the tools to do that.  I might also add I don't believe the procedural arguments are valid. First, let me say this bill has been on the floor pending, available for scrutiny for weeks--4 weeks, 5 weeks, at least. Anyone who argues they haven't had a chance to look at this bill, it isn't for lack of opportunity, as everyone should for a bill of this consequence.  The second argument that somehow this process we are about to embark upon is so unusual as to be unfair, what the Senator failed to note is that the amendments which will be considered this week are an agreed-upon list of amendments on a bipartisan basis. Democratic leaders, Republican leaders came together and are offering over 20 amendments which will be debated on and considered this week. There are amendments offered by Senators who are going to oppose this bill no matter what it says and amendments offered by those who support it.  There will be ample opportunity for more debate on a bill that has already been debated for weeks--a bill which has been subjected to almost 40 amendments. I think most people understand the gravity of this bill, the importance of this bill, and the complexity of this bill. It is the effort of the majority leader, Harry Reid, to finally bring this matter to closure and a vote.  There are some, who for a variety of different reasons, oppose this bill who have said: We will do everything within our power to stop this matter from coming to a vote. That is their right as Senators in this Chamber. It is the right of those who want to bring it to a vote to use the rules for their purposes. That is the nature of this body. That is what the Senate is all about. So I think it will be a fair process.  At the end of the week, we will have considered this bill in its entirety and subjected it to amendment and debate. That is what the Senate should be about, and that is what this bill is concerned with.                          ____________________
