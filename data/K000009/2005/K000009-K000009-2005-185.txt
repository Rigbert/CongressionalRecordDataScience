Marian Wojciechowski, now a U.S. citizen, who is an Auschwitz survivor. The book ``Seven Roads to Freedom'', in which his chapter is included, traces the tragic journey of 6 million human beings who perished in Nazi death camps. Mr. Wojciechowski and his wife Wladyslawa survived, by a series of miracles and brave encounters. History must record these noble stories so their vast sacrifice shall be remembered and honored. May the world save itself in the future from this horrific suffering. This story, translated into English, from the original Polish publication deserves our attention and respect on this 60th anniversary commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz.                         Seven Roads to Freedom          (Edited by Miroslawa Zawadzka and Andrzej Zawadzki)            The Martyrology of Poles in Hilter's Death Camps                  (Translated by: Anna Wojciechowski)       (A Presentation delivered by Marian Wojciechowski on May 8,      1998 to the Discussion Club at the American Polish Cultural      Center in Troy, Michigan, USA).       ``Who is victorious shall be free, and who has died is      already free.''--words from ``Warszawianka''       6 million victims of the Holocaust in Poland in the years      1939-1945: 3 million Christian Poles; 3 million Jewish Poles.       The historians of future generations will research the      archives, evaluate and then write how many additional      hundreds of thousands of Polish Christians--on whose orders,      where, by whom and under what circumstances--were murdered in      the years 1939-1989 by the henchmen of communist authorities.                            1. introduction       I'm very happy that I came here, because I see that I have      already met here many colleagues and friends from past      times--now pleasant ones, in America--as well as from the      times of our national martyrology: the occupation and the      concentration camps. I was in three concentration camps, in      Auschwitz, Gross Rosen and Leitmeritz, and here I meet after      many years my colleague, Mr. Romanski, who was in the same      camps and we knew each other in Gross Rosen and met there      together quite frequently; and with the husband of Mrs.      Romanska, who is here today--Zbyszek Romanski and I were      friends, and we talked for many hours during the time free      from labor in the Gross Rosen camp.       At the beginning I would like to make clear, that I am      describing my wartime and concentration camp experiences not      for the purpose of inciting any hatred in anyone, or anger,      or a desire for revenge. Absolutely not. For a long time, I      was unable either to speak or to write on this subject,      because there stood before my eyes all the macabre scenes      which one saw then, as well as deaths, which took away many      of my friends and acquaintances under horrible camp      conditions. I was afraid of these memories; I did not want to      talk about them.       But time heals wounds, and in the end, we see that it is      necessary to touch on this subject, because history repeats      itself. History repeats itself especially there, where it is      forgotten. We pass it on, to avoid forgetting it and      repeating its horrible moments. Some of us (for example, my      colleague Romanski) are still in the possession of authentic      notes written in the heat of the moment, in the camps, in      pencil, already faded today. These historical artifacts      should not be allowed to disappear; we have to take care of      their conservation.       My narration pertains to my own experiences. As those who      survived the concentration camps also know very well, in the      same camp, and even during the same time period and      commando--it was possible to have more luck or less, to      encounter better or worse conditions and treatment, to      survive or to perish. My reminiscences then cannot be related      exactly to the fate of other prisoners. Almighty God helped      me in these oppressions, and I survived.       I will begin with my youth, which has a connection with the      main topic of my story. I come from the region of Sandomierz.      Forty some kilometers to the south of Sandomierz, there is a      small town called Polaniec, laid out on sandy soil. In the      area, there were two or three mills, and at that time there      was no factory or work establishment, besides the Ruszcza      estate where one could get agricultural work. I remember,      that in those difficult times after the First World War, the      local small landowners ate bread only on such important feast      days like Christmas and Easter, or during the harvest. For      everyday meals, there was barszcz and potatoes for breakfast,      lunch and supper. Not until somewhat later, around 1937, did      construction begin there (for example, the embankments near      the Wisla river). which gave people work and better      conditions for living. Besides, these people worked very well      and the results were very beautiful. Afterwards, industrial      centers (COP--Centralny Okreg Przemyslowy) were also built,      and the situation was systematically improved.       After finishing elementary school in Polaniec, in 1939 I      received my high school diploma in Busko-Zdroj (in the      beautiful newly constructed building) and went to the Szkola      Glowna Handlowa in Warsaw (Warsaw School of Economics). My      parents, who were small farmers, did not have the funds to      pay for my tuition, clothes, and room and board. That's why,      during the four years of high school, my brother and I earned      money for our keep by tutoring for money. I would get up at      around 5, no later than 6 in the morning, and I would go to      bed after 11 in the evening. During the last two years I was      a so-called ``Marszalek'' (the chairman of chairmen) of the      high school. During my college studies in Warsaw, I was able      to get a job as the assistant of the secretary in the Union      of Agricultural and Economic Cooperatives (Zwiazek      Spoldzielni Rolniczych i Zarobkowo-Gospodarczych), with the      benefit of being able to do my work during the day or at      night, during the workweek, as well as on Saturdays and      Sundays.       Even before the beginning of my studies I belonged to the      Polish Scouting movement, I participated in military      preparation, I was interested in various political directions      and social problems, trying to find answers to the question,      how we should manage our country, in order to improve the      welfare of the people. During my college studies. I had many      colleagues with various persuasions.     There were many forms of the so-called ``sanacja'' of the      former Pilsudski camp, such as Straz Przednia, Legion      Mlodych, BBWR, OZON, various shades of the Stronnictwo      Narodowe, Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, Stronnictwo Ludowe.      There were some who communized (Jerzy Wuensche, Roman Ujma).      There were also a few who usually played cards in the      restrooms of the library, and some who were not interested in      anything beyond their studies.       I studied two faculties simultaneously: cooperatives and      business education; and of the required foreign languages,      German and English. I joined the group of friends of the      Stronnictwo Ludowe.       In discussions then we searched for the appropriate road to      improve the conditions in the country. While still in high      school, I read a copy of Kapital by Marx, translated into      Polish, which I borrowed from the local Jewish library. By      such searching around, I came to the conclusion that in      Poland we must work out our own way, and I found--the      cooperative movement. Working in the co-op movement, first as      the secretary's assistant, and later as an auditor of the      agricultural-cooperatives, I made contacts with many people      of the Warsaw and Lodz provinces, which helped me very much      during WWII in the underground resistance.       Immediately after my studies, I performed my military      service in the School of Ensizns of the Cavalry (Szkola      Podchorazych Kawalerii) in Grudziadz, and after finishing      there, I was assigned to the 21st Regiment of the      Nadwislanski Lancers (21-szy Pulk Ulanow Nadwislanskich) in      Rowne Wolynskie, in the Luck province.       During military service in the cavalry military college in      Grudziadz, I taught evening courses after service hours about      cooperatives for the non-career soldiers in Grudziadl. I      organized courses in wheat-product (``zbozowo-towarowe:''      purchase. cleaning, milling, revision, storage, sale as well      as basic bookkeeping). The point was that after returning to      their homes from the army, they could join in the co-op work      in their hometowns.       That's a broad view of what my prewar past looked like.                           2. THE WAR OF 1939       During the war in 1939 I was with my regiment in the Lodz      Army, in the Wolynska Cavalry Brigade, in the region around      the locality of Mokra near Czestochowa. History appraises our      battles there very positively.       During the retreat towards Warsaw, my platoon was in the      rear guard that is in shielding formation, Before reaching      Warsaw, I received the order to march on Garwolin and further      on east for regrouping. But other detachments of my regiment,      walking behind us, received an order to remain in the      vicinity of Warsaw to defend the capital (I learned about      this from the leadership of the regiment after the military      actions of 1939 were over). Because Garwolin was already      burning, my platoon and I joined in with various detachments      of the Army of General Kleeberg--the grouping, of      Lieutenant-Colonel Mossor (Czas Ulanow, Bohdan      Krolikowski, page 217 and we took part in the successful      cavalry charge of Cavalry Captain Burtowy (ibid, page 221)      at the same time that Lieutenant-Colonel Mossor      surrendered to the Germans with the rest of the grouping      in the forest near Osuchowo.       The disbanding of our detachment did not take place until      the area near Uchnowo or Rawa Ruska at night, when the      Germans were attacking us from one side of the forest, and      Soviet detachments were attacking from the other side. The      order was: bury the weapons and ammunition, give the horses      and uniforms to the peasants, change into civilian clothes,      march home and await further orders.       Over half of the soldiers of my platoon came from Wolyn.      The entire detachment was a well-harmonized group, fought      bravely, heroically. The losses in human lives were large. My      deputy, a Wolynian, Corporal Szkurski was killed in the first      week of the war. I filled the losses in this way, by putting      always-willing volunteers, stray infantrymen, on the horses      left by those who were killed. I named as my deputy one of      the leaders of the section, a senior lancer. He fulfilled his      function very well.       After changing into civilian clothes, groups of people      started to form in a loose march towards different      directions: to their homes, to nearby relatives and      acquaintances. I proposed a march through Hungary or Rumania      to the Polish Army in France. Two colleagues joined in: one a      second lieutenant of the reserve of a different detachment,      who was originally from Warsaw, and one ensign of the career      school of cavalry. As I recall, his name was Bratkowski or      Bartkowski, having finished his second year. We agreed to go      to Stanislawow, stay there with a colleague of Bratkowski's      and look for a way to cross the border. After a few hours the      Russians detained us, and added us to a group of demobilized      soldiers headed for Lwow.       After various difficulties we were able to leave the      barracks in Lwow and get to the colleague's house in      Stanislawow. We were received hospitably, but with fear that      the Soviets might find us, because then the whole family was      in danger of arrest. After a few days of gathering news, we      determined that the Rumanian border was surrounded by the      army with dogs, and that crossing the border seemed to be      impossible at that time. After about a week, we decided we      couldn't place Bratkowski's friend's entire family in danger,      we had to return to Warsaw. We reached the new Soviet-German      border and there we fell into Germans hands. They packed us      into autos and conveyed the entire transport to Radom, where      we were unloaded onto an empty field fenced in with barbed      wire. During the night, the two of us dug our way out under      the barbed wire and fled in the direction of Warsaw.       Sometime towards the end of October 1939, we got to the      locality of Pyry near Warsaw. The farmer let us sleep in the      barn. The next day we were invited in for breakfast, and they      told us about the destruction and lack of food in Warsaw.      After breakfast my colleague and I parted company. He went in      the direction of his home, and I towards my rented room on      Narbutta Street. A friend of mine from studies in the Szkola      Glowna Handlowa (Warsaw School of Economics), Hieronim Tatar      and I rented one room, two other student acquaintances rented      the second room, and the lanlords took up the rest of the      house.       However, it appeared that the landlords had already signed      the volksliste, so that after a few days, my colleague Tatar      and I moved in with a colleague from school--Andrzejewski, on      Mokotowska Street. The two of us took up one room. The rest      of the house was occupied by our colleague Andrzejewski, his      mother and his elderly grandfather Jakubowski (the mother's      father).                3. PROFESSIONAL WORK AND THE UNDERGROUND       Immediately the next day after returning to Warsaw, I went      to my place of employment, the Zwiazek Spoldzielni Rolniczych      i Zarobkowo-Gospodarczych (the Union of Agricultural and      Economic Cooperatives) in Warsaw, 11a Warecka Street. The      Kasa Spoldzielcza (Cooperative Cashier) occupied the first      floor, the second floor was taken up by the Okreg w Warszawie      (Warsaw District), the sections Rolniczo-Handlowy,      Jajczarsko-Mleczarski (agricultural-commerce and ovo-dairy),      as well as the cashiers and Banki Spoldzielcze (Cooperative      Banks). The third floor was occupied by the Zarzad Centrali      (Central Administration), and the Institytut Spoldzielczy      (Cooperative Institute) was on the fourth floor. Many workers      ``camped out'' there with their families, because family      members were slowly finding each other.       During the siege of Warsaw food supplies were exhausted,      the prices on the black market were very high, and a large      part of the populace was starving. Situations were especially      difficult in hospitals, children shelters and so on. Many of      my coworkers denied themselves part of what were rightfully      their own rationed portions to jointly gather food supplies,      for example for the hospitals. The director of the section of      agricultural-commerce cooperatives was senior colleague      Franciszek Kielan, a very honest individual, unusually      generous and universally much respected. He convinced the      German commissar on cooperative matters in Warsaw to      transport food for the employees from the cooperative in      Kutno (the largest cooperative in the Warsaw district).       Along with fellow friend Jan Boniuk, we set out for Kutno      and brought to Warsaw, to our office, a food-filled ladder      wagon harnessed to three horses. Part of the food was      designated for hospitals, and the rest was divided according      to the number of members in each family, regardless of the      employee's position. A majority of the younger co-op      employees began to carry food to the hospitals. In this way,      I found in the hospital (probably the Ujazdowski Hospital)      the leader of my regiment, the 21st Regiment of the      Nadwislanski Lancers from the Wolynska Cavalry Brigade      Lieutenant-Colonel Kazimierz Rostwosuski, as well as many      officers from our regiment and brigade. I have to admit, that      from that time on the food situation in the hospital improved      very much.       After a certain time, we learned that the officers in the      hospital were going to be transported somewhere, and that the      Germans were already examining the lists of patients. I had      the most acquaintances in the municipal offices in the former      Sandomierski district. So I set out on a circuit and brought      back as many as possible of clean unfilled personal      identification documents (identity cards) and municipal      seals. I brought all these back to Warsaw and handed them      over to the reconnaissance liaison from Sluzba Zwyciestwu      Polski (SWP--Service for the Victory of Poland). I already      belonged at that time to the underground group ``Raclawice.''      After a few days, the sick officers were released from the      hospital and directed to an agreed upon residence location.      The new identity cards turned out to be very good--they      passed the test.       One day, the wife of Lieutenant-Colonel Rostwosuski      contacted my office to let me know not to spend the night at      home, because her husband was arrested during a street      roundup (lapanka) and would be interrogated by the Gestapo      that night. Luckily the next day, she advised me that he had      already been released on the basis of a previously issued      identity card (as I recall, it was issued to an      ``agricultural engineer'' from an estate somewhere in      Podole).       After the end of the September campaign, there began the      underground phase of the battle. I was very much engaged in      two groups. The first one was the group ``Raclawice''      belonging to the peoples' movement (most from the pre-war      ``Siew''). In connection with my work in the co-op movement,      I was invited to prepare the statutes and to help with the      organizational work of     the newly established restaurant in Warsaw, the ``Wymiana,''      on 73 Mokotowska Street. This was only going to be a cover      for the ``Raclawice'' group in its underground resistance      work. After a few months there occurred a desconspiration      (wpadka) of a cell of our group in Lublin (from where we      received printing paper for the underground press). Using      torture, the Germans forced information about our Warsaw      group from the arrested members of that cell, but for now did      nothing to us as yet.       One day a friend of mine, with the same first and last name      besides (we called him Marian Wojciechowski number one, I was      number two) came to me and asked if I could help them in the      following matter. Apparently there was for sale an entire      printing press hidden from the Germans by one of the printer      compositors somewhere in a barn in the countryside. But for      this printing press, the compositor wanted money--which      needed to be organized. I didn't promise anything at first,      because I didn't have the money, but I began some efforts in      that direction. In Rawa Mazowiecka the director of the      agricultural cooperative was my friend, Zygmunt Jedlinski. I      went to him, explained the situation and asked for help. Over      the time interval of several weeks, Zygmunt sent two ladder      wagons loaded with food (all the automobiles were      requisitioned by the Germans, and for the Poles they were      unattainable). The printing press was purchased for the money      received from the sale of this food on the black market. This      was one of the first printing presses in service of the      Polish underground in Warsaw.       The Germans depended very much on the agricultural      cooperatives that supplied food for them on location, as well      as for the residents of the Reich. Because of this, they      wanted to have precise reports and inventories regarding      existing cooperatives. The execution of such reports also      constituted my work. Traveling around to the cooperatives as      an inspector, I had special privileges in buying tickets for      busses and trains, of course only in work-related matters. I      made the most of these trips to contact other organizations.      They were given information, and communiques, meetings and      terms were discussed, and so on.       Springtime 1941 was the date set for the meeting of the      representatives of the organization ``Raclawice.'' This      meeting was to take place in the cooperative restaurant in      Warsaw in the evening. I was going to that meeting from Nowe      Miasto near Pilica, where I was staying with my brother after      recent surgery on my appendix. At departure, my brother asked      me to take along his wife, who was going to visit her family      in Sandomierz and continue further on to Polaniec, and was      going to have to change trains in Warsaw. I agreed readily      and promised to help my sister-in-law to transfer from one      train station to the other. Meanwhile, my sister-in-law      suddenly got sick on the train, so that in Warsaw, instead of      escorting her to the second train station, I took her to my      place on the Aleje Niepodleglosci. I brought over a woman      doctor acquaintance of mine, brought medicine from the      pharmacy and gave it to my sister-in-law. She already felt      significantly better. I announced to her that in the evening      I was going to the meeting. My sister-in-law began to cry,      she didn't know my landlords, they didn't know her, she was      afraid to remain by herself without my care. She finally      convinced me with this lamenting so much, that I resigned      from attending the evening dinner meeting of the underground      organization ``Raclawice'' in the co-op restaurant. I planned      to find out about the details the next day by going there for      breakfast.       At five in the morning I received a phone call from my      colleague Wegierski (he was my friend from the cooperative      and the ``konspiracja''), who asked me if I was coming for      ``breakfast.'' I answered yes, because I wasn't at the      ``supper'' yesterday, so I should go for ``breakfast.'' And      my friend replied: ``Better don't go there, because last      night there was some poisoning with mushrooms.'' In our      language, ``mushroom poisoning'' meant deconspiration or      betrayal. It turned out that the Gestapo arrived before the      hour designated for the meeting in the restaurant, and      planted all the halls as well as the stairway with its      people, both in uniforms and in civilian clothes. And      afterwards, they would admit all incoming guests, but they      were not let in. In this way, they arrested about 30 people.      From this group of arrested individuals, two women (a cook      and her daughter assisting her) survived; all the remaining      people died from exhaustion at labor or were executed by      shooting--the men in Auschwitz, the women in Ravensbruck. I      would undoubtedly have shared their fate, if not for the fact      that my sister-in-law's illness and strong pleas kept me at      home.       But I survived luckily for some time afterwards, until the      next year, 1942. Because I was informed that at the Gestapo      they are inquiring about Marian Wojciechowski, and I didn't      know which one, then I would change residences often (more      or less every 4-6 months). The last residence I rented in      Warsaw was in Zoliborz, in the housing co-op of      musicians--the landlord of the residence, who also was a      Wojciechowski (but Kazimierz) besides, was a musician.       I continued to travel around the General Government region.      One day, shortly after the arrests at the restaurant, Kazik      Wegierski came to me and announced to me, that he would like      me to meet his sister who had just arrived from Lodz. I went      to visit them, we talked some, and when the family went to      bed, Kazik's sister told me that she has a task for me. She      worked in reconnaissance and needed a place near the border      of the General Government on the train line Lowicz-Zychlin-     Kutno, where couriers crossing the border could stay the      night for some rest and a place to sleep. After a few months,      her brother advised her to ask me for help. I promised that I      would look around. Under the German occupation Warsaw,      Sochaczew and Lowicz still belonged to the General      Government, however the next train station--Zychlin--was      already on the side of the Reich, or territory incorporated      into Germany. As quarters for the woman courier, Lowicz      seemed the best fit to me, especially since I had very good      relations there in the local agricultural-commerce co-op.      That person was a woman courier of the Polish underground      (Kazik's sister from Lodz, Wanda Wegierska). Because of the      assignment of the liaison of the Polish underground, she took      on German citizenship, traveled quite often across the border      into German territory, met there with our intelligence      personnel and brought back from them information, among other      things including the localization of German armament plants.      This information was transmitted from Warsaw to London via      radio, to be utilized for bombing raids by the British air      force. The woman courier (a young girl, about 18-19 years      old) realized at one point in Berlin that she was being      followed, and she fled to hide in the hotel. Sometimes even      very sensible and brave people sometimes do tragically stupid      things. She did just such a stupid thing. Back in the hotel,      she wrote several letters, addressed the envelopes and mailed      them. One of those letters was addressed to me. The Gestapo      intercepted the letters and copied them along with the      addresses. The woman courier was arrested in Berlin only      after three or four months during her third trip. All the      recipients of her letters were also arrested. I had already      organized for her a point of transfer, everything was      prepared, but unfortunately it was too late.       Sometime during the second half of 1940 or maybe at the      beginning of 1941, I believe it was Kazimierz Wegierski      himself who came to my office room with his friend and asked      me to help him as much as I would be able to, after which he      left the room, leaving me alone with his friend. I asked what      was it all about? It was about making contact with people      through whom he would be able to acquire smaller or larger      quantities of every kind of food. In my travels around the      co-ops for inspection, before and even during the      occupation--I knew the remaining stock products of the co-     ops, and I tried to get to know people whom I could trust.       Verifying the percent of so called ``tluczek'' (breakage)      of eggs, ``rozsyp'' (spillage) of flour, cereal or grain, I      knew roughly how much and of what it was possible to take      away without putting people at risk of suspicion by the      German authorities. If there were suspicions about the black      market, that was only just half the problem. People were in      danger of being thrown out of work, being sent to labor in      Germany and so on. However, if there was suspicion that the      food was being handed over to partisans or to Jews--there was      the threat of punishment by death, preceded by torturing all      suspects and their families. We had to help, but always we      had to be cautious. My colleague Wegierski's friend came to      me to the office several times, and if I had them--I always      gave him some contacts in the cooperatives of the Warsaw or      Radom districts. A contact could be the director of the      cooperative, the director of a certain section. the warehouse      keeper, the bookkeeper or also even an ordinary laborer who      was initiated into the underground.       Only after the war, looking at a photograph in the press, I      recognized that friend of my colleague Wegierski. It was      Julian Grobelny, founder of the Council to Assist the Jews,      ``Zegota.'' During that time he was buying food and was more      than likely providing it for Jews.                       4. arrested by the gestapo       I was arrested in Radom, where I had moved, because in      Warsaw it was ``too tight'' for me, the Gestapo was tripping      over my heels. In Radom, I resided at the local high school      teacher's home (as I recall, his name was Oder). On April 23,      1942, at night, the Gestapo was battering at the door of the      house where I lived. At that time I was not at home, and the      landlord tried to open and escape through the back door, but      they shot him in the leg. His son died from the wounds      received during the shooting. The Gestapo inquired about me      and found out that I was working in the cooperative. The next      day, they went to the office of the Union of Agricultural and      Economic Cooperatives, and without mentioning my name, made a      general survey of the employees. They made accusations that      the office produced fictional work cards for people who in      reality don't work there. Under that pretext, they checked      the entire registered personnel ``from a to z,'' what and      where a given individual did during a given day. By this      method they got to me, and learned at which co-op I was      performing an inspection at that point in time. It was in the      Wloscianska Agricultural-Commerce Cooperative in Piotrkow      Trybunalski. They returned to their headquarters and      telephoned the order to arrest me by the local Gestapo. The      Gestapo came to the commissar of the cooperative during the      dinner hour asking about me. Meanwhile, not expecting      anything, I had just had a secret meeting at the cemetery     and returned at noon to the co-op bureau. There I found a      message that the commissar of the cooperative, a German,      wanted to see me in his office. This was nothing unusual, so      I calmly went to his bureau, and the Gestapo were already      there waiting for me. They checked my personal documents and      informed me that I was under arrest. The protestations of the      German commissar, who needed my help in the work of the      cooperative, did not help. I was arrested; the Radom Gestapo      demanded my immediate transport to Radom. At the moment of      the arrest, I had on my person several ``trefne'' (secret      under ground) documents, that is, such that should not,      under any circumstances, fall into German hands. Handing      over my briefcase to a colleague who was my assistant-     apprentice, I told him quietly to burn whatever could be      damaging to us. Unfortunately, I also had some papers on      me in my clothes; I could not get rid of these without      attracting the attention of the Gestapo. We arrived in      Radom (that was April 24, 1942) around 11 pm at night. And      here, fate was kind to me in a most miraculous way.       Now, about a month earlier I was taking the train from      Radom to Warsaw. At the train station, using my cooperative      inspector's identification card, I could buy a train ticket      without having to wait in line (this was no small matter:      there were barely 20 tickets available for about 200 people      in the queue). At that time, there walked up to me a stranger      in the uniform of a prison guard, asking me to help him to      buy a ticket: he had received a telegram that his sister in      Warsaw is dying and he desperately wanted to visit her (he      was going to be busy at work the next day). I like people and      I like to help them. Therefore, I agreed, and I bought him a      ticket in the next ticket cashier's window to avoid      suspicion. And it so happened, that we were passengers in the      same train car and chatted with each other a bit.       When, in accordance with their received orders the Gestapo      brought me to the Radom prison that night, it was this      ``acquaintance'' from the train station who was the guard on      duty!       On the first floor of the prison building there was the      criminal section (for prisoners accused of theft, etc.) and      on the upper floor, I believe either on the second or third      story, there was the political section. After bringing me in,      the Gestapo led me to the guard on duty and told him to sign      a document that I had been delivered. When he signed the      receipt for my person, they left, leaving me in his      responsibility. We were left alone, and we began a discussion      as to what to do next. My eventual escape would risk      reparations against our entire families (his and mine), as      well as against my colleagues from work and from home. I felt      that it was too dangerous not only for my loved ones, but      also for the family of the prison guard. I decided that I do      not have the right to put so many people in danger, and I      decided not to escape. The guard advised me to destroy      anything that was ``trefne'' (secret underground documents)      that I had with me. In the middle of a large hall on the      first floor in which we found ourselves, there stood a huge      stove (so called ``koza'') with a fire burning inside. The      guard lifted the cover of the stove and said: ``Throw it in      here.'' I had with me a notebook with coded names, telephone      numbers and addresses. Without knowing the code, it would      have been difficult to decode them. However, the Gestapo      could come to the conclusion that the information in the      notebook is coded, and with additional beatings maybe get      that necessary information out of me. Without a moment's      hesitation, I took advantage of the ``koza'' and threw in my      notebook along with the rest of the ``trefne'' papers into      the fire.                 5. interrogation and torture in radom       And so I fell into the hands of the Gestapo, but with the      exception of what they already knew about me, I did not      provide them with any other indications. Everything I      possessed was ``clean,'' because anything else had been      burned.       During the first few days of my stay at the prison, I      received a package with a large pot of buckwheat cereal. The      Gestapo checked this cereal rather thoroughly, but      fortunately, they did not find the tiny rolled up ball of      paper hidden inside it. It contained only the brief piece of      information, that the Wegierskis had been arrested with their      entire family. I did not receive any additional information:      why, who and how. Kazik Wegierski, a scout instructor (I      believe from the scout troop ``Wigry'') was that colleague      from work and the underground, who had informed me earlier in      Warsaw about the ``mushroom poisoning,'' or ``wpadka''      (deconspiration of a cell of my underground organization). He      was very actively engaged in the Polish underground, and his      sister was that courier who traveled to Germany for      reconnaissance.       I wasn't sure what the Gestapo already knew or what it      didn't know, but just in case, I didn't admit to anything.      For the first interrogation, there arrived at the prison a      special envoy from German intelligence, who spoke Polish      perfectly. As it turned out. he knew Poland, and about two      weeks earlier, that is, right before the outbreak of war, he      had returned to Germany from a ski trip to Zakopane. He      wanted me to tell him everything that I knew about people      acquainted with me, where they work, what they do. Naturally,      when it came to Wegierski, I pretended not to know anything.      At that point, there was not yet any beating or anything of      that sort. The person leading the interrogation said, that's      too bad, that I don't know anything. and left the prison.      About two weeks later at the next interrogation I was beaten      so thoroughly, that after finishing they threw me into the      cell completely disabled.       Normal interrogation took place in this way, that in the      attic of the Gestapo headquarters, they would put handcuff      the prisoner's hands in back of him, tie the handcuffs to a      rope hanging from the ceiling, and pull the rope upwards so      that one would hang above the floor of the attic at the      height of an average chair or table. Then, there would take      place a beating over the entire body, including the head and      legs. A person would be completely covered in blood. Because      I was hanging by my hands with the entire weight of my body,      and sometimes pulled downwards by my legs, I lost complete      use of my fingers and hands already after the second      interrogation. It was possible to prick me in the fingers,      and I would not be able to feel it. I could not bend my arms      at the elbows, so that when eating, for example, a piece of      bread, I had to use a spoon, because I could not reach my      mouth with my hand. They maltreated me horribly. Luckily, my      prison guard acquaintance alerted the persons indicated by me      about my imprisonment. These individuals tried to help me      through the commissar of the co-op union where I worked, and      also through his secretary. As I learned later in the Gross      Rosen camp, where I met the son-in-Law of my Radom landlords,      it was that German woman secretary who suggested that one of      the stapo (he had a high position and loved to play around)      be bribed. Of course, there could in no way be any      agreement about my release from prison, but it was about      sending me to Auschwitz without a death sentence. Normally      in similar incidences the prisoner, after the      interrogations were concluded, was executed by shooting in      the prison or in nearby forests, or sent to Auschwitz with      a death sentence. This sentence was executed by shooting      in the camp after a two- or several-month stay. Such a      sentence was not sent after me. I was transported to      Auschwitz, but all my things were returned to my mother      with the announcement of my death. They didn't want to      release the body, but they sent a message that I am no      longer on this earth.                              6. AUSCHWITZ       In the camp I met with a series of events that appeared to      be miraculous, or perhaps accidental coincidences ordained by      the Providence of God. It is difficult for me to say that God      wanted to retain my person, because there were so many who      were so much better and so much more needed. But it all      happened so that I was saved.       I arrived at Auschwitz as a complete human ruin: I could      not bend or move my hands. At the camp apels, when the orders      ``caps off'' or ``caps on'' were issued, I grabbed the cap on      my head without feeling it in my fingers. Not obeying the      command risked being beaten or even being killed on the spot.       They took me to Block 11, the block of death. Had they      learned about my state and that I was unable to work, a death      sentence would have been immediate. I was unfit for work, so      there was no reason why I should be kept alive. In such a      state, I was held in the death block for a day or two. I was      hit over the head with a club several times, but after about      a week they sent me, in a group of about 20 prisoners, to the      kitchen for food, for the afternoon soup. This soup--a bit of      water with some thing like nettle in it--and yet hot, was      carried on poles in barrels of various dimensions (25, 50      liters) by two prisoners. They sent a few too many people to      carry the soup, under the assumption that there would be more      barrels. But as it turned out, the barrels were larger and a      few of us didn't have to carry anything. I tried to walk in      the back, so that they would not choose me when changing      carriers, because I knew that I would be unable to carry the      barrel. And spilling the soup, especially a barrel of soup--     that would have been death on the spot for certain, for the      reckless denial of food for many people. And after all, I      could not tell them that I had no feeling in my hands. So I      walked in the back of the group of these carriers down a      street leading to Block 11, and suddenly I saw a man in front      of me, coming closer, also wearing prison garb, but shaped      and well-fitting. We got closer to each other and both of us      stood: ``Marian, is that you?'' and I answered, ``Zdzisiek,      is that you?'' It turned out that this was my friend, with      whom I shared a room in 1937-1938 at the cavalry training      center in Grudziadz for a period of about 9 months. At that      time, after military service, I returned to work in the co-op      movement, and he remained in the army as a candidate or a      career officer. During the occupation, he was rounded up      along with all the remaining men on a train on the Krakow-     Tarnow line and sent to Auschwitz. Because the man was strong      and healthy, he survived the first few months in the camp not      all that badly, and then people like that, if they were able      to do something, were assigned various positions in      maintaining the camp. My friend Zdzisiek Wroblewski was      appointed as the block scribe: he had the responsibility of      keeping the prisoners' register up to date, where and what      each one was doing at each hour. We briefly recounted to each      other our histories; he decided to accompany me. He went with      me to block monitor--it was a German criminal, who beat and      killed people without hesitation; he told him not to do me      any harm, because I was his friend.       In about a week, Zdzisiek arranged to have me transferred      to his block. I don't know how he did that, but at the new      place there were many former colleagues and acquaintances      from various political parties and factions, from various      universities and various cities. They already had formed an      entire underground organization Auschwitz, and everyone      helped each other as much as was possible. Zdzisiek drew me      to him and said that he would make me a ``sztubowy.'' The      ``sztubowy'' was responsible for one large camp ward. I told      him that I was not suitable for that function; I saw that a      ``sztubowy'' beats people, hitting them with a ladle wherever      it fell. I was not suited for this. Zdzisiek replied,      ``Listen, this is the way it is here, that either you will      beat, or you will be beaten.'' But I refused; I wanted to be      in the middle, to not beat and not to be beaten. So I bounced      here and there, working in different commandos in the camp      territory.       A typhus epidemic broke out. Two blocks were reserved for      the sick. The Germans were not at all that concerned about      the prisoners, who were dying in masses from the typhus, but      they were afraid of getting infected themselves. Because the      prisoner worked in many sections, for example, in the      canteens where they had contact with SS-men, they could      infect them. One day, two large trucks arrived, onto which      were loaded all the people in those two ``typhus'' blocks:      the sick, the reconvalescing and the orderlies. They were all      gassed. Less than a week later, I fell ill with typhus      myself. My companions in adversity took me arm in arm and led      me to the receiving hall for the sick, and then they      themselves had to quickly report to work. The doctor in      reception, a young Jew fresh after medical studies (probably      from Hungary) had already been alerted about my coming by my      colleagues or their acquaintances. At that very moment an SS-     man appeared. He was an older man, who went about the camp      and observed the prisoners, writing down the numbers of those      who were working poorly--as well those who were so weak that      they could not work. These numbers were then passed on to the      camp registry office. All those recorded prisoners were then      immediately murdered in the gas chambers or (more frequently)      by injection with phenol. At the moment of the SS-man's      arrival, I had already been examined by the doctor, with a      filled out health card. The SS-man came up and took my card,      and noticed the high fever. Seeing this, and knowing that in      a moment my number would be recorded and passed on for      execution, the doctor quickly reported: ``High fever, for      observation.'' In the Auschwitz camp, on Block 10, there      were performed various types of observations and medical      experiments. German doctors inoculated male and female      prisoners with bacteria of various diseases, performed      research and observations, and then of course they killed      the subjects. In connection with this, the visiting, SS-     man understood that I would be sent there for observation;      he put away his notebook and did not record my number. At      that time, I was already semiconscious.       Next, they sent me to a newly opened ``revier'' for those      who were sick with typhus. I was visited there by my friend      and one of the leaders of the conspiracy--Kazimierz      Wegierski, who was arrested even earlier than I. During his      interrogation, the Gestapo beat him so severely that his      kidneys, liver and other internal organs were damaged. As a      result, this very slender man was so badly swollen that I      could not recognize him. He died the next day, without      betraying anyone to the very end.       From the entire group that was arrested along with him, not      one person broke under cruel interrogation, no one was      betrayed. His sister, Wanda Wegierska, caught by the Germans      and accused of spying, was sentenced to death and executed by      beheading in the prison in Berlin. Working for the Polish      intelligence, she presented herself as a German citizen and      that type of death was administered to her. For her      achievements in the underground resistance movement, she      received the Virtuti Military Cross posthumously after the      war, and was also promoted to the rank of second lieutenant.      She was the woman courier about whom I spoke earlier at the      beginning of my lecture.       After getting well, I was sent back to the block of my      friend Zdzisiek, who started to look for work for me. He      found for me the position of bookkeeper for a German      civilian--an engineer, assigned to supervise the storage of      building and construction materials intended for the camp, as      well as for military objectives. At the Auschwitz camp there      was a main warehouse of that type. At the beginning, we      observed each other: on the third day of such an      acquaintance, the engineer placed a piece of bread with      marmalade on my table, and later we began to talk with each      other. Of course, I did not admit to my underground      connections. Our conversations were held cautiously and only      inside the building. The German warned me that if our      contacts were revealed, then he would become a prisoner like      myself, and I would end up in the crematorium. We worked      together, we exchanged words of greeting, the relationship      between us was arranged on a level plane of not so much as      work colleague or friend, but human being nonetheless.       After about two weeks, my work was changed: at the Sunday      morning apel, I was assigned along with about a hundred other      prisoners to clean the overgrown drainage ditches outside the      camp. Standing on the bottom of the ditch with water up to      the knees, one had to deepen the trench and hand the soil up      to people located higher. The work assigned to me was at the      bottom of the ditch, and any kind of protest would of course      risk a beating. At that time I already had enough feeling in      my hands so that I could hold a shovel, but my fingers were      still not fully functional (moreover, that condition has      persisted till this day). I worked this way for a full day;      it was already the middle of November, the water was very      cold. After returning to the camp I was shaking with the      cold, but the next day I went to do the same work, not saying      anything to the German engineer with whom I had worked      previously. After the second day of working in the ditches. I      got a very high fever during the night, and they took me for      a medical examination. It was pure luck that there were      Polish doctors there, who, even though they had no medicines,      were able to do advice what to do. They diagnosed pneumonia,      pleurisy, water in the side as well as inflammation of the      kidneys. They had no medicinal supplies, because people were      held in the camp to be finished off, completely without any      care as to their medical treatment. And once again, I met      with Divine Providence. In this so-called hospital to which I      was taken, there worked a prisoner--called the block tailor,      who had been arrested along with one of my friends. This      friend, like me, was a recipient of one of the letters from      our woman courier, which had been intercepted by the Gestapo.      The Gestapo came for him at his place of work--a tailor shop      on Wiejska Street right nearby the Sejm. He was arrested      along with other workers. A handy tailor from just that group      by the name of Wladek Dabrowski was presently in Auschwitz.      He performed a series of tailoring tasks for the camp      ``dignitaries''--the functionaries and the SS-men. Wladek and      I recognized each other and he helped me in the treatment.      Once again, God showed His mercy. How was I treated? They cut      off a small barrel and installed heating elements in the form      of several light bulbs. They would place me on blankets on      the ground, they would place the so ``armed'' barrel on my      chest, and they would connect the electrical wire conduit to      the electrical contact. After a half hour of such heating, I      was almost unconscious, but the blanket on which I was laying      was completely wet from the water coming out from within my      body. Besides this, the water from my side was extracted with      the help of a syringe. When the SS-man who was writing down      the numbers of the prisoners for execution, because they were      very sick and not fit for work, would draw near us, a well-     organized camp intelligence would warn us ahead of time. Then      I would be pulled out of bed, wrapped in a blanket and placed      on the ground by a wall. That was done with prisoners who had      already died, because at the morning, afternoon and evening      apels every man in every block had to be accounted for. After      the SS-man left, my friend the tailor, along with his      friends, put me back into bed. This would be repeated during      my entire stay at the hospital.       Meanwhile on the block to which I belonged. Zdzisiek had a      fatal fallout. He organized contacts from outside the camp      for the purpose of bringing in medicines for so many sick      prisoners. This was realized in the following way: Some of      the specialists (for example, welders, plumbers. and so on)      needed in the camp were imported as civilian workers from      outside the camp. Zdzisiek would pass on a list of needed      medicines to them, which they would bring to the camp at the      next opportunity. One of those workers was caught with such a      list during inspection, and under torture revealed who had      given it to him. Zdzisiek was arrested immediately along with      the two ``sztubowy'' who were responsible for the wards,      which Zdzisiek frequented most. Despite the tortures, all      three did not betray anyone and did not admit to anything;      they all perished either from starvation, or by phenol      injection. Had it not been for my stay in the hospital,      because I was so closely connected to them, I would have      probably been also taken, tortured and bestially murdered.       I stayed in the hospital until the moment that my fever      dropped, then I had to go back to work. I was released from      the hospital one Sunday and assigned to a different block.      This was the block of the so-called ``Zugange'' (prisoners      newly-arrived to the camp as well as prisoners discharged      from the hospital). The ward of the block I was assigned to      was located on the first floor; I was so exhausted by the      illness that I would walk up the wide stairs on all fours. I      had a card of discharge from the hospital and was assigned to      work the next day. This time the work consisted of arranging      in layers boards, still wet, freshly brought in from the      mill, in tall stacks with some air draft to dry the boards.      To accomplish this, some of the workers had to climb upwards      and pull up heavy boards handed up from below. I barely      managed to drag myself to the place of work; I was assigned      the work at the top, but I lacked the strength to climb up      the stack. Even if I had been able to do so, with the frosty      weather (and it was about the middle of January) I would      undoubtedly have frozen to death or, unable to climb down,      would have been pushed off to the ground, breaking my bones.      I thought to myself then, there is no point in climbing up,      better let them kill me here on the ground and it will be the      end of it. I decided not to go to the top of the stack--this      was a refusal to work, which in the camp meant inevitable      death.       At that time there was in Auschwitz an obercapo of the      Bauhoff (building section), a     German criminal prisoner known as ``Bloody August,'' who was      renowned for his cruelty. Tall, thin, with long hands like an      ape. It was enough for him to smack a prisoner with such a      hand, to make a corpse out of him. I suddenly saw that      ``Bloody August'' from a distance of about 10 meters. I      thought that this is the end of me; but he suddenly became      interested in someone else, jumped to the side and reached      him, getting further away from me. However, the other person      accompanying him came up to me. Normally, a prisoner of the      concentration camp when approached by anyone from the camp      administration, was obligated to take off his cap and stand      at attention. I did not do this; it was a matter of complete      indifference to me whether they would kill me or not. The      person approaching me noticed that, came up closer, looked at      me and said in German: ``Marian, is that you?'' I recognized      that it was the German engineer, for whom I had worked as a      bookkeeper. He asked what I was doing here, why I didn't come      to him to work. I answered, that they assigned me to      different work, that I had been in the hospital and then they      told me to report to the present work site. I added, that I      could not perform the work, because I did not have the      strength to do it, therefore because of that they will kill      me. The engineer looked at me and told me to come with him.      He took me to a huge storage place for pipes and other      plumbing parts. Outside the building there were all kinds of      concrete pipes, and inside there were copper and nickel      pipes, as well as all sorts of joints for pipes. The director      of this whole warehouse was a prisoner from Stalowa Wola,      engineer Sledziewski or maybe Sledzinski. The German led me      to him and said that he is leaving me with him as his      responsibility, turned around and left. Sledziewski knew      nothing about me, but he saw that I was barely able to stand      on my feet. He told me to sit down, brought me a piece of      bread, pointed to the hot water for bread soup. And I sat      like that next to him, by the hot stove, not doing anything      for about two or three days.       Under camp conditions this was something completely unheard      of and meant inevitable death. Soon we began to talk with      each other; I told him everything about myself honestly. When      I had rested some, I started to help him more and more. I      worked in this way to approximately the middle of March,      1943, when the transfer of prisoners from Auschwitz to other      camps was begun, because the Auschwitz camp was already      overloaded.                       7. GROSS ROSEN--ROGOZNICA       I was sent to the camp in Gross Rosen. The stay in Gross      Rosen began as usual with a quarantine. Even before it was      over, I was sent to Hirshberg (today, Jelenia Gora) to work      on the construction of a factory to make products from wood      fibers. The task of the workers was construction of timbering      for cement walls. I volunteered as a carpenter, trying to      avoid work with sand or cement, where one had to work full      speed running with wheelbarrows filled with sand or cement;      with this, one received a lot of lashes. The work of a      carpenter, requiring precision in matching timber or boards,      was slower. Later, I was even appointed the secretary of the      entire group, because it turned out that the former candidate      for the position was unable to write well, and quickly. So I      held the position of carpenter and secretary until about      November, when they brought us from Hirschberg back to the      mother camp of Gross Rosen. There I was again employed as a      carpenter in the construction of new barracks. One had to      work very fast, because everyday there arrived new transports      of thousands of prisoners pulled from many other camps (from      Majdanek and others). In the construction of the barracks      there were used ready-made slabs which had to be put      together, next the windows were mounted, and also finishing      work was performed. Part of the work was done in the      interiors, where it was hot, and for other types of work one      had to run, and fast at that, outside. Under these conditions      I caught a very severe cold, I was close to pneumonia, I had      trouble with breathing and speaking. My olleagues decided to      help me, taking me to the ``revier'' where I could rest. I      stayed there, and already on the second day there came to my      bed the ``revier'' kapo by the me of Siehsdumich and started      a conversation with me. I told him a bit of this and at about      myself, of course hiding my activity in the underground; he      asked me from here do I know German so well, and learning      about my education he proposed a more responsible job. He      suggested a project employing me in the camp post office, the      parcel section. This change suited me very much and I began      the new work of receiving and delivering parcels.       Some time later there came to Gross Rosen a transport of      prisoners from Majdanek. Right after that, a few weeks later,      this was followed by a large shipment from Majdanek of food      parcels which had been sent to these prisoners by their      families. The director of the post office, SS Unterscharfurer      Layer, decided to send the packages back to the families,      because some of the addresses were no longer current. The      parcels were delivered to the prisoners in accordance with      their prisoner number as well as the number of the block in      which they slept and ate. The first and last names of the      prisoners were not important, it was only those numbers that      mattered. However, after arrival in Gross Rosen from      Majdanek, prisoners were located in a new block and received      a new prisoner number, so that finding the original      addressees among so many thousands of prisoners was unusually      complicated. Therefore, the director of the post office      decided to send back the entire transport of parcels to the      senders. I knew that with the hunger prevailing in the camp,      the return of the food packages constituted a huge loss: in      addition, the families of the prisoners receiving the returns      will be convinced that the addressees were dead. This type of      explanation would not be effective with the director of the      post office, who was an SS-man. Certainly he was not      concerned with the hunger of the prisoners and the pain of      the families. I decided then, to propose other arguments to      him. I told him that returning the packages places an      additional burden on the communication centers, whose main      purpose should be services for the German populace and armed      forces. I cited the slogan placed on German trains: ``Die      Rader rollen fur den Sieg'' (``The wheels are rolling for      victory.'') With this I convinced the German, who asked me      for advice what to do, because it would be difficult to just      distribute the packages at random. I offered to help: if I      received permission from the commandant of the camp and his      deputy (Raportfuhrer Eschner) to spend additional hours      during the week working in the camp chancellery after normal      work hours, then I would attempt to find the addressees of      the parcels, by comparing their former registered numbers      with the currently assigned numbers, as well as searching for      the block in which they were presently residing.       In the camp registry office, there were card index tiles of      the mother camp Gross Rosen and all the subcamps of this      region, all living and dead prisoners with their new numbers,      occupation, and cause of death in case the prisoners were no      longer alive. After receiving the consent of the camp      authorities, I spent the next week working additionally until      about 11 or 12 at night, in search of the owners of the      parcels. The beginning was the hardest, that is, finding the      first few. Next, those who were found helped me to find the      next addressees. And in this way during the week we unloaded      the entire shipment of parcels, additionally earning the      confidence of the director of the post office, SS-man Layer,      and of Raportfurer Eschner with this work well done.       Shortly thereafter, this SS-man's goodwill, earned in this      way, became very useful to me. For one of the prisoners, it      pains me to say--a Pole (he currently resides in Warsaw),      supplemented his food rations by stealing the best foodstuffs      from some of the packages, for example, pieces of sausage.      Noticing this process, of course I did not denounce him, but      I sharply called his attention to it to have him stop doing      this. I even threatened him, that the next time this offense      occurred, he would receive from me a healthy lesson. The      angry prisoner, along with another Polish ``volksdeutch,''      wrote a denunciation about me, that I was taking advantage of      my work at the post office to send letters outside the camp,      even though I was under the so-called ``Postsperre''      (forbidden to write letters, and to receive letters and      packages). I knew nothing about this denunciation. One day,      when I arrived at work, the SS-man, director of the post      office Unterscharfuhrer, called me to his office and told me      from whom and what kind of denunciation was deposed about me.      The main chief of the political section of the camp,      representing the highest authority of the Gestapo in the      camp, came to him to verify this and to eventually take me in      for interrogation. ``My'' SS-man supervisor guaranteed that      it was not true, that I am a very good worker, and that the      denunciation was probably caused by jealousy. In the      conversation with me he added, that he was not asking me if      the accusation is true, but warned me not to do anything like      that, and also not to mention our conversation to anyone.      This SS-man saved my life then, because the denunciation      about me was true. Of course, having correspondence forbidden      to me (camp authorities ordered such types of prohibition      concerning certain dangerous prisoners). I would occasionally      send letters, availing myself of the kindness of my      colleagues, who were able to write once or twice a month to      their loved ones. From time to time (for example, once a      year) they would give up one of their own letters so I could      send one of my own, signed with their name and number (and to      these same numbers there could also come a reply to me from      my family, which they then transmitted to me later).       Luckily, the matter of the denunciation ended on this note      without any consequences. Additionally in my favor there was      also the following fact from the recent work time spent      building the warehouse in Hirschberg. Due to intervention      from the International Red Cross to the highest German      authorities in Berlin, it was demanded that all prisoners      receive the order one Sunday to write a letter home. I      reflected on what I should do. Since I had the ``Postsperre''      (under penalty of death, it was forbidden to send out or      receive any kind of correspondence or parcel, which      effectively made the prisoner ``dead'' to the outside world),      I delayed with writing the letter, in fear of the      consequences. So I went to the commandant of the subcamp      Hirschberg and asked what I should do. After coming to an      agreement with the main camp, he said that the prohibition is      binding and that I am not allowed to write. This proof of      subordination was registered in my records, and also helped      me to survive in face of the denunciation.       A group of prisoners from Majdanek, who received food      parcels thanks to my work, was most grateful to me. Hunger      ruled in the camp; food parcels were unbelievably valuable.      They invited me most warmly for a tasty treat, but I      declined--not accepting even a piece from anyone. At that      time, I worked inside the building and not that hard, so it      wasn't very bad for me; if they wanted to, then they could      share the food products with their friends and colleagues.      Helping my colleagues I saw as my duty, without accepting      even the smallest payment, not even in the form of food.                             8. leitmeritz       In January 1945, the German-Russian battles already moved      to the west of Wroclaw. The prisoners were transported by      train and on foot to the west. As I recall, on the 4th or 5th      of February 1945 there occurred the final liquidation of the      concentration camp Gross Rosen. They loaded us on various      uncovered train cars (for example, coal cars). They packed as      many of us as possible into each train car, putting in one or      two SS-men with machine guns. All prisoners were told to      kneel or to sit, and who ever raised himself or stood up was      immediately shot. The train drew near several locations where      there were concentration camps, but they were already      overfilled. On some stops, the bodies of dead prisoners were      removed from the wagons. Finally we reached Flossenburg, and      from there the subcamp Leitmeritz. It was a camp of murderous      labor in digging tunnels into the rock walls, into which were      then placed machines to produce armaments and ammunition. The      mountains protected the production against bombing      explosions. Those prisoners who were still alive in the last      few train cars, where I also found myself, received orders to      take the corpses out of the wagons outside, and lay them out      on the embankments along the railroad tracks. This caused a      considerable delay in entering the camp itself. Walking in      through the gate, I heard someone calling my name. It turned      out that they were the former prisoners of the Majdanek camp,      and later Gross Rosen, whose parcels from their families I      had rescued in Gross Rosen, with that additional night work      in the camp registry office.       After the quarantine, the entire transport of prisoners was      sent to set up camp Leitmeritz, and many of them now occupied      good positions (for example, as functionaries of the camp's      firefighting service). Out of gratitude, they fed me and my      colleagues, assigned me a bed to sleep on (many of the      prisoners slept two or three on one bed or on the ground) and      arranged work for me outside the main camp, under good      conditions, at the construction of a house for the camp      commandant. Because the German criminal prisoners, and      especially those so-called ``kapo,'' had already been      dismissed by then from the camps, and after a short training      were sent to the eastern front, they made me the ``kayo'' of      that group. I chose the following individuals for the group:       (1) Kazimierz Wisniewski, former student of the Szkola      Glowna Handlowa in Warsaw (Warsaw School of Economics), still      sick after typhus.       (2) Jerzy Cesarski, pre-war activist of the PPS (Polska      Partia Socjalistyczna) and an active member of the      underground.       (3) A German (whose name I do not remember) ``kapo'' of the      electricians in the commando ``Steinbruch,'' the exploitation      of the quarries in camp Gross Rosen. He was known for      secretly constructing a radio receiver together with a few      Poles and Germans; they jointly listened to the radio      broadcasts from London and also news about the situation of      battles on the fronts, and passed them on by word of mouth to      their colleagues in the camp, by which they really raised      their hopes for surviving. And that was a great deal. Caught      red-handed listening to this radio, despite terrible beatings      and other tortures, he did not betray anyone, taking the      entire responsibility on himself. The liquidation of camp      Gross Rosen probably saved him from death.       One evening, a group of Polish colleagues at work digging      the tunnel, reported to me--explaining, that the German      supervisor working there, who murdered people at work, had      already promised one Pole that he would finish him off the      next day. This Pole, already sentenced for extermination, was      engineer Dr. Henryk Stankiewicz, docent lecturer of the      Warsaw Politechnical School (as I recall, before the war he      specialized in research on the endurance of building      materials). Because I could not take more than three people      to work, I had to release someone in order to take in      Stankiewicz. I decided to dismiss Jerzy Cesarski, who scolded      me terribly, that I was sacrificing a political activist in      favor of some kind of engineer. Fortunately, both survived      and both returned to Poland. On a marginal note on this      matter, I will only add that as I recall, the 68-year old SS-     man who watched us, of Czech origin, and who knew the Czech,      German, Russian and even the Polish language rather well,      stated to us at the very beginning, that in his presence we      can say whatever we like about Hitler and the Germans, but if      his wife or his daughters arrived, we were not allowed to say      anything, because they were real Germans and would      immediately report this fact to the Gestapo.       To build the house for the commandant of the camp (it was      already under roofing) we had absolutely no materials and no      desire. We spent our whole time looking for wood remnants      nearby, which we exchanged with the local residents for a      beet, a turnip, a few potatoes, or a piece of bread. From      these products we would make a soup, which we shared honestly      with our guard. This commando was kept for me for a long      time, so that I think that it was due to the gratitude shown      me for that time in Gross Rosen. I have great respect and      gratitude for my colleagues.                  9. ESCAPE FROM THE TRANSPORT ON FOOT       In the months of March and April 1945, the Russian armies      were pressing to the west. One could hear in the distance      somewhere the bombs bursting and the cannonade of the      artillery. All work outside the barbed wire of the camp was      halted, and also within our commando. Whole columns of      prisoners were prepared to march out one after the other      somewhere to the west. On May 5, 1945, my colleagues      Wisniewski and Stankiewicz, and I were included in such a      column marching on foot. In the camp it was already a public      secret that the prisoners in the transports on foot, who no      longer had the strength to continue further, were finished      off with a rifle shot and left by the roadside to be buried      by the local residents. Long marches, often without food      and water, left numerous victims. Therefore, at the first      occasion during the night, walking through a dense forest,      at a given password all three of us jumped into the      roadside thicket. We waited until the entire column passed      us and then we hid ourselves in even thicker shrubs and      waited for sunrise. In the morning, we turned into the      first forest path crossing, which led us to a Czech      village, where we were greeted very, very hospitably.      Bathed, fed and dressed in clean undergarments, and in      clean albeit old clothes, we finally felt like human      beings. The Czechs informed us that the Russian armies      were already in Prague (or in the vicinity of Prague), and      the American armies were in the area of Pilzno.       While still in the concentration camps, we all knew about      the fate of the Polish officers at Katyn. The German press      made this known, and it was confirmed by the Polish      underground press, with the exception of procommunist      gazettes. We already knew about the mass arrests of Poles on      territories taken over by Russia and of their transports      under terrible conditions to Siberia. We already knew what      would be waiting for us there, if we believed in the      communist prattle and headed east. That's why we had already      planned earlier to head west. The roads were already      obstructed with German deserters and other nationalities in      all directions. Almost everywhere there were organized      kitchens for the fugitives. Without greater obstacles, we      made it to the vicinity of Pilzno. There, on the main road to      Germany, we were stopped by an American patrol. Only those      who had documents proving that they resided in the west were      allowed to go on. Residents of Central and Eastern Europe      were to return to their homes. The three of us went off to      the side to consult on what to do. A young Czech boy was      listening in on our conversation. Apparently he understood      our situation, because he informed us that he could show us      where to cross the border. He returned with us part of the      way towards the village, then turned off to the side through      the field boundary strips, in the direction of some small      shrubs and thickets, and said that beyond those shrubs we      would reach a grove, and beyond that would be Germany. That's      how we made it to the German locality in the area of      Schwandorf, and then further on to the town of Amberg, where      a Polish DP (Displaced Persons) camp was being formed. There      the commandant of the camp, a prisoner of concentration      camps, a major in the AK (Armia Krajowa--Polish Home Army),      Wojcik (Jozef was his first name, I think) greeted us, and in      a pleasant, friendly new-camp atmosphere we slowly regained      our old selves mentally and physically, after the tragic      experiences of the preceding years. The nightmare of German      concentration camps still remained in our subconsciousness      for decades and even now after more than fifty years of      freedom, sometimes I wake up from a terrible dream and I see      the silent pleading eyes of my friends standing in front of      the camp administration office in Gross Rosen, under the      guard of SS-men, I hear the shots into the back of their      skulls; and I sense and I see in the dream the black cloud of      smoke weaving lazily out of the crematorium. Those who      survived this hell did not speak of it for a long time. But      it is necessary to talk about it, so that the memory will not      be obliterated, so that the history of the Polish Holocaust      will not be further falsified.                     10. THE POLISH CIVILIAN GUARD       In August and September 1945, the news spread around in      Amberg that:       (1) the Polish DP camp in Amberg would be transferred to a      larger camp in Wildflecken,       (2) the Americans were organizing the Polish Civilian Guard      and Transitional Training Camps.       The commandant of our camp, Major Jozef Wojcik, became the      commandant of one of such camps (Wincer) and asked me to help      in enrolling participants. I traveled around the DP camps,      made speeches and kept sending to Wincer even more candidates      for the Civilian Guard. Finally-late in the autumn of 1945, 1      also went through a period of training as a second      lieutenant, and at the beginning of 1946, our Civilian Guard      company was sent into service at Bad Aibling (near Rosenheim      by Munich). As I recall, there were three of our companies      all-together. We performed our duty by guarding German POWs;      mechanical vehicles and their spare parts; and     stores of weapons, ammunition, etc. In the summer of 1946.      they transferred our company for repeat short training do      Mannheim Kafertal. There I found many young officers and      soldiers whom I knew from my college years, my military      service and during my professional work. I became friends      with the deputy of the leader of the Civilian Guard of the      American Army, Lieutenant-Colonel Wladyslaw Rylko, and he,      knowing that I am a member of the cooperative movement, asked      me for help in organizing co-ops in the Civilian Guard      companies. I began work on preparing the statutes as well as      the accounting forms and cash settlements. However, since      part of the company to which I was assigned was transferred      to Buttelborn near Gross Gerau in the vicinity of Darmstadt,      in order to guard the warehouses of automobile parts and      automotive service columns, I went along with them. After a      few days in Buttelborn, I became aware of two things:       (1) the members of the companies and their families were      still somewhat hungry;       (2) the American army would employ the Civilian Guard only      for as long as they needed us. In case of dismissal, our      soldiers will go looking for work in Germany or through      emigration, without possessing any practical professional      skills.       I resolved to do something to remedy both these cases.      Regarding the suffering due to hunger, I again started up the      company cooperative. making the bookkeeping, the accounting,      and the periodical rights of control by members (the      auditing committee) more efficient. Regarding the      guardsmen's lack of professional skills, I held a meeting      of the soldiers and asked them, who would like to learn      which profession. Next, I applied to the local village      resident Germans individually, owners of trade workshops,      with a request to accept our candidates for training in      the profession. In this way I was able to accommodate all      who wanted to learn. Next, I sat down with my friend, the      leader of the company. Captain Roman Wcislo-Winnicki, to      work out the scheduling of guard service for afternoon or      evening hours, so that those who wanted to learn could go      to work during the day in the trade workshops and learn      the trade skills. With the help of the educational officer      of our center, Captain Jerzy Wilski (my colleague from the      concentration camp Gross Rosen), a scouting instructor      before the war, we founded clubs for soccer, basketball,      volleyball, and an educational club with a handy reference      library and so on. The work came out just fine. It was      time to think about myself, too. Lieutenant-Colonel      Wladyslaw Rylko suggested that I transfer to the center of      civilian guard training in Mannheim Kafertal. I applied to      the University (Wirtschaftshochschule) in Mannheim for      admission to studies and to work on a doctorate in      economics (Wirtschaftswissenschaft). They accepted me and      assigned study subjects and an amount of time for two      semesters, that is, with a possibility of finishing      studies in one year. Unfortunately, just after I passed      the examinations for the first doctoral semester, I was      dismissed from the Civilian Guard of the American army in      the summer of 1947 (Reduction In Force). Because this was      equivalent to depriving me of financial resources for me      and my entire family (wife and daughter), I had to resign      from further studies. Luckily, before the dismissal, and      with a greater cooperation of a special co-op committee, I      was able to work out the statutes, bookkeeping, and plant      the seed of trade courses in very many guard companies, so      that the Civilian Guard of the American Army could rightly      be proud of beautiful attainments in education, culture,      profession, charity and finances--and always in the spirit      of the true independence of Poland.       During the autumn of 1947, I moved with my family to the      Polish DP camp in Hochenfels (Lechow) near Regensburg, where      I was drawn immediately into collaborative work with a circle      of farmers; and I began lectures on economics and accounting      subjects. After a few months, they offered me a position with      the chief Polonian organization in the American-occupied zone      in Germany, called ``Zjednoc zenie Polskie'' (``Polish      Union'') with headquarters in Regensburg--Brunnleite 7. But      that is a completely different topic. 11. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, WHICH WAS NOT PRESENTED AT THE DISCUSSION                                   CLUB       Due to lack of time and the huge amount of material to      discuss, I did not touch on many details. Having that      opportunity presently, I would like to complete some of the      topics in short fashion.       While working in the post office in Gross Rosen in parcel      reception, I was also on a block with other prisoners working      at the camp registry office, such as:       In the Political Section, which settled prisoner affairs in      the course of further interrogations (and torture!), verified      the records of prisoners sentenced to death, kept under      surveillance those prisoners suspected of enemy anti-Nazi      propaganda or even anti-camp, and hunted after secret      underground organizations in the same camp, as well as      checked every so often whether prisoners with death sentences      were really executed (by phenol injections, gassing or      shooting).       In the Labor Section, which located and controlled the      status of prisoners in all commandos of the mother camp Gross      Rosen and in all its subcamps.       In the Camp Enlargement Section.       In the Post Office Section, and so forth.       However, the most important was the Political Section and      the Labor Section. It depended on them whether one would      eventually survive the camp or not.       In periods free from work tasks, there were many occasions      for conversations between prisoners on various topics,      discrete exchanges of opinions, getting to know each other.      The highest prominent of the not very numerous Polish group      in the camp registry office was Jan Dolinski, a political      prisoner who spoke German excellently, but who did not      blindly serve the Germans. He did what he had to. He was      polite but he kept his distance. In the group of foreigners,      a young Ukrainian from the Polish territories, Antoni      Kaminski attracted attention (he was friendly, but something      told me to avoid him); and also a tall, stout, middle-aged      resident of Belgium or Denmark (I don't remember exactly),      with whom I quickly formed a friendship (unfortunately, I      don't remember his name either). After a short time he told      me, that he worked in the Political Section of the camp      (Politische Abteilung), that I am on the list of prisoners      who are under surveillance at least once a month without      knowing about it--by other prisoners, mostly Germans. He gave      me the name of my ``guardian angel,'' warning me not to give      away that I know anything about it. Such a prisoner-spy would      try to make friends, would bring up certain questions during      a conversation, such as who will win the war, who is losing      the war, why and whom do I wish victory, what was my attitude      towards the communists, and of course the whole time he would      agree with my opinions. Afterwards the entire content of that      conversation would be reported where he was so told. The      information from this Belgian protected me from painful      consequences and increased my vigilance and caution in      pronouncements to strangers. Shortly after the first      warnings, ``my'' Belgian told me that he has access to a list      of individuals of Polish nationality, who, after      interrogation by Gestapo in various cities are sent to the      camp in Gross Rosen, but with a sentence of death. These      individuals after a few months were called to the Political      Section; after their identity had been verified, they were      made to stand at attention before the camp administration      office, until a designated SS-man would lead them to the      crematorium and there kill them with a phenol injection, gas      or a bullet. Then on the prisoner's card file in the camp      registry office would be noted the date and the letters      ``ABE'' which meant ``Auf Befehl Erschossen''--shot on      orders.       Because Polish names are difficult to remember for      foreigners, the Belgian prepared a short list with the names      of the new Polish prisoners that were under a sentence of      death. On one of the first lists was the name Antoni Suchon,      my younger brother's friend from the Stopnica high school. I      had already met with him before in camp. During the German      occupation he belonged to the peoples' movement and was a      member of the underground organization. One day, a meeting of      that organization was scheduled in a village during a dance      party. The Germans surrounded all the participants, and      Suchon had with him a loaded revolver, which he tossed out      unnoticed. The Germans found the revolver, and in order not      to put the others in jeopardy of interrogation, torture and      maybe even death, he himself confessed during the search that      it was he who tossed the gun and that the weapon is his. All      were set free, and after interrogation he was sent to camp      Gross Rosen with a death sentence.       The camp in Gross Rosen had many subcamps. In some of them      mortality was so high, that rarely were prisoners transferred      from them to the mother camp in Gross Rosen in order to      execute death sentences. Usually the prisoners died      themselves from exhaustion or poisoning (for example from the      exhaust fumes in the factory of poison gases). The director      of the Labor Section was a small, slender, middle-aged      hunchback ``Krieger,'' who wore the pink triangle (pederast).      For a piece of cake, bacon, lard or onion, he agreed to      send--without any publicizing--a Polish prisoner to a subcamp      designated by me. In this way the lives of certain worthy      people were saved. Unfortunately, I was unable to save the      life of my younger (he was about 26 years old) colleague      Antoni Suchon. After several months, during the afternoon      apel, I noticed him standing at attention before the      administration office. He didn't look too badly, he was calm,      resigned. Already next to him stood the SS-man who was to      lead him to the crematorium for execution. I wept for Antoni      like a child.       Unfortunately one day, probably already in autumn of 1944,      as I was returning from work for the afternoon apel, I      noticed my friend the Belgian standing at attention in front      of the camp administration office. I walked slowly across to      the other side of the camp street and looked at him. He also      looked at me and with his head signaled ``no.'' I understood:      he did not betray anyone. Someone denounced him and the SS      searched his pockets when leaving work and found some names.      He was handed over to the penal company of the horrible      murderer ``Vogel.'' My friends and I had to put in a lot of      effort, and live through much fear, to save ``my'' Belgian as      well as another of my friends from college years, Stanislaw      Dziadus. Dziadus, who was sent from Gross Rosen to the      subcamp in Biedrusk near Poznan, escaped from there and was      caught by the Gestapo and returned to camp Gross Rosen. We      were able to arrange that he would not be killed, only sent      to the penal block. Since the camp in Gross Rosen was      overloaded with prisoners, they were sending transports to      other     camps, located further west. For a bit more cake, bacon and      other items received from colleagues, we were able to include      our friend the Belgian and Stas Dziadus (later, a doctor and      peoples' activist in Poland) on the list of participants of      the transport and give them provisions for the trip.               12. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE POLISH HOLOCAUST       For almost fifty years after the attack of Germany and the      Soviets on Poland and after the experiences in the      concentration camps, I was unable to withstand the      psychological stress involved in discussing or even listening      to conversations on the subject of the terrible effects of      the war, and above all the results of Gestapo rule. I had a      nervous breakdown and burst out in bitter weeping on the      stand while testifying in the federal case in Chicago      regarding the deportation of a former SS-man from Gross      Rosen, Reinhold Kulle, which took place in the years 1983-     1984.       But I was also aware of the fact that the recording of      experiences of former prisoners of German and Soviet      concentration camps is a necessity to preserve historical      truth--and I slowly began to control myself, and to speak on      those subjects. And so, on September 1, 1989 on the fiftieth      anniversary of the attack of Germany and the Soviets on      Poland and the outbreak of WWII, two television stations      (Channel 11 and Channel 13) in Toledo, Ohio, and also the      locally well-known and widely-read daily newspaper, The      Blade, came to me with a request for an interview.       The matter of the Polish Holocaust and my wartime      experiences was widely commented on the two TV stations and      written up in an interesting, lengthy article of the major      local press. The local Polish American Congress (of which I      was vice-president) arranged a solemn observance of the 50th      anniversary of the attack on Poland in the local theater      located in the old Polish neighborhood, where Rev. Chaplain      George Rinkowski presented his war history and experiences,      and I presented my own experiences--my Polish Holocaust. In      September of 1989, an instructor (Applied Economics) in the      high school in Maumee, Ohio, also asked me to lecture on the      subject of differences between capitalism and communism.       In October 1989, Mr. Dale Schroeder of Monroe, Michigan      invited me to speak about my experiences during the war to      the members at a dinner meeting of the local Kiwanis Club. My      lecture also appeared in the local gazette, The Monroe      Evening News.       In December 1989, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, the U.S.      Representative from Toledo and herself of Polish heritage, a      very well-known, loved and respected person, organized for      middle-school students a memorial observance of the Holocaust      at the University of Toledo Urban Affairs Center, with the      participation of ethnic groups. I was the lecturer from the      Polish group.       The terminal illness and death of my late wife, Wladyslawa      (who, with her parents and two brothers had already been      arrested on January 18, 1940, and whose brother was murdered      in a mass execution at Palmiry, and her father at Auschwitz)      interrupted my thoughts about the Polish Holocaust.       Only towards the beginning of 1995 did I accept an      invitation from the high school in Oak Harbor, Ohio (from      teachers Mr. & Mrs. S. Kirian) for a chat about my      experiences in the concentration camps (it was also recorded      on videotape). The children listened with great interest.       If I remember correctly, on October 15, 1995 there was a      solemn Mass (on the occasion of the annual meeting) at the      American Czestochowa in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, in the      intention of those who were deceased and those who survived      the German and Soviet concentration camps. We set out there      together with my friend Albert Ziegler, who is of Jewish      heritage. Because Al did not speak Polish, I was his      interpreter. The Poles present at the meeting greeted Ziegler      very cordially. There weren't even the slightest missteps or      shortcomings. They even asked him to light a candle during      Holy Mass, in memory of the Jews who perished in the      Holocaust.       More or less around this time, I had a short interview by      the editor (or perhaps owner) of The Monroe Evening News,      which later appeared in their published book, In the Rockets'      Red Glare; Recollections of Monroe County Veterans.       In 1996 we again decided to travel to Doylestown for the      solemn observance, and Al was even prepared with special      video equipment for this occasion. However, in the interim      there was an intensification of anti-Polish attacks in the      press and TV, after the so-called ``documentary'' film PBS/     Frontline Shtetl. Al Ziegler filmed the entire ceremony. They      greeted him very politely, but coldly. There was no sign of      the previous outpouring of courtesy and friendship from the      entire hall. It was replaced by a polite reserve, although no      one told him even one unpleasant word. I know that Al Ziegler      felt this very sharply, but he was probably not surprised at      this reaction, which resulted from the current attacks on      Poles.       After the nationwide broadcast of the PBS/Frontline film      Shtetl, my daughter called the local PBS TV station with a      request that they show the documentary film Zegota. Although      they received a copy of the video from the film director,      they still decided not to broadcast it. So, on several      occasions we invited groups of people to our home to show      them this real, other side of the problem. Naturally, we also      invited over our Jewish friends.       After all, the majority of the actors of this documentary      film Zegota are real witnesses of the drama. They are the      participants and authors of this history, which unfortunately      a majority of Jews does not wish to view and doesn't even      want to hear about it. The kind of help that the Jews      received during WWII in Poland was not found in any other      country under German control. And this is precisely      demonstrated in the film Zegota.       On September 17, 1997 I was invited by my friend Mr. Dale      Schroeder to talk to the members of the local Kiwanis Club      about the attack of the Soviets on Poland on September 17,      1939.       In 1997 and 1998, I had two presentations for students of      American history at the University of Toledo, Ohio (at the      invitation of teacher Carol Holeman). After my lectures, the      students admitted to me privately that they had not known      anything about the Polish part of the Holocaust.       In November 1997, I attended a public meeting at the Erie      United Methodist Church in Erie, Michigan. Two students from      the church had just returned from mission vacations spent in      Poland, and were relating their impressions in a most      flattering way about Poland. Following their presentation, I      spoke on the subject of the Polish Holocaust.       In April 1998, the minister of the same church invited me      to their Sunday service to speak at length on the subject of      the Holocaust (during which the Germans murdered 6 million      Polish citizens: 3 million Christian Poles and 3 million      Jewish Poles). The lecture was received very favorably, and      the attendees of that meeting recalled it to me on many      occasions.       In 1997 and 1998, my friend Al Ziegler and I took part in a      whole series of interviews and occasional discussions on the      topic of the Jewish and Polish Holocaust, presenting it as it      really had happened. Schools in Toledo, Maumee and Sylvania,      Ohio, invited my Jewish friend along with me, a Christian, to      speak on and explain those topics. Often, they were      videotaped. I must state that my Jewish friend was very      objective and reported the matters entirely in agreement with      the truth.       Albert Ziegler recorded very many interviews with both Jews      and Christians, probably hundreds of hours. Unfortunately, we      were not always able to lecture together. Some schools only      allotted 45 minutes for a presentation. The best situation      was on those occasions when we had 2-3 hours for both of us.       On January 30, 1998, I was interviewed for the Steven      Spielberg Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation,      with a specially hired videographer. The interview itself was      performed by Albert Ziegler, one of the specially trained      Spielberg interviewers in the region.                         13.
