 President, today I am introducing legislation--along with Senators Grassley, Cochran, Roberts, Abraham, and Hutchinson--which will restore to American farmers an important tool in meeting their Federal income tax obligations.  Mr. President, America would not be what it is today without the dedication, sacrifice, and hard work of the American farmer. The American farmer is the most efficient farmer in the world. Each farmer in America provides food and fiber for 94 people in our country and an additional 35 people abroad. As a result, Americans enjoy the most affordable, healthy, and stable food supply of any country in the world.  Yet, despite the successes of the American farmer, they are faced with unique and difficult barriers, they must overcome, including unpredictable weather, natural disasters, plauges of insects and diseases, and excessive Government regulations. All of these result in substantial income fluctuations for the average farmer.  Wide swings in farmers' income from year to year, result in a tax burden much higher than individuals with a stable source of income because surges in income are taxed at a higher rate than is a steady flow of income. This problem is compounded when a farmers income is exaggerated by the sale of land or other assets.  Prior to 1986, farmers were allowed to average their income over a 2-year period in order to give them some sense of regularity and predictability in their payment of Federal taxes. This provision was repealed as part of the 1986 Tax Act, which reduced the number of tax brackets and lowered the top rate of 28 percent. However, since 1986, Congress has added two new tax brackets, and increased the top rate to 39.6 percent.  This change, along with the move to a more market-oriented farm program, makes it imperative that Congress restores to farmers the ability to average their income, and the legislation I am introducing today will do just that. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last year that this bill would cost about $90 million over 5 years.  Representative Nick Smith has sponsored an identical bill in the House, and it has the broad support of the farming community. Groups endorsing this proposal include: Alabama Farmers Federation, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Farmers Union, National Grain Sorghum Producers, National Grange, National Pork Producers Council, and Women in Farm Economics.  Mr. President, the success of our Nation depends in large part on the success of the American farmer. Until we can enact broad-based tax reform, we should provide farmers with some sense of regularity and predictability in meeting their Federal tax obligation. This legislation will do that, and I hope my colleagues will support it.                                 ______                                       By
