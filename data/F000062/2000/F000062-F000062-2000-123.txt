 President, I extend my deepest thanks to Professor Tribe for his letter and for his support. We will certainly be consulting both he and Professor Cassell again and come back to fight again another day.  I want to say something to the victims who have been so heartrending in this process. Those of us who are political come to grips with the sophisticated lobbying around this place. One of the things I have seen in the people whom we represent is they are real people. They have been maimed, they have been harmed, they have been hurt, and with this--I have seen this in the past when I was active in the criminal justice system--victims almost become catatonic. They almost become unable to go out and do the lobbying that is necessary to move something such as this.  I want them to know how much we identify with their cause, how much we intend to continue to pursue this cause. It is a just cause. It is a cause that deserves remedy and recognition in the Constitution of the United States. It is a cause where, once victims have these rights, they lost them.  This Congress--the other body and our body--should provide these rights again. I am hopeful that in the coming years, we will be able to continue our work on this. Perhaps we will be able to solve this one dilemma of the balancing. It is interesting; anytime one reads a statement by the President or by the Attorney General, it mentions the balancing of these rights. Yet when we write something in the Constitution which, in effect, would provide for this, it brings out the criminal defense bar; it brings out the liberal scholars; it brings out people who say: You can't do this. You can't give victims these rights.  The cause is just that they have these rights. A statute, we believe, will be unable to provide them, but as to their standing in the Constitution, there is a time and there is a place, I predict, when that standing will happen and take place.
