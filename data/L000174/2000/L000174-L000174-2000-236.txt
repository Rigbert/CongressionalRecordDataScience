President, today I am introducing legislation, with my friend from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, to protect the personal privacy of consumers whose information is held by firms filing for bankruptcy protection.  The Privacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act would prohibit the sale of personally identifiable information held by a failed business if the sale or disclosure of the personal information would violate the privacy policy of the debtor in effect when the personal information was collected. Personally identifiable information, under our legislation, includes name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, Social Security number, credit card number, date of birth and any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.  This legislation is needed because the customer databases of failed Internet firms now can be sold during bankruptcy, even in violation of the firm's stated privacy policy. That is wrong.  Toysmart.com, for example, an online toy store, recently filed for bankruptcy and its databases and customer lists were put up for sale as part of the liquidation of the firm's assets. This personal customer information was put on the auction block even though Toysmart.com promised otherwise on its web page.  Toysmart.com's web site states that ``personal information voluntarily submitted by visitors to our site, such as name, address, billing information and shopping preferences, is never shared with a third party.'' Toysmart.com's privacy statement continues: ``When you register with toysmart.com, you can rest assured that your information will never be shared with a third party.''  But on June 8, 2000, one day before filing for bankruptcy, Toysmart.com advertised in the Wall Street Journalto sell its customer lists and databases. That was a clear violation of Toysmart.com's web site privacy policy. The Federal Trade Commission has filed suit against Toysmart.com for this violation and I commend the FTC for its action.  Yesterday, the Walt Disney Company, the parent company of Toysmart.com, announced that it would try to purchase Toysmart.com's customer information from the bankruptcy court. I applaud Disney for taking this step. There is no guarantee, however, that Disney will be the top bidder for this information and other corporate parents may not be as responsible if one of their subsidiaries fails. Indeed, two other failed web businesses, Boo.com and Craftshop.com, have reportedly sought buyers for its personal customer data.  That is why this Congress should pass the Privacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act this year. Consumers deserve this privacy protection.  Mr. President, it is wrong to use our nation's bankruptcy laws as an excuse to violate a customer's personal privacy. Customers have a right to expect an online firm to adhere to its privacy policies whether it is making a profit or has filed for bankruptcy.  I commend Senator Torricelli for joining with me to introduce the Privacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act. Our legislation will close this loophole in the Bankruptcy Code and ensure that online and offline firms keep their promises to protect the personal privacy of their customers.  I urge my colleagues to support this basic privacy protection legislation.                          ____________________
