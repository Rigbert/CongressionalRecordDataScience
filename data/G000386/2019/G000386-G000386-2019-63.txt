 There are 2.5 million veteran-owned businesses in the United States that account for more than $1.1 trillion in revenue. In Iowa, there are 26,119 veteran-owned businesses that employ 51,801 people and bring in $10.9 million.  Iowa is working hard to attract veterans and help them start and expand their businesses. I honor these hard-working entrepreneurs who have served our country by joining my colleagues in recognizing this week, the week of November 4, as National Veterans Small Business Week.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
