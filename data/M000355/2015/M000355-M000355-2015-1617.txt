 President, it is my hope the logjam on this bill, which seems to have developed today, will be broken tomorrow and that we can begin to consider amendments under a fair and open process, which is what we would like to do on this measure that came out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously.  Chairman Grassley and Senator Cornyn have been here all day trying to work through amendments, and there are a number on our side in the queue and ready to go.                          ____________________
