 Lud ably served in our Congress from 1955 to 1981, a career that spanned a quarter century, after he returned home as a corporal in the Army during World War II, serving in the Pacific theater.  As the Toledo Blade editorial reminds us, ``The late Senator Edward Kennedy once said: 'Americans sleep in better housing today because of Lud Ashley.''' As chair of the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development, Lud led America in urban and small town revitalization, improving our condition as a society a home and block at a time. He voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and authored many pieces of legislation to rebuild America following the civil rights movement of that period.  In 1977, Mr. Ashley was selected by his beloved friend and Speaker, Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill, to lead the House in the first ad hoc Energy Committee after the first Middle East oil embargo threw America into a deep recession. As Speaker O'Neill said at the time, ``Lud has a toughness and a never-say-die attitude, and who, when he was put on the first team, could run with the ball.''  Born on January 11, 1923, in Toledo, Lud was raised on Robinwood Avenue. He has been laid to rest nearby at Woodlawn Cemetery. He was the great grandson of James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio, who served before him from 1859-1869 and coauthored the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution outlawing slavery. In that tradition, Lud Ashley's legacy was his abiding spirit of equal justice that moved civil rights forward in the post-World War II era.  It is appropriate this Congress has honored both Congressmen in passing legislation that named the Federal courthouse at Toledo forever in their memory.  Our prayers go out to the Ashley family: to his daughter Lisa and sons Meredith and his wife Monica, to Mark, brother Charles, sister-in-law Gerry, and many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his wife, Kathleen.  Our citizenry in the 9th Congressional District shall miss his great intellect, dogged nature, and incredible sense of humor that lifted us all to carry forward.  Thank you, Thomas Ludlow Ashley.                 [From toledoBlade.com, June 16, 2010]     Congressman Known for Aiding Housing, Civil Rights Dies at 87                           (By Mark Zaborney)       Thomas Ludlow ``Lud'' Ashley, a liberal Democrat who played      key roles in passing landmark civil rights, housing, and      anti-poverty legislation while representing Toledo in      Congress for more than a quarter century, died yesterday of      melanoma at his home in Leland, Mich. He was 87.       Mr. Ashley cut a large figure on national and local stages,      a genial good companion with a ready wit. He was colorful at      times but also a thoughtful, skilled legislator capable of      reconciling diverse interests to produce bills that would win      floor approval.       While a student at Yale University in the 1940s, he      befriended George H.W. Bush, and     the two remained close for more than 60 years. Yesterday,      former President Bush said in a statement that he and his      wife, Barbara, ``mourn the loss of a very close friend'' and      said Mr. Ashley ``might well have been my very best friend in      life.''       During Mr. Ashley's congressional tenure from 1955 to 1980,      he brought millions of dollars home to northwest Ohio.       On Capitol Hill, he was known as ``Mr. Housing,''      shepherding America's public-housing programs through      Congress in the 1960s and 1970s--including more than $15      million in public-housing units across Lucas County.       Through his efforts, Toledo was one of the first 30 cities      in which food stamps were distributed to the poor.       With more than $11 million he secured, the Port of Toledo      was dredged and improved, creating one of the nation's      leading ports.       ``It seemed like when the city needed the money, Lud      would come through,'' Harry Kessler, Toledo's mayor from      1971-77 and now deceased, told The Blade in 1997.       Mr. Ashley's son Meredith, of Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., said      yesterday that of all his father's Washington achievements,      the lawmaker was proudest of what he did to help Toledo.       ``There was a lot of national legislation that Dad was      really proud of, but there was nothing he was more proud of      than scoring that $11 million grant for downtown Toledo,'' he      said.       Known universally as ``Lud,'' Mr. Ashley was the 26th man      to represent the 9th Congressional District in the House.      Until his defeat in 1980, he served the district longer than      anyone before him.       His great-grandfather James M. Ashley represented Toledo in      Congress from 1859-69 as a Republican, having left the      Democratic Party because of his anti-slavery beliefs.       The federal courthouse in downtown Toledo was named the      James M. and Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley United States Courthouse      by an act of Congress two years ago. President George W. Bush      signed the measure, which had been sponsored by U.S. Rep.      Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo), in a private White House ceremony,      and the official renaming was held in Toledo on June 3, less      than two weeks ago.       Miss Kaptur, who with her re-election in 2008 surpassed Lud      Ashley's record for representing Toledo the longest in      Congress, said yesterday that ``Lud Ashley gave true meaning      to the term `public servant.' He followed admirably in the      footsteps of his abolitionist great-grandfather, James,      putting his genius to work in another tumultuous time and      helping pass the momentous 1964 Civil Rights Act.''       James Ashley's co-authorship of the 13th Amendment, which      abolished slavery, and his great-grandson's work on the      Housing and Community Development Acts of 1974 and 1977      ``reflect the Ashley family's place in history on the scales      of justice and equality for all people,'' Miss Kaptur said.       Mr. Ashley had been a resident in recent years of Leland,      Mich., near Traverse City, but noted in 2008 that his great-     grandfather chose to settle in Toledo.       ``It's where he was buried, and where I'm going to be      buried,'' Mr. Ashley told The Blade. ``Toledo's home.''       Mr. Ashley was first elected to Congress in 1954, defeating      incumbent Frazier Reams, Sr., an independent, in a three-way      race. He proved a redoubtable vote-getter over the years,      dispatching some of the best opponents the Republican Party      could muster.       He rose to a position of leadership in the House of      Representatives, becoming a close ally and personal friend of      House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, Jr.       In 1977, Mr. O'Neill named Mr. Ashley chairman of a special      committee created to handle a package of bills submitted by      President Jimmy Carter to deal with the energy crisis.       When energy legislation cleared Congress more than a year      later, Mr. O'Neill sent Mr. Ashley a letter of praise.       ``Somebody said that it couldn't be done, but they didn't      know that Tip O'Neill had a friend who had knowledge,      ability, toughness, and a never-say-die attitude, and who,      when he was put on the first team, could run with the ball,''      the House Speaker wrote.       There were other instances of political courage.       In 1959, more than a decade before President Richard      Nixon's landmark visit to the People's Republic of China, Mr.      Ashley was one of two House members to openly support that      nation's admission to the United Nations.       In 1961, he was one of only six congressmen who voted to      cut off funds for the House Un-American Activities Committee.       Mr. Ashley also became a senior and influential member of      three permanent House committees: budget; banking, finance,      and urban affairs; and merchant marine and fisheries, serving      briefly in 1980 as chairman of the latter panel.       Mr. Ashley was known especially for his expertise in      housing and community development legislation.       He was chairman of the housing and community development      subcommittee of the House banking, finance, and urban affairs      committee, and much of the legislation dealing with urban      housing and development problems that was passed in the 1970s      bore his imprint.       In October, 1979, President Carter, at a White House      ceremony marking the anniversary of a community development      program, praised Mr. Ashley's legislative abilities.       ``He cares about people, and he is superb in his ability to      conceive legislative programs and have them passed by      Congress,'' President Carter said.       Mr. Ashley loyally supported Democratic presidents, but he      had good relations with President Gerald Ford, a Republican,      and many Republican members of Congress.       While Mr. Ashley and President George H.W. Bush were Yale      undergraduates, the two were tapped to be members of the      elite secret student society Skull and Bones. In an old stone      building owned by the society and known as the Tomb, the      members confessed deep secrets to one another as part of      their initiation.       ``It allowed us to come to know more about one another,''      Mr. Ashley told The Blade in 1997. And from that sprang a      lifelong friendship.       After Mr. Bush was elected president, Mr. Ashley spent many      days with him at Camp David and the White House, especially      in times of crisis.       In 1990, he went to Camp David to buck up the president      after his budget was spurned by Congress, leading to a      temporary shutdown of the federal government.       ``I have a lifetime of memories of friendship between those      two that stretch back to my youngest days,'' Meredith Ashley      said yesterday. ``We'd go up to Kennebunkport [Maine] during      the summer, well before he became vice president and      president, and nothing ever changed in their friendship after      he became vice president. If anything, their friendship got      stronger.''       Mr. Ashley joined Mr. Bush at the opening of the Bush      Presidential Library and Museum in Texas, where the Toledo      congressman's name appears prominently in biographies and      videos of the 41st president.       Mr. Ashley, born Jan. 11, 1923, to Alida and William      Ashley, was raised on Robinwood Avenue in the Old West End      and attended Glenwood Elementary School.       His father owned a small steel manufacturing firm on Tracy      Road and nearly lost his business during the Great      Depression. The business rebounded, and the family moved to      Front Street in Perrysburg. His parents sent their son to      Kent School in Kent, Conn., from 1939 to 1942.       His older brother William, the heir apparent to the Ashley      political legacy, was killed at age 22 in May, 1944, when his      Army bomber exploded during a training mission over      Massachusetts. All 10 aboard died.       Decades later, Mr. Ashley said he was greatly affected by      the loss. ``We were inseparable friends,'' Mr. Ashley said.       Mr. Ashley was a corporal in the Army during World War II,      serving in the Pacific Theater.       He graduated from Yale in 1948 and was associated with the      Toledo Publicity and Efficiency Commission that year.       Michael DiSalle, then mayor of Toledo and later governor of      Ohio, encouraged him to study law, and Mr. Ashley enrolled in      the University of Toledo law school. He later transferred to      Ohio State University, from which he received a law degree in      1951.       Mr. Ashley was hired to be a special projects coordinator      for Radio Free Europe and was stationed briefly in New York      City.       In 1954, Mr. DiSalle was looking for a candidate to      challenge Mr. Reams, the independent 9th District incumbent.      Mr. DiSalle provided Mr. Ashley with considerable advice and      aid. Mr. Ashley provided the energy and image in what was the      first local campaign to make extensive use of television. Mr.      Reams was defeated by 4,000 votes.       In 1980, when he was defeated by Republican challenger Ed      Weber, some political analysts linked it to the landslide      presidential victory of Ronald Reagan. But Mr. Ashley told      The Blade in 1997 that it was his own fault, saying it was      ``tough to get enthusiastic about another campaign. And      that's when you get beaten. I just didn't get the job done.''       Miss Kaptur defeated Mr. Weber in 1982.       Mr. Ashley was married twice. He and the former Margaret      Mary Sherman of Toledo married in August, 1956, in Manassas,      Va., but separated that fall.       In 1967, he married Kathleen Lucey, a graduate of      Georgetown University law school who'd begun working as an      assistant in his office in 1962.       Mr. Ashley was a student of history and politics with a      personal library that testified to those passions. He also      loved opera and gardening.       His decision to make Leland, Mich., his home came a few      years after the death of Kathleen in 1997.       Mr. Ashley was a member of the George H.W. Bush      Presidential Library Foundation at the time of his death and      earlier served on numerous other boards including those of      Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's two largest      mortgage lenders.       He is survived by sons Meredith (Monica) Ashley of Ho-Ho-     Kus, N.J., and Mark Ashley of Washington; daughter, Lise      Murphy of Washington; brother, Charles S. Ashley, and sister-     in-law Gerry Ashley, of Leland, and many nieces and nephews.       A reception for family and friends will be held from 3-6      p.m. Sunday in the Ashley home, 402 Mill St., Leland. A      memorial service will be held later in Washington and      interment will be in Toledo's Historic Woodlawn Cemetery.       The family requests that any donations be to the Leland      Township Library. Martinson Funeral Home is handling      arrangements.                                  ____                    Ashleys Served With Honor, Vigor                        (By James M. Ashley IV)       This Thursday, Toledo's new federal courthouse will be      dedicated to two men--both     past congressmen from our city, both named Ashley. I am proud      to claim kinship with both men.       James M. Ashley and Thomas Ludlow Ashley served their      constituencies and their country with vigor, honesty, and a      firm resolution to achieve what they saw as the best courses      of action for the people. They served our state for more than      16 percent of the time from when Ohio was admitted to the      United States in 1803 to the present day.       James Ashley served in Congress during the most difficult      period of our history, from 1859 through 1869--the era of      John Brown, the Civil War, and the impeachment of President      Andrew Johnson. He saw slavery firsthand while he worked on      riverboats in the South during his youth. He became a      passionate and dedicated abolitionist, working within the      Underground Railroad.       The turmoil of the decade before the Civil War led to the      formation of the Republican Party. Like Abraham Lincoln,      James Ashley was stirred into action by the growing national      emergency and ran for public office as a Republican. Both men      put their strongly held beliefs into action.       In Congress, James Ashley adamantly opposed secession and      any compromise on slavery. He worked zealously and skillfully      to make the emancipation of America's slaves a reality.      Expressing his hard-line outlook and frontier upbringing, he      proposed that a congressman who favored a slavery compromise      should be ``kicked by a steam Jackass from Washington to      Illinois.''       Such no-nonsense dedication was useful to Lincoln in his      efforts at emancipation. As president, Lincoln could not      express or overtly back anything that might weaken support      from border states or moderates within the Union. James      Ashley became Lincoln's go-to man in Congress.       When Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation during      the Civil War, it immediately freed only a few thousand      slaves. But it turned the war from a sectional struggle into      a crusade to free the millions of African-Americans who were      still held in bondage.       The stage was set for the Constitutional amendment that      would finally outlaw chattel slavery throughout the country,      forever. James Ashley focused on the complexities of      achieving necessary harmony within Congress to pass this      monumental amendment.       With help from the president, James Ashley garnered the      necessary votes and support. To those who wavered, Lincoln      stated that ``whatever Ashley had promised should be      performed.''       The Thirteenth Amendment, authored by James Ashley, became      the law of the land in 1865. ``Neither slavery nor      involuntary servitude'' without due process for crimes      committed would ever again stain America.       Thomas Ludlow Ashley, the abolitionist's great-grandson,      represented Toledo in Congress as a Democrat from 1955      through 1981. During that time, his influence and impact on      both Congress and this community grew immensely.       Toledo's ethnic blue-collar voters provided Lud Ashley's      power base during the latter part of the industrial heyday      the city enjoyed during the mid-20th century. But instead of      riding that wave of prosperity to become part of the      industrial establishment, he pursued a congressional career      noted for liberal causes.       ``I think probably one of the most lasting contributions      was my role in housing,'' Thomas Ashley said in retirement.      Sen. Edward Kennedy concurred: ``Americans sleep in better      homes today because of Lud Ashley.''       Thomas Ashley fought urban sprawl with legislation. He      warned his colleagues about the tremendous flight of      Americans to suburbs from the inner cities--a crushing fact      of national life in the 21st century.       Thomas Ashley's stance on civil rights, community block      grants, and enterprise tax zones contributed to his image as      an urban liberal. But the late Judge William Skow, a former      aide to the congressman, noted that he was a moderate on      fiscal issues.       Whatever the label, Thomas Ashley's career centered on      fighting racism and poverty. It was a natural extension of      his family legacy. Like James Ashley, he fought the good      fight.       James M. Ashley IV, of Maumee, is a senior lecturer in      sociology and anthropology at the University of Toledo. He is      a great-grandson of James M. Ashley and first cousin of      Thomas L. Ashley.                                  ____                          Thomas Ludlow Ashley       The late Sen. Edward Kennedy once said: ``Americans sleep      in better homes today because of Lud Ashley.'' He was right.       Mr. Ashley, the longtime Toledo congressman who died this      week at age 87, chaired a House committee on housing and      community development. For years, he worked hard to provide      federal grants to improve low and moderate-income housing      nationally, as well as close to home.       Thomas Ludlow Ashley also was important to and instrumental      in the development of the city where he was born, which he      represented in Congress from 1955 until 1981.       ``Lud'' Ashley was the great-grandson of James Ashley, who      settled in frontier Toledo, changed political parties because      of his opposition to slavery, and represented Toledo in      Congress during the Civil War. James Ashley was a co-author      of the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery. In that      tradition, his great-grandson sought to free Americans from      the squalor of terrible housing.       Lud Ashley served in the Pacific during World War II before      he attended Yale University. He and George H.W. Bush, who      would become President decades later, were classmates and      fellow members of the ultra-elite secret society Skull and      Bones. Though they were of different political parties, the      men remained longtime friends.       Mr. Ashley earned a law degree at Ohio State University and      worked for Radio Free Europe before he returned home in 1954      to campaign for Congress. He ousted independent Rep. Frazier      Reams, in part because of the support of the late Paul Block,      Jr., publisher of The Blade, who felt Toledo's interests      would be best represented by a member of Congress with ties      to a major political party.       During his career, Mr. Ashley landed millions of dollars      for public housing in Lucas County. He got a crucial $11      million to improve Toledo's port.       Late in his career, during the energy crisis of the 1970s,      Mr. Ashley was chairman of a special committee that      successfully steered through Congress a controversial package      of bills proposed by President Jimmy Carter that were      designed to reduce oil consumption.       That assignment won him some enemies in the auto industry      but high praise from then-House Speaker Thomas ``Tip''      O'Neill, who counted Mr. Ashley as a personal friend.       In 1980, Mr. Ashley was defeated for re-election by      Republican Ed Weber in a stunning upset. Mr. Ashley fell      victim to Ronald Reagan's landslide victory and huge negative      feeling against the Carter administration.       His death came days after the federal courthouse in Toledo      was renamed in both his and his great-grandfather's honor.      That tribute is appropriate.       When the energy bills were passed, Rep. Ashley knew the      legislation was unpopular with Jeep. But he responded: ``My      view is that my district elected me to represent, when called      upon, a wider national interest.''       That is who Thomas Ludlow Ashley was. As he is laid to rest      in his hometown, that is how Toldeo's congressman should be      remembered.                                  ____                   `Gracious' Right Label for Ashley       It always saddens me when a great warrior dies, and among      other things Lud Ashley was a warrior (``Congressman known      for aiding housing, civil rights dies at 87,'' June 16).       In the 1980 campaign, we debated at least six times.      Although an incumbent's strategy would usually be to deny the      opponent the public forum of a debate, Lud never failed to      accept any challenge.       Of course, he was well informed, and I believe our joint      appearances led to a clarification of the issues and opposing      viewpoints in an intelligent and civil manner that we don't      always see at election time.       Lud Ashley's name is etched in the history of Toledo and      Lucas County. For 26 years, he was an important member of the      liberal Democratic wing that controlled the House of      Representatives. Always a strong advocate of Toledo, he      brought millions of dollars to Toledo and the area during his      tenure in office.       He was a likable person, with good friends on both sides of      the aisle. At the time of his defeat, he was very gracious to      me. Two years later, at the time of my defeat, he was equally      gracious and considerate.       It is very fitting that the federal courthouse here is now      named for Lud Ashley and his great-grandfather James Ashley,      the Republican abolitionist congressman during the Civil War.     Ed Weber.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, June 16, 2010] Ohio Congressman and Public Housing Supporter Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley                                Dies at 87                          (By T. Rees Shapiro)       Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley, 87, a 13-term Ohio Democrat in the      U.S. House of Representatives who was chiefly known for his      work on housing and addressing the energy crisis of the      1970s, died of melanoma June 15 at his home in Leland, Mich.       Mr. Ashley--known colloquially as ``Lud''--served Ohio's      9th District, which includes Lucas County and the city of      Toledo, from 1955 to 1981.       As chairman of a House subcommittee on housing and      community development, Mr. Ashley was a key supporter of      legislation to provide federal grants to cities and counties      to improve low- and moderate-income housing.       ``Americans sleep in better homes today because of Lud      Ashley,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) once said of Mr.      Ashley's extensive work on low-income housing legislation.       In 1977, Mr. Ashley was appointed to an ad hoc energy      committee by House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr. (D-     Mass.), who said he picked Mr. Ashley because he had      ``toughness, and a never-say-die attitude, and who, when he      was put on the first team, could run with the ball.''       A year later, Mr. Ashley helped the 40-member bipartisan      group pass a series of energy bills aimed at reducing the      nation's use of oil and increasing the budget for research      into alternative energy sources.       Upon his appointment to the position, Mr. Ashley assured      critics that he would not be close to the automobile      industry. At the time, Toledo housed the headquarters of     many car-parts manufacturers and an American Motors plant      that produced Jeeps.       ``That district is a part of me,'' Mr. Ludlow told the New      York Times in 1977. ``It is responsible for the perspective I      bring with me. But my view is that my district elected me to      represent, when called upon, a larger national interest.''       Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was born Jan. 11, 1923, in      Toledo. His great-grandfather, James Mitchell Ashley, served      Ohio's 9th District from 1859 to 1869 as a Republican, having      switched from the Democratic Party because he was vehemently      opposed to slavery.       The elder Ashley co-authored the 13th Amendment abolishing      slavery and led the campaign to impeach President Andrew      Johnson, who he claimed had conspired to assassinate Abraham      Lincoln in order to assume the presidency. He was also      chairman of a committee on territories and helped choose the      names for Wyoming and Montana.       After Army service in the Pacific during World War II, the      younger Mr. Ashley graduated from Yale University in 1948. At      Yale, he became close friends with George H.W. Bush when they      were members of the Skull and Bones secret society.       He received a law degree from Ohio State University in 1951      and practiced law for a short time with his father before      moving to New York to work for Radio Free Europe.       Before losing his House seat in the Reagan landslide of      1980, the only time Mr. Ashley had come close to being      defeated was in 1974. The race occurred only months after      he'd been convicted of drunken driving and resisting arrest      in Toledo, and Mr. Ashley eked out a victory over his      Republican opponent by a margin of 3,500 votes.       Mr. Ashley directed federal funds toward his district,      including more than $15 million for public housing units and      $11 million for the improvement of the Port of Toledo. By an      act of Congress in recent years, the city's federal      courthouse was named in his and his great-grandfather's      honor.       His marriage to Margaret Mary Sherman ended in divorce. His      second wife, Kathleen Lucey Ashley, died in 1997.       He had two children from his first marriage; two children      from his second marriage; and a brother.
