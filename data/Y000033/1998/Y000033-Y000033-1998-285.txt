Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Glacier Bay National Park Boundary Adjustment Act of 1998. The legislation is a manifestation of efforts to make the construction and operation of a small hydro-electric facility near the city of Gustavus, Alaska, possible through a land exchange. The hydro project would be constructed and operated by Gustavus Electric Company, and is intended to benefit the city's residents by providing a cheap source of electricity as an alternative to using diesel-powered generators. The project could also supply low-cost power to the National Park Service facilities in Glacier Bay National Park.  An Act of Congress is necessary to allow the development of this hydro project. The project location is within designated wilderness of Glacier Bay National Park. Current law governing wilderness areas does not permit such construction and operation of hydro power facilities. The legislation I am introducing will provide for a land exchange in which the appropriate lands where the project is located are transferred to the State of Alaska, and the Park Service acquires State lands of equal value to compensate. Once the state acquires its lands under the exchange, construction of the facility will be possible.  To reflect an understanding among the parties to this exchange, this legislation requires that the proper environmental and economic analyses and licensing procedures of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission be followed prior to any transfer of lands. This stipulation assures the integrity of the lands and wildlife will be maintained before construction of the project may begin. In addition, the bill requires an exchange that is of equal value to the State and the federal government, and a ``no net loss'' of wilderness acreage.  The major provisions of this bill were negotiated by people most directly affected by the land exchange. It is therefore a local solution to a local problem.                          ____________________
