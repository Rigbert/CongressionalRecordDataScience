 President, I have introduced in the Senate a sense of the Senate amendment to the budget resolution to provide funds for a grant program to build new schools.  The goal of this amendment is to first, reduce the size of schools; and second, reduce the size of classes. The amendment would give the Senate's support for grant funding to enable states to build new schools.                              The Problem  Why do we need this amendment?  First, many of our schools are too big. In particular, schools in urban areas are huge. The ``shopping mall'' high school is all too common. ``It's not unusual to find high schools of 2,000, 3,000, or even 4,000 students and junior high schools of 1,500 or more, especially in urban school systems,'' writes Thomas Toch in the Washington Post. In these monstrous schools, the principal is just a disembodied voice over the public address system.  Second, another serious problem is that our classes are too big for effective learning and as public school enrollment soars, the problem will only worsen. Even though we have begun to reduce class sizes in my state, California still has highest pupil-teacher ratios in the nation, says the National Center for Education Statistics.                              The Solution  This amendment supports legislation providing flexibility in grant funding so that school districts can build new schools and reduce both school size and class size.  The U.S. Department of Education estimates that we need to build 6,000 new schools just to meet enrollment growth projections. This estimate does not take into account the need to cut class and school sizes. The needs are no doubt huge.                    California's Schools Are Too Big  My state that has some of the largest schools in the country. Here are some examples: Roosevelt High School, Fresno, 3,692 students; Clark Intermediate School, Clovis, 2,744 students; Berkeley High School, Berkeley, 3,025 students; Rosa Parks Elementary School, San Diego, 1,423 students; Zamorano Elementary School, San Diego, 1,424 students.  California also has some of the largest classes sizes in the nation. In 1996-1997, California had the second highest teacher-pupil ratio in the nation, at 22.8 students per teacher. Fortunately since 1996, the state has significantly cut class sizes in grades K-3, but 15 percent or 300,000 of our K-3 students have not benefitted from this reform. And students have grade 3 have not been touched.                       Examples of Large Classes  Here are some of the classes in my state: Fourth grade, statewide, 29 students; sixth grade, statewide, 29.5 students. National City Middle School San Diego, English and math, 34 to 36 students. Berryessa school District in San Jose--fourth grade, 32 students; eighth grade, 31 students. Long Beach and El Cajon School Districts, tenth grade English, 35 students. Santa Rose School District--fourth grade 32, students. San Diego City Schools, tenth grade biology, 38 students. Hoover Elementary and Knox Elementary in E. San Diego Elementary, grades 5 and 6, 31, to 33 students. Hoover High School 10th grade Algebra, 39 students.  To add the problem, California will have a school enrollment rate between 1997 and 2007 of 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 percent. We will have the largest enrollment increase of all states during the next ten years. By 2007, our enrollment will have increased by 3.3. percent. To put it another way, California needs to build seven new classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the surge in student enrollment. The California Department of Education says that we need to add about 327 schools over the next three years, just to keep pace with the projected growth.           Smaller Schools, Smaller Classes, Better Learning  Studies show that student achievement improves when school and class sizes are reduce.  The American Education Research Association says that the ideal high school size is between 600 and 900 students. Study after study shows that small schools have more learning, fewer discipline problems, lower dropout rates, higher levels of student participating, higher graduation rates (The School Administrator, October 1997). The nation's school administrators are calling for more personalized schools.  California's education reforms relied on a Tennessee study called Project STAR in which 6,500 kindergartners were put in 330 classes of different sizes. The students stayed in small classes for years and then returned to larger ones in the fourth grade. the test scores and behavior of students in the small classes were better than those of children in the larger classes. A similar 1997 study by Rand found that smaller classes benefit students from low-income families the most.  Take the example of Sandy Sutton, a teacher in Los Angeles's Hancock Park Elementary School. She used to have 32 students in her second grade class. In the fall of 1997, she had 20. She says she can spend more time on individualized reading instruction with each student. She can now more readily draw out shy children and more easily identify slow readers early in the school year.  The November 25, 1997, Sacramento Bee reported that when teachers in the San Juan Unified School Districts started spending more time with students, test scores rose and discipline problems and suspensions dropped. A San Juan teacher, Ralphene Lee, said, ``This is the most wonderful thing that has happened in education in my lifetime.''  A San Diego initiative to bring down class sizes found that smaller classes mean better classroom management; more individual instruction; more contact with parents; more time for team teaching; more diverse instructional methods; and a higher morale.  Teachers say that students in smaller classes pay better attention, ask more questions and have fewer discipline problems. Smaller schools and smaller classes make a difference, it is clear.                            Many Old Schools  Other amendments and other bills that I am supporting provide mechanisms to modernize old schools and we have many old schools. One third of the nation's 110,000 schools were built before World War II and only about one of 10 schools was built since 1980. More than one-third of the nation's existing schools are currently over 50 or more years old and need to be repaired or replaced. The General Accounting Office has said that nationally we need over $112 billion for construction and repairs to bring schools up to date.              California's School Building Needs Critical  My state needs $26 billion from 1998 to 2008 to modernize and repair existing schools and $8 billion to build schools to meet enrollment growth. In November 1998, California voters approved state bonds providing $6.5 billion for school construction.  In addition to the need to reduce school and class sizes, there are several key factors driving our need for school construction:  1. High Enrollment: California today has a K-12 public school enrollment at 5.6 million students which represents more students than 36 states have in total population, all ages. We have a lot of students.  Between 1998 and 2008, when the national enrollment will grow by 4 percent, in California, it will escalate by 15 percent, the largest increase in the nation. California's high school enrollment is projected to increase by 35.3 percent by 2007. Each year between 160,000 and 190,000 new students enter California classrooms. Approximately 920,000 students are expected to be admitted to schools in the state during that period, boosting total enrollment from 5.6 million to 6.8 million.  California needs to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per class between now and 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student population. By 2007, California will need 22,000 new classrooms. California needs to add about 327 schools over the next three years just to keep pace with the projected growth.  2. Crowding: Our students are crammed into every available space and in temporary buildings. Today, 20 percent of our students are in portable classrooms. There are 63,000 relocatable classrooms in use in 1998.  3. Old Schools: Sixty percent of California's schools are over 40 years old. 87 percent of the public schools need to upgrade and repair buildings, according to the General Accounting Office. Ron Ottinger, president of the San Diego Board of Education has said; ``Roofs are leaking, pipes are bursting and many classrooms cannot accommodate today's computer technology.''  4. High Costs: The cost of building a high school in California is almost twice the national cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in California, it is $27 million. In California, our costs are higher than other states in part because our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, floods, El Nino and a myriad of other natural disasters. California's state earthquake building standards add 3 to 4 percent to construction costs. Here's what it costs to build a schools in California: an elementary school (K-6), $5.2 million; a middle school (7-8), $12.0 million; a high school (9-12), $27.0 million.  5. Class Size Reduction: Our state, commendably, is reducing class sizes in grades K through 3, but this means we need more classrooms.  And so to exacerbate the need to build smaller schools and to reduce class sizes, our school districts are saddled with overwhelming construction demands.                               Conclusion  Big schools and big classes place a heavy burden on teachers and students. They create an impersonal learning environment.  The American public supports increased federal funding for school construction. The Rebuild American Coalition this month announced that 82 percent of Americans favor federal spending for school construction, up from 74 percent in a 1998 National education Association poll.  Every parents knows the importance of a small class where the teacher can give individualized attention to a student. Every parents knows the importance of the sense of a school community that can come with school.  I hope my colleagues will join me today in supporting this important education reform.                      federal anti-drug strategies
