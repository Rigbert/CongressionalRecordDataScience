 Mr. John Wood of Glasgow, KY, will be honored this month for his service in uniform to our country. Mr. Wood served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1941 to 1947, was present for the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and was there at the Battle of Midway Island just months after America entered World War II.  After his military service, Mr. Wood settled in Glasgow, where he worked as a radio broadcast engineer from 1949 to 1990. He is a true legend from the Greatest Generation who still has much to teach us younger folks.  This November 18, Mr. Wood will be honored at Glasgow City Hall. Also, local officials in Glasgow, Cave City, and Barren County will join with local veterans' organizations in Kentucky to proclaim November 20 as ``John Wood Day'' in Barren County. Coincidentally, on November 20, Mr. Wood will also turn 93 years old. I cannot think of a better tribute to this fine man's service than to recognize him on his birthday.  My fellow Kentuckians can turn out to see Mr. Wood when he serves as the Grand Marshal for the Cave City Christmas Parade later this year, and also as a featured guest in the Glasgow Christmas Parade. These will be wonderful community events to bring Kentuckians together to honor John Wood's service and to say thank you to all veterans in the Christmas spirit.  I know I speak for my colleagues in the U.S. Senate when I express gratitude to Mr. John Wood for his service to our great Nation. Kentucky is proud to have him in our midst. I want to wish him a very happy birthday, a happy John Wood Day, and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  Recently an article appeared in a Kentucky publication, the Sanford Herald, highlighting Mr. Wood's life of service. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Sanford Herald, November 9, 2013]                Marine Vet Recounts Pearl Harbor, Midway           John E. Wood Remembers his Service in the Pacific                           (By Anna Johnson)       Sanford.--When the first Imperial Japanese plane burst into      a ball of fire, John E. Wood thought he saw something else      fall toward the small Hawaiian island where he was stationed      in 1942.       ``I saw something drop from the plane,'' Wood said. ``I      thought at first he had bailed out. A little closer you could      tell it wasn't the pilot. It was a silver bomb.''       It was just a few seconds later when the bombs fell in      unison toward the Marine Corps 6th Defense Battalion,      destroying plane hangars, power stations, and a cluster of      above-ground fuel tanks near Wood.       ``I got half nauseated from the smoke and all of those guns      being fired,'' Wood said. ``There were fuel tanks burning.      The island was just, almost, engulfed with smoke. And then      the planes dropped all their bombs.''       Wood, a former Lee County resident, manned a .50-caliber      machine gun--``They were airplane guns, but they had mounts      so they could rotate''--when the Imperial Japanese planes      began to fly toward and over Midway Atoll on June 4, 1942.       ``We could see them off in the distance,'' Wood said. ``Two      or three planes would go down, a plume of smoke behind them.      Off the shore away, you'd see a splash when one would go down      We were ordered to fire when they got in range.''       One plane, tilting from damage to its left tail, came into      close range near Wood, giving them a close encounter with the      pilot.       ``He was dressed up,'' Wood said. ``He had a white shirt      and black coat and black tie. The gloves, he had white gloves      on his hands. Every gun there on through the center of the      island opened up on him. He was shot down.''       The Battle of Midway, a decisive victory for the United      States and a turning point in the Pacific theater during      World War II, came just six months after the attacks on Pearl      Harbor--a battle Wood witnessed, rifle in hand.                IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO FOR A LIVELIHOOD       Wood, 92, was born in Montgomery County, near Troy. He grew      up in Lee County with his parents, John Lee Wood and Nancy      Phillips Wood, and two brothers, Malphus and Thomas.       ``My first school was the old McIver Street School, and      Edna St. Clair was my teacher,'' he said. ``When I was      finished over at McIver Street, I started over at the high      school and that was in 1934.''       Wood spent two years in the Civilian Conservation Corps--a      public-relief program meant to relieve families who faced      difficulties during the Great Depression--before enlisting in      the Marine Corps in 1941.       ``I really didn't have anything else to do at the time,''      he said. ``At the time I enlisted, it was something to do for      a livelihood. And     I had a brother already in the Marine Corps.''       Wood joined the 4th Defense Battalion as a radio and radar      operator, traveling to Cuba, Panama, and along the west coast      of the United States. The day after his 21st birthday, aboard      the U.S.S. Henderson, Wood left San Diego and arrived at      Pearl Harbor on Dec. 1, 1941.       ``We were there a week when the Japanese attacked Pearl      Harbor and Hickam Field,'' he said.                              PEARL HARBOR       Wood was stationed two miles from the entrance of Pearl      Harbor at an unfinished Marine base. The battalion's rifles      were still crated up when Imperial planes began to fire.       ``We were still close enough to Pearl Harbor to see when      the Japanese planes began to attack,'' he said. ``In Hickam      Field we could see all the anti-aircraft fire being fired at      the planes down in the harbor area. All the smoke and anti-     aircraft fire burst around the planes.''       There were murmurs among the men about military maneuvers      or exercises that quickly evaporated when the first plane      burst into a fireball, streaking down, he said.       ``We got the call from the harbor that we were under      attack,'' Wood said. ``They tore the crates open, without any      regard if you got your own rifle. They gave us a bandolier      and told us to fire on anything that came into range. We got      our rifles but we weren't sure where we were going.''       Only one Japanese plane, possibly taking pictures, Wood      said, came near his group.       ``There was one Japanese plane that circled our camp area,      and he wasn't in range to be firing on,'' he said. ``But some      of the boys were firing rifles at it, and we did get a      machine gun, .50-caliber, and began firing at it, but the      plane was still too far away. It circled and went back in the      direction of Honolulu.''       There were no causalities or injures in the 4th battalion,      but more than 2,000 Americans lost their lives and another      1,000 were injured. Shots were fired over their heads, Wood      said, and they were forced into a nearby mess hall--a      military cafeteria--to avoid the gunfire.       ``It wasn't the Japanese,'' he said. ``It was our own      shells from some of our guns. We didn't know where it was      coming from . . . but I was lying there as close to the      ground as I could get and there was another boy lying eight      or 10 inches from my head. We both had our hands over our      heads, and finally they did quit firing and we just laid      there for a few seconds. We finally got the nerve to look up,      and we raised our heads at the same time. I looked at him,      and he looked at me. Neither of us spoke, but I noticed his      face was white as a sheet. I just wondered to myself if my      face was as white as his. That was my most uneasy moment of      it all.''       The next day, Wood listened to the declaration of war from      President Franklin Roosevelt and preparations began for his      15-month tour at Midway as part of the 6th Defense.       In 1943, he arrived home in Lee County sometime between 1      or 2 p.m., and said simply his parents were glad to see him.       ``I was kinda glad to get back home, too,'' Wood said.       He left the military in April 1947, moved to Kentucky and      worked at a radio station for more than 40 years. He married      the late Glindoln and had three children.       Wood comes back to Central Carolina almost every summer for      a family reunion, he said.       This Veterans Day, Wood said he'll be attending a ceremony      and meeting with the Kentucky Bluegrass Chapter of the Pearl      Harbor Survivors Association.       ``I do think being at both of those two places, well, they      are important events in the military history of our      country,'' Wood said. ``I do feel a little bit of pride for      being at both of those events.''                          ____________________
