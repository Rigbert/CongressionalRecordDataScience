Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to establish an African-American Museum on the mall, in Washington, D.C., as part of the Smithsonian Institution.  The story of black people in America has yet to be told in its entirety. African-American history is an integral part of our country, yet the richness and variety of that history is little-known and little-understood. As tourists from all over the world come to visit our Nation's Capital, they will not be able to learn the full history of black people in America. This museum represents a great opportunity--to showcase our history in its diversity and breadth, and to make the understanding of American history more complete.  Did you know that Dr. Daniel Hale Williams was a pioneering heart surgeon that played a vital role in the discovery of open-heart surgery? And that Ernest Everett Just, Percy Julian and George Washington Carver were all outstanding scientists? Educators such as W.E.B. DuBois and Benjamin E. Mays left an indelible mark on this country. The Harlem Renaissance produced poets, writers and musicians like Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes and Duke Ellington. The civil rights movement changed the face of this country and inspired movements toward democracy and justice all over the world--producing great leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Whitney Young. Too few people know that Benjamin Banneker, an outstanding mathematician, along with Pierre L'Enfant, designed the District of Columbia. There are many more and their stories must be told.  Until we understand the African-American story in its fullness and complexity, we cannot understand ourselves and our nation. We must know who we are and where we have come from so that we may move forward together. And we recognize the importance of all our people and all of our history. The establishment of the museum would be one important step toward achieving greater understanding as a nation and as a people.  It is my hope and prayer that as we preserve these important moments in history, we will inspire future generations to dream, to write, to march and to teach. As they are able to look back at all that has been accomplished, they will be able to look forward and believe in the future of our great country.  I am pleased and delighted that many of my colleagues have joined me in cosponsoring this bill. I urge all my colleagues of the 106th Congress to support this worthwhile and important legislation.                          ____________________
