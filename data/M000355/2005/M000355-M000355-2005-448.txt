 President, I first met Bill Frist 11 years ago when he was a world-renown heart transplant surgeon from the neighboring State of Tennessee. He was considering a career change to public service in the Senate. Then, as now, I believe he was one of the most gifted, hard-working, and honest people I had ever met. He is a bit of a rarity in this town. He has more talent and less ego than almost anyone I can think of.  There has been this question raised about the sale of some stock. Of course, a bit lost in this dustup is the simple fact that the Senate Ethics Committee preapproved the sale. However, this is Washington, and sometimes even honest actions are questioned.  I have absolutely no doubt that the facts will demonstrate that Senator Frist acted in the most professional and the most ethical manner, as he has throughout his distinguished medical and Senate career.  Senator Frist has been clear that he welcomes the opportunity to meet with the appropriate authorities and put this situation in its proper context as a completely--a completely--appropriate transaction.  Furthermore, Senator Frist has my full and unconditional support. He is a great majority leader. I find myself agreeing with my good friend from Nevada, the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, who said he knew Senator Frist would not do anything wrong. Senator Reid has it right.  Finally, I think there are few settled facts in this contentious capital of ours, but there is one fact of which I am completely certain: Bill Frist is a decent, honest, hard-working man who puts public service before private gain.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
