 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Let us be clear what this is about. This is not about saving the family farm. This is not about protecting small business. This is about over a 10-year period giving $160 billion in tax relief to the richest 2 percent of the population. Ninety-eight percent of the people get nothing.  What these folks are trying to do by running up huge deficits and a huge national debt is to end up cutting back disastrously on Medicare, Medicaid, education, and veterans' protection. No money to ease the waiting lines at VA hospitals all over America, but $180 billion for the richest 2 percent of the population.  This is an insult to the middle class and to the working families of this country. It should be defeated.
