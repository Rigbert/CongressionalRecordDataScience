We are sent many books and some of them I have a chance to glance at. This is the recent one I received, entitled ``Bend the Health Care Trend.'' They have here information which says: American health care spending reached $2.4 trillion in 2008 and will exceed $4 trillion by 2018. We expect a doubling of basic health insurance premiums in 8 to 10 years, and we know what you just described is reality. Even businesses owned by a couple, a husband and wife, are finding themselves not only unable to provide health insurance for their employees, because of its cost, they can't cover themselves.  I had a friend of mine, one of my boyhood friends, I grew up with him and his wife. His small business had one of their employees under the health insurance plan, and his wife had a baby with a serious illness. As a result, their premiums went through the roof. He had to cancel his group health insurance. He had to cancel the insurance he gave to his employees. He gave his employees the $300 a month, whatever itwas they were paying, and said: We are all on our own now. We have to go in the private market. The couple with the sick baby couldn't find any health insurance. My friend, who was in his 60s, and his wife are in a pitched battle every year about how much they have to pay for health insurance and the company, the only one that will cover them, each year excludes whatever they turned a claim in for last year. So that is the reality of health insurance for small businesses.  I also want to tell my friend from Vermont, about one-third of all realtors in America are uninsured, have no health insurance. They are independent contractors, and they have no health insurance, one out of three.
