 President, I am placing this language in the Record because I have been given reason to believe that some very different language will appear in the omnibus appropriations act, once it is actually filed.  A lot of credit belongs to Chairman Istook, Chairman Stevens, and Chairman Shelby for allowing the conferees on the Transportation/Treasury bill to work through the issues and develop our original compromise.  When I left the Capitol building late in the evening on Wednesday, November 12, all the conferees expected that compromise to be incorporated into the conference agreement on the Transportation/Treasury bill that was to be filed the next day. Each and every Senator, Republican and Democrat, that participated in that conference agreement was content with the compromise and signed the conference report. What has happened since then has been one of the most astonishing and deplorable process that I have ever witnessed in my 11 years in the Senate.  When the Bush White House learned that the conferees decided to insist upon a level playing field and some demonstration of taxpayer benefits for Federal jobs to be contracted out, they began a quiet but relentless campaign to the gut the compromise. Despite the fact that the conference committee adjourned well over a week and a half ago, the White House has seen to it that the bipartisan conference agreement has not been filed in either the House or Senate while they work to emasculate the compromise.  The administration's alternative language makes their true motives clear. One language change that the Bush administration has been promoting would effectively eliminate the requirement that the administration demonstrate any cost savings before throwing Federal employees out onto the unemployment line. Indeed, the loophole language they are promoting would allow them to award Federal work to private contractors even if the contractor's costs are considerably higher than letting Federal employees keep the work.  Could it be that we are seeing yet another attempt by the Bush/Cheney administration to use Federally appropriated resources to reward their friends?  I am told that the administration has even voiced reservations about the language in our compromise prohibiting Federal jobs from being shipped overseas. Where does it stop.  This administration seems to see no problem with senior citizens picking up a phone to call Social Security Administration and the phone being answered by a Federal contractor in India--and it could actually cost taxpayers more. That's absurd.  On another provision, the administration is objecting to language allowing Federal employees to put forward their best and most efficient bid in order to keep their jobs. Why? Because the administration doesn't want Federal employees to retain this work no matter what the benefit to the taxpayer.  This is the first year that I have served as the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing these government-wide procurement issues. Over the course of this year, I have been increasingly appalled by the disrespect and disdain that the Bush administration holds for the thousands of Americans that come to work for our Government every day.  As of today, I regret to inform the Senate that the Bush administration appears to be making meaningful progress in its campaign to gut the bipartisan compromise that was agreed to as part of the Transportation/Treasury conference.  My subcommittee staff was present with language that was intended to be included in the omnibus appropriations bill. That language guts our original compromise in three fundamental ways.  First, the rules included in the Transportation/Treasury bill will no longer apply to all Federal agencies. They will only apply to the agencies funded in the Transportation/Treasury bill. So these provisions will apply only to jobs being contracted out in the Department of Transportation, the Treasury Department, the General Services Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and a few smaller, related agencies.  None of these protections will apply to the hundreds of thousands of employees in the other major Federal civilian agencies, such as the State Department, Commerce Department, Agriculture Department, Labor Department, and the Health and Human Services Department. There will be a distinctly different set of rules for jobs in the Department of the Interior and still different rules for jobs in the Department of Defense.  This makes a sham of our Federal contracting-out policy, but the Bush administration certainly doesn't seem to care.  The first major change is in the scope of the agreement. Instead of applying to all civilian agencies, it would just apply to a few. The second major change undermines the fairness of our agreement. The language being slipped into the omnibus bill would now deny Federal employees the legal standing to appeal a wrongful decision to contract out their jobs. Under current regulations, only contractors can appeal a decision that doesn't go their way. Federal employees who are losing their jobs have no such right.  The administration obviously does not want its decision to ever face a truly fair appeals process.  The third major change effectively eliminates the requirement that there be any meaningful cost savings to the taxpayer before jobs are contracted out. That is deplorable.  No wonder the Bush administration will only push for these changes in back rooms.  I think this result is bad enough. However, I am now being told that the administration has not given up on weakening our provision even further.  As I stand here today, the conference agreement on the omnibus appropriations bill, including the Transportation/Treasury section, has still not been filed. The back-room dealing continues and the basic principle of fairness and respect for our Federal employees continues to be under attack.  I have to say that in my many years on the Appropriations Committee, I have never witnessed such a cynical effort to undermine a fair and equitable conference agreement.  I want to emphasize that it is not the fault of Chairman Istook, Chairman Shelby, Chairman Stevens, Chairman Young, or any of the other members of the Transportation/Treasury conference. Those honorable gentlemen reached a deal at the conference room table and, I believe, had every intention of standing by our compromise.  This attack on Federal workers, on fairness and on taxpayers has only one source--the administration of George Bush. It is the White House that is keeping our compromise from being enacted--or even filed--so that the American public can read and understand it.  Next year, I hope that our Transportation/Treasury Subcommittee will hold hearings with the appropriate administration officials so that they can explain to us why it is so important to them to deny Federal employees even the most basic rights when competing to keep their jobs. I hope they will explain why it is important to the Bush administration that different Federal workers be subjected to a hodgepodge of differing rules depending on where they work. Perhaps they could also explain why they think it is appropriate that only contractors--and not Federal employees--have the right to appeal a ``contracting out'' decision.  This issue will not go away. I can guarantee you that efforts will be made on next year's Transportation/Treasury bill to rectify this situation and restore a government-wide policy based on fairness and savings for the taxpayer.  I only hope the Bush administration will have the decency to articulate its position before the public--and on paper--rather than in the back rooms in the dark of night.                               Exhibit 1      final a-76 compromise language for conference report on the   transportation, treasury and independent agencies appropriations act       Sec. 7  .
