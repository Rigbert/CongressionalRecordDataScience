Chair, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding and support his amendment strongly. It strikes a harmful provision that prevents the Corps from addressing deficiencies in regulatory uncertainties related to Clean Water Act regulations. Without this amendment, the bill would contribute to delays, uncertainty, and increased costs both for the government, for companies, and individuals who discharge into wetlands, streams, lakes, and other waters.  It will increase delays in the implementation of important public works projects and lead to protracted litigation on the disparity between existingFederal regulations and two Supreme Court decisions.  The provision that this amendment strikes does not apply to just this year. It applies to any subsequent Energy and Water Development Act precluding potential changes that may be necessary to protect public health and the environment, and ensuring that uncertainty continues indefinitely.  I believe the amendment allows the Corps the needed flexibility to deal with the confusion that has surrounded Clean Water Act jurisdiction in the wake of the two Supreme Court decisions, and we should be allowing the Corps to take actions that address the Supreme Court's ruling, bringing clarity and certainty to the regulatory process, not prolonging the confusion.                              {time}  1845  If this amendment is not passed, it could mean an estimated one-fifth of wetlands and 2 million miles of small streams will not be protected.  I urge my colleagues to support the Beyer amendment. Freshwater is a precious resource, one which should be protected in the best scientific manner possible. We owe it to future generations.
