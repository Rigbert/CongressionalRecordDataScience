H.R. 910 does not impact asthma. Frankly, our side would have liked to have debated this amendment. It was not offered to the Rules Committee. It was offered in committee, where it was rejected on a voice vote.  If you read the endangerment finding, you will see that asthma is mentioned one time. As to asthma, EPA's endangerment finding refers only once to the term ``asthma,'' and then only in the context of wildfires and particulate matter which is already regulated. So it doesn't change that.  If you care about jobs, you are going to vote ``yes'' on the bill. If you care about not increasing gas prices beyond $4, where they are in much of the country today, you will vote for the bill, which means you ought to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and ``yes'' on final passage.  The Clean Air Act regulates 188 different pollutants. H.R. 910 doesn't change one of those. So please, my colleagues, vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and ``yes'' on final passage.  I yield back the balance of my time.
