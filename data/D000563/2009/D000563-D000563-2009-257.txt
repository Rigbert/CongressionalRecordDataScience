Those left in Medicare are sicker and more expensive, so the government-run program ends up being more expensive because those private health insurance companies cherry-pick out the healthiest people they can find.  There are those who want to defend Medicare Advantage who think it is great that we would pay $170 billion in subsidies to these companies over a 10-year period of time. This bill moves us away from that and says if these private health insurance companies can't basically compete and match what government Medicare offers, then it is time for them to get out of the business and get out of the way. I don't see why in the world we are arguing about a subsidy for private health insurance companies when they already make so much money.  So I would at this point yield the floor. I know Senator Hatch has asked for an hour to speak on his motion. I believe it is a motion to commit. I yield the floor.
