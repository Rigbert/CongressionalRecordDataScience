President, it is a pleasure to stand in support of this legislation. Senator Grassley and I have worked on it, but I want to give him the lion's share of the credit because this was his notion, his concept, and he has developed it into a very good piece of legislation.  We work closely together on these bankruptcy issues, and for those who are interested in bankruptcy stay tuned; there is more to follow. But I think you will find this bill noncontroversial and certainly one everyone should be able to support.  The bottom line here is whether or not you are dealing with a fraudulent conveyance. Someone in anticipation of bankruptcy may give away money and it is said by the court that you cannot do that; if you are going to give money away for nothing, then we aregoing to come back later on in the bankruptcy court and recover it. But Senator Grassley has pointed out, I think appropriately, the situation where people give money to a charity or a church, and he says that should be considered in a different category. And I agree. As he has mentioned in the opening statement, there is a limitation in the law of 15 percent of your annual income that can be given in this fashion. So we don't anticipate any type of abuse in this area.  I thank Senator Grassley. It is a pleasure to serve with him and work with him. We have more to follow on the bankruptcy issue, but I am anxious to encourage my Democratic colleagues today to join with us in voting for this legislation.
