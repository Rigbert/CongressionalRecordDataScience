Speaker, two additional issues: campaign finance legislation, or Pence-Wynn, and CAFTA. Can the leader give us any thoughts as to when those might be considered as it relates to the July 4 break?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, as far as campaign finance reform legislation, we have no plans right now to consider any legislation.  As far as the Central America Free Trade Agreement, the President has not transmitted any proposed agreement so we will not make any decisions about scheduling until he does.
