 President, I want to speak the common sense of Iowa to the Senator from the political machine of Chicago and to express a simple statement of fact: If, in fact, we had adopted the minority's budget, the Democrat budget, earlier this year, we would be facing the exact same increase in the debt ceiling now and by almost the same exact amount of money throughout the rest of the year. So it doesn't matter whether you are in the majority or we are, we would be doing about the same thing right now. So don't try to fool the people of America. You cannot do it even if you are from Chicago.
