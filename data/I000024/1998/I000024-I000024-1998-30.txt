President, I have been listening, as I have in years past, to the debate, to the eloquence of those dedicated individuals who feel so strongly about this issue, particularly the leadership of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the things he has said, the things he has stood for, and the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, and then Dr. Frist.  I hope people heard what Dr. Frist said because he really is the only one who truly is a professional, who truly understands what this is all about, who can articulate the pain that a small baby during the birth process feels when he is put to death in the very cruel way that this takes place.  As he described that procedure--the procedure of going under the cranium with scissors and opening it up with no anesthesia and the baby feeling that pain--something occurred to me: that those individuals who want to keep that procedure alive and keep it legal are the same ones who, if you did that to a dog, would be picketing your office.  I think somehow we have developed, in a perverted way, into a society, many of whom put a greater value on the lives of critters than on human life. I hope we change that today. I yield the floor.
