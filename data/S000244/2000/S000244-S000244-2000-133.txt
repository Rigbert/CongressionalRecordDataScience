Chairman, heaven rejoices when a sinner repents, and this amendment strikes language that the gentleman from Massachusetts added to the bill in committee. I commented at the time that I thought it was ill-advised to get the GAO involved in what amounted to a political debate over the budget. I am glad that the gentleman from Massachusetts has seen the light, and I hope that his amendment is adopted.
