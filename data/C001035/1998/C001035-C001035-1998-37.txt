President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, will hold a hearing entitled ``The Safety of Food Imports: From the Farm to the Table--A Case Study of Tainted Imported Fruit.'' This hearing is the second in a series of hearings the Subcommittee has scheduled as part of an in-depth investigation into the safety of food imports. The hearing will be a case study of an outbreak of Cyclospora associated with fresh raspberries imported into the United States from Central America. The outbreak of Cyclospora occurred in over 20 states across the country in 1996 and in 1997.  This hearing will take place on Thursday, July 9, 1998, at 9:30 a.m., in room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For further information, please contact Timothy J.
