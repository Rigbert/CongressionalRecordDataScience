 President, I see the Senator from West Virginia in the Chamber. I know he would like to speak. Any time he stands up, I will end my remarks and allow the Chair to recognize him.  I did want to add to the comments Senator Kennedy has made. I am very pleased that Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Kyl, and I have joined in authorizing this legislation. I am very proud that more than 60 of our colleagues have joined in cosponsoring it. I had a chance on Friday, along with the other Senators, to describe the legislation. I would like to make a few comments now.  I sincerely believe, in the wake of September 11, this is the most important bill this Senate can pass in terms of being able to begin to fix what is a very broken system and also to begin to change our priorities.  Our immigration policies have been in the past largely driven by our humanitarian and economic interests. That has changed today because we now realize that security of our borders is extraordinarily important and that our visa system, as a product of many errors and many instances in which it doesn't produce the dividends that it was expected to produce for a lot of reasons, needs changing.  Before September 11, just over 300 U.S. Border Patrol agents were assigned to the job of detecting and intercepting illegal border crossers along our vast 4,000-mile United States-Canadian border. Nine hundred State Department consular officers were assigned to conduct background checks and issue visas to 6 million foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States in a whole host of capacities--as students, tourists, temporary workers, and as temporary visitors.  The State Department's policy was that consular officers did not have to perform extensive background checks for students coming from such terrorist-supporting states as Syria or Sudan. Only an intermediate background check was required for Iranian students. More extensive checks were required for students from Iraq and Libya.  Frontline agencies, such as the INS, were chronically understaffed, used obsolete data management systems, and had substantial management problems. We all knew that. Today, the INS does not have a reliable tracking system to determine how many of our visitors legitimately enter the United States and how many leave the country after their visas expire.  It almost seems effortless, the way the terrorists got into this country. They didn't have to slip into the country as stowaways on sea vessels or sneak through the borders evading Federal authorities. Most, if not all, appeared to have come in with temporary visas, which are routinely granted to tourists, students, and other short-term visitors to the United States.  Clearly, our guard was down. September 11 clearly pointed out other shortcomings of the immigration and visa system. Just the sheer volume of travelers to our country each year illustrates the need for an efficiently run and technologically advanced immigration system. Most people don't really realize how many people come into our country, how little we know about them, and whether they leave when they are required to leave.  Each year, we have over 300 million border crossings of individuals from other countries. For the most part, these individuals are legitimate visitors to our country. We currently have no way of tracking all of them. We had 30.4 million nonimmigrants enteringthe United States during one year, 1999. That is the most recent year for which INS has statistics. Now, 23 million of them entered as tourists on the visa waiver program--23 million from 28 different countries. No visas, little scrutiny, no knowledge where they go in the United States or whether they leave once their visas expire.  Another startling fact is that the INS estimates that over 100,000 blank passports have been stolen from government offices in participating countries in the visa waiver program in recent years. Now, why is that significant? Right now, countries that participate are not required to report information on missing passports. That will change under this bill. The number of passports reported stolen or lost by visa waiver countries is not always entered into the lookout database or entered in a timely manner. That, too, will change when this legislation is enacted.  Abuse of the visa waiver program poses threats to U.S. security and increases illegal immigration. These visas are often sold on the black market for as much as $7,500 per visa. Passports from visa waiver countries are often the document of choice for terrorists.  Consider this: Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian convicted of plotting to blow up the Los Angeles International Airport in 1999, trafficked in a number of these false passports, at least one of which was linked to a theft from a townhall in Belgium, a visa waiver country. In addition, two members of an al-Qaida cell who assassinated the Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud just before September 11 traveled from Brussels to London to Karachi on stolen Belgian passports. Mr. Robert Reid--the shoe bomber--had a visa from the United Kingdom, another visa waiver country. These are some of the problems our bill seeks to stop in the visa waiver program.  Each year, more than a half million foreign nationals enter with student visas. Most recently, 660,000 foreign students entered in the fall of 2001. That is just last fall. Within the last 10 years, 16,000 have come from such terrorist-supporting States as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, and Syria.  The foreign student visa system is one of the most underregulated systems we have today. We have seen bribes, bureaucracy, and many problems with this system that leave it wide open to abuse by terrorists and other criminals. For example, in the early and mid 1990s, in my own State of California, in the San Diego area, 5 officials at 4 California colleges were convicted of taking bribes, providing counterfeit education documents, and fraudulently applying for more than 100 foreign student visas. These are university officials in that area who practiced fraud and said students were there when they were not, and they falsified grades. They were convicted for doing so.  However, it is unclear what steps the Immigration and Naturalization Service took to find and deport the foreign nationals involved in that scheme. It has been all too clear to those of us on the committee--Senators Kennedy and Brownback on Immigration, and Senator Kyl and I on the Technology and Terrorist Subcommittee--that without an adequate tracking system, our country becomes a sieve, which is what it is today, creating ample opportunities for terrorists to enter and establish their operations without detection.  Consider these facts:  On May 28, 2001--last May--11 months ago, a criminal warrant was issued for Mohamed Atta's arrest in Broward County, FL, after he failed to appear in court for a traffic violation. On July 5, Atta was pulled over for speeding in Palm Beach, FL. At that time, the officer conducted a criminal search on Atta and found no outstanding warrants. After a trip to Spain, in which he allegedly met with coconspirators, Atta entered the United States for the final time--that was on July 19--despite past illegal incidents and the fact that his name was on a terrorist watch list. Instead, Atta was allowed into the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor after informing an INS officer that he had applied for a student visa.  One of the hijackers entered on a student visa and, though he never showed up for classes, was never reported because the INS stopped taking such reports in 1988. In other words, the INS doesn't even take reports if you don't show up for class when you come in on a foreign student visa.  In December 1999, Ahmed Ressam, otherwise known as the ``millennium bomber,'' crossed the northern border into the United States with the intent to bomb Los Angeles International Airport. He presented a legitimate Canadian passport under the name Benny Norris, and a computer check of Norris showed no reason to detain him.  However, had they checked the name Ahmed Ressam, they would have found that Ressam had been arrested four times in Canada, had a pending warrant for deportation, and was being investigated by the French and Canadian Governments for being a terrorist. It was only because a U.S. Customs agent in Port Angeles, WA, voiced suspicions about his demeanor, causing Ressam to flee on foot, that Ressam was then arrested.  This man had an extensive criminal record and terrorist ties. Yet there was no data system to supply the Border Patrol with such crucial information.  Clearly, existing technologies that employed biometric identifiers could have been used to uncover Ressam's criminal background even though he had used a false name. We do this in our bill.  We must make it more difficult for foreign visitors to enter our country using false identification and take sufficient steps to combat and prevent identification and visa fraud.  The world might well be in an electronic age, but agencies such as the INS are still struggling with the paper-bound, bureaucratic system. Even in instances where technological leaps have been made, like the issuance of more than 4.5 million smart border crossing cards with biometric data, the technology is still not being used. In other words, we appropriated the money, 4.5 million of these technologically superior cards were issued, but INS never put in the laser reading systems.  According to the Department of Justice inspector general, INS has approximately 100 different automated information systems for each function of the agency. Few of these systems talk to each other. This is a stark reminder of how much work needs to be done to fix our broken immigration system.  By now, we are all aware of the various proposals that have emerged to restructure or dismantle the INS. While restructuring the INS is certainly an idea worth examining, the most immediate need today is for Congress to enact this legislation because restructuring it is not going to cure any of the problems we address in this legislation. Restructuring it does not provide additional inspectors, does not provide additional border patrol, does not provide for an interoperable database system, does not provide for visa waiver reform, does not provide for student visa oversight monitoring and tracking.  Our bill would do just these things. It attempts to transform agencies, such as the INS, from a paper-driven bureaucracy to one that better manages its mission by upgraded information management and sharing systems. It would enable the INS and consular offices to access vital intelligence information in real time before they issue visas and permit entry to the United States.  The INS has often argued that it did not have sufficient intelligence to prevent the terrorists from entering the United States. However, this failure of intelligence information does not explain why the INS would admit at least three terrorists who clearly were inadmissible at the time they were permitted to enter the country.  Last year, in the subcommittee that I chair and on which Senator Kyl is the ranking member, we heard the testimony of Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, Mary Ryan. She testified that the consular staff felt terrible because they had granted visas to some of the 19 terrorists. At least three of the hijackers, including Mohamed Atta, the alleged ringleader, had stayed in the United States longer than authorized on their previous visits, making their visas invalid. Because the consular officers had no information on these individuals, they had no reason at the time to deny the visas.  If the INS had a system in place to identify visa overstayers, this might have enabled both the State Department to further investigate the backgrounds of the terrorists and the INSinspectors to enforce the law by stopping these terrorists before they entered the country.  The INS should have had the information at their disposal. They either did not collect the information or they did not have the means for the INS inspectors on the front lines to access it.  In the wake of September 11, we know the chances of another terrorist attack are great, and we know it is unconscionable for our systems to allow entry of another terrorist into the United States. Unless we move on this bill, we cannot possibly remedy the faults in our system.  The legislation would require the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to issue machine readable, tamper resistant visas that use standardized biometric identifiers. This in itself is a big improvement. I myself have visited streets where in a half hour, one can buy a green card that certainly no layperson can tell the difference between a forged green card produced on this street in Los Angeles and a real green card.  Our bill allows INS inspectors at ports of entry to determine whether a visa properly identifies a visa holder and, thus, combats identity fraud.  Second, it will make visas harder to counterfeit.  Third, in conjunction with the installation of scanners at all ports of entries to read the visas, the INS can track the arrival and departure of aliens and more reliably identify aliens who overstay their visas.  The bill also provides that aliens from countries that sponsor international terrorism cannot receive nonimmigrant visas unless the Attorney General and the Secretary of State determine that they do not pose a threat to the safety of Americans or the national security of our country.  American embassies and consulates abroad will be required to establish terrorist lookout committees that meet monthly to ensure that the names of known terrorists are routinely and consistently brought to the attention of consular officials, our Nation's first line of defense.  The bill contains a number of other related provisions as well, but the gist of the legislation is this: Where we can provide law enforcement, more information about potentially dangerous foreign nationals, we do so. Where we can reform our border crossing system to weed out or deter terrorists and others who would do us harm, we do so. And where we can update technology to meet the demands of the modern war against terror, we do that as well.  As we prepare to modify our immigration system, we must be sure to enact changes that are realistic and feasible. We must also provide the necessary tools to implement them.  The legislation Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Kyl, and I have crafted is an important and strong first step, but this is only the beginning of a long, difficult process.  As the Senator from West Virginia has pointed out, this legislation is only as good as the appropriations that follow forthwith. The annual cost is about $1.1 billion. The 3-year cost is about $3.5 billion. This leaves for this year about $753 million that we will have to come up with to meet the cost of the first year. My understanding is that this money is available in unallocated dollars, but that, of course, has to be checked out, or we should take it from another source.  I guess the biggest assurance I can give, as a lowly appropriator, to the distinguished powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is I will do my level best to lobby my colleagues to produce the money and, with whatever influence I probably do not have with the administration, try to influence the administration, as well, because I truly believe if we are to protect our people, this bill is a prerequisite. Unless we tighten up our loopholes and provide the funding for the technology we need, we are going to be nowhere. That is not to say that a terrorist still cannot come in, but it is to say we can make it very much more difficult for them.  So I conclude by saying that for some time many of us have been calling for reforms of our visa and border security system. We should have acted in 1993. We did not, and that left us vulnerable to the events of September 11. We are now in a position where we are reacting to this latest tragedy, and I think it is really important we act now to get this legislation on the books. Then it is up to each and every one of us to do everything we possibly can to see that it is funded promptly and, more importantly, for the Immigration Subcommittee to really exercise oversight over the INS and oversight over the Consular Affairs Division of the State Department to see that the necessary reforms do get put in place with respect to the visa system.  There is not much else I can say, but I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, without going through it again because I went through it on Friday, a summary of the bill and also some critical statistics on the number of people coming into our country, and particularly the specific status under which they come and the loopholes that exist.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001--Facts and                                Statistics                   foreign-born in the united states       An estimated 30 million foreign-born residents lived in the      U.S. in 2000.       Between 8 and 9 million are residents without legal status      (i.e., either they entered illegally or overstayed a      temporary visa)--40 percent of that total were visa      overstays.       30.4 million nonimmigrants entered the U.S. during 1999      (the most recent year for which the INS has statistics)--23      million of them entered as tourists on the Visa Waiver      Program (according to State Department statistics); 6 million      of them were issued nonimmigrant visas as students, tourists,      temporary workers and other temporary visitors (only 900      State Department consular officers, mostly junior staff, are      assigned to issue these visas and conduct background checks);      and 660,000 were foreign students who had entered in Fall      2001.                            Foreign students       660,000 foreign nationals held student visas in Fall 2001--     more than 10,000 enrolled in flight training, trade schools      and other non-academic programs; and more than 16,000 came      from terrorist supporting countries.       Some 74,000 U.S. schools are allowed to admit foreign      students, but checks of the schools on the current INS list      found that some had closed; others had never existed.       Exactly six months after the 9/11 attacks, Huffman Aviation      in Venice, Fla. received student visa approval forms for      Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi. The men were aboard      separate hijacked planes that struck the World Trade Center      towers, killing thousands.                          visa waiver program       23 million foreign visitors enter the U.S. each year under      the Visa Waiver Program.       There are now 28 countries that are included in the      program.       Earlier this year, Argentina was dropped from the program      because of the country's political and economic instability.                       Current Inspections System       Because visitors traveling to the U.S. under the Visa      Waiver Program do not need a visa to enter the U.S., INS      inspectors at U.S. ports of entry are the principle means of      preventing unlawful entry of individuals from one of the 28      countries.       The primary tool available to INS inspectors during the      inspections process is the Interagency Border Inspection      System, known as IBIS, which allows INS inspectors to search      a variety of databases containing records and lookouts of      individuals of particular concern to the U.S.       A 1999 Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report found,      however, that INS inspectors at U.S. ports of entry were not      consistently checking passport numbers in IBIS.       INS officers also failed to enter lost or stolen passports      from visa waiver countries into IBIS in a timely, accurate or      consistent manner.       One senior INS official from Miami International Airport      told the OIG that he was not even aware of any INS policy      that required the entry of stolen passport numbers.                         Anti-fraud enforcement       In a report released in February 2002, the U.S. General      Accounting Office said that anti-fraud efforts at the INS are      ``fragmented and unfocused'' and that enforcement of      immigration laws remains a low priority.       The report found that the agency had only 40 jobs for      detecting fraud in 4 million applications for immigrant      benefits in the year 2000.                           national security       In FY 1999, the Department of State identified 291      potential nonimmigrants as inadmissible for security or      terrorist concerns.       Of that number, 101 aliens seeking nonimmigrant visas were      specifically identified for terrorists activities, but 35 of      them were able to overcome the ineligibility.       47 foreign-born individuals--including the 19 September      11th hijackers--have been charged, pled guilty or convicted      of involvement in terrorism on U.S. soil in the last 10      years.       41 of the 47 had been approved for a visa by an American      consulate overseas at some point. Thus, how we process visas      is critically important.       Only 3 entered without inspection (illegally) into the      United States and thereby avoided contact with an immigration      inspector at a point of entry.       This means that 44 of the 47 had contact with an inspector      at a point of entry.       Of the 47 terrorists, at least 13 had overstayed a      temporary visa at some point prior to taking part in      terrorist activity, including September 11th ring leader      Mohamed. Therefore, tracking visa overstays is therefore a      very important part of terrorism prevention.       The terrorists who entered on student visas took part in      the first attack on the Trade Center in 1993, the bombing of      U.S. embassy in Africa in 1998, and the attacks of September      11th. Therefore, how we process and track foreign students is      clearly important.       Some reports indicate that Khalid Al Midhar, who probably      flew American Airlines flight 77 into the Pentagon, was      identified as a terrorist by the CIA in January 2001, but his      name was not given to the watch list until August 2001.       Unfortunately, he had already reentered the United States      in July 2001. (I should point out that there is some debate      about exactly when the CIA identified him as a terrorist).       But, if it really did take the CIA several months to put      his name on the list as PBS' Frontline has reported, then      that is a serious problem because we might have stopped him      from entering the country had they shared this information      sooner. This speaks to the issue of sharing information      between federal agencies.                          Absconders/detainees       In December 2001, INS estimated that 314,000 foreigners who      have been ordered deported are at large.       More recent estimates released in March 2002 suggest that      there may be at least 425,000 such absconders.       At least 6,000 were identified as coming from countries      considered Al Qaeda strongholds.                        border agency statistics       There are 1,800 inspectors at ports of entry along U.S.      borders.       The Customers Service has 3,000 inspectors to check the 1.4      million people and 360,000 vehicles that cross the border      daily.       The 2,000-mile long Mexican border has 33 ports of entry      and 9,106 Border Patrol agents to guard them all.       In October 2001, there were 334 Border Patrol agents      assigned to the nearly 4,000-mile long northern border      between the U.S. and Canada. This number of agents cannot      cover all shifts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, leaving some      sections of the border open without coverage: The Office of      the Inspector General found that one northern border sector      had identified 65 smuggling corridors along the 300 miles of      border within its area of responsibility; and INS      intelligence officers have admitted that criminals along the      northern border monitor the Border Patrol's radio      communications and observe their actions and this enables      them to know the times when the fewest agents are on duty and      plan illegal actions accordingly.       350 million foreign nationals enter the U.S. each year.       The INS estimates that approximately 40 to 50 percent of      the illegal alien population entered the U.S. legally as      temporary visitors but simply failed to depart when required.       An estimated 40 percent of nonimmigrants overstay their      visas each year. 9 million illegal and 4 million visa      overstayers.                                  ____    The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act--Summary       The legislation would:       Create interoperable data system.--The Administration would      be required to develop and implement an interoperable law      enforcement and intelligence data system by October 26, 2003      to provide the INS and State Department immediate access to      relevant law enforcement and intelligence information.       The database would be accessible to foreign service      officers issuing visas, federal agents determining the      admissibility of aliens to the U.S. and law enforcement      officers investigating and identifying aliens. The bill also      prevents and protects against the misuse of such data.       Reform the visa waiver program.--The bill would require      that each country participating in the visa waiver program      issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable biometric passports      to its nationals by 2003.       Require the reporting of lost or stolen passports.--The INS      would be required to enter stolen or lost passport numbers      into the interoperable data system within 72 hours of      notification of loss or theft. And until that system is      established, the INS must enter that information into an      existing data system.       Require new requirements for passenger manifests.--All      commercial flights and vessels coming to the U.S. from      international ports must provide manifest information about      each passenger, crew member, and other occupant prior to      arrival. This section of the bill also eliminates the 45-     minute deadline to clear arriving passengers.       Require new travel document measures.--Requires all visas,      passports, and other travel documents to be fraud and tamper-     resistant and contain biometric data by October 26, 2003.       Increase scrutiny of nonimmigrants from certain      countries.--Prohibits the issuance of nonimmigrant visas to      nationals from countries designated as state sponsors of      international terrorism, unless the Secretary of State, after      consulting with the Attorney General and the heads of other      appropriate agencies, determines that the individuals pose no      safety or security threat to the United States.       Institute student visa reforms.--Reforms the student visa      process by:       Requiring the Attorney General to notify schools of the      students entry and requiring the schools to notify the INS if      a student has not reported to school within 30 days at the      beginning of an academic term. The monitoring program does      not, at present, collect such critical information as the      student's date of entry, port of entry, date of school      enrollment, date the student leaves school (e.g., graduates,      quits), and the degree program or field of study. That and      other significant information will not be collected.       Requiring the INS, in consultation with the State      Department, to monitor the various steps involved in      admitting foreign students and to notify the school of the      student's entry. It also requires the school to notify INS if      a student has not reported for school no more than 30 days      after the deadline for registering for classes.       Requiring the INS to conduct a periodic review of      educational institutions to monitor their compliance with      record-keeping and reporting requirements. If an institution      or programs fails to comply, their authorization to accept      foreign students may be revoked.       While the INS is currently responsible for reviewing the      compliance of educational institutions, such reviews have not      been done consistently in recent years and some schools are      not diligent in their record-keeping and reporting      responsibilities.       Increase more border personnel. This section authorizes an      increase of at least 1,000 INS inspectors, 1,000 INS      investigative personnel, 1,000 Customs Service inspectors,      and additional associated support staff in each of the fiscal      years 2002 through 2006 to be employed at either the northern      or southern border.       Increase INS pay and staffing. To help INS retain border      patrol officers and inspectors, this section would raise      their pay grade and permit the hiring of additional support      staff.       Enhance Border patrol and customs training. To enhance our      ability to identify and intercept would-be terrorists at the      border, funds are provided for the regular training of border      patrol, customs agents, and INS inspectors. In addition,      funds are provided to agencies staffing U.S. ports of entry      for continuing cross-training, to fully train inspectors in      using lookout databases and monitoring passenger traffic      patterns, and to expand the Carrier Consultant Program.       Improve State Department information and training. This      section authorized funding to improve the security features      of the Department of State's screening of visa applicants.      Improved security features include: better coordination of      international intelligence information; additional staff; and      continuous training of consular officers.               why is this immigration reform necessary?       Six months to the day after Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-     Shehhi flew planes into the World Trade Center, the      Immigration and Naturalization Service notified a Venice,      Florida, flight school that the two men had been approved for      student visas.       One week later, the INS discovered that four Pakistani      crewmen, four Pakistani nationals were reported missing after      an INS inspector had inappropriately allowed them to take      shore leave after a ship docked in the Norfork, Virginia      harbor.       On November 30, Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Browback and      Kyl introduced this bill to make sure these missteps do not      happen again. This bill would help prevent terrorists from      entering the United States by exploiting the loopholes in our      immigration system.       The House passed this bill by voice vote on December 19,      2001 and again on March 12, 2002. It is now time for the      Senate to act.                           Facts to consider       As many as 3.5 to 4 million tourists, students and others      legally entered the U.S. with visas, but later became illegal      immigrants by remaining in the country long after their visas      expire. The INS has acknowledged that the agency has no idea      where they are.       Each year, we have 350 million border crossings. For the      most part, these individuals are legitimate visitors to our      country. We currently have no way of tracking all of these      visitors.       47 foreign-born individuals--including the 19 September      11th hijackers--have been charged, plead guilty or convicted      of involvement in terrorism on U.S. soil in the last 10      years.       41 of the 47 had been approved for a visa by an American      consulate overseas at some point. Thus, how we process visas      is critically important.             Other serious problems that have come to light                            Foreign Students       Each year, more than 500,000 foreign nationals enter the      U.S. with foreign student visas.       Within the last ten years, 16,000 came from such terrorist      supporting states as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and Syria.       The foreign student visa program is severely under-     regulated. During the 2000-2001 academic year, 3,761 foreign      nationals from terrorist supporting countries were admitted      into the U.S. on student visas.       Before September 11th, the State Department did not perform      extensive background     checks for students coming from Syria or Sudan. An      intermediate background check is required for Iranian      students and more extensive checks are required for students      from Iraq and Libya.       Last year, the National Commission on Terrorism warned,      ``Of the large number of foreign students who come to this      country to study, there is a risk that a small minority may      exploit their student status to support terrorist activity.''       The problem is that the INS has no idea whether the      students are registered at the schools that sponsored them or      how many are in the United States today with expired visas.       Nor can the INS provide information on the number or the      type of institutions who are eligible to accept foreign      students into their academic programs. This type of      information is essential to INS and the Congress' ability to      exercise effective oversight over the visa program.                       Foreign Student Visa Fraud       In the early 1990s for example, five officials at four      California colleges, were convicted of taking bribes,      providing counterfeit education documents and fraudulently      applying for more than 100 foreign student visas.       When asked what steps the INS took to ensure that the      college would comply with the terms of the program in the      future, INS staff said no steps were taken. When asked about      the fate of the 100 foreign nationals who fraudulently      obtained foreign student visas, the INS had no idea.                              Visa Waiver       The Visa Waiver Program was designed to enable citizens      from 29 participating countries to travel to the U.S. without      having to first obtain visas for entry. Earlier this year,      Argentina was dropped from the program, so now there are 28      participating countries.       An estimated 23 million visitors enter the U.S. under this      program. This program has been subject to abuse and has, at      times, facilitated illegal entry because it eliminates the      need for visitors to obtain U.S. visas and allows them to      avoid the pre-screening that consular officers normally      perform on visa applicants.       As a result, checks by INS inspectors at U.S. ports of      entry become the chief and sometimes only means of preventing      illegal entry; INS inspectors have, on average, less than one      minute to check and decide on each visitor.       The INS has also estimated that over 100,000 blank      passports have been stolen from government offices in      participating countries in recent years.       Abuse of the Visa Waiver program poses threats to U.S.      national security and increases illegal immigration. For      example, one of the co-conspirators in the World Trade Center      bombing of 1993 deliberately chose to use a fraudulent      Swedish passport to attempt entry into the U.S. because of      Sweden's participation in the visa waiver program.               Information Sharing Among Federal Agencies       In a Judiciary Subcommittee hearing I held in September,      Mary Ryan, the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular      Affairs, said that the lack of information sharing is a      ``colossal intelligence failure'' and that the State      Department ``had no information on the terrorists from law      enforcement.''       Right now, our government agencies use different systems,      with different information and different formats, and they      often refuse to share that information with other agencies      within our government. This clearly, in view of September      11th, is no longer acceptable.       I am amazed that a person can apply for a visa and there is      no mechanism by which the FBI or CIA can enter a code into      the system to raise a red flag on individuals known to have      links to terrorist groups and pose a national threat.       In the Wake of September 11th, it is hard for me to fathom      how a terrorist might be permitted to enter the U.S. because      our government agencies aren't sharing information.       I am also concerned about the current structure of      information technology. An assessment made of the INS      management and investment of information technology by the      Department of Justice Inspector General revealed the INS      cannot ensure that the money it spends each year on      information technology will be able to support the service      and enforcement functions of the agency.       Nor is the agency's information adequately protected from      unauthorized access or service disruption. Moreover, the INS      currently uses to many different data bases, many of which do      not communicate with each other.       All these problems point to the dramatic need for change.  What the ``Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act'' does       This bill protects our nation's openness to newcomers while      at the same time adds some prudent steps to our immigration      policy to ensure that Americans are safe at home.       The bill's major provisions would:       Require the administration to create a computerized      database system giving INS and the State Department, which      issues visas, immediate access to law enforcement and      intelligence service information. One of the 19 hijackers,      Khalid Almidhar, may have appeared on a CIA watch list--well      before he entered the country--that information was not      shared with the INS.       Require U.S. universities and other educational      institutions to notify the INS if a foreign student has not      reported to school within 30 days of the start of the      academic term. Two of the 19 highjackers came to the United      States on student visas yet never showed up for class.       Tighten reporting requirements for the 500,000 people      admitted annually on student visas.       Force airlines and shipping companies to provide passenger      and crew manifests for every fight and ship originating at      international ports before they arrive in the United States.       Require the 28 countries taking part in the Visa Waiver      Program, which permits certain of their citizens to travel      here for up to 90 days without first obtaining visas, to      issue tamper-resistant biometric passports by 2003.       Prohibit the issuance of visas to nationals from countries      designated as state sponsors of international terrorism      unless they are carefully vetted and determined to pose no      security threat to the United States. Such countries      currently include Iraq, Iran, Syria. Libya, Cuba, North Korea      and Sudan.       Even if we pass this legislation, it is still possible for      a terrorist to sneak into this country and inflict serious      harm. But, if we pass this important legislation, we can at      least reduce substantially the probability that terrorists      such as those who came here prior to September 11th will ever      be able to launch that type of attack again.
