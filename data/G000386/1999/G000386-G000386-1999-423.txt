 President, I would like to speak briefly on the Grassley-Domenici amendment on financial management reforms at the Department of Defense.  The bill before us today provides the first major increase in defense spending since 1985.  The increase in defense spending authorized in this bill was initially approved by the Budget Committee back in March.  As a Member of the Budget Committee, I voted for the extra 8 billion dollars for national defense.  That may come as a surprise to some of my colleagues.  In the past, I have opposed increases in the defense budget. Now, I don't. My colleagues must be wondering why.  I would like to explain my position.  I support this year's increase in defense spending for one reason and one reason only.  The Budget Committee--and now the Armed Services Committee--are calling for financial management reforms at DOD.  The Committees are telling DOD to bring its accounting practices up to accepted standards, so it can produce ``auditable'' financial statements--as required by the Chief Financial Officers Act.  This is music to my ears.  We should not pump up the DOD budget without a solid commitment to financial management reform.  The Committees are telling DOD to do what DOD is already required to do--under the law.  The Budget Committee's report on the Concurrent Resolution for FY 2000 contained strong language on the need for financial management reform at the Pentagon.  While the Budget Committee's language is not binding, it sends a clear, unambiguous message to the Pentagon: clean up your books--now!  The Armed Services Committee reached the same conclusions--independently.  The Armed Services Committee has cranked up the pressure a notch. The Committee has taken the next logical step.  The bill before us today contains much more than a strong message.  It mandates financial management reform.  If adopted in conference, the language in this bill would become the law of the land.  And with it, I hope we are able to generate more pressure for financial reform at the Pentagon.  The legislative language on financial management reform is reflected in several provisions in Title X [ten] of the bill.  Mr. President, if financial reforms were not in the bill, I would be standing here with a different kind of amendment in my hand.  I would be asking my colleagues to support an amendment to cut the DOD budget.  Fortunately, that's not necessary.  It's not necessary because the Armed Services Committee has seen the light and seized the initiative.  The Armed Services Committee is demanding financial management reforms at the Pentagon.  First, I would like to thank my friend from Virginia, Senator Warner--the Committee Chairman--for recognizing and accepting the need for financial management reform at the Pentagon.  I would also like to thank my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe--Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee--for putting some horsepower behind DOD financial management reform.  His hearing on DOD Financial Management on April 14th helped to highlight the need for reform and set the stage for the corrective measures in the bill.  But above all, I would like to thank the entire Armed Services Committee for taking time to listen to my concerns and for addressing them in the bill in a meaningful way.  I hope the Committee's efforts to strengthen internal controls--when combined with mine--will improve DOD's ability to detect and prevent fraud and better protect the peoples' money.  Mr. President, this bill does not contain all the new financial management controls that I wanted. There had to be give-and-take along the way.  I remain especially concerned about the need for restrictions on the use of credit cards for making large payments on R and procurement contracts.  The Committee has assured me that there will be a good faith effort to examine this issue before the conference on this bill is concluded.  Based on information to be provided by the Department and the General Accounting Office and Inspector General, the final version of the bill may include: (1) a dollar ceiling on credit card transactions; and (2) strict limits on using credit cards to make large contract payments.  I hope that is possible.  There will be no improvement in the dismal DOD financial management picture without reform--and some pressure from this Committee and the other committees of Congress.  We need to lean on the Pentagon bureaucrats to make it happen.  Without reform, the vast effort dedicated to auditing the annual financial statements will be a wasted effort.  The bill before us will hopefully establish a solid foundation--and create a new environment--where financial management reform can begin to happen.  In doing what we are doing, I hope we are providing the Pentagon with the wherewithal to get the job done.  The reforms in the bill are not new or dramatic.  In my mind, it's basic accounting 101 stuff: DOD needs to record financial transactions in the books of account as they occur. Now, that's not complicated or difficult, but it's the essential first step. And it's not being done today.  The Committee is telling DOD to get on the stick and do what it's already supposed to be doing--under the law. And it calls for some accountability to help get the job done.  The language in this bill--I hope--will get DOD moving toward a ``clean'' audit opinion.  I hope that's where we are headed.  And there is another important reason why DOD financial reform is needed today.  As I stated right up front, we are looking at the first big increase in defense spending since 1985.  I think this Committee needs to be on the record, telling the Pentagon to get its financial house in order.  If the Pentagon wants all this extra money, then the Pentagon needs to fulfill its Constitutional responsibility to the taxpayers of this country.  First, it needs to regain control of the taxpayers' money it's spending right now.  And second, it needs to be able to provide a full and accurate accounting of how all the money gets spent.  DOD must be able to present an accurate and complete accounting of all financial transactions--including all receipts and expenditures. It needs to be able to do this once a year--accurately and completely.  The GAO and IG auditors should be able to examine the department's books and its financial statements and render a ``clean'' audit opinion.  That's the goal.  I want to see us reach that goal reached in my lifetime.  Mr. President, I would like to extend a special word of thanks to the entire Armed Service Committee for helping me with my DOD financial management reform initiative.  I would like to thank the committee for helping to push the Pentagon in the right direction--toward sound financial management practices.  I would like to thank the Committee Chairman, Senator Warner, and his Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Inhofe, for throwing their weight behind the effort.  I would like to thank them for working with me and helping me craft an acceptable piece of legislation.  Mr. President, in my mind, DOD financial management reform is mandatory as we move to larger DOD budgets.  Higher defense budgets need to be hooked up to financial reforms--justlike a horse and buggy--one behind the other. They need to move together.                           amendment no. 431(Purpose: To authorize $4,500,000 for research, development, test, and     evaluation, Defense-wide, relating to a hot gas decontamination     facility, and to reduce by $4,500,000 the amount authorized for   chemical demilitarization activities to take into account inflation               savings in the account for such activities)       On page 18, line 13, strike ``$1,169,000,000'' and insert      ``$1,164,500,000''.
