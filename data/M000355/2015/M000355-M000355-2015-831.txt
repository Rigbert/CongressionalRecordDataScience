 President, the Democratic leader and myself continue to discuss the way forward on cyber. I think we have made some progress, but to make that more possible for us to reach some kind of agreement, I now ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture vote with respect to the motion to proceed to S. 754 occur at 2 p.m. today; further, that the mandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived.
