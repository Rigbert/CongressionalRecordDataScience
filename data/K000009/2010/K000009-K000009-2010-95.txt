Paul Zaleski who passed from this life on November 24 at the age of 95. This tribute was written by noted author and historian, Allen Paul, whose books include ``Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Triumph of Truth.'' As Mr. Paul points out, Mr. Zaleski epitomized the courage of his generation of extraordinary Poles who came to the U.S. after the terror and broken dreams unleashed by World War II. I, too, had the privilege of meeting him on May 5 of this year at a 70th anniversary observance of the Katyn Forest Massacre, at the Library of Congress. Paul Zaleski may well have been the last link here in the U.S. to the Polish Government in Exile. May his family and friends be comforted in the knowledge he lived to see the fall of the Berlin Wall, Solidarity whose 30th anniversary we commemorate this year, and Poland admitted to NATO.                       A Tribute to Paul Zaleski       Paul Zaleski led the most interesting life of anyone I have      ever known. Such a quiet unassuming man, imbued with old      world grace and dignity, never bitter despite the slings and      arrows of outrageous fortune--who could have guessed his      escape in a hail of bullets, how he and others returned that      fire by pinging the American conscience, how we eventually      came to see that Poland, the land he loved and lost, must be      reborn independent and free. He laid no claim to great deeds,      but the memorable title of Dean Acheson's autobiography--     ``Present at the Creation''--almost perfectly fits his life.       Paul and I were close friends for twenty years. His death      on November 24 leaves a notable void: a direct link is lost--     perhaps the last--to the Poles' ill-fated Government in Exile      and to the heroic gamble after the end of the war to save      Poland from Stalin. Paul was longtime secretary to Stanislaw      Mikolajczyk, prime minister of the Government in Exile in      London. In 1945 Mikolajczyk decided to go back to Poland to      join a communist-controlled coalition government and Paul      went with him. Both men were gambling with their lives but      took the chance to achieve two main objectives: first, to      keep the communists from stealing the ``free and unfettered''      elections promised at Yalta; and second, to prevent Stalin      from liquidating and/or deporting nearly 400,000 partisans      who were still in the forests of Poland waiting to fight. The      elections were stolen through blatant fraud; but aim two was      achieved: Mikolajczyk ``bought'' safe passage for the      partisans and averted a bloodbath.       Along the way thugs from the infamous UB (security service)      made two attempts on Paul's life; and soon it became clear      that Mikolajczyk, himself, would be tried as a traitor or      liquidated. Both men escaped in 1947 and returned to the west      where they launched a high-profile campaign to warn the west      about the fate of Poland. Archbishop Francis Spellman      arranged for rooms at the Waldorf Astoria where Mikolajczyk      wrote his bestseller--``The Rape of Poland.'' The famous      sports writer, Bob Considine, helped as did Paul. The book      and the heavy speaking schedule Mikolajczyk kept up were      influential in getting Congress to investigate the Katyn      Forest Massacre in 1951-52. That probe established a record      and body of evidence that stands even today. It concluded      that the Russians had brutally murdered thousands of Polish      officers in the spring of 1940.       Paul's symbiotic relationship with Mikolajczyk heavily      influenced his life. Not long before the war Paul earned a      law degree from Jan Kazimierz University in Lwow and became      an organizer with the Peasant Party (Stronnictwo Ludowe) then      headed by Mikolajczyk. After his escape from Poland, Paul      went to France where Mikolajczyk was serving in the      leadership of the Government in Exile. He sent Paul as an      emissary to Bucharest and later to Istanbul. When the Germans      invaded Russia in 1941, the Poles and Russians reestablished      diplomatic relations; and Paul was sent to help open the new      embassy in Kuybyshev. Two years later the relationship fell      apart over the Katyn crisis and Paul helped get the embassy      staff out of the U.S.S.R. They took the southern route which      meant the convoy had to cross ``The Roof of the World''--the      Pamir Mountains--to get to Persia. Paul then crossed the      Middle East and rejoined Mikolajczyk where the Government in      Exile moved after Dunkirk. He was at Mikolajczyk's side--     often when he met Churchill and other world leaders--and      remained there until Mikolajczyk died in 1966.       His exploits notwithstanding, Paul still had to earn a      living after immigrating to the United States. His Polish law      degree gave him no standing here, so he went to law school      for the second time at George Washington University and later      became an attorney with the U.S. Maritime Commission. After      he retired he practiced law on his own specializing in estate      work. He was executor for many members of the expatriate      community and seldom if ever charged for his services.       I saw in Paul many qualities that epitomized the Poles who      got stranded in the west when Stalin swallowed their country      whole. They found the courage to rebuild shattered lives,      became intensely proud and loyal Americans and remained      unswerving in their commitment to Polish freedom and      independence. I talked to Paul often and we spoke only a few      days before he died. I know it gave him great satisfaction--     much comfort in fact--that the torch was passed, that the      ideals of his generation survived the long dark years of      communism, that they are strongly embraced today by a new      generation of leaders who have guided Poland to a remarkable      position in which it has one of the strongest economies and      most stable democracies in all of Europe.       From their near-miraculous escape in 1947 to their      messianic campaign to win the minds and hearts of Americans,      Paul and his     mentor, Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, came to represent one of the      aspects of Polish character I admire most: the concept of      ``Victory in Defeat.'' The very idea may strike most      Americans as peculiar, but from 1795 to 1989--when Poles were      ruled from abroad except for the brief interwar period--it      meant that honor came first, that the Poles would never give      up, that they would persevere without fail to win back their      independence. When I think of Paul I think of this first; and      it gives me great satisfaction to know that he lived to see      freedom restored and a vibrant Poland reborn.       When I last talked to Paul he told me, as he often did,      that: ``I am so thankful that I am able to live in my own      home.'' His courage could be measured in matters great and      small. Despite crippling conditions he managed to take care      of himself until the last four days of his life. To say that      he will be missed feels like a gross understatement to me. He      was the product of an unusual place and time; he never shrank      from the difficulties that came his way. And he would      certainly chide me for praising him even to this extent.                          ____________________
