President, yesterday marked the end of the Major League Baseball regular season. Fans everywhere have enjoyed a season with Barry Bonds leading the league in hitting, Alex Rodriguez hitting 57 home runs, and Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling combining as perhaps the greatest pitching duo ever. It has been a tremendous season of achievement for many teams. The Minnesota Twins, a team Commissioner Selig wanted to disband last off-season, won the American League Central Division. The Oakland A's set an American League record with a 20-game winning streak and won the American League's Western Division.  Eight teams, and fans from across the country and around the world, are now gearing up for an exciting playoff season. The Twins and the A's, as well as the Anaheim Angels, the St. Louis Cardinals and the San Francisco Giants, have earned the opportunity to continue into the playoffs, to compete for a pennant and even the World Series championship along with last year's champion Arizona Diamondbacks, the New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves. They are not the eight teams with the highest payrolls or biggest markets. They do share a few things in common: talented players having outstanding seasons, great team play and exceptional management both on and off the field.  We are fortunate that this baseball season is being played to its rightful conclusion and that crisis was avoided on August 30, when negotiators for team owners and the Major League Baseball Players Union reached a new collective bargaining agreement. Announced just two hours before another work stoppage, this agreement saved professional baseball from a disastrous screeching halt to yet another baseball season.  With this agreement baseball can now go about the business of assessing the future of the sport in Montreal. It is unfortunate that this fine city, its team with a number of outstanding players, and its fans have been left in limbo for the past year over the future of the franchise. For a large number of Vermonters, Montreal provides the closest major league venue. This franchise is the major league affiliate for our own minor league Vermont Expos. There are many dedicated Expos fans in my State. Several local towns are doing their best to show their support for keeping the Expos in Montreal. I ask that a letter recently sent by the St. Albans Town Selectboard to the Mayor of Montreal be printed in the Record.  The letter follows:                                                  August 12, 2002.     Mayor Gerald Tremblay,     Montreal, Quebec.       Mayor Tremblay, the St. Albans Town Selectboard wishes to      express our utmost hope that the city of Montreal tries      everything possible to help retain the Montreal Expos.       Montreal is a beautiful international city with much      diversity and many different types of cultures. We believe      the Expos are a large part of the city and it serves to bring      many people from Northern Vermont to your city every year.       With a downtown stadium, we believe the Expos can flourish      once again and help attract many more tourists to your      wonderful city. We hope that you and your government are      trying everything possible to work with new-interested      buyers.       If the Town of St. Albans can be of assistance please feel      free to contact us.       Cordially Yours,                                                   Tayt R. Brooks,                                                       Vice-Chair.  Mr. President, through repeated hearings in the Judiciary Committee, Congress has tried to help the major league baseball owners and players find common ground. After the last work stoppage, we culminated almost a decade of hearings examining labor strife and other problems in major league baseball, when we enacted the Curt Flood Act in 1998. Senator Hatch was the lead sponsor of that measure, and I was his principal cosponsor. It was a bipartisan effort to clarify the law. By that effort we hoped to promote labor peace in Major League Baseball.  The principle purpose of the law was to make clear that federal antitrust laws apply to the relationshipsbetween major league team owners and players. Clarifying the law was intended to contribute to an atmosphere in which management and labor, owners and players would resolve their differences through collective bargaining rather than through work stoppages. I hope that the Curt Flood Act and our efforts over the last several years, including the hearing we held this Congress at the requests of Senators Wellstone, Dayton, Dorgan and Johnson, contributed in some small way to creating a legal framework and atmosphere in which the parties could resolve their differences through agreement.  Fortunately, baseball has avoided its ninth work stoppage since 1972. During the previous eight work stoppages, 1,736 games were lost--including 938 that were wiped out because of the 1994-95 labor war. Clearly, another work stoppage would have had serious consequences for the professional game. I congratulate Commissioner Selig, Bob Dupuy and their team and Don Fehr and his team on reaching an accord.  Earlier this year Forbes Magazine estimated that the New York Yankees were worth $730 million. The New York Mets were the next-highest valued franchise at $482 million, followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers ($435 million) and the Boston Red Sox ($426 million). Even, the Montreal Expos franchise was valued at over $100 million. The average annual salary for major league players this season reportedly is $2.8 million.  We all hope the recent labor agreement marks a new era of cooperation in Major League Baseball. I remind both the owners and the players that the responsibility for preserving the best of our national pastime--and for restoring the faith and enthusiasm of the fans across the United States--is their opportunity in the coming months and years.  May all of the fans of professional baseball enjoy an exciting post-season, and I wish each of the playoffs teams well.                          ____________________
