 ``Inclusion of Detainees on No Fly List: The Assistant Secretary, in coordination with the Terrorist Screening Center, shall include on the No Fly List any individual who was a detainee housed at the Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on or after January 1, 2009, after a final disposition has been issued by the President.'' The quibbling seems to be over the final disposition.  The only point at which any of these people might have some opportunity to try and get on an airplane will be after they get out of Guantanamo. The President determines the final disposition, and if they are sent to a third country or transferred elsewhere at that point, they go on the No Fly List. We have terrorists in our super maximum security prisons in the United States who aren't on the No Fly List because they're in a super maximum security prison. If they ever get parole or otherwise get released, they'll go on the No Fly List. But we don't junk up the No Fly List, which already has problems, with a whole bunch of people who are in shackles in ultra-secure locations and are in security already. It doesn't make a lot of sense.  I know you're trying to get political advantage here to say somehow we're soft on terrorism. These people will go on the list if they ever get out.  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the remaining time.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3\1/4\ minutes. The gentleman from Mississippi has 3\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to my distinguished colleague from Indiana (Mr. Souder).
