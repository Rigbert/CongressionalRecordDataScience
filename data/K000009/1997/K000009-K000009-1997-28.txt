Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion to instruct conferees so that we can go to the conference with a strong position from both the House and the Senate and really do something for the young people of this country and help prevent additional addiction which will cost millions of lives in the future and billions of dollars.
