Speaker, I was one of the earliest supporters of President Obama's negotiations with Iran to prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons. I supported the conclusion of those negotiations which resulted in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a historic international agreement which has already limited Iran's nuclear activities. I strongly appreciate the President's robust enforcement and monitoring of Iran's compliance with the JCPOA. During a long vote series I mistakenly voted yes on H.R. 5461 when my intention was to vote against this legislation. I oppose H.R. 5461 and any other effort to undermine the JCPOA.                          ____________________
