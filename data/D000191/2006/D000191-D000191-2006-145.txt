Now, with great fanfare in the dark of the night, this Congress passed this plan, a plan written by and for the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry is the number one beneficiary. According to some academics, it should raise their profits by 28 percent over the next 5 years, not bad for the pharmaceutical industry.  Some forget history. The first time this bill came up on the floor of the House, it was being hotly debated, and then suddenly at 5 o'clock the House had to adjourn. Why did the House have to adjourn? Because the Republicans were going downtown to have their huge annual fundraiser, and a number of the principal fund-raisers were from the pharmaceutical industry. They are very, very generous to those who benefit them.  The pharmaceutical industry does really well. The insurance industry gets subsidies to offer these plans, even though they say that these are going to be great plans. They are getting subsidies to offer them. Still, seniors aren't lining up in great numbers for the plans because they are unbelievably complex plans.  Now, there are a number of problems that have come to our attention recently. In fact, even the chairman of Walgreen's, no lefty Democratic institution there, said that the government needs to intervene because the multiplicity of plans is just so unbelievable that people cannot understand them. Even worse than that, these plans are the most restrictive insurance product in history for requiring prior approval and testing before drugs are approved.  When the CEO of Coventry Health Care was contacted regarding the 39 different forms with multiple procedures the physicians would have to access in order to give drugs with prior approval to seniors, he said that could not be true. He checked, he came back, and he said it was true. He said, for instance, there are things like Accutane which could cause birth defects.  I know that we are pushing the boundaries of science, but I don't think too many 65-and-over American women eligible for Medicare have to worry about that. There are some other disorders for which Accutane can be a very helpful and legitimate treatment.  What they are doing is, first off, you have to buy into a plan. They can change the benefits weekly. Even if you took that plan because it offers the drugs you need on a weekly basis, the insurance industry can change it. Then even if they keep those drugs available, they are going to require that your doctor and you jump through incredible hoops to get prior approval.  Even seniors in nursing homes who have been on drugs for 10 and 15 years with a very well-known and documented condition, their doctors are being required to order expensive tests to justify continuing prescriptions for those seniors; and in some cases prescriptions have been interrupted, jeopardizing the patients.  This is a plan that wasn't set up to be convenient or easy for seniors to use to provide a meaningful benefit. It was set up first to benefit the pharmaceutical industry, then the insurance industry. The plausible excuse for that is to provide some coverage for seniors, coverage which, by the way, is going to cost taxpayers $800 billion.  Because, guess what, the bill, as written by the pharmaceutical industry, and passed by the Republican Congress and signed by the President, says that the Federal Government is outlawed, outlawed, from negotiating lower drug prices for seniors. That is prohibited by Federal law, despite the fact that the VA does it, and recent studies show that the VA is acquiring drugs between 40 and 80 percent cheaper than are being offered under these plans to our seniors.  The pharmaceutical industry said it would not be fair if the government negotiated lower drug prices for everybody on Medicare. It would not be fair to do that.  Come on, the most profitable industry consistently in the world, and they say that would not be fair; the industry that is gouging profits out of Americans, while selling drugs for half or a third the price overseas, and then crying all the way to the bank, when seniors here have to pay three and four times as much for those particular drugs.  What would be fair is to have the government negotiate lower drug prices for everybody eligible for Medicare. You can walk in. You do not have to have any insurance; you are going to get that big discount. Then the government could offer a simple plan, one plan, that would give benefits to cover that additional cost, and they could do that on a sliding scale basis.  We could save, over the next 5 years, the taxpayers of the United States $600 billion and provide a more meaningful benefit to all our seniors than this plan is doing. But we will not do that here, because the seniors aren't big campaign contributors like the pharmaceutical and insurance industries. Hopefully, there will be a revolt among America's seniors, and they will demand we change this plan, do something meaningful and save the Treasury $600 billion.                          ____________________
