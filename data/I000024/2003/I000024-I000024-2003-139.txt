President, I rise today to honor the memory of a remarkable man. SSG Aaron Dean White was an Oklahoman through and through. People say he was a hard worker, dedicated, friendly, and that he loved his family and country. Those who knew him best remembered him as being always willing to help others. He even served alongside his father as a volunteer firefighter for the town of Sasakwa, OK. A former resident of both Sasakwa and Shawnee, OK, he graduated from Shawnee High School in 1994. He entered the U.S. Marine Corps shortly thereafter, gladly serving his Nation for 9 years, and eventually moving up to the position of crew chief on a CH-46 Sea Knight Helicopter.  Staff Sergeant White was passionate about his job--excited to serve--proud to be a marine. After being deployed to Iraq in January of 2003, he was upset because he was not as close to the action as he had hoped. A passionate lover of flying who had earned his pilot's license, he volunteered to be a gunner on a helicopter, just so he would have the opportunity to fly more often.  On Monday, May 19, Staff Sergeant White was one of four individuals on board a helicopter on a resupply mission when the chopper went down into the Shat Ahilala River in Iraq. Tragically he, along with four other marines, did not survive the incident. This courageous man who was living out his dreams lost his life while defending his country.  Staff Sergeant White's remarkable life of helping others was commemorated at his funeral ceremony in Wewoka, OK, at which friends and family filled the chapel. His many loved ones grieved, including his parents, Shawnee, OK, residents Darrell and Karen White; his wife Michele; his daughter Brianna Nicole; and his sister, Sergeant Patricia LaBar, who was serving with the U.S. Army in Germany when her brother passed into the next life. However, I know they are incredibly proud of this man--son, husband, father, and brother--lover of life and soldier of freedom. He is a man who has set a higher standard for all of us to follow. We will never forget him, SSG Aaron Dean White.                  In Memory of Petty Officer Bollinger
