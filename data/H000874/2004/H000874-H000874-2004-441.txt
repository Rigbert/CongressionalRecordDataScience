Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and pay tribute to the service of a valued friend of mine and a courageous veteran from Maryland, Clancy Lyall.  Just last week we observed Veterans Day, where we honored the bravery and sacrifice of our veterans and their families and all of the men and women who make up our Nation's armed forces.  On June 6, 1944, U.S. Army General Dwight D. Eisenhower sent our troops on a mission to confront one of the world's most tyrannical dictatorships with some notable words of inspiration. ``You are about to embark on a great crusade, the eyes of the world are upon you, the hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.''  Despite a tragic number of casualties, the allied forces were ultimately triumphant in liberating Europe and in defending the world from further oppression by ending the control of the brutal and bigoted Nazi regime.  As a member of the E Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, known as the ``Band of Brothers'' during World War II, Clancy Lyall jumped onto the beaches at Normandy on D-Day, fought at the Battle of the Bulge and helped capture Hitler's ``Eagles Nest'' retreat.  Sixty years later, on June 6, 2004, Clancy was able to return to Normandy with hundreds of WWII veterans where he participated in the ``Normandy Memoire 60th Anniversary'', and was awarded by the French Government with a chest badge in Carenton where his unit distinguished themselves in battle.  Southern Maryland is fortunate to have Clancy Lyall in our midst. He has served our community as a loud voice for Veterans and has organized Memorial Day and Veterans Day parades for many years, privileging our community with an opportunity to honor these important observances.  He has also served as the Past Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Veterans Service Organization, meaning he has made a choice to not only be a member of the veterans' community, but to take part in the organization and work to further the causes of veterans. And, Clancy has worked to preserve stories of the war through presentations at area high schools so that students are able to begin to truly know and understand the human experiences of World War II.  I know that all my colleagues join me in saluting my friend and representative of one of the true heroes of the ``Greatest Generation,'' Clancy Lyall, for his unwavering devotion to our country, and his uncompromising dedication to our community. Clancy, a grateful Nation is indebted to you for your extraordinary service in war and in peace.                          ____________________
