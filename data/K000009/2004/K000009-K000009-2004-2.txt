Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution commending Second Harvest and other food banks around the country who do such a wonderful job in providing essential assistance to people who need it. I am thankful each and every day that they are able to provide help to hungry people, as are the people who receive the food.  As the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Agricultural Appropriations, I have been torn over the level of funding we provide for our many food assistance programs. I am happy that we are able to provide as much funding as we do, while recognizing that there are still are other programs like WIC, Commodity Supplemental Feeding, and the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, that could still use more.  I am unhappy about the growth in these food programs because they are supposed to be countercyclical. If our funding levels are high, then it means many among us, including many who have full time jobs, are not doing well economically. They need these food programs to help make ends meet.  Consider the following: In fiscal 2001, we provided $20.1 billion for Food Stamps. In the fiscal 2005 bill approved by the House in July, we included $33.6 billion, an increase of 67 percent in that one program. Do the additional 5.8 million program receiving these benefits think they are better off than they were four years ago?  According to testimony provided by USDA, in 2002, 47 percent of all infants born in the nation--1.9 million out of 4.1 million--were receiving benefits under the WIC program. What happened to meaningful jobs for their parents?  Last year the Toledo Blade reported of cases in which the families of individuals called up for active National Guard or Military Reserve Duty had to seek assistance from the WIC program because of lost family income. This is taking care of our servicemen and women and their families?  A population survey from the Census Bureau found that 12.1 percent of Ohioans were living in poverty in 2003, up from 11 percent in 2001. There is definitely a connection between increases in poverty and the thousands of jobs that have been lost in Ohio since 2001;  In 2003, the Toledo-Northwest Ohio Food Bank reported that food pantries and soup kitchens in the area served 28,000 households. By the end of June of this year, this number increased to 40,000 households. People who in past years had donated to food banks are now becoming recipients.  Local grocery stores had been generous in their support of food banks in prior years, but because of local closures and consolidations, the food banks are finding that the donations they are receiving are down while the need for the program has increased.  As a nation, while we support these programs of assistance because it is the right thing to do, no one should ignore the fact that there are reasons why people are on these programs. America needs more jobs that pay a living wage. America needs an increase in the minimum wage to be sure that families can live in dignity, not in despair. America needs to end the harsh choices we expect too many young families and too many elderly to make--do they pay the rent, pay for utilities, pay for health care, or leave money for food?  America, frankly, needs better days than we have seen for the past four years.  I ask unanimous consent to include at this point in the Record an article from the October 3rd issue of the Toledo Blade, entitled ``Ranks of Area's `Invisible' Poor are Increasing''.                 [From the Toledo Blade, Oct. 3, 2004]           Ranks of Area's ``Invisible'' Poor are Increasing     More Ohio, Michigan residents are living on the edge than ever                         (By Karamagi Rujumba)       Gary Robertson was laid off from his warehouse job eight      months ago. With no steady income and the bills piling up, he      soon lost his apartment. A couple of friends put him up for a      while, but that didn't last for long. So one day, he was      finally forced to do something he never imagined: He spent a      night at a men's homeless shelter at the Cherry Street      Mission. ``I was homeless and that was hard for me to accept.      I had never been to a food pantry or a shelter,'' said Mr.      Robertson, a native of Alabama who moved to Findlay 17 years      ago and got a job at an area warehouse. ``I was doing well      until I lost my job,'' Mr. Robertson said. He came to Toledo      hoping for better luck in a larger city, but has since failed      to find a regular job here. He has been working odd jobs to      make his portion of the rent for an apartment he shares. When      he needs food, he goes to the Cherry Street Mission's food      pantry. Mr. Robertson is far from alone.       ``We are seeing an increasing number of people who rely on      pantries and soup kitchens, especially this year,'' said Lisa      Hamler-Podolski, the executive director of the Ohio      Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks, a Columbus-based      agency that donates food to food banks across the state. A      U.S. Census Bureau report released last month confirmed what      many volunteers at area food pantries and soup kitchens have      known for a long time--that more people in Ohio and Michigan      live in poverty today than in past years.                          Area Census figures       Poverty is defined in terms of family size and income. For      2003, the Census Bureau reported that a family of four living      on a total annual income of $18,810 or less is considered to      be in poverty. And statistical benchmarks show poverty is on      the rise in Toledo, Ohio, and Michigan: In the last Census      report, Toledo was ranked eighth among cities that have the      highest number of children living in poverty. A recent      population survey from the Census Bureau found that 12.1      percent of Ohioans were living in poverty in 2003, up from      11.9 percent in 2002, and 11 percent in 2001. In Michigan,      11.4 percent of the population was living in poverty last      year, compared to 11.6 percent in 2002 and 9.4 percent in      2001. In 2003, the Toledo-Northwest Ohio Food Bank, Inc.,      reported that the various food pantries and soup kitchens to      which it distributed served 28,000 households. By the end of      the first six months of 2004, the same pantries and kitchens      reported that 40,000 households were dependent on their      services.       ``The people we are talking about appear to be invisible,      but you see them everyday. They serve you at restaurants,      take care of your parents in nursing homes, and make your      beds in hotels,'' Ms. Hamler-Podolski said. ``They are the      new poor. People who have always had jobs and now, due to      plant closings and downsizing, find themselves struggling to      put food on the table.''                        Demand high at pantries       Julie Chase Morefield, the director of marketing and      operations at the Toledo-Northwest Ohio Food Bank, agreed.      ``The demand at area pantries and kitchens is way up and it      has been a problem finding enough food to distribute,'' she      said. Her agency serves 330 pantries and soup kitchens in      eight northwest Ohio counties, including Lucas, Defiance,      Fulton, Henry, Ottawa, Sandusky, Williams, and Wood counties.      ``It is worse than we have ever seen it. We've never really      seen numbers this high,'' Ms. Morefield said. ``There are a      lot of people out there who are really struggling.''       John Urban, a retired vacuum cleaner salesman is one of      them. Standing in line for a food bag at the Helping Hands of      Saint Louis pantry in East Toledo one recent Tuesday morning,      Mr. Urban said his Social Security income of $900 a month no      longer was enough to sustain him. ``I come here once a month      and they give me enough food to last a couple of weeks,''      said the 64-year-old, who was born on the city's east side.      After showing his proof of residence and income, Mr. Urban      was handed a brown bag stuffed with loaves of bread, bagels,      macaroni, spaghetti sauce, several cans of soup, and powdered      milk.       The line at the pantry on this particular morning was not      very long. That is because it was the beginning of the month,      said Linda Lupien, the director of Helping Hands. ``The      middle and the end of the month are usually very tough      because that's when people run out of money,'' Ms. Lupien      said. ``We are seeing new faces every day and people who are      hitting the pantry line because they simply cannot make it      anymore.''       Al Baumann, a retired pastor at Saint Mark's Lutheran      Church in East Toledo, is the director of the Toledo Area      Council of Churches, which runs the Feed Your Neighbor      program. ``There are a lot more people in Toledo who rely on      food donations. You see them everyday, but you just don't      know it,'' Mr. Baumann said. ``We serve more than 30,000      families a year through our program.'' Feed Your Neighbor is      a food voucher system involving 12 Toledo churches that was      started in 1975, when the council of churches     started distributing emergency food supplies because of the      drastic economic downturn of the 1970s. While the current      economic climate is not as dire, Mr. Baumann said the number      of people in need of food is growing every month. ``We're      finding more people, even in the suburbs, who can no longer      make ends meet,'' he said. ``A lot of people are not aware of      the economic hardships their neighbors might be experiencing      because of the way that we are economically segregated as a      society.''                          Cutting food stamps       Drastic cuts in federal government subsidies to food stamp      and similar programs serving the poor is another reason that      more people are lining up at food pantries, Mr. Baumann      said. According to the Lucas County Department of Jobs and      Family Services, there are now 27,784 households receiving      food stamps and 4,574 families on cash assistance through      the Ohio Works First program. The county has seen a steady      increase in the number of people seeking cash and food      assistance, said Cindy Ginter, the program manager at      Lucas County's Department of Jobs and Family Services. In      2003, the county had 25,286 households on food-stamp rolls      and 3,736 families on cash assistance.       ``We would like to not have seen this kind of increase, but      because of the economy, the numbers just keep increasing,''      Ms. Ginter said. The sluggish economy also is cited by the      county's Women, Infants, and Children program for the record      number of low-income earning families that depend on its      services, said Tom Kuhn, the agency's director. In 1999, WIC,      an agency of the Ohio Department of Health's Bureau of      Nutrition Services, served 12,326 families in the county.      This year, that number has jumped to more than 15,000      families. ``The numbers have been steadily rising, but this      is the highest they have ever been,'' Mr. Kuhn said.       Sheldon Danziger, a professor of public policy at the      Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of      Michigan, said the federal and state governments are not      doing enough to stave the rising numbers of people living in      poverty.       The Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services came under      fire last week because $431 million in federally-allocated      funds have been sitting unused for months in the state's      Temporary Assistance for Needy Families account. Director Tom      Hayes confirmed the funds are being held while the state and      counties design programs to spend the money.                           Economic problems       Mr. Danziger argued that it isn't because of a failure of      antipoverty programs that poverty has remained high for      Americans since the 1970s. He said it's because the economy      has not delivered the benefits of prosperity to all workers,      and because politicians and the public have lost faith in the      ability of government to deal with the problem of poverty.      ``Wage stagnation is one of the reasons that we still see      people lining up at food pantries,'' Mr. Danziger said.      ``Since the 1990s, labor market changes have meant that      workers with a high school education or less have had wage      rates that have not grown relative to the rate of      inflation.'' He said the government has failed to implement      public policies like a higher minimum wage adjusted for      inflation, which would be the quickest way to help people who      are struggling. The last time the minimum wage was adjusted      was in 1997, when it was raised to $5.15 per hour. If it were      to be adjusted to current inflation, the professor said, the      minimum wage would be $6.10 per hour.                        Global poverty increase       Mr. Danziger said the gap between the rich and poor is not      only increasing here, but in many developing nations of the      world where more than a billion people continue to face      extreme poverty. According to a report released by the World      Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization in      February, more than a billion people lived on less than $1      per day in 2000. The commission, which was established in      2002 by the International Labor Organization, a United      Nations agency, reported the gap between the richest and      poorest countries has widened dramatically in the past four      decades. In the U.S., increasing unemployment benefits and      implementing more tax credit programs for low-wage earners      would be a critical step in helping the unemployed get back      on their feet, Mr. Danziger said. According to the Center on      Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank, 17      States and the District of Columbia so far have enacted      earned income tax credits for low income residents, which      supplement the federal government credits.       Ohio and Michigan, however, are not among them.       These tax credits, Mr. Danziger argued, go a long way in      meeting day-to-day expenses for low-wage earners. George      Garcia, a Toledo truck driver, said he could have used some      help when he almost lost his house after breaking both his      legs in an accident that left him unemployed for more than      six months. ``I was down to the last week and $1,500 behind      on my mortgage. I had to tell the children that we were about      to lose our home,'' said the 39-year-old father of three.      After borrowing from several friends, he kept the family's      home. But because he had no health insurance, he spent all      his money on medical bills and had to turn to the Cherry      Street pantry for food. ``The pantry was great. I always got      enough food and when I took it home, it was like I had just      come from the grocery store,'' he said. Though he now makes      enough to support his family most of the time, Mr. Garcia      acknowledged that ``every now and then, I have to go to the      pantry to get by.''
