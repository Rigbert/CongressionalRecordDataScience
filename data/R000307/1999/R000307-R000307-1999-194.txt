President, I have some general remarks about the bill. I know that under the previous order we are to recess at 12, and I will try to make my remarks as brief as possible. I know the senior Senator from Kansas has some remarks as well.  I know there is a lot of concern about the U.S. involvement in putting troops into Kosovo. I wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues a conference report that was passed last year as part of the defense appropriations bill that says--as a matter of fact it is law--the President and the administration must come to the Congress with a report of that deployment. Senator Hutchison and I will be making some remarks sometime later this afternoon in regard to this provision.  I ask unanimous consent to have this page of the Conference Report printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Making Appropriations for the Department of Defense for the Fiscal Year  Ending September 30, 1999, and for Other Purposes--Conference Report                            (H. Rept. 105-746)       Sec. 8115. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise      made available under this Act may be obligated or expended      for any additional deployment of forces of the Armed Forces      of the United States to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Macedonia      unless and until the President, after consultation with the      Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader      of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the House of      Representatives, and the Minority Leader of the Senate,      transmits to Congress a report on the deployment that      includes the following:       (1) The President's certification that the presence of      those forces in each country to which the forces are to be      deployed is necessary in the national security interests of      the United States.       (2) The reasons why the deployment is in the national      security interests of the United States.       (3) The number of United States military personnel to be      deployed to each country.       (4) The mission and objectives of forces to be deployed.       (5) The expected schedule for accomplishing the objectives      of the deployment.       (6) The exit strategy for United States forces engaged in      the deployment.       (7) The costs associated with the deployment and the      funding sources for paying those costs.       (8) The anticipated effects of the deployment on the      morale, retention, and effectiveness of United States forces.       (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to a deployment of      forces--       (1) in accordance with United Nations Security Council      Resolution 795; or       (2) under circumstances determined by the President to be      an emergency necessitating immediate deployment of the      forces.       (c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to restrict the      authority of the President under the Constitution to protect      the lives of United States citizens.
