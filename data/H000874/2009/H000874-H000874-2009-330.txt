Speaker, I rise today in honor of Mitch King, a government relations manager at the U.S. Postal Service, who, on May 1, is retiring after 36 years of work for the Postal Service, for Congress, and our Nation.  Mitch King began his postal career in 1973 as a letter carrier in Falls Church, Virginia, just a few miles from here, and then became supervisor of letter carriers before becoming an instructor in the delivery service branch of the Postal Management Academy in Potomac, Maryland.  In the spring of 1982, he began working in the government relations department at Postal Service headquarters in Washington, D.C. In 1992, he was promoted to the position of government relations manager, a postal career executive position equivalent to the executive branch's senior executive service. During the latter part of his career, he managed postal service congressional liaison activities for the States of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and the District of Columbia. He also served on the Election Mail Task Force.  Mitch has managed government relations activities with many Members of Congress, addressing an ever-expanding variety of postal-related issues. He has also served as the principal postal contact for the House Appropriations Committee and the Financial Services Subcommittee. When I chaired the Treasury Postal Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I dealt with Mitch on a regular basis.  Since that time, as whip and majority leader, I have continued to dealwith Mitch King and have found him very responsive, very knowledgable, and very conscientious. He was, in short, a model of an employee that the citizens of this country would want to have.  For years, Mitch worked with me to help ensure my constituents the level of service they have rightfully come to expect from the Postal Service. Indeed, he's done that for all of our Members. He was a true and dedicated public servant. He did his work well and faithfully for decades with no expectations of great rewards or renown. For 36 years, Mitch King helped keep the mail going. He was part of a collective accomplishment that is no less impressive for the fact that it happens 6 days a week.  The United States Postal Service handles millions and millions of pieces of mail a day. Does it make some mistakes? Yes. But an extraordinarily small percentage. In fact, it's the most productive mail service in the world. And 40 percent, frankly, ahead of number two.  At the same time, Mitch's humor, intelligence and consummate skill help make him entirely unique in many ways. I know I speak for all of us when I say he will be missed from public service. I am sure that he will go on to continue to contribute to his community, to his family, to his State, and to his country.  Good job, Mitch King. Godspeed.                          ____________________
