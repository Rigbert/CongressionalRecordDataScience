 Speaker, this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the School for International Training in Brattleboro, Vermont. As one of the foremost schools for cross-cultural education in the world, its record is one trail-blazing effort after another, a whole series of initiatives that have transformed both the world, and the way education about the world is shaped.  The SIT, as it is known, was an outgrowth of the Experiment in International Living, which originated in 1932 when Donald Watt took twenty American teenagers to Europe to live together with teenagers from several European nations. Year after year that program grew and prospered.  In the wake of World War Two the Fulbright Program for the international exchange of scholars and the establishment of the Peace Corps increased this Nation's commitment to the exchange of citizens between different countries and cultures. The SIT was founded in order to provide training and ultimately advanced degrees to those who wanted to work and teach in a global context. It was an early and important resource for Peace Corps training--an unsurprising fact, given that Sergeant Shriver, the first Director of the Peace Corps, had in 1934 been a member of one of the earliest Experiment in International Living programs. The core of the SIT has remained the same for forty years: language training, field-based practice, and a commitment to internationalism.  The School for International Training is not only about technical training for international exchange and work. It has a central vision and a central mission: world peace. Its motto is, ``Building peace through understanding--one person at a time.'' It has lived up to this motto by educating individuals to work in a world where human need is more important than political borders, religious groupings, ethnic identities, or geographical boundaries. It tries to construct a new world in which human beings are united rather than divided by working together to shape a more equitable and peaceful society.  Too often our world today is rent by violence or plundered by corporations looking only to make a quick profit. Building peace and community takes time and steadfast effort. It also takes vision, and a deep sense of generosity. The School for International Training--its leaders, its teachers, its generation of students--have devoted time, effort, vision and generosity in extraordinary measure.  As it celebrates its first forty years, I, the people of Vermont, and the citizens of both the American Nation and the world, wish the School for International Training forty more years of success.                          ____________________
