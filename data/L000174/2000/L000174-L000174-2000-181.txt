President, I applaud what the distinguished Senator from Illinois has said. He, of course, has worked so long on both the H-1B visas issue and the immigration issues included in the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. I know of nobody who spends more time on these issues than he does. I am proud to be here with him, and I invite him to return to these issues as we proceed in this debate.                          ____________________
