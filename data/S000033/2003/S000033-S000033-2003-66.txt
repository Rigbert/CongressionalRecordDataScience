 Chairman, the reality here is that throughout this country today, over 100 cities and towns have spoken out, including three States, with deep concern about various aspects of the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act. For many people, conservatives and progressives, the decline of civil liberties in this country and the ability of the FBI to go into libraries and bookstores is an issue of enormous concern. It is beyond my comprehension why that issue cannot be debated on the floor of the House.  Maybe my amendment would win. We have 130 cosponsors. Maybe it would lose, but when we talk about the democracy, how can we not debate an issue of enormous consequence regarding civil liberties, and that has been my simple request.
