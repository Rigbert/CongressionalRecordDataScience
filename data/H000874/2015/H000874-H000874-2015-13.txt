 To further clarify, I know there has been some talk about a CR that may be sufficient to get us into next year. As I understand what the majority leader is saying, it is our intention not to do that, but to, in fact, complete the appropriations process and the funding of government for the balance of the year until September 30 of next year. Is that accurate, sir?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding again.  Yes. As the gentleman knows, we just passed a CR moving into next Wednesday. It is our intention to have our work done and to not need to pass any further CRs.
