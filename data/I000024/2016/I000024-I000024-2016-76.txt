The President signed that bill and a matter of hours later released the Taliban Five.  Everybody remembers the Taliban Five. They were the most egregious of all the terrorists who were in Gitmo. We don't know what they are doing now. Supposedly they are in Qatar or someplace under some supervision, but it happens that the recidivism rate of those who have been released from Gitmo is 30 percent. In other words, 30 percent of those released are back trying to kill Americans again.  It is unacceptable, and it is very similar to this. Whether it is releasing people--terrorists from Gitmo--to go out and kill Americans or releasing people who are criminal aliens from our cities and towns, it is a problem, a serious problem, and we are going to have to address this problem, and we are going to address it.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
