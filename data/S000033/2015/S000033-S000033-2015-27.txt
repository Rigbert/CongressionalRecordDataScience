 President, let me just concur with the Senator from Ohio. This trade agreement was supported by virtually every major corporation in this country, the vast majority of whom have outsourced millions of jobs to low-wage countries all over the world. This trade agreement is supported by Wall Street. This trade agreement is supported by the pharmaceutical industry, which wants to charge people in poor countries higher prices for the medicine they desperately need.  This agreement was opposed by every union in this country, working for the best interests of working families, and by almost every environmental group and many religious groups.  In my view, this trade agreement will continue the policies of NAFTA, CAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China--agreements that have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.  We need a new trade policy in America--a policy that represents working families and not just the big money interests.  I strongly disagree with the majority leader, who called this a great day for America. It is not a great day. It is a great day for the Big Money interests, not a great day for working families.
