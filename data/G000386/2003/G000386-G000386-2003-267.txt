 President, the U.S. Postal Service provides a vital and important communication link for the Nation and the citizens of my home State of Iowa. Rural Letter Carriers play a special role and have a proud history as an important link in assuring the delivery of our mail. Rural letter carriers first delivered the mail with their own horses and buggies, later with their own motorcycles, and now in their own cars and trucks. They are responsible for maintenance and operation of their vehicles in all types of weather and road conditions. In the winter, snow and ice is their enemy, while in the spring, the melting snow and ice causes potholes and washboard roads. In spite of these quite adverse conditions, rural letter carriers daily drive over 3 million miles and serve 24 million American families on over 66,000 routes.  Although the mission of rural carriers has not changed since the horse and buggy days, the amount of mail they deliver has changed dramatically. As the Nation's mail volume has increased throughout the years, the Postal Service is now delivering more than 200 billion pieces of mail a year. The average carrier delivers about 2,300 pieces of mail a day to about 500 addresses.  Most recently, e-commerce has changed the type of mail rural letter carriers deliver. This fact was confirmed in a GAO study entitled ``U.S. Postal Service: Challenges to Sustaining Performance Improvements Remain Formidable on the Brink of the 21st Century,'' dated October 21, 1999. As this report explains, the Postal Service expects declines in its core business, which is essentially letter mail, in the coming years. The growth of e-mail on the Internet, electronic communications, and electronic commerce has the potential to substantially affect the Postal Service's mail volume.  First-Class mail has always been the bread and butter of the Postal Service's revenue, but the amount of revenue from First-Class letters is declining. E-commerce is providing the Postal Service with another opportunity to increase another part of its business. That is because what individuals and companies order over the Internet must be delivered, sometimes by the Postal Service and often by rural letter carriers. Currently, the Postal Service had about 33 percent of the parcel business. Rural letter carriers are now delivering larger volumes of business mail, parcels, and priority mail packages. But, more parcel business means more cargo capacity is necessary in postal delivery vehicles, especially in those owned and operated by rural letter carriers.  When delivering greeting cards or bills, or packages ordered over the Internet, rural letter carriers use vehicles they currently purchase, operate and maintain. In exchange, they receive a reimbursement from the Postal Service. This reimbursement is called an Equipment Maintenance Allowance, EMA. Congress recognizes that providing a personal vehicle to delivery the U.S. Mail is not typical vehicle use. So, when a rural letter carrier is ready to sell such a vehicle, it's going to have little trade-in value because of the typically high mileage, extraordinary wear and tear, and the fact that it is probably right-hand drive. Therefore, Congress intended to exempt the EMA allowance from taxation in 1988 through a specific provision for rural mail carriers in the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.  That provision allowed an employee of the U.S. Postal Service who was involved in the collection and delivery of mail on a rural route, to compute their business use mileage deduction as 150 percent of the standard mileage rate for all business use mileage. As an alternative, rural letter carrier taxpayers could elect to utilize the actual expense method, business portion of actual operation and maintenance of the vehicle, plus depreciation. If EMA exceeded the allowable vehicle expense deductions, the excess was subject to tax. If EMA fell short of the allowable vehicle expenses, a deduction was allowed only to the extent that the sum of the shortfall and all other miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeded two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income.  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 further simplified the tax returns of rural letter carriers. That Act permitted the EMA income and expenses ``to wash,'' so that neither income nor expenses would have to be reported on a rural letter carrier's return. That simplified taxes for approximately 120,000 taxpayers, but the provision eliminated the option of filing the actual expense method for employee business vehicle expenses. The lack of this option, combined with the dramatic changes the Internet is having on the mail, specifically on rural letter carriers and their vehicles, is a problem I believe Congress must address.  The mail mix is changing and already Postal Service management has, understandably, encouraged rural letter carriers to purchase larger right-handdrive vehicles, such as Sports Utility Vehicles, SUVs, to handle the increase in parcel loads. Large SUVs are much more expensive than traditional vehicles. So without the ability to use the actual expense method and depreciation, rural letter carriers must use their salaries to cover vehicle expenses. Additionally, the Postal Service has placed 11,000 postal vehicles on rural routes, which means those carriers receive no EMA.  These developments have created a situation that is contrary to the historical Congressional intent of using reimbursement to fund the government service of delivering mail, and also has created an inequitable tax situation for rural letter carriers. If actual business expenses exceed the EMA, a deduction for those expenses should be allowed. To correct this inequity, I am introducing a bill today that reinstates the ability of a rural letter carrier to choose between using the actual expense method for computing the deduction allowable for business use of a vehicle, or using the current practice of deducting the reimbursed EMA expenses.  Rural letter carriers perform a necessary and valuable service and face may changes and challenges in this new Internet era. We must make sure that these public servants receive fair and equitable tax treatment as they perform their essential role in fulfilling the Postal Service's mandate of binding the Nation together.  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Bingaman, Daschle, Bunning, Rockefeller, Snowe, Thomas, Smith of Oregon, Conrad, Graham of Florida, Kerry, Breaux, Lincoln and myself in sponsoring this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1333       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CERTAIN EXPENSES OF RURAL LETTER CARRIERS.       (a) In General.--Section 162(o) of the Internal Revenue      Code of 1986 (relating to treatment of certain reimbursed      expenses of rural mail carriers) is amended by redesignating      paragraph (2) as paragraph (3) and by inserting after      paragraph (1) the following:       ``(2) Special rule where expenses exceed reimbursements.--     Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A), if the expenses incurred by      an employee for the use of a vehicle in performing services      described in paragraph (1) exceed the qualified      reimbursements for such expenses, such excess shall be taken      into account in computing the miscellaneous itemized      deductions of the employee under section 67.''.
