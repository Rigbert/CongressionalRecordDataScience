President, I have spoken on this subject many times on the floor. The people who are affected by violence against women have wondered why the Congress has delayed so long on the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, the bill we passed here in the Senate. If someone is a victim of violence, that person can't understand such delays. So I think it is time for the Senate and the House to come together to pass the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. The other body needs to do what we did overwhelmingly in this Senate.  Earlier this week, I read in the Burlington, VT, Free Press the story of Carmen Tarleton. She is a woman from Thetford, VT. Thetford, VT, is a small, quiet, beautiful little town in our State.  Five years ago, Carmen's estranged husband broke into her home, he beat her with a baseball bat, and he poured industrial strength lye on her, severely burning a great deal of her body and nearly blinding her. Her doctors said she had suffered the most horrific injury a human being could suffer. Today she is still disfigured and continues to experience pain from these injuries of 5 years ago. She is currently awaiting approval for a procedure that could help her get a face transplant. Despite this, Carmen is courageously sharing her story in a book that she has written called Overcome: Burned, Blinded, and Blessed.  Stories such as Carmen's remind me that every day we do not pass VAWA more people are suffering.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the article to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Burlington Free Press,                              Dec, 3, 2012]                Lye Attack Victim Writes of Forgiveness                            (By Lisa Rathke)       Montpelier, VT.--While Carmen Tarleton lay in a hospital      bed, burned, beaten and disfigured by her estranged husband      with injuries that doctors called ``the most horrific injury      a human being could suffer,'' she had vivid dreams.       In one of the most memorable, dozens of doors stretched      around her. ``Life is a choice,'' a voice said. And then the      words appeared one at a time in white across a dark movie      screen: LIFE IS A CHOICE.       Tarleton carried that lesson with her through her ongoing,      daunting and remarkable recovery after her ex broke into her      Theftord home five years ago, beat her with a baseball bat      and poured industrial- strength lye on her, burning most of      her body.       Tarleton, who at age 44 continues to undergo surgeries and      awaits a possible face transplant, has written a book that      will be published in March called ``Overcome: Burned, Blinded      and Blessed.'' She hopes it will speak to abuse victims and      others.       ``I think I can help a whole bunch of people, not just      domestic violence people,'' she said in a recent interview      with The Associated Press. ``I think I can help a whole bunch      of people wherever you are in your life.''       Despite her suffering, she says she's in a better place      than she was before the attack.       ``I'm so much more blessed than I was then,'' she said.       The book starts with Tarleton's decision at 28 to move      across the country from her native Vermont to Los Angeles,      with her two children in tow, to work as a nurse at a UCLA      hospital. There she met Herb Rodgers, whom she eventually      married. The family moved back to Thetford, where her      marriage started to unravel--in part over Rodgers'      dishonesty, Tarleton said.       Tarleton recalls what she now says was a premonition. One      evening when she was about to leave for her night shift at      the hospital, her 12-year-old daughter was sobbing in      bedroom. When she asked what was wrong, her daughter said,      ``Something really, really bad is going to happen to you.''       Eight months later, it did. Rodgers is serving a minimum of      30 years in prison for the June 2007 attack.       When she set out to write the book three years later with      only limited vision in one eye, she stalled when it came time      to explain what Rodgers had done to her that night. She had      to coach herself through it.       ``Alone at my magnifying machine, I felt physically ill      with what I was doing,'' she wrote. ``The experience of      reliving that night, trying to capture every detail as      vividly as I remembered it, was sickening. Halfway through, I      let my pen drop and rushed to my bedroom, the edges of my      limited vision blackening.''       It took her two days to write it. It was scary, but it was      what she wanted to do, she said.       She talked out the rest of the book and recorded it. She      hired Writers of the Round Table Press to write it all down,      including dialogue she had recalled.       ``I was paying attention, because some of it I couldn't      forget if I wanted to,'' she said.       She writes about facing Rodgers in court, how she dealt      with being blind and disfigured, her pain, the help she has      received from her community, family and friends, and how she      came to forgive the man who maimed her so she could get on      with her own life.       ``That's where I feel people get stuck because we don't      have a segment of our society that says just because this      terrible thing happened to you it doesn't have to ruin the      rest of your life,'' she said. ``And I want to be the example      of that because it doesn't.''       Publishing the book was a no-brainer for Writers of the      Round Table Press, which helped Tarleton write it, said vice      president David Cohen.       ``Taking that kind of experience and turning that energy      into something positive and wanting to go out there and      effect change with as much as she had to overcome, to me was      just striking,'' Cohen said.       As she awaits approval for a procedure that could help her      get a face transplant, she looks forward to feeling well      enough to speak publicly again about her ordeal to help      others. She has had several recent surgeries to install a      catheter in her chest and was sick last winter with      hyperthyroidism.       ``When life gives you a big negative situation like I'd      been through, if you can get through that, you can really      find all of the blessings and all of the positive things that      can come out of that,'' she said. ``And I found so much that      I would not go back.''
