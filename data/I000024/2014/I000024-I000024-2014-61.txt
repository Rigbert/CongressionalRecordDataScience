Pratt, who died on July 20, 2009, serving our Nation in Maydan Shahr, Afghanistan. Specialist Pratt, SPC Anthony M. Lightfoot, SPC Andrew J. Roughton, and SGT Gregory Owens, Jr., died of wounds sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near their vehicle followed by an attack from enemy forces using small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.  Dennis was born January 7, 1975, in Waterbury, CT. After graduating high school in Southington, CT, he moved to Arizona, Oklahoma, and then Texas, where he joined the military. He married Michelle Bryant on May 9, 2008 in Lawton, OK.  After completing basic training at Fort Sill, OK, Dennis was assigned to 4th Battalion, 25th Field Artillery (Strike), 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), Fort Drum, NY. A third-generation soldier and a 34-year-old father of three, Dennis was called ``the old man'' among comrades in his unit.  On January 6, 2009, he was deployed to Afghanistan as a field artillery automated tactical data systems specialist and reenlisted while there. ``Dennis wasn't supposed to be at that place at that time, but he always told us that the Army and serving his country was where he wanted to be. He had found his niche in life in the military,'' said his mother.  Funeral services were held July 31, 2009, at the Fort Sill chapel, and he was laid to rest in Fort Sill National Cemetery, Elgin, OK.  Dennis is survived by his wife Michelle, three children, Collin Kessler, Gabrielle Pratt, and Caden Bryant, parents, Jim and Sinammon Pratt, mother and father-in-law, Fred and Margaret Bryant, two brothers, Jim Pratt and wife Staci and their children Miranda, D.J. and Morgan and Kyle Hansan and wife Nicole and their daughter CaLista, one stepsister, Leanna Pratt, and a host of other relatives and friends.  Today we remember Army SPC Dennis J. Pratt, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                Petty Officer 2nd Class Tony M. Randolph  Madam President, I would also like to remember the life and sacrifices of PO2 Tony M. Randolph, who died on July 6, 2009, of injuries sustained when insurgents utilized improvised explosive devices to attack his convoy in Zabul province, Afghanistan.  Tony was born on September 27, 1986, in Santa Rosa, CA. Growing up in Oklahoma, he was a 2005 graduate of Henryetta High School in Henryetta, OK, where he was a star athlete earning all-district honors in football.  ``Tony was a leader. I truly believe he was a natural born leader,'' said Henryetta football coach Kenny Speer. He was known for his toughness. In high school one day, Coach Speer made him run lap after lap. All Tony had to do was say ``yes sir'' for the punishment to end. ``I said, Tony, you say the two magic words to make you stop running. So he looks at me and goes, `Si Senor,' '' said Coach Kenny Speer.  Tony joined the Navy on September 28, 2005, and graduated from boot camp at Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, IL, in December 2005. Other military assignments include Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, VA; Naval Dive and Salvage Training Center in Panama City, FL; Naval Explosive Ordnance Device School at Eglin Air Force Base, FL; and Explosive Ordnance Device Training and Evaluation Unit 1 in San Diego, CA.  He reported to Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit Eight, Sigonella, Sicily, in March 2008 and deployed to Afghanistan in March 2009.  ``Petty Officer Randolph brought an incredible sense of youthful spirit, professionalism and dedication to this unit,'' said CDR Todd Siddall, commanding officer of EODMU 8. ``He will forever be remembered by his fellow Sailors as an example of true service to country and selfless sacrifice.''  Funeral services were held July 15, 2009, at First Baptist Church in Henryetta, OK, and he was laid to rest in Hillcrest Cemetery, Weleetka, OK.  ``He loved his friends. He loved his family. He loved his country. That was Tony,'' said his mother, Peggy Randolph.  Tony is survived by his parents, Fred and Peggy Sue Randolph, his brothers, Shawn and Richard, and his sisters, Susan and Kelly.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Tony's family and friends. He lived a life of love for his family and country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice for our protection and freedom.                   Lance Corporal Jonathan F. Stroud  Madam President, I also wish to remember Marine LCpl Jonathan F. Stroud, who died on July 31, 2009, of injuries sustained when his unit was attacked by insurgents with small arms fire while on foot patrol in Garmsir District, Afghanistan.  Jonathan was born on October 10, 1988, in North Richland Hills, TX. He attended Cashion High School in Cashion, OK, where teachers remember him as exceptionally intelligent. Fellow students remember him as the class clown--goofy, gangly, dorky, the most honest, and one of the nicest guys you could ever meet.  After graduating from high school in 2007 he joined the Marines on April 14, 2008. He was assigned to 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, NC, as a combat engineer.  Funeral services were held on August 8, 2009, and he was laid to rest in Cashion Cemetery, Cashion, OK.  While many tears were shed, there was a brief moment of laughter when Jonathan's final request was played, ``Another One Bites the Dust'' by Queen. The song is to let everybody know that he's still with us and he's still trying to make us happy even after he's gone,'' a friend of his said.  Jonathan is survived by his wife Lacie E. Stroud of Jacksonville, NC, mother Mavis Stroud and Thomas ``Smokey'' Longan of Cashion, OK, sister Marissa L. Stroud of Oklahoma City, OK, father Bill R. Stroud of Bedford, TX, grandparents Virginia Crawford Light and Jim Light of Weatherford, TX, grandparents Bo and Helen Stroud of Hobbs, NM, and numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Jonathan's family and friends. He lived a life of love for his family and country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice for our protection and freedom.                          ____________________
