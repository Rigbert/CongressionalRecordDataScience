Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1778) to provide for equal exchanges of land around the Cascade Reservoir.  The Clerk read as follows:                                S. 1778       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXCHANGES OF LAND EXCESS TO CASCADE RESERVOIR                    RECLAMATION PROJECT.       Section 5 of Public Law 86-92 (73 Stat. 219) is amended by      striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:       ``(b) Land Exchanges.--       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may exchange land of      either class described in subsection (a) for non-Federal land      of not less than approximately equal value, as determined by      an appraisal carried out in accordance with--       ``(A) the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property      Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.);      and       ``(B) the publication entitled `Uniform Appraisal Standards      for Federal Land Acquisitions', as amended by the Interagency      Land Acquisition Conference in consultation with the      Department of Justice.       ``(2) Equalization.--If the land exchanged under paragraph      (1) is not of equal value, the values shall be equalized by      the payment of funds by the Secretary or the grantor, as      appropriate, in an amount equal to the amount by which the      values of the land differ.''.
