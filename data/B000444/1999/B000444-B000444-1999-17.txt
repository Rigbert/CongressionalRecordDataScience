 President, under the daily 24-hour assault of our highly competitive news media, constantly in search of the latest event and the most readily available personality, it would be easy to confuse leadership with celebrity. However, there are in every community, men and women whose names are rarely found in the headlines and whose faces rarely appear on the television screen, but who nevertheless contribute real leadership day in and day out.  In my state of Delaware, one of those invaluable if rarely recognized leaders is Wilmington City Clerk, and Democratic City Chairman, Leo Marshall. A Wilmington native and a lifelong Wilmington resident, Leo Marshall does not often make the morning headlines or the evening broadcast news, but he is easily familiar to many Wilmingtonians because he never joined the migration to the suburbs that drained the energies and economies of many of our older cities--he has lived and served among them for four eventful decades.  Leo Marshall is, in many ways, the ``Mr. Wilmington'' of an older and increasingly diverse city he has helped to guide through the social and economic challenges that have marked our urban landscape from the confrontations of the Sixties to, in Wilmington's case, the dawning rebirth of the Nineties. He would be the last to claim major credit for the city's successes; he will tell you that the city has survived and got to its feet again at the hands of a succession of progressive city administrations--but knowledgeable Wilming-tonians will tell you Leo Marshall has built and maintained the strong political structure that has made progress possible in the relatively small city that is nevertheless Delaware's largest and most thoroughly urban community.  Like another Democrat prominently in the news today, Leo Marshall first came to public notice with a basketball in his hands, but as a proud product of Wilmington's still highly coherent Polish-American community, he was not willing to stop there. He turned his attention to city government, and the same intelligence and fiercely competitive spirit that had been so evident on the basketball court soon marked him as a leader in the rough-and-tumble of city politics.  He was and is a frankly partisan Democrat, and he has made Wilmington a Democratic stronghold in most of our elections; but he has always reserved his most intense partisanship for his city itself. He never loses sight of the city's interests, and he will vigorously defend them against all comers, regardless of party. Those of us who encounter him as Democrats learn quickly, if we expect to enjoy the relationship, that Leo Marshall will almost invariably be found among the most progressive of Democrats when it comes to issues or candidates, local, state or national--but only when he is assured that the city's interests have been taken into constructive consideration. In those cases, he is capable of being a statesman who can help pull a party, a city or a state together; but ifhe feels the city is being attacked or neglected, he takes off the frock coat and rolls up his sleeves--and his opponents rarely enjoy the contest that ensues.  If it sounds like I am characterizing Leo Marshall as an old-fashioned ``city boss,'' there is some truth to that notion; he came to party leadership out of the tradition of bare-knuckle ward politics that was the hallmark of most American cities of the day. But he has survived and successfully carried his leadership into a far different day because he has proved to be a boss with a difference--in a city significantly and persistently marked by rapid and challenging social and economic changes, he has been able to adapt his outlook, his leadership and his party to one major transition after another to the benefit of both his party and his community.  Such adaptable behind-the-scenes party leadership invites a consideration of the current state of our political parties. Much is said these days of how ``entrepreneurial politics'' has reduced our parties to mere shadows of their former selves, and those of us who must regularly place our records and our hopes for the future before the judgment of our constituents are well aware that that analysis comes uncomfortably close to the truth. Replacing party conventions with primary elections, struggling to meet the staggering costs of campaigning and coping with a swollen press corps that dogs our tracks at all seasons has inevitably thrown onto the shoulders of individual candidates much of the burden that historically was borne by the political parties.  But we should not let that fact blind us to the continuing contribution our political parties make to our national life. They remain the institutions that embody the political values we place before the voters when we campaign for office. They still provide the structure upon which our whole political system is based. They may not wield the overwhelming political influence they once possessed--and most of us would agree that they should not--but they are not without identity, they are not without purpose, and they are not without continuing value. They deserve our continuing attention, and leaders who maintain them to serve our nation's political life--leaders like Leo Marshall who have adapted those parties to the realities of our day--deserve our thanks and our admiration.  Mr. President, the great American humorist Will Rogers was as wise as he was amusing, and never more so than when he said, ``God will look you over, not for medals, diplomas or degrees-- but for scars!'' Wilmington's Leo Marshall need fear no such examination; he bears the honorable scars of many a political battle, all of them acquired in the service of his city and his party, but also on behalf of his state and nation. He does not often make the headlines, but he has made his mark on the history of his community, and that is the truest legacy of leadership.                          ____________________
