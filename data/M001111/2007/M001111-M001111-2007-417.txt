 President, I regretfully inform the Senator at this point we are not setting aside amendments until we have disposed of or determined how we are going to dispose of some of the other amendments that are in front of us. I would be happy to let the Senator speak on the amendment at this time. We are going to object until we have a way to proceed forward with the amendments that have been offered.
