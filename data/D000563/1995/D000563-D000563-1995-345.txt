 The chairman from Louisiana has been speaking to us in subcommittee for the last several weeks about what we are going to do with all the money we are saving tonight, all the money we are saving by cutting these programs. The chairman has given several different explanations.  I think tonight finally we are down to one simple explanation: About $5 billion or so is going to disaster relief, primarily in California. The remainder is going to go to deficit reduction.  This is a new development. All of you who are following the contract, punching out the holes, there is a question tonight about the Republican tax plan. All of a sudden this tax plan that they love so much they are walking away from. Why would they walk away from a tax cut? Could it be the publicity that they have been getting, as Americans take a closer look at the Republican tax cut and find out that the benefits are, once again, under the Republican plan going to a privileged few?  Take a look at the capital gains tax cuts. If you happened to be making less than $100,000, the Republicans have in store for you 26 dollars and 5 cents. But if you happen to be one of those families making over $100,000, guess what the Republicans have to offer you, $1,223, too much money for the people who do not need it.  But where do they come up with this money? They come up with it by cutting critical programs, absolutely critical programs that are important for people all around America.                              {time}  2030
