 REID. Sure.  Mr. McCONNELL. I never served in the House of Representatives, but my question is--it strikes me, I would say to my good friend, the majority leader, that he is attempting to act as if he is chairman of the Rules Committee in the House in determining what amendments would be allowed. Under this filling-up-the-tree process, where the majority leader is then positioned in order to allow the tree to be open and select amendments, is it not the case that my definition of ``open'' would probably not meet yours in the sense that you would be, yourself, selecting which amendments would be allowed?
