I thank Senator Hatch, the Ranking Republican Member of the Judiciary Committee, for his hard work and support of this legislation.  The last time Congress properly authorized spending for the entire Department of Justice, ``DOJ'' or the``Department'', was in 1979. Congress extended that authorization in 1980 and 1981. Since then, Congress has not passed nor has the President signed an authorization bill for the Department. In fact, there are a number of years where Congress failed to consider any Department authorization bill. This 21-year failure to properly reauthorize the Department has forced the appropriations committees in both houses to reauthorize and appropriate money.  We have ceded the authorization power to the appropriators for too long. Our bipartisan legislation is an attempt to reaffirm the authorizing authority and responsibility of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. I commend Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee for working in a bipartisan manner to pass similar legislation in the House of Representatives.  The ``21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act,'' is a comprehensive authorization of the Department based on H.R. 2215 as passed by the House of Representatives on July 23, 2001. Our bipartisan legislation contains four titles which authorize appropriations for the Department for fiscal year 2002, provide permanent enabling authorities which will allow the Department to efficiently carry out its mission, clarify and harmonize existing statutory authority, and repeal obsolete statutory authorities. The bill establishes certain reporting requirements and other mechanisms, such as DOJ Inspector General authority to investigate allegations of misconduct by employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), intended to better enable the Congress and the Department to oversee the operations of the Department. Finally, the bill creates a separate Violence Against Women Office to combat domestic violence.  Title I authorizes appropriations for the major components of the Department for fiscal year 2002. The authorization mirrors the President's request regarding the Department except in two areas. First, the bill increased the President's request for the DOJ Inspector General by $10 million. This is necessary because the Committee is concerned about the severe downsizing of that office and the need for oversight, particularly of the FBI, at the Department. Second, the bill authorizes at least $10 million for the investigation and prosecution of intellectual property crimes, including software counterfeiting crimes and crimes identified in the No Electronic Theft, NET, Act, Public Law 105-147. The American copyright industry is the largest exporter of goods from the United States, employing more than 7 million Americans, and these additional funds are needed to strengthen the resources available to DOJ and the FBI to investigate and prosecute cyberpiracy.  The bill does not contain an authorization for appropriations for several unauthorized grant programs. Senator Hatch and I have decided to review each of these expired programs and authorize them as needed.  In addition, Title I authorizes $9 million in FY 2002 to add an additional Assistant United States Attorney in each of the 94 U.S. Attorney Offices to implement part of the Administration's Project Safe Neighborhoods proposal to reduce school gun violence across the nation. These prosecutors will assist in targeting juveniles who obtain weapons and commit violent crimes, as well as the adults who place firearms in the hands of juveniles.  Title II permanently establishes a clear set of authorities that the Department may rely on to use appropriated funds, including establishing permitted uses of appropriated funds by the Attorney General for Fees and Expenses of Witnesses, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal Prison System, and the Detention Trustee. Title II also establishes new reporting requirements which are intended to enhance Congressional oversight of the Department, including new reporting requirements for information about the enforcement of existing laws, for information regarding the Office of Justice Programs, OJP, and the submission of other reports, required by existing law, to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Section 206(e) expands an existing reporting requirement regarding copyright infringement cases. Title II also establishes a counterterrorism fund and provides the Attorney General with additional authority to strengthen law enforcement operations.  Title III repeals outdated and open-ended statutes, requires the submission of an annual authorization bill to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and provides states with flexibility to use existing Truth-In-Sentencing and Violent Offender Incarceration Grants to account for juveniles being housed in adult prison facilities. Title III requires the Department to submit to Congress studies on untested rape examination kits, and the allocation of funds, personnel, and workloads for each office of U.S. Attorney and each division of the Department.  Section 305 requires the Attorney General and Director of the FBI to provide the House and Senate Judiciary Committees with a detailed report on the use of DCS 1000, also known as Carnivore, and other similar Internet surveillance systems. Many have raised legitimate privacy concerns with Carnivore. Congress needs to know the facts about Carnivore to find a way to balance the needs of law enforcement investigators with the privacy interests of all Americans.  In addition, Title III provides new oversight and reporting requirements for the FBI and other activities conducted by the Justice Department. Specifically, section 308 codifies the Attorney General's order of July 11, 2001, which revised Department of Justice's regulations concerning the Inspector General. The section insures that the Inspector General for the Department of Justice has the authority to decide whether a particular allegation of misconduct by Department of Justice personnel, including employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration, should be investigated by the Inspector General or by the internal affairs unit of the appropriate component of the Department of Justice.  Section 309 requires the Attorney General to submit a report and recommendation to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on whether there should be established an office of Inspector General for the FBI or an office of Deputy Inspector General for the FBI that would be responsible for supervising independent oversight of programs and operations of the FBI.  Title IV establishes a Violence Against Women Office (VAWO) within the Justice Department. The VAWO is headed by a Director, who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In addition, Title IV enumerates duties and responsibilities of the Director, requires the Attorney General to ensure VAWO is adequately staffed and authorizes appropriations for the VAWO.  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, Congressman Sensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers to bring the important business of re-authorizing the Department back before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. Clearly, regular reauthorization of the Department should be part and parcel of the Committees' traditional role in overseeing the Department's activities. Swift passage into law of the ``21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act'' will be a significant step toward restoring our oversight role.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                S. 1319       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Extended assignment incentive       ``(a) The head of an Executive agency may pay an extended      assignment incentive to an employee if--       ``(1) the employee has completed at least 2 years of      continuous service in 1 or more civil service positions      located in a territory or possession of the United States,      the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of the      Northern Mariana Islands;       ``(2) the agency determines that replacing the employee      with another employee possessing the required qualifications      and experience would be difficult; and       ``(3) the agency determines it is in the best interest of      the Government to encourage the employee to complete a      specified additional period of employment with the agency in      the territory or possession, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico      or Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, except that      the total amount of service performed in a particular      territory, commonwealth, or possession under 1 or more      agreements established under this section may not exceed 5      years.       ``(b) The sum of extended assignment incentive payments for      a service period may not exceed the greater of--       ``(1) an amount equal to 25 percent of the annual rate of      basic pay of the employee at the beginning of the service      period, times the number of years in the service period; or       ``(2) $15,000 per year in the service period.       ``(c)(1) Payment of an extended assignment incentive shall      be contingent upon the employee entering into a written      agreement with the agency specifying the period of service      and other terms and conditions under which the extended      assignment incentive is payable.       ``(2) The agreement shall set forth the method of payment,      including any use of an initial lump-sum payment, installment      payments, or a final lump-sum payment upon completion of the      entire period of service.       ``(3) The agreement shall describe the conditions under      which the extended assignment incentive may be canceled prior      to the completion of agreed-upon service period and the      effect of the cancellation. The agreement shall require that      if, at the time of cancellation of the incentive, the      employee has received incentive payments which exceed the      amount which bears the same relationship to the total amount      to be paid under the agreement as the completed service      period bears to the agreed-upon service period, the employee      shall repay that excess amount, at a minimum, except that an      employee who is involuntarily reassigned to a position      stationed outside the territory, commonwealth, or possession      or involuntarily separated (not for cause on charges of      misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency) may not be required      to repay any excess amounts.       ``(d) An agency may not put an extended assignment      incentive into effect during a period in which the employee      is fulfilling a recruitment or relocation bonus service      agreement under section 5753 or for which an employee is      receiving a retention allowance under section 5754.       ``(e) Extended assignment incentive payments may not be      considered part of the basic pay of an employee.       ``(f) The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe      regulations for the administration of this section, including      regulations on an employee's entitlement to retain or receive      incentive payments when an agreement is canceled. Neither      this section nor implementing regulations may impair any      agency's independent authority to administratively determine      compensation for a class of its employees.''; and       (2) in the analysis by adding at the end the following:``5757. Extended assignment incentive.''.

Each agency shall maintain such records and report      such information, including the number and size of incentive      offers made and accepted or declined by geographic location      and occupation, in such format and at such times as the      Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, for use in      preparing the report.

Short title and table of contents       Section 1 provides that the short title of the Act shall be      the ``21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations      Authorization Act.'' It also contains a table of contents.     Title I--Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2002     Section 101. Specific sums authorized to be appropriated       Section 101 authorizes appropriations to carry out the work      of the various components of the Department of Justice for      fiscal year 2002. The structure of Title I mirrors the      organization of the annual Commerce-Justice-State, CJS,      appropriations bill and the President's budget request. The      bill authorizes the appropriations of amounts requested by      the President in most accounts. The accounts, and the      activities and components that each would fund, are as      follows:       General Administration--$93,433,000--For the leadership      offices of the Department, including the offices of the      Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, and the Justice      Management Division, Executive Support program, Intelligence      Policy, Office of Professional Responsibility, and General      Administration.       Administrative Review and Appeals--$178,499,000--For the      Executive Office for Immigration Review and the Office of the      Pardon Attorney.

This amount is $10 million above the      President's Request. The IG's office has been severely      downsized over the last several years from approximately 460      to 360 full-time equivalents. Oversight is a priority and      this level of funding should get the IG back on the path of      meeting the audit and oversight needs of the Department. The      Committee expects that the OIG will substantially increase      its oversight of the FBI, INS, and the Department's grant      programs.

Federal Bureau of Investigation--$3,507,109,000--For the      detection, investigation, and prosecution of crimes against      the United States. The FBI also plays a primary role in the      protection of the United States from foreign intelligence      activities and investigating and preventing acts of terrorism      against the United States.       United States Marshals Service--$626,439,000--To protect      the Federal courts and its personnel and to ensure the      effective operation of the federal judicial system, of which      no more than $6,621,000 may be used for construction.
