Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to speak to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) this morning. He thanked the leadership for the moment of silence, and also the staffs of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and my staff, and also his staff has been terrific in putting together this event on, obviously, a pretty short notice.  I also want to thank Northwest Airlines which has bent over backwards to allow us to charter a plane to fly to Wisconsin tomorrow. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) also indicated he wanted me to thank the leadership for postponing votes allowing Members to be able to attend the service tomorrow afternoon and evening.  I would just like to thank the Dean of the House for this 5 minutes and would ask Members that would like to attend the service tomorrow if they could contact either the office of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) or my office. We will make sure that those arrangements are taken care of.
