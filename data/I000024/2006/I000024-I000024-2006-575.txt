Samuel Alito is not a racist, not a rightwing extremist who believes in an executive branch with sole authority and rules only in favor of the powerful but a thoughtful, mainstream, fair, experienced interpreter of the Constitution. He is a good guy. I have heard many people say that he is probably one of the most qualified persons ever to be nominated for this High Court. Those liberal Senators who are desperately grasping at any straw to find justification to vote against Judge Alito, they have their litmus test. In order to be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, a judge must embrace all of the leftwing's extremist agenda, an agenda that is so unpopular in America that the American people reject it, and it must be legislated from the bench. That is the problem they have.  When my service in the Senate is over, one of the greatest honors I will have had, for the sake of America andfor the sake of my 20 kids and grandkids, is to vote to confirm Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.  I yield the floor.
