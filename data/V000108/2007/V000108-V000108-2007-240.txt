On Sunday, March 4, 2007, Anita, a member of the Indiana General Assembly for the past 27 years, passed away at the age of 86 after a courageous battle with breast cancer. Known for her commitment to preserving the rights of all citizens, Anita will surely be missed by her family, friends, and the people she so loyally served.  Though well-known for her career as a public servant, Anita's life of service to her fellow citizens goes far beyond her impressive career as an elected official. A revered scholar, Anita received her bachelor's degree from Kent State University and a law degree from the McKinley School of Law, as well as a master's degree from Purdue University and a master's degree and doctorate degree from the University of Notre Dame. It should come as no surprise, then, that Anita chose to use her vast knowledge to give back to her community by becoming an educator. Anita, who taught political science classes at Purdue University North Central for many years, touched and enriched the lives of her students, many of whom went on to very successful careers in an array of fields. As an instructor, she taught her students with the same passion, commitment, and energy that she demonstrated as a member of the Indiana General Assembly. Her passion for teaching and for challenging her students will forever be remembered, and her unwavering commitment to the betterment of society will forever live in the hearts and minds of those she mentored.  First elected to the Indiana General Assembly as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives in 1980, it was apparent upon her arrival that a true champion of civil rights had come to Indianapolis. Following a remarkable career as a State Representative, Anita was elected to the State Senate in 1992. As a member of both the House and Senate, Anita served on many committees, and prior to her passing, she was the ranking member on the Senate's Pension and Labor Committee, where she fought tirelessly for workers' rights. Additionally, though she received many awards and accolades for her efforts in promoting and preserving civil rights, Anita has the distinct honor of being the first woman to act as House Speaker in the history of the State of Indiana.  Throughout her illustrious career, aside from being known as an eloquent speaker, Anita was often referred to as the ``Conscience of the General Assembly,'' Undoubtedly, this moniker stemmed from her desire to better society through supporting legislation aimed at what is just and what is right. This desire for equality and inclusion was demonstrated time and time again, even in her final speech from the podium, when she reminded her colleagues that the State constitution was intended to preserve rights, not to take them away.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring State Senator Anita Bowser for her outstanding devotion to her community and the State of Indiana. Her unselfish and lifelong dedication to her family, friends, students, and those she so faithfully served in her elected positions is worthy of the highest commendation. Anita's selflessness and her commitment to preserving the rights of all people are an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to have called her my friend.                          ____________________
