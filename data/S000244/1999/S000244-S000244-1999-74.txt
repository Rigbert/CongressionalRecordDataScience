Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me this time.  Let me just put a word of procedural caution relative to how this bill is being considered. All three of the provisions of this bill have merit and should be enacted into law on their own. Two of them are private bills in nature, the Kerr-McGee settlement and the Menominee Indian Tribe settlement, and the other provision is public in nature relative to disseminating on the Internet a do-it-yourself kit on how individuals can make their own weapons of mass destruction. So they all should become law, and I support this legislation today.  However, I am disturbed at the practice of the other body in mixing public and private legislation in the same bill, and I would hope that the consideration of this bill today as a mixture of both public legislation and private legislation will not be viewed as a precedent for future mixings by either this body or the other body.  I would hope that this motion to suspend the rules will be overwhelmingly agreed to so that we can get these three items out of the way and enacted into law, but I would hope we would be a little bit more careful procedurally as we deal with both public and private legislation in the future.
