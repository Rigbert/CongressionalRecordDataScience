Speaker, it is with great pleasure and profound respect that I recognize First United Methodist Church of Crown Point as its congregation and church leaders join together in celebration of its 175th anniversary. Bishop Michael Coyner, Reverend Mark Wilkins, Senior Pastor, Reverend Tom Shanahan, Associate Pastor, and the congregation will be commemorating this momentous milestone with a celebratory church service and reception on Sunday, October 13, 2013.   First United Methodist Church of Crown Point was founded in 1938 by Isaac Stagg. The first church services were held in log cabin homes. In 1887, the first church building was completed in Crown Point and became the place of worship for parishioners for many years. By 1957, a new church building was completed and remains the home of First United Methodist Church of Crown Point today. Throughout the years, more than seventy ministers have served as leaders of the church, and the devoted congregation has grown to over 800 members. With the increase in membership, the church has been able to organize numerous programs that have played a major role in the church's success. These remarkable programs include the United Methodist Women's Group, the Epworth League, a teen-age youth group, Methodist Men, Caring Cooks and the Older Adult Ministry.   The leaders and parishioners of First United Methodist Church of Crown Point touch the lives of countless individuals through their compassionate service, especially to those most in need. Over the years, they have come to the aid of many through their selfless support to various charitable organizations, including Meals On Wheels, Saint Jude Home, Adopt a Family at Christmas, and Adopt a Highway. The church has also supported missionaries both nationally and abroad, and is currently raising funds to help build a church in Roatan, Honduras.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the church leaders and congregation of First United Methodist Church of Crown Point for their exceptional community service and congratulating the church on its 175th anniversary. The outstanding work of this truly admirable congregation continues to touch lives in Northwest Indiana and far beyond, and for their selfless service, the leadership and members at First United Methodist Church of Crown Point are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
