President, many Americans are benefiting from today's robust economy--unemployment is down, the stock market is up and homeownership is at record levels.  Sounds good. But while homeownership levels are up for some, for others, the idea of owning a home is about as realistic as winning the lottery.  For millions of working families, paying for the house of their dreams too often turns into a financial nightmare. Homeownership should not be reserved for the wealthiest in our society, but should be within the grasp of every working man and woman.  Families with incomes below $25,000 generally cannot afford rent--much less monthly mortgage payments on most homes. Some of these are the people who keep our streets safe, fight fires and teach our children, people who play vital roles in our community. They deserve to own their own homes in the communities they know so well and work so hard to improve.  Working families should be able to invest in themselves and in their families rather than put their hard-earned income every month into rent paid to someone else. Houses do more than provide shelter. Houses become homes. They allow adults a chance to become established. They give children a sense of security. They allow small towns to function and big cities to endure.  It is no wonder then that we value homeownership in this country. Owning a home is a part of our culture, it's what we call ``the American dream.'' Still, this dream is out of the reach of many Americans. In Oregon, where more than 75 percent of jobs do not pay a living wage for a single parent, housing costs have skyrocketed, forcing nearly half of Oregon renters to spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing and utilities. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's guidelines, if someone is spending more than 30 percent of his or her income on housing, they start cutting into other basic needs such as putting food on the table, taking elderly parents to the doctor or clothing kids for school.  People should not have to choose between feeding their kids or keeping a roof over their heads. The bill that I am introducing, ``The Promoting Housing Affordability for Working Families Act of 1999,'' will help communities remove the barriers to affordable housing, so working families will not have to make this choice. Many factors, such as excessive rules and regulations, add to the price of a house. Cities and states must work together to remove these barriers. By working together, they can free up rental housing for those who cannot afford to buy a home while making the purchase of a first home easier for folks who have been previously denied the opportunity.  This bill addresses the problem on three fronts. First, it brings communities together to form ``barrier removal councils'' so they can identify problems to housing affordability and begin implementing solutions.  Second, the bill requires Federal agencies to examine the impact of their regulations on the cost of housing. Determining this information through a ``housing impact analysis'' at the outset will save states, communities and, ultimately, families a lot of hassle down the road.  Third, it makes homeownership possible for people who help our communities thrive--teachers, police officers, fire fighters and other public employees. Through incentives such as downpayment assistance and closing cost flexibility this bill helps people live in the communities they serve.  Many working families are ready for their first home. They are starting to raise families, move up the ladder at work and are prepared to take on the responsibilities of homeownership. But when they get to the front door, they cannot step over the threshold because they are tied up in unnecessary regulation that drives up home prices. The ``Promoting Housing Affordability for Working Families Act of 1999'' will help these families untangle this regulatory knot and unlock the door to their first home.                                 ______                                       By
