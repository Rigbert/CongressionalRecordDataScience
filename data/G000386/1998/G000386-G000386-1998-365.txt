 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to further protect taxpayer rights.  Mr. President, I have long championed taxpayer rights. In 1989, I co-authored the first ever taxpayer bill of rights with Senator David Pryor of Arkansas. We joined forces again in 1996 to pass the sequel known as T2, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2. Yet, my work as a member of the National Commission on the Restructuring of the IRS and as a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee led me to believe that we need even more taxpayer protections. In addition, we need to make a concerted effort to educate taxpayers of their rights and the IRS tax procedures.  The findings of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, of which I was a member, recommended increasing taxpayer rights. The Senate Finance Committee recently concluded months of hearings that demonstrated to us, and to the public, that American taxpayers are being treated unfairly by the IRS. I cannot sit idly by and let this happen to the American people.  For a start, last year Senator Kerrey and I introduced legislation that would implement the Restructuring Commission's proposals, including the taxpayer rights recommendations. The House of Representatives, when considering identical legislation, weakened some of the provisions. To its credit, the House also added some strong, imaginative protections in return. I applaud everyone who works to increase taxpayer rights, and to give the unrepresented taxpayer a louder voice against the IRS.  With introduction of this legislation, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, or T3, I am saying that I want to see the strongest taxpayer protections possible in any Senate-passed IRS restructuring legislation. The bill I am introducing today, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, contains the strongest provisions from both the Kerrey-Grassley bill and from the House-passed bill, and also some additional protections.  This bill takes a two-pronged approach to assure taxpayer rights. First, it increases basic taxpayer rights. It helps place a check on IRS collection actions. It gets the IRS off the back of delinquent taxpayers who are making good faith efforts to resolve disputes, and it prohibits the IRS from harassing and abusing taxpayers. Specifically, it requires the IRS to obtain court approval before seizing taxpayer property or belongings. Further, it requires that the levy is reasonable. If the IRS is levying a principal residence or business, then the IRS must have exhausted all other payment options, including the use of installment agreements. It also increases taxpayer rights by allowing honest citizens to sue the IRS when its employees negligently disregard provisions of the code or regulations.  It also requires the IRS to enter into installment agreements for tax liability that is less than $10,000, if the taxpayer has not failed to file or pay taxes in the last 5 years, and has no prior installment agreements. It also requires the Commissioner to catalog and review taxpayer complaints of misconduct by IRS employees, and develop procedures for review and discipline. It expands the grounds on which taxpayers can sue the IRS for civil damages to include negligent actions.These are only a few of this bill's provisions.  Another inequity that is solved is the difference between interest on tax overpayments and underpayments. Currently, the IRS charges you more in interest on money you owe to it, than it gives you on money that it owes you. This is simply not fair.  Another unfairness that occurs is that the IRS does not have to live by the same collection rules that creditors live by. My bill prohibits the IRS from communicating with a delinquent taxpayer at any unusual time or place, generally prohibiting telephone calls other than between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. It also prohibits the IRS from harassing or abusing delinquent taxpayers.  The second prong of my bill increases taxpayer education, notice and resources. Taxpayers must be aware of their rights in order to take advantage of them. Recent hearings have exposed IRS strategies that target the little guy by using his lack of knowledge about the process and about his rights against him. I intend to bring this unjust practice to an end. My bill establishes a 24-hour a day, toll-free taxpayer help line. This help line must be staffed at all times by a person trained in helping individual taxpayers, and during regular business hours by a person trained to help small businesses. All paper communications received from the IRS must prominently display this phone number, as well as the number of the local taxpayer advocate, low-income taxpayer clinics and the toll-free number for taxpayers to register complaints of misconduct by IRS employees.  In addition, the IRS must inform taxpayers of their rights and IRS processes. This includes notice at the time of an interview, in a first notice of appeal, and in other contacts with the IRS. Taxpayers also must be notified of their right to refuse to extend the statute of limitations when the IRS asks the taxpayer to extend this time.  Mr. President, this bill sends a clear signal to the IRS: put the customer first. Blame only those who are guilty. To this end, my bill is missing one provision that is vital to taxpayer rights reform. Today, in addition to introducing my own freestanding legislation, I am adding myself as a cosponsor to Senator D'Amato's innocent spouse reform bill. Innocent spouses are caught in the trap of joint and several liability and are unfairly saddled with another's tax debt. If we are truly trying to bring fairness and equity to the American tax system, then strong, and retroactive innocent spouse reform must be a part of any IRS reform bill.  Finally, I'll be working during Finance Committee and Senate consideration of IRS reform legislation to give taxpayers the rights they deserve. This bill, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, is the first step in this direction. Let the word ring clear: The era of IRS bullying is over.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
