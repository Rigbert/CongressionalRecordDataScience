 President, I have had the opportunity over the last almost 24 hours now to hear from a wide swath of our Democratic conference speak out against the nomination because they feel so strongly that in this country public education is a core principle. I know a number of my colleagues will be participating with me in these last few minutes, but I want to thank, again, everyone who has written, who has called in, who has expressed their opinion on this critical nominee that this President tapped to oversee education policy.
