                             {time}  1315  The problem is--and I say this honestly, and I think most Members know--if I thought you had asked for a vote and the Speaker had not recognized that vote--I was sitting right here. I was not distracted, and I was surprised that a vote was not asked for because I understand that most, if not all, of you were not for opening up the government.  The fact of the matter is that a vote was not asked for. We have now gone through business, and we put ourselves in a very difficult position. But I cannot agree to a proposition where I have told Members: No, you can go catch your plane. Some had 1:30s, and they left right at the dot of 1. I don't know whether they are going to make it.  And, you know, we are in a bad situation, but I cannot agree to a unanimous consent that is going to require our Members to come back from wherever they are. I don't know that they are on planes yet, but they are going to be on them shortly.  And both sides have that problem. I think you probably have that problem anyway. And, very frankly, I am absolutely convinced the outcome would be no different.  The problem is so many of your Members wanted to vote against the proposition--I understand that--and I would like to give them that opportunity. I am not in a position to do so, and I feel badly about that, but that is the position I made.
