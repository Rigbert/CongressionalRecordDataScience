President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, the committee amendment, as amended, be agreed to, and the bill be read the third time. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the House companion bill, H.R. 2130, all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1561, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof. I further ask that the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the amendment to the title be agreed to, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record. Finally, I ask that S. 1561 be placed back on the calendar.
