President, shortly after the Senate recessed in September, a compelling article was published in the Burlington Free Press which I would like to share with this Senate.  John Ewing is a true public servant in Vermont. His vision and ability to work with diverse groups to protect Vermont's environment has been an inspiration to many. His September 30, 2012, column entitled, ``I Believe'' reviews the important steps Vermont has taken to achieve smart growth to help our natural resources and the State's economy hand in hand. John also looks to the future and what we must continue to do in Vermont to ensure we are planning for our best future possible with vibrant communities, a working landscape, and the natural beauty of our open spaces. Vermonters have a history of approaching these issues in a collaborative and objective fashion and I know that if we continue to do that we will be able to move Vermont forward to a bright and sustainable future.  John's column is a roadmap to how States can protect their natural heritage while maintaining their economic vitality. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this column be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 30, 2012] I Believe: ``Economic Vitality and Protecting Natural Heritage Are Not                          at All Incompatible''                           (By John T. Ewing)       Vermont is defined by its natural beauty, its towns and      villages and its working landscape. But the question always      remains: Can Vermont encourage growth, provide jobs and at      the same time retain these special qualities? Will we be able      to avoid the negative impacts of unplanned growth and      suburbanization?       When I first came to Vermont in the 1950s, the site of the      Sheraton Hotel on Williston Road beyond the University of      Vermont was a dairy farm. Burlington had three hardware      stores, and its banks stayed open on Friday nights to      accommodate the farmers who came to town.       So much has changed. And yet Vermont has worked hard to      retain its traditional settlement patterns--its compact      communities and a healthy working landscape.       State policy has long recognized the need to protect these      special qualities. The principle of ``compact settlement and      a working landscape'' has been imbedded as an official vision      since the 1960s. Act 250, with its set of principles to guide      growth, was enacted in 1972. The Vermont Housing and      Conservation Trust Fund was enacted in 1987 to pay for the      conservation of farms and natural areas, and to invest in      affordable housing in our villages and downtowns.       Under Gov. Madeleine Kunin, several efforts were made to      strengthen state and community planning, and under Gov.      Howard Dean, the state provided substantial funding to      conserve farms, forests and natural areas. Recently the      Legislature enacted downtown legislation and growth centers      to encourage growth in and around existing population centers      and towns.       However, not all is rosy. As I traveled across the state as      chairman of the Environmental Board in the late 1990s, the      suburbanization of Vermont was all too clear in certain      areas. So we founded the nonprofit Smart Growth Vermont      (originally named the Vermont Forum on Sprawl) in 1998. Our      aim was to work with the administration and the Legislature      to better preserve our heritage, and to assist local      communities in their planning and regulatory functions to      more effectively guide their growth. This ``smart growth''      organization has now been merged into the Vermont Natural      Resources Council, where its director, Brian Shupe, and his      staff are well positioned to carry forward the initiatives      and the tools we developed, and to work with individual      towns.       The smart growth movement believes that the twin goals of      economic vitality and the protection of our natural heritage      are not at all incompatible. In fact, much of the success of      Vermont is attributable to its beauty and special qualities,      supporting all facets of economic activity: tourism, farming,      businesses and jobs all integrated so that there is no need      to sacrifice our basic values.       We are blessed in Vermont with so many organizations      working together to achieve these goals. I doubt that any      state is so well served by the quality of its leaders and its      organizations. I have already mentioned the Vermont Natural      Resources Council, which just celebrated its 50th      anniversary; a sampling of other groups include:       Land trusts, such as the Vermont Land Trust and many of its      local counterparts.       Conservation organizations: the Nature Conservancy and      countless similar groups.       Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility.       Preservation Trust of Vermont.       The Vermont Council on Rural Development and its initiative      on the working landscape.       The housing nonprofits, exemplified by the Champlain      Housing Trust.       The ``buy local'' food movement, which is so important in      ensuring that our land resources are used productively.       There's also the important Vermont Housing and Conservation      Board, which over the years has contributed to the      development or protection of:        10,750 permanently affordable housing units.       144,000 acres of agricultural lands.       253,000 acres of natural areas and recreation.       57 downtown historic properties.       And most importantly, there are the local planning      commissions, zoning boards and town councils that are on the      front line in confronting the complex proposals in their      communities.       There always will be apparent conflict between growth and      preserving the Vermont that we cherish. A current example      involves the proposals for industrial wind power, fields of      solar collectors, and bio-mass. There is an obvious conflict      with those who cherish our ridgelines, mountains, forests and      fields.       I believe these tensions can be relieved if we correct the      current lack of planning and develop a more impartial      regulatory system. As we have done in the past on other      issues, Vermont can integrate the need for renewable energy      with the environment if we provide the planning, systems for      approval and opportunity for citizen involvement.       Compact and vibrant communities, natural beauty and a      working landscape: I believe we     should never allow these special qualities to be eroded and      lost; they are what define Vermont. But we have a history of      addressing these issues in an objective and collaborative      manner--that also is what defines Vermont.                          ____________________
