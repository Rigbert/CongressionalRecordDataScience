President, I rise today to remember a young man from Illinois whose future was full of promise and hope. Last summer, 18-year-old Brett Karlin of Buffalo Grove, IL, was anticipating a summer of youthful fun. Just weeks after his graduation from Adlai E. Stevenson High School, on July 30, 2004, Brett and his best friend Andy set out on a fateful drive through the outskirts of a neighboring suburban town. Neither Andy nor Brett was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and Brett's seatbelt was fastened, but it was little help as they raced over the posted 30-mile-per-hour speed limit. As they pushed the speedometer of the Honda Accord they were driving to 112 miles per hour, the car skidded out of control and collided with a tree. The crash left twisted metal, protruding shards of shattered glass, and a head trauma that cost Brett his life 6 days later. A reckless pastime gone awry had cut a promising life short and left a grieving family in its wake.  Unfortunately, tragedies like Brett's occur each day. According to a 2003 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 4,700 U.S. teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 died of injuries caused by motor vehicle crashes in 2001. In my home State, teenagers make up only 6 percent of all Illinois drivers, but they account for 16 percent of all crash fatalities. We must work to prevent these tragic losses, and one of the ways we can do that is by encouraging legislators, teachers, and parents to educate America's teenage drivers about driver safety.  To memorialize Brett's life, Brett's father, Michael Karlin, founded the Brakes for Brett nonprofit organization. Through peer presentations to high schools and religious and community groups, and by maintaining an informational Web site, Mr. Karlin, Andy, and other friends of Brett educate young adults about the dangers associated with reckless driving. I commend Mr. Karlin and those who collaborate with the Brakes for Brett organization for their work to save the lives of young drivers.  Together, we can work to alert teens to the hazards associated with speeding and joyriding, including its social, emotional, psychological, and financial effects.  In 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated that the economic costs of both fatal and nonfatal police-reported crashes involving drivers age 15 to 20 were approximately $40.8 billion. Our Nationbears nearly three-fourths of these costs, primarily through medical expenses, increased insurance premiums, taxes, and lost worker productivity.  Yet these costs pale in comparison to the agony endured by parents, families, and friends of a teen driver whose life ends tragically and prematurely.  Brett Karlin's family, despite their immense pain and grief, made the generous decision to donate Brett's organs, providing the opportunity for others to live. That opportunity to give the gift of life often comes in the wake of sudden tragedy. When families embrace that opportunity, organ donation often provides renewed hope for the donor's family as well as for the recipients whose lives are saved by the donation.  A new person is added to the national organ donation waiting list in America every 13 minutes, and sadly, 17 people each day die waiting for transplants that cannot take place because of the shortage of donated organs. Illinois is fortunate to have the country's largest donor registry with more than 6 million participants. Although tremendous strides in promoting organ donation have been made, more than 320 Illinois residents died in 2004 while waiting for an organ transplant.  I commend Brakes for Brett for its valuable educational efforts. Today we remember Brett Karlin's life and honor him by recommitting ourselves to teen driver safety education and organ donation. Through these and similar efforts, we can make great strides to preserve young lives that might otherwise be lost.                          ____________________[Pages S9273-S9274]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       IN MEMORY OF BRETT KARLIN
