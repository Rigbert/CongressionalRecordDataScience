 He is absolutely accurate. I am not suggesting in any way that any of the 131 programs listed by GAO would fall to his amendment in any way.  What I am suggesting is, the very compelling argument he makes, when examined, is not as compelling as it appears. And that is, I believe he offered those charts as evidence that we were already doing a great deal on the prevention side.  He is not against prevention. I am not suggesting that either. But he is basically suggesting, as many others have, that we are already doing this massive effort, totaling about $4 billion and 131 programs, to deal with prevention. He believes that what my friends from South Carolina and New Hampshire did by adding $50 million for more prevention is misplaced and it should be placed on the enforcement side of the equation.  The reason I went through in great detail why it is really only about 40 programs and really only about $400 million is to make the point that we are not doing nearly enough on prevention, and to take this paltry sum of $50 million out of prevention, as proposed by my friends on the Appropriations Committee, and put it into enforcement would be a misallocation of a limited number of resources. That is the overall point.  Secondly, I should point out, which I didn't, to put together this little syllogism, that my friend from South Carolina and the chairman of the committee, in fact, allocate $3.5 billion to enforcement just in the Justice Department. Our friends who are the managers of this bill are not--if one listened only to this debate, one would think this debate were about $400 million in youth prevention Federal Government-wide, all the programs I just said. It is not.  My friends are putting $50 million into prevention and $3.5 billion in this bill, in their appropriations bill, into enforcement. It breaks down: On Byrne grants, \1/2\ billion dollars; local law enforcement grants, $460 million; prison grants, $711 million; reimbursement of prison costs for aliens, $350 million; juvenile block grants--that is all enforcement money--$100 million; and $1.4 billion for cops who don't make a distinction between enforcing the law against juveniles and adults.  Again, what the Senator from Alabama and I are really debating about, when you put it all aside, is not whether we should spend money on prevention and not whether we should spend money on enforcement, but the allocation: Are the limited dollars we have being appropriately allocated?  My argument is, my friends from the Appropriations Committee have appropriately allocated the limited number of dollars and that the amendment my friend from Alabama is proposing would misallocate that money by taking $50 million out of prevention and putting it into enforcement, which already has, as it should, the lion's share of the money.  Let me get back to this prevention issue. The vast majority of the police in America not only do not disagree with the notion that we should be spending money on prevention, not only do not want us to cut existing prevention programs, but want us to spendmore money on prevention. They are not in here asking that prevention money be taken and spent on enforcement.  Let me give you one anecdotal piece of evidence before I go to the major organizations. In Seaford, DE, a relatively small community, I asked a question that was--and in Dover, DE, 20,000 people, my State capital, I went to the police officers. I am going to be very blunt about this. I have a great relationship with the law enforcement community. They have always supported me. They have supported me overwhelmingly as long as I have been in the Senate. I pay attention to their concerns. I suppose that is why they support me so strongly.  I went down and met with a very conservative former chief of police in Delaware. He raises steers on the side, and he is a cowboy. I think he thinks my view on a lot of things may be too liberal. We had a debate on how we should treat gays in America, and I think we should treat them no differently than others. I am not so sure he and others would think my view is so good and makes sense, et cetera. This is not a guy who is a liberal law enforcement officer.  I said to him, ``If I can do anything for you--get you more cops, get you more equipment--what would you have me do?'' Do you know what he said to me? No malarkey. He said to me, ``Build me another Boys & Girls Club.'' This is a hardnosed cop in the southern part of my State. My friend from South Carolina knows the southern part of my State well, and I think he would tell you, it is not a lot different from Virginia or North Carolina or South Carolina. They view themselves as southern, they view themselves as conservative, and they are.  Do you know what he asked me for? He asked me for no more cops, no more money for squad cars, equipment, radios. He said, ``Build me a Boys & Girls Club.'' That is what he said, I say to my friend from South Carolina.  Seaford, DE, had a serious problem with drugs. I said, ``What do you want me to do? What do you need?'' They said, ``We need a Boys & Girls Club. Build us one.''  Well, we did. I didn't. We didn't. The local community, with some Federal help, did.  Let me give you a few statistics. This is a letter from the executive director of the Boys & Girls Club in Delaware. He said:       I would like to share with you some recent statistics --  This dated April 30, 1998. It is not about this debate.       I would like to share with you some recent statistics      compiled by the Seaford Police Department on juvenile      complaints from the period February through March of the last      three years.       The statistics revealed:       In 1996, seventy-eight (78) juvenile complaints were      logged.       In 1997, eighty-eight (88). . ..       In 1998, only thirty-five (35) juvenile complaints were      logged.       The statistics show a 151 percent drop in complaints in      1998 as compared to . . . 1997.  It is no coincidence that the drop in complaints directly corresponds to the opening of the western Sussex Club for Boys and Girls on February 1, 1998.  I say to my colleagues, this ``ain't'' rocket science. This is not rocket science. There was a study done in the mid-eighties involving three cities, I believe it was New York, Pittsburgh, and Denver. Which took some Boys & Girls Clubs. First of all, there were housing projects in the same demographic areas, same number of people. They put a Boys & Girls Club in the basement of these mostly high-rise public housing projects.  Guess what? Over a period of 2 years, all the indices of crime--rearrests, initial arrest rate, drug use, et cetera--dropped about 30 percent.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter, Mr. President.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Boys & Girls Clubs of Delaware,                                   Wilmington, DE, April 30, 1998.     Senator Joseph Biden,     Federal Building,     Wilmington, DE.       Dear Senator Biden: I would like to share with you some      recent statistics compiled by the Seaford Police Department      on juvenile complaints for the period February through March      of the last three years.       The statistics revealed:       In 1996, seventy-eight (78) juvenile complaints were      logged.       In 1997, eighty-eight (88) juvenile complaints were logged.       In 1998, only thirty-five (35) juvenile complaints were      logged.       The statistics show a 151% drop in complaints in 1998 as      compared to the same period in 1997.       I believe it is no coincidence that the drop in complaints      directly corresponds to the opening of the Western Sussex      Club on February 1, 1998.       I am sharing these statistics with you because your support      was critical in the development of the Western Sussex Club.      Your support of $300,000 through the Bureau of Juvenile      Assistance was instrumental in the construction of the new      Western Sussex Boys & Girls Club facility in Seaford.       The following are a few additional statistics concerning      the Western Sussex Club operations:       The Club's membership has grown from 600 to more than 2,000      in three months.       More than 400 boys & girls are using the facility on a      daily basis.       The Senior program which is also housed in the facility has      dramatically increased both its membership and program      service units.       Senator Biden, we sincerely appreciate your strong support      of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Delaware and our Clubs      throughout the country. We both know that the Clubs work.       Again, I want to thank you for your support and thank you      for joining with us in our efforts to do more for even more      kids.           Sincerely,                                                 George Krupanski,                                               Executive Director.
