 President, there are a number of germane amendments which will be in order postcloture. I have indicated to the majority leader that we hope to have a number of those voted on. Whether we finish this bill today or tomorrow, I certainly share the view of the majority leader that we need to get this bill conferenced by staff at the very least--both the staff of the House and the Senate--over the break so that the conference can be completed, we can get the bill down to the President for a veto, and get it passed in a form that gets the funding to our troops at the earliest possible point. There will be maximum cooperation on this side toward that end. We need to get through this process and repass this bill as quickly as possible because the troops need the money.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
