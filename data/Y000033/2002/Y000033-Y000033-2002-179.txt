Mr. Speaker, today I rise to introduce a resolution that would express support for President George W. Bush's withdrawal of the United States from the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty. Today marks the conclusion of the 6-month notification of the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty by the United States.  My legislation reaffirms that the United States' national security has fundamentally changed since 1972. Not only do the Russians and Chinese have ballistic missile arsenals that are capable of reaching the United States, but so do a growing number of countries that are hostile to the United States' interests, such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq.  This resolution simply says that the Congress supports the decision by the President to withdraw the United States from the ABM Treaty in accordance with article 15 of the treaty. It also states that Congress supports efforts to provide for the establishment of a robust layered missile defense system to protect the United States and its allies.  Very frankly, the United States faces new and complex threats. September 11, 2001, showed the new threats to our national security and the potential threats we face by more than 32 countries that are working on ballistic missile development. The new threats involve states with considerably fewer missiles with less accuracy, yield, reliability and range. However, emerging ballistic missile systems can potentially kill tens of thousands, or even millions, of Americans, depending on the warhead and intended target.  I believe we cannot allow these countries to use ballistic missiles as instruments of blackmail against the United States and its allies. The way we can and must defend our homeland is through the development of a layered missile defense system, a layered system that would violate the terms of the ABM Treaty.  Clearly, the day has come to withdraw from this dated and ineffective document that was created more than 30 years ago during a different time and under different conditions than those that face our national security today.  I would also like to submit the following sponsors: The gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jeff Miller), the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hostettler), the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones), the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hayes), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts).                          ____________________
