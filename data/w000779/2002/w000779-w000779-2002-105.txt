President, I know the hour is late, but I want to take just a couple of additional minutes to talk about the campaign finance legislation that passed today. I very much appreciate the indulgence of the Presiding Officer. I just have a few minutes I want to use to discuss the landmark bill that passed today.  First, as so many colleagues, I salute Senators McCain and Feingold. They are a model of what it takes to get a tough proposal through the Congress. They simply would not take no, literally. From the time I came to the Senate, both of them double-teamed me and made it clear they were going to stay at it until I had come around to the value of supporting their legislation. In fact, I went on record in support of the legislation as soon as I came to the Senate, and I wanted to talk to them about some additional ways to strengthen the bill.  One of those additional proposals has become a part of the legislation that passed the Senate today. I want to touch on it briefly.  I offered this proposal with our friend and colleague, Senator Susan Collins of Maine. It is called the stand-by-your-ad requirement. It is a significant step forward in promoting accountability in the political process. It will provide a meaningful step to slow the corrosion of the political process and essentially the corrosion that springs from a lack of Federal responsibility when Federal candidates take to the airwaves to win elections but do not want to be held accountable.  The stand-by-your-ad proposal that was included in the legislation we voted on today is straightforward. It says simply that to qualify for the special advertising discount given to candidates now for Federal office, those candidates have to personally stand by any mention of an opponent in a radio or television ad by placing a photo on the screen and stating he or she personally approved the broadcast or personally identify themselves in a radio ad and reading a statement saying they have approved the ad.  First amendment rights are protected under this proposal. Candidates can say anything they please. They just have to personally stand by their remarks to get the discount. They can say anything they want, however farfetched and however extreme. As long as it is allowed under Federal law, they can still say it. To get the discount, if they are going to attack their opponent--of course, that is almost invariably what happens when you mention an opponent in an ad--they have to stand by that ad and personally be held accountable.  If a candidate chooses not to stand by a reference to an opponent, they will buy their ad time at a rate comparable to that charged a commercial user at the station.  Take Nebraska, Oregon, or any part of the country. What happens now, in effect, is the local car dealer or restaurant or other private sector firm has to pay more for various ads because there are subsidies that are given for political campaigns. We are saying that to get those subsidies, to get those discounts, you have to stand by your ad. A candidate who is going to say something positive or negative about an opponent has to own up to it, not just edit together a bunch of shadowy pictures to cover up the fact he or she is the one making the statement.  What this means is that if you want to get the discount with respect to your campaign, you are not going to be able to hide anymore behind those grainy pictures and bloodcurdling music. You are not going to be able to paint your opponent as somebody who looks like they just came out of prison and has not had a chance to get cleaned up and has had every possible dastardly act impugned to them. You are not going to be able to do that any longer. You are going to have to own up to what you say and not just run these grainy pictures and frighten kids and families with bloodcurdling music in an effort to score points at your opponent's expense.  As the Chair knows, we are all campaign veterans in this body and know a little bit about how in a campaign the sucker punches happen. They are not made on the stump while the candidate stands there with the band and bunting all around. They are made on TV; they are made on radio when the announcer's voice comes on in the most sinister way and shadowy pictures appear saying a vote for your opponent is pretty much a vote to end Western civilization. That is what happens in a campaign. You have again and again portrayed your opponent not as somebody with whom you disagree on the issues but someone who is going to be a threat to the American way of life, andthe accusing candidate's face and voice are nowhere to be found, and it is easy for folks to forget--conveniently to forget--who is doing the attacking.  I bring a special awareness to this issue because in the Senate special election with Senator Smith, with whom I work on a great many issues and publish a bipartisan agenda at the start of each Congress, meeting me more than halfway as a colleague and friend in the Senate, he and I were in a campaign that was completely and totally out of hand, and many Oregonians simply did not want to vote. They got to the point where they said: The stench in this debate on both sides is so great, we are turned off the political process altogether.  I made the judgment in that race that I was going to take all the ads off the air about Senator Smith. I said: This is not what I went into public service for--to attack somebody else. The reason I got involved with the Gray Panthers--and I was codirector of the senior citizens group for 7 years before I was elected to the House--is because I was interested in ideas, the best ideas. I did not care if they were Democratic or Republican ideas. Oregon on a bipartisan basis came up with breakthroughs in home health care and a variety of other ways to serve senior citizens.  I looked at what was happening in the Senate special election and said: This is completely contrary to everything I have stood for since my days with the Gray Panthers and contrary to all the reasons for which I went into public service. I went into public service to offer ideas and creative suggestions for making my State and my country a better place, and all of a sudden in that Senate special election, I was not recognizing what was being said in my name because all of it was just the opposite of positive. It was just attack, attack, attack.  My colleague, Senator Smith, to his credit, shares my view that our campaigns got completely out of hand.  For about 3 weeks, the people of Oregon had balance in their hand. I made no reference to Senator Smith at all. I took all of the ads off the air that mentioned his name and talked only about the kinds of initiatives I wanted to pursue, issues we talked about in the Senate today such as the bipartisan proposal Senator Snowe and I have on prescription drugs.  I admit I come to this question of attack ads colored by a truly searing experience I had in 1996 and it is why Senator Collins and I felt so strongly about trying to make this change.  I think owning up to statements about what a candidate says about their opponent is going to make a difference. I think it is going to cause a candidate to think twice before they go forward with these negative blitzes on their opponents. I am going to be frank. That is what I wanted to see American politics be all about after 1996. That is why I have tried to keep it positive and to focus on areas where in the public policy arena people can be helped, people can be empowered, and they can make choices that make a difference for their lives.  Certainly the debate on campaign finance reform has been contentious, but I think we can all agree that reasonable ideas can help clean up this process, reasonable ideas can help drain the swamp that has become the way political campaigns are financed and run in much of this country.  I believe the stand-by-your-ad proposal, which holds candidates accountable, and which I was honored to have a chance to work with Senator Collins of Maine, is going to help clean up campaigns. It is going to help make candidates more accountable and make the politics and political discourse in this country more positive and more open.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
