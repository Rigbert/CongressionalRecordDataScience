 President, I rise today to honor one of Kentucky's inspirational treasures. Ninety-four-year-old Clyde Brock is one of four residents of Laurel County, KY, who was chosen to share his remarkable story as part of London, KY's Living Treasures Project. Looking back, Clyde Brock has remembered for us the monumental events and cherished memories that helped shape his life.  Born April 9, 1917, in a small town called Roots Branch in Clay County, KY, Clyde Brock was the eldest of 10 children of Johnny and Mary Brock. Suffering from a staph infection in his leg, Clyde endured a childhood of doctor visits and constant operations. Though his disability left him with one leg shorter than the other, Clyde refused to let it hinder his ability to experience life to the fullest. He can recall the excitement of seeing his first Model T Ford, the growth and development of his hometown, the constant changes in prices, the Great Depression, and the effects of war. After being turned down for the draft, due to his leg, Brock went on to pursue a career in teaching after graduating Sue Bennett College in 1940.  Clyde also took the position of postmaster and remembers well when customers would bring eggs to pay for their stamps instead of money. Three eggs paid for a letter; eggs sold for 12 cents a dozen back then. Clyde also ran a rationing board during World War II. He can remember folks standing in line half a day to get their pound of lard.  Soon after, Clyde married his late wife Ada Brown and they had three children. Sadly, Ada passed away earlier this year after suffering a severe stroke. After many years together, Clyde says that his greatest accomplishment in life was getting her to marry him.  After 32 successful years at eight different schools teaching history and civics, Mr. Brock retired. While recollecting his memories of walking to school through the snow and the enjoyment of seeing his students become excited about learning, it's clear Clyde Brock still has a passion for teaching.  Clyde is a member of Providence Baptist Church, where he is a deacon and trustee. Realizing that life is short, Mr. Brock says that it has only been ``by the grace of God'' that he has been able to live for so long.  I know my U.S. Senate colleagues join me is saying Mr. Clyde Brock, who can look back with pride at a full life well lived, is an inspiration to us all. He is not only a living treasure to London, but a living treasure to the State of Kentucky.  Mr. President, the Laurel County Sentinel Echo recently published an article illuminating Mr. Clyde Brock's long life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, May 11, 2011]                   London's Living Treasures: Part 1                     (Transcribed by Tara Kaprowy)       Following is the life story of 94-year-old Clyde Brock, who      is one of four Laurel Countians chosen to be part of London's      Living Treasures project. Over a two-hour interview, while      sitting in an easy chair in his Bush-area home, Brock shared      many memories, from the day he saw his first car to the day      his beloved wife Ada died ``with just a curtain between      them.''       ``I was born April 9, 1917 in Clay County in a place called      Roots Branch because so many Roots lived there. I was born in      a big log house. I was the first of 10 children to a young      couple called Johnny and Mary Brock.       My dad bought a farm, I was about 5 years old when we moved      from there. Then he decided to leave the farm and got a      public job and we moved to Corbin. It must have been about      1924. I went to school one year there, Felts School.       I remember my grandfather had a brother that fought on the      southern side during the Civil War. I just remember him. He'd      come to see my grandfather and he had a mule and I just      remember that. He didn't draw a pension. Then I saw one      soldier that fought on the northern side and he drew $100 a      month.       In 1926, I had the misfortune of getting a staph germ. It      was one Sunday evening, I was just out fooling around outside      and it hit me, all at twice. The next morning there was a      knot in my leg.       Well, they took me to Corbin Hospital. They scraped the      bone, but it didn't help. Brought me to London, you know      where the First National Bank is now. There was a little bank      and it had a little hospital over it. Well, they took me in      there and my temperature was 105.5. This doctor, he saved my      life, Dr. H.V. Pennington. The kind of surgical tools he used      was a hammer and chisel to chisel bone out.       I stayed there a month until they got the new hospital over      on the hill. There was eight of us moved into that new      building. There was four doctors in it: Dr. J.W. Crook, Dr.      G.S. Brock, Dr. O.D. Brock and Dr. Pennington. I had two more      surgeries there, and I stayed there from last of March in      1926 until some time in August. With staph going on up, they      performed surgery on my knee. That didn't check it, and it      got to my hip. They come in, all four of them one day with a      big needle, they went into my hip and they found it had got      up there. So, they told my mother and my father to come up      because they'd have to perform surgery again. My dad picked      me up in his arms and carried me to the operating surgery      table. They took the ball out, I don't have that ball in my      hip. It made my leg shorter so they put a 10-pound weight on      a roller on the foot of the bed and held it six weeks to try      to pull it down. It didn't work. They didn't have therapy      then, they didn't have penicillin then, so that staph, it      left my leg short and stiff.       We moved to Cane Creek and I had C. Frank Bentley as a      teacher at Union Grade School. Then my father, he wanted a      bigger farm so he swapped that farm in to one about 200 acres      and we moved there. I start Bush School in the seventh grade.      I had eight brothers and sisters graduated from Bush. I was      about an average student--no, I didn't shine.                          The Great Depression       Let me tell you a bit about the Great Depression. If you      live down on the farm, it didn't affect you because you      didn't have any bills to pay. Everybody had their own meat      and killed their own hogs, they had their cows where they got      their butter or their milk, they had their chickens, had      their eggs. You was almost independent.       My job was to go to the mill on Saturday evenings. We'd      shell a bushel of corn on Friday night. I'd take that corn to      mill and everybody else did too and get it ground into meal      and it made that good, ole cornbread. It was over here on      Black water Road, Henry Hale run the mill. I'd ride on a      mule. You either walked or rode a mule or horse.       I saw my first car when I was about 5 years old. It had      come over from London to Manchester. A man come along      walking. He said, ``There's a car coming up here.'' Well, I      was out to see it in the yard and here it comes. One of those      old Model-T Fords in the wagon tracks.       I got out of high school, I went to Sue Bennett College,      1938. London used to be a lot of wooden buildings down each      side there. Over on Broad Street, straight across from the      courthouse where those annex buildings are now, there used to      be two dwelling houses there. And they had a theater up there      that you could go to the movies, 15 cents in 1938, '39. You      went in and had to go up some steps and it had about two rows      of seats, aisle down the middle. Next block over from      Weaver's pool room. You could get you a hamburger and a      bottle of pop there and it would cost about 15 cents.                             Wages and War       They had Hackney's, Daniel's, Woody's, 10 cents stores,      they had a lot of them. Then they had pool rooms. Laurel      County was wet at one time, about '38, '39. '40, they had      beer joints. Where Scoville's office is, when you go down in      a hole, that was called Underworld, they had a beer joint      down there. Then they had one in east London over by Benge      Supply, used to be a liquor store. Go in and bottles were      sitting up on the counter.       There used to be a lot of people go to church on Sunday      because they didn't have anywhere else to go. They'd stay      outside and fight and things; I was outside too. There'd be      more people outside than there were in. Blackwater Church,      I've seen the preacher come right out and his son and the      other preacher's son were fighting right at the door. He just      walked out and tried to get them separated.       Going to Sue Bennett, I stayed in the dorm, the boys would      sit up all night and play poker, blackjack for a penny.      Cigarettes used to you could buy for 11 cents, you could get      Camels, Lucky's for 15 cents. On Sunday, if you want to get      out, if you got a pack of cigarettes and a pack of chewing      gum, you was doing pretty good.       I graduated from Sue Bennett in 1940 and got my teaching      diploma. That was the quickest thing you could do then. That      was after the Depression. I made $73.74 a month. When I was      about 23, I got to be postmaster. There would be people to      bring three eggs to the post office to mail a letter. Eggs      was 12 cents a dozen at one time. My dad had a store and he'd      take the eggs and he'd sell them and put 3 cents in. He could      get all the men he wanted to work for 50 cents a day and      their dinner.       War started. In addition to being postmaster, I was also      deputy clerk. People had to come to register when they      rationed everything. They'd come and sign up and you'd give      them a ration book with stamps in it. Coffee was rationed and      people used lard back then. They'd stand in line about a half      a day to get about a pound of lard.       I was called in January before the War started. With my      leg, I got so I could work and do things, I didn't have to go      on crutches. I done about anything anybody else used to do.      I'd a liked to go, I told them they could use me anywhere,      I'd have gone. I was the second one called in the county      before the War started, but I was turned down. A teacher I      was teaching with, he told me I would pass. He said, ``They      don't want you to run, you're not supposed to run when you're      in a war.''                          Love of a Good Woman       In 1940, I met a girl that meant more to me than all the      rest that I knew. Named Ada Brown, who lived over in Pigeon      Roost in Clay County. We married in 1941, I must have been      about 20. I had a good friend I'd run around with, and he was      dating her sister. We went to Freedom United Church one      Wednesday night, and after church he and her sister was      walking in front. He was down leading a mule. I was riding      behind this other one and she was walking by herself. I asked      about getting down, and we got together. That was the best      thing that happened to me in my life, she marrying me. We      went to Jellico, Tenn., went into the clerk's office to get      the license. He said $10, $5 for the license, $5 for the      preacher.       We had a four-room house and about four acres of ground and      had a cook stove. Then we had a kitchen cabinet, a little      dining room set, we had two beds and a few chairs.                        Seven Miles in the Snow       The second year I started teaching, they sent me to a      school called Darl Jones, and it was about seven miles away.      I had to get a horse, cost me about $75. In wintertime, one      morning, I got up and you had to be there at 8 o'clock. I      thought, ``It's too cold to ride, it's way below zero,'' so I      said, ``I'm going to walk.'' I left walking, snow on the      ground, moon shining bright, I walked that seven miles. You      know what I was wishing? I wished that someone would ask me      to stay all night with them. Just about before we turned out      for lunch, a fellow by the name of Willie Martin that lived      in the community, he come in and sit down and he said, ``I      want you to stay all night with me.'' He didn't have to twist      my arm.       In 1941, I had 44 students in school, 16 in the sixth      grade. Now, a lot of them's already passed on. On Friday      afternoon, used to young people would come around because      after school you had a ballgame or you had a ciphering match.      We'd see which side could add the columns the quickest. Well      one Friday night, a man come there and when it started to      rain he went outside and got his gun, a pump shotgun, and set      it in the corner of the schoolhouse. We paid no attention to      that. When it quit raining, he got his gun and went up the      road.       The day my first son was born, I was gone up to get my pay      that day at a teacher's meeting. My brother had to go and get      the doctor. He had an old bicycle, but one pedal was broken      off, it just had that rod that came out, and his foot kept      slipping off and it would cut his leg. And it was hot, it was      in September, he rode all the way and back with that old      bicycle and burned up and he always said, ``And look what we      got.'' Well, I felt good, and you know I had a pay day that      day. You know how much it cost? $20. He's a pretty good boy,      never had to go to the jailhouse or anything like that.       I have three children, Larry, Janice and Gary.       I was about 25 or 26 when I got my first car, a 1936      Chevrolet. I didn't know how to drive. On Monday morning I      started out and I had to go up a little bank. Well, I says,      ``I'll put it up in second.'' Well, I didn't put it in      second, I put it in reverse. It went back with me. I had a      time driving.       In 1946, that's when I built this house. I was going to      build it out of wood. Couldn't find it, couldn't get wood.      Corbin had a cement block factory, and I got a man to lay the      block 50 cents an hour. Rationing was so bad, you couldn't      buy a car. When we got the house up, we couldn't get any      windows. It was a year before I could get windows.                        Through Faith and Grace       We got saved in 1951, been members of Providence Baptist      Church now for 60 years. I taught Sunday school for 36 years.      And you know they gave me an honor? They named the class      after me. And I'm still a deacon and a trustee.       In 1955, we started raising chickens. I guess we raised      chickens 20 years and we always had chicken to eat. Then we      raised tobacco. And Ada always had a big garden, and she      always had a big freezer. She froze everything.       I retired in 1972, taught 32 years. I taught at eight      schools, Blackwater, Darl Jones, Bennett Branch, Lake, White      Hall, Pace's Creek, Boggs, Head Beech Creek and Bush Junior      High. I liked teaching history and civics, but not English,      didn't like diagramming and analyzing. I couldn't tell a      dangling modifier now from anything else. But I liked when I      could see progress in some of them, you knew you was doing      maybe something good. Those little fellers, I'd like to watch      them. They'd get up to the board, we loved going to the board      and make ABCs back then. Now you don't do that, you don't      memorize nothing now.       A lot of my students came to me when I was up in that      nursing home in December last year. They said, ``You had a      lot of company.'' Some of them come in there with old, grey      beards, and I didn't recognize them. They said, ``Well, I      went to school with you.'' I stayed about 31 days up there. I      was there with Ada.       In 1992, one day my wife, she cooked a big dinner. We ate      dinner, we watched Price Is Right, she says, ``I'm going in      here to freeze some beans.'' I got up and went through there      and she laid on the floor. No response. I called 9-1-1 and      when they come they thought it was a stroke and that's what      it was. It took her speech and paralyzed her right side.       She stayed in the hospital and nursing home. From the time      she went in to the day she passed away was 18 years, six      months and 9 days. And she stayed in Laurel Heights in London      18 years. I had already retired. We was together for about 51      good years. She was a quilter and a good cook. She was noted      for her fried apple pies. She'd take them to the homecomings      at church. She'd made 60 pies one morning.       After I got sick this December, I had to go for rehab and      they had me go to Laurel Heights. The lady that was in with      Ada passed away and they said, ``You go be in the room with      your wife.'' So I went. They'd get me up in the wheelchair.      They let me sit by her on Sunday. After I'd been there a      while, she passed away, just a curtain between us. That was      the 22nd day of January this year.       See I'm 94 years old now. My wife was 88. Now I stay here      by myself. But I gave up driving. Just six months ago. I      thought I'd better quit while I was ahead.       How does it feel to be 94? You know one thing, you know      your time is getting shorter, and you don't have too long to      stay here.       I say it's been by the grace of God that I've been blessed      to live this long. I don't want to take any honor or      anything, as if I've done something myself to stay healthy.      It's all for the grace of God.''                          ____________________
