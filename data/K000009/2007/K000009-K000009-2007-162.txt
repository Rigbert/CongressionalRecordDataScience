Proctor, Wayman E. Scott, Ferrier H. White, William Young, Gilbert Cargill, Perry Young, and William L. Williams, Jr.  On March 29, 2007, we were privileged to be witnesses to history as the largest group ever to be awarded a Congressional Gold Medal was honored in the Capitol rotunda. The elder men and their families who joined us that day were there not only to be feted for their own achievements, but represented dozens more of these gallant heroes who could not be there. I am proud that many residents in our own Ninth Congressional District of Ohio were part of this elite cadre of men.  The story of the Tuskegee Airmen continues to unfold, for they were truly unsung heroes of their time. Their outstanding service during World War II became legendary. Even while they fought a common enemy in foreign lands, they also fought racism at home. Despite discrimination they helped to tear down racial barriers in the U.S. armed services. History books tell the story that no U.S. military pilot was African-American prior to World War II. Eventually, in 1941, guided by leaders of the African-American civil rights movement the United States Congress directed the Army Air Corps to form an all-black combat unit. In June of that year, the 99th Fighter Squadron was formed at the Tuskegee Institute, a well-regarded university founded by national leader Booker T. Washington in Tuskegee, Alabama. The squadron was placed under the command of Capt. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., one of the few African-American West Point graduates.  During World War II the Tuskegee Airmen flew escort for heavy bombers, established an impressive combat record, and often entered combat against greater numbers of superior German aircraft. By war's end, the unit was credited with shooting down 109 Luftwaffe aircraft and destroying numerous fuel dumps, trucks and trains. The squadrons of the 332nd Fighter Group flew more than 15,000 sorties on 1,500 missions.  The unit was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for a mission flown on March 24, 1945, escorting B-17s to bomb the Daimler-Benz tank factory at Berlin, Germany, an action in which its pilots destroyed three Me-262 jets in aerial combat. The meritorious individual achievements of the pilots were also recognized. Together, the Tuskegee Airmen were awarded 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, seven Silver Stars, fourteen Bronze Stars, and 744 Air Medals. From 1940 to 1946, 992 pilots were trained as Tuskegee Airmen. Of these, 445 went overseas and 150 lost their lives in service to our Nation and freedom's cause.  Booker T. Washington once noted that ``A life is not worth much of which it cannot be said, when it comes to its close, that it was helpful to humanity.'' The corps of airmen who hailed from the school Mr. Washington founded most assuredly fulfilled that destiny. Our world remains profoundly grateful.                          ____________________
