Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Many of our colleagues were shocked and angered to learn that the big name pro-abortion population control organizations like Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, Zero Population Growth and others had grossly misled Congress, the President, and the American people about partial-birth abortion. In one letter sent to every Member of Congress signed by those organizations and many others, we were solemnly assured that, and I quote: This surgical procedure is used only in rare cases, fewer than 500 per year. It is most often performed in cases, it goes on to say, of severe fetal anomalies.  Mr. Chairman, we now know that the abortion lobby's campaign to defeat the partial-birth abortion ban was and is riddled with lies and distortions. It is one thing to have an honest difference about policy. Congress after all is a marketplace of disparate opinions and ideas, but do not lie to us.  Mr. Chairman, interestingly, it was one of their own, Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, who blew the whistle on their fraudulent tactics. Members will recall Mr. Fitzsimmons came forward and said that he was lying through his teeth about the circumstances and the incidences surrounding partial-birth abortion. Having raised serious questions concerning the credibility and the reliability of Planned Parenthood and others, Mr. Fitzsimmons admitted, and I quote, that thousands of partial-birth abortions in the vast majority of cases are performed on healthy mothers with a healthy fetus.  Why is this relevant to the amendment the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Barcia] and the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Oberstar] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] and I are offering this morning? Because each year Congress authorizes hundreds of millions of dollars; this is not an entitlement, these are discretionary funds, hundreds of millions of dollars for population control organizations. And much of that cash will wind up in the hands of the very same abortion industry that so skillfully lied to my colleagues and me.  After lying through their teeth on the partial-birth abortion ban here in the United States, is it so unreasonable to doubt the abortion lobby's commitment to truth-telling elsewhere? Who then will expose their deceptive tactics in Warsaw or Lima or Cairo or Pretoria or San Salvador? I believe that we need to steer family planning funds to those who will pledge neutrality on abortion rather than promote abortion in foreign capitals.  Today the pro-life laws and policies of almost 100 countries that restrict abortion are under siege, and the engine driving this global pro-abortionpush are the nongovernmental organizations like Planned Parenthood funded by the U.S. Government. Let me remind Members, we provide almost 50 percent of all the money that goes into their coffers. That is why we need to make a difference with the amendment that I and my friends are offering today.  Our amendment permits the flow of funds to those organizations that pledge to provide family planning and only family planning and not abortion. This is all about abortion, Mr. Chairman. The innocent children are held harmless. Who we subsidize, not just what, but who we subsidize and who we give millions of dollars to does matter.  Some Members have argued today that U.S. funds will not be used for abortion. That is already the underlying law. An amendment simply restates current law. But money is fungible. The millions of dollars we give to a group immediately frees up other non-U.S. funds that can be used, and in this case are used, for performing and aggressively promoting abortion around the world. If we give millions of dollars to those for whom abortion on demand is a way to plan family size, we put unborn babies at grave risk of death.  It should matter greatly to each of us not just what an organization does with our specific donation but the rest of its agenda as well. It is a package deal. Many groups use family planning as the Trojan horse to conceal their real agenda, which is abortion.  Let me remind Members of Vision 2000, that abortion manifesto in 1992 that was agreed to by International Planned Parenthood Federation based in London and its 140 affiliates. It said these are their marching orders that they will, quote, ``bring pressure on governments and campaign for policy and legislative change to remove restrictions against abortion.''  Fred Sai, who used to be chairman of IPPF, a Planned Parenthood group, said, now for the first time the IPPF plan Vision 2000 outlines activities at both the secretary and the family planning association level to further their explicit goal of increasing the right of access to abortion. Again let me remind Members, 100 countries protect their babies. These people to whom we are giving millions of dollars want to bring down those right-to-life laws. Let me give some examples.  In Poland, the chairman of the Parliamentary Group on the Family, Stanislaw Kowolik, recently lashed out at external factions in Poland for meddling in that country and pushing for liberalized abortion. As a result of strong lobbying by family planning groups, Poland recently reversed the pro-life policies of Lech Walesa and Solidarity and put in its place the pro-abortion policy of the Communists.  Another example of backlash over United States and Planned Parenthood pressure to legalize abortion on demand is the Philippines. A headline in the Philippine Daily Inquirer last July said Senator ``Flavier Hits U.S. Pressure on Abortion.'' And he writes: We had just celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence from America, but we can still see insidious methods of imperialism trying to subvert our self-determination by using funds as subtle leverage,'' and then he goes on to say he strongly opposes abortion, that his constitution prohibits it. And then he said, finally, ``we should be prepared to lose foreign funding rather than be pressured into causing the death of unborn children.''  The abortion promotion by Planned Parenthood is so extreme in the Philippines that the head of their IPPF affiliate, the Planned Parenthood president, quit. He said it was because a ``hidden agenda of'' and that his affiliate was being used as a Trojan horse to legalize abortion. They talk family planning, the real agenda is abortion on demand.  The pro-life safeguards say: We will provide money for family planning. There is not one penny lost as a result of this amendment. But we will give it only to those groups that are committed to family planning and not abortion on demand.  Let me also say on the China provision, since 1979, the U.N. Population Fund has been there on the ground promoting the one-child-per-couple policy. We have heard testimony, Members should be fully aware by now that forced abortion is commonplace in the People's Republic of China. Yet Dr. Sadik, who is the executive director of the UNFPA, has said, and I quote: ``UNFPA firmly believes, and so does the government of the People's Republic of China, that their program is a totally voluntary program. It is not. It is a totally coercive program, and the UNFPA has been whitewashing these crimes since 1979.  Let me also point out to my colleagues that the amendment, the substitute amendment, is a fake. With all due respect to my good friend, the gentleman from California [Mr. Campbell], it is cover. It does not stop abortions. It does not do anything meaningful relative to China, and it actually trivializes this crime against humanity, against women, of forced abortion because again in China there is the UNFPA doing its work day in and day out. And we understand now that they are in negotiations for new programs in the PRC. We are saying you can have your $25 million. Just get out of China. Stop being complicit. Stop the hand and glove relationship with the dictatorship of the PRC.  Mr. Chairman, many of our colleagues were shocked and angered to learn that the big name pro-abortion/population control organizations like Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Alan Guttmacher Institute, had grossly misled Congress, the President, and the American people about partial-birth abortion.  In one letter sent to every Member of Congress, signed by Planned Parenthood and the others, we were solemnly assured that:       This surgical procedure is used only in rare cases, fewer      than 500 per year. It is most often performed in the case of      wanted pregnancies gone tragically wrong, when a family      learns late in pregnancy of severe fetal anomalies or a      medical condition that threatens the pregnant woman's life or      health.  We now know the abortion lobby's campaign to defeat the partial-birth abortion ban was and is riddled with distortion and lies.  It's one thing to have honest differences about policy--Congress is, after all, a marketplace of disparate opinions and ideas.  But don't lie to us.  Interestingly, it took one of their own, Ron Fitzsimmons, Executive Director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, to blow the whistle on their fraudulent tactics. You will recall that Mr. Fitzsimmons admitted ``lying through (his) teeth'' in spouting the pack of lies dished out by the abortion lobby. Having raised serious questions concerning the credibility and reliability of Planned Parenthood and others, Mr. Fitzsimmons admitted that of the thousands of partial-birth abortions ``in the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus * * *.''  Why is this relevant to the amendment Messrs. Barcia, Oberstar, Hyde, and I are offering today?  Because each year Congress authorizes hundreds of millions of dollars for population control organizations--and much of that cash will wind up in the hands of the very same abortion industry that so skillfully lied to you and me.

It should matter greatly to each of us not just what an organization does with out specific donation, but the rest of its agenda as well. It is a package deal. Many groups use family planning as the Trojan horse to conceal their real agenda--abortion on demand.  I urge Members to carefully consider the 1992 International Planned Parenthood Federation abortion manifesto called Vision 2000, a global strategic plan that Planned Parenthood and its 140 country affiliates adoptedand have been implementing ever since to promote abortion in every corner of the world.  The Vision 2000 strategic plan says, and I quote, that family planning organizations should ``bring pressure on governments and campaign for policy and legislative change to remove restrictions against abortion.'' Can anything be more clear? Pressure governments to nullify their pro-life policies. Campaign for abortion on demand. And we are providing many, many millions of dollars to this group.  Fred Sai, who is the former chairman of International Planned Parenthood, put it very succinctly:       Now, for the first time, the IPPF strategic plan, Vision      2000, which was unanimously adopted at the Members' Assembly      in Delhi, outlines activities at both the Secretariat and FPA      level to further IPPF's explicit goal of increasing the right      of access to abortion.  IPPF has plans of action, as they call them, to promote abortion in Central and South America where unborn children are now legally safeguarded. They have plans to repeal the pro-life laws in Africa, the Muslim countries in the Middle East, and several Asian countries.  In Poland, the chairman of the Parliamentary Group on the Family, Stanislaw Kowolikveouk recently lashed out at external factions in Poland for meddling in that country and pushing for liberalized abortion. As a result of strong lobbying by family planning groups, Poland recently reversed the pro-life policies of Lech Walesa and Solidarity and put in its place, the pro-abortion policy of the Communists.  Only last week's action by Poland's high court stopped the new abortion law from going into effect.  Another example of backlash over United States and Planned Parenthood pressure to legalize abortion on demand is the Philippines.  A headline in the Philippine Daily Inquirer last July: ``Flavier Hits U.S. Pressure on Abortion.'' The article quotes Senator Juan Flavier:       We had just celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence      from America, but we can still see insidious methods of      imperialism trying to subvert our self-determination by using      [population control] funds as subtle leverage * * *. I      strongly oppose abortion. It is prohibited by our laws and      the Philippine Constitution. Hence, we should be prepared to      lose foreign funding rather than be pressured into causing      the death of unborn children.  The abortion promotion by Planned Parenthood is so extreme in the Philippines that the president of IPPF's affiliate--the Family Planning Organization of the Philippines [FPOP]--resigned over what he called International Planned Parenthood Federation's ``hidden agenda'' and use of his affiliate as a Trojan horse to legalize abortion.  The use of family planning as cover--the use of family planning as a Trojan horse for abortion law liberalization is now commonplace and must be stopped.  Let me remind Members that the pro-life safeguards included in my amendment are nothing new; they were in effect for almost a decade. And they worked.  The pro-life safeguards often referred to as the Mexico City Policy were in effect during the Reagan and Bush years as a principled way to fully fund family planning without promoting abortion.  Specifically, the safeguards say this: We will donate funds only to those organizations that will not perform abortions except in the cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother. Funds may go to those organizations that will not lobby for or against abortion.  We should have no part in empowering the abortion industry to succeed in its war on the unborn.  If Members want to promote abortions, be up-front and legislate that. But don't hide behind counterfeit amendments like the Campbell substitute. The Mexico City Policy makes it very clear that there ought to be a wall of separation between abortion and family planning. The Campbell amendment--with all due respect to its author, a friend of mine--is a fake and a counterfeit.  The second part of our amendment relates to forced abortion.  Every day, forced abortion and forced sterilization devastate the lives of women and families in China while the U.N. Population Fund provides political cover and sustenance to those who practice these abuses. The Government of China compels women to abort their so-called unauthorized, illegal unborn children. It starts with intense persuasion using all of the economic, social, and psychological tools a totalitarian State has at its disposal. If these methods fail, women are taken physically to abortion mills. Forced abortions are often performed very late in pregnancy, even in the ninth month. Sometimes the baby's skull is crushed with forceps as the baby emerges from the birth canal. Other times the baby gets an injection of formaldehyde or some other poison into the baby's cranium. The mass murderers, euphemistically called family planning cadres, are at it every day--killing babies, devastating women's lives.  Forced abortion was properly construed to be a crime against humanity at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal. Today, it is employed aggressively and with chilling effectiveness and unbearable pain upon women in the People's Republic of China. Women in China are required to obtain a birth coupon before conceiving a child. Chinese women are hounded by the population control cadres and even their menstrual cycles are publicly monitored as one means of ensuring compliance.  The New York Times has pointed out in an expose that the authorities, when they discover an unauthorized pregnancy, an illegal child, normally apply a daily dose of threats and browbeating. They wear the women down. Eventually, if the woman does not succumb to the abortion, she is physically forced to submit.  In the mid-1990's, the PRC issued a decree on eugenics which nationalizes discrimination against the handicapped. In a move that is eerily reminiscent of Nazi Germany, the Communist Chinese Government is implementing forced abortion against handicapped children simply because they suffer an anomaly like Downs Syndrome, and forced sterilization against parents who simply do not measure up in the eyes of the State. Since 1979, the U.N. Population Fund has provided funds, materiel, people on the ground and what no money could buy, the sort of shield of respectability that the PRC Program so desperately wants.  Mr. Chairman, in July 1995, victims of the Chinese forced abortion program testified to the truth. Our Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights heard the testimony of three women who testified that they had been forced to have abortions.  One of those witnesses, Li Bao Yu [Lee Bough You], told us how her troubles started in earnest after she removed an IUD that the population cadres had forced her accept, but which had been making her sick. She became pregnant. The family planning program officials, who came to inspect every woman in the village several times a year--the involuntary inspections a serious violation of each woman's privacy--discovered her pregnancy and threatened that if she did not have the abortion, her first child would be denied education and health care. In her own words,       They threatened me that I do not agree to have this      abortion, then my first child will forever have no chance of      being a registered, normal citizen.  Mr. Chairman, this is the human cost of the shameful program that for years has been assisted, praised, coddled, and protected by the U.N. Population Fund, the UNFPA. The supporters of this amendment argue that if it were not for UNFPA, the Chinese program would be even worse. But this is an assertion without evidence. UNFPA officials including Nafis Sadiq have repeatedly praised the Chinese program. UNFPA has provided demographic capabilities--a tracking system that hunts down women bearing babies--a system that enables the Beijing population commissars to tell where they need to enforce their program more vigorously. They have trained thousands of cadres--the implementors of this egregious policy. They have provided major elements of the infrastructure that systematically oppresses the women of China and murders their babies. They are part of the problem, not part of the solution.  The Campbell amendment would delete the pro-human rights language in my amendment and insert a substitute that looks good and does next to nothing. UNFPA could spend all the money it wanted in China so long as it kept a separate set of books that showed our money going only for projects outside China. There would also be a reduction in the U.S. contribution--but past experience has shown that a reduction is not enough. The language of the amendment is almost identical to language that has been adopted in the past by the Appropriations Committee, and when this language has been adopted, UNFPA has stayed in China. Only when there was a real threat of serious action--an absolute condition that UNFPA get out of China or lose our money--did UNFPA even go through the motions of getting out. So the substitute language is simply not enough. It absolutely trivializes these crimes--it should not be enough for those of us who are pro-life, and it should not be enough for those who think of themselves as pro-choice. If there is anything UNFPA's involvement in China is not about, it is not about free choice.  This House has voted countless times to condition United States funding for UNFPA on its disengagement from the PRC forced abortion program. Last year, we gave UNFPA some flexibility. They insisted they were no longer giving grants in China. They still had an office there, which they said they were using to administer old grants. Now it turns out that they are actively negotiating with the Chinese Government for future grants and contracts. So we were misled last year: UNFPA was notgetting out of China and, unless we take decisive action, has no intention of getting out of China. Congress gave UNFPA the flexibility their supporters said they needed. This is as far as we can go. Loyalty to these women--these victims of unspeakable torture--will allow us to go no further.                              {time}  1200
