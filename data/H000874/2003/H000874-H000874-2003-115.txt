Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me the time, and I agree with everything he said; and I think the chairman agrees with most of what he said.  Usually when we discuss these issues, almost invariably those of us on this side of the aisle rise and first say that we do not hold responsible our chairman for the policies that are being pursued. It is his responsibility, however, to practically try to carry out flawed policies. He does so with a great deal of skill, with eminent fairness and with grace for which all of us who serve on his committee are very thankful.  But, Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations is operating in the context of the most fiscally irresponsible policy that any administration and majority has followed in the history of this country. I pause for emphasis. The children of America, the grandchildren of America are going to be called upon to pay the bill for this irresponsible policy. That is what the ranking member meant when he said that all of the dollars that are being requested to pursue a policy that I supported in Iraq will be paid for by our children and grandchildren.                              {time}  1045  An irresponsible policy. An unrealistic policy.  And I would recall for Members that just a few months ago, when we adopted that budget resolution, of which the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) spoke, we adopted it on a Thursday. No Democrats voted for it. Not one. We then, on the Tuesday following that Thursday, had a motion made by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt), and that motion simply said that we instructed the conference not to do what was in the budget; not to cut veterans by $1.5 billion; not to cut housing, which is in short supply for middle America; not to do many of the things that would have undercut education, health care, and the environment that were proposed in that budget.  And I would further recall for Members, and unfortunately there are no press here, but I recall that the chairman of the Committee on the Budget (Mr. Nussle), sitting where the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations now sits, railed for about 29 minutes about how awful the motion to instruct was and how Members ought to vote against it. And then, lo and behold, the majority leader came to the floor, spoke quietly to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), and the vote was called.  Many Republicans rushed to the floor to vote against that motion to instruct, and, lo and behold, as the minutes went by, votes were changed. Lo and behold, as the minutes went by, the rhetoric of the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) was forgotten quickly when the reality of the votes and the necessity to report at home the consequences of those votes was realized by our Republican friends on the majority side. So they changed their votes; or if they had not voted, voted for the motion to instruct offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt). How ironic.  And now the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) is confronted with another reality. Last year, we could not pass appropriation bills. Eight of them were passed not only after the fiscal year, but after the Congress had adjourned. Why? Because the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) was forced to operate within a context of a totally unrealistic budget. And what did the Republicans say? They said, oh, it is Mr. Daschle's fault. It is the Senate's fault. They have not adopted a budget.  Well, now, they control the House, they control the Senate, they control the administration, and as the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) pointed out, on a good day, they control the Supreme Court. I thought that was a good line and, unfortunately, true at times as well. But the fact of the matter is they control it all. And the lamentation that they put forward last year, the excuse that they put forward last year, the rationalization they pursued last year is not available to them; not to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) but to the majority leadership.  And so we are confronted with, yes, having passed our bills, and I might say some without a single Democratic vote. As a matter of fact, one of the largest bills, one of the most important bills for education of our children, for the health care of our families and citizens, not one Democrat voted for it. Not because we are not for education and health care, but because we knew that bill was an unrealistic bill.  So we are confronted today with a resolution that the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) is required to put forward, and acting as he always does, responsibly, he must put forward, andwhich I am going to support, as the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) is going to support. It is the alternative we ought to pursue.  I said the most fiscally irresponsible administration. Why? Because after we adopt this budget or these appropriation bills, which will spend a lesser and lesser percentage of the gross domestic product of our country on discretionary spending that we will make decisions about, we will have created over a $.5 trillion deficit in this single year, more debt than we incurred in the first 90 percent of the days of this Republic, and our children are going to pay the bill. How tragic. How irresponsible.  We passed a bankruptcy bill in which we made it harder to declare bankruptcy, and each of us on the floor said we need to require personal responsibility of those who seek credit. If we applied that same criteria to this administration and to the Congress of the United States, we would fail. We are not exercising personal responsibility. In this instance, we must pass this resolution, and I will vote for it, but I lament the fact that it is passed in the context of the most irresponsible fiscal policy that I have ever seen and this country has ever seen, and which is disadvantaging our country and our ability to invest in the future.
