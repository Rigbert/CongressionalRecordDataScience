We are going to remain so.  On Monday, the House will meet at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. There will be no votes before 6:30.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour debate and noon for legislative business. We will consider additional bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of the suspension bills for the week will be announced later this week.  On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 o'clock. We will consider a long-term continuing resolution. I want Members to hear that because on Wednesday we will consider the long-term continuing resolution. We have a continuing resolution which expires on February 15. The long-term will cover approximately nine appropriation bills that failed to pass in the last Congress and will fund most of government, other than the Defense Department and the Homeland Security Department.  The House will not meet on Thursday and Friday next week in order to accommodate the Democratic Members issues conference. I thank my friend for yielding.
