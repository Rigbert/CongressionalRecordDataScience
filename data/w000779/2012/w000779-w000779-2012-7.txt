 With my colleagues' indulgence, my understanding from the leader is we would have 15 minutes on each side at some point in the morning. If we could proceed with what I thought was the direction we were going, I would very much appreciate it. But it should be limited to 15 minutes on each side, pro and con, at some point in the session tomorrow.
