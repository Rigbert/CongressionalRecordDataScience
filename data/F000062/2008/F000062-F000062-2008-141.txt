 I used cloth diapers. The toys were not as flexible as they are today. My daughter grew up fine. One of the real hazards of this society is chemicals and how chemicals are used, and we don't know how they are used. When it comes to children's toys, I didn't know you could make plastic that way, so soft, so flexible. The reason you can is because of all the chemicals added to it. When these chemicals have a toxic factor and you know these chemicals are going in a child's mouth and you know they leach out of the plastic into the child's system, it simply isn't right. We ought to stop it.  People out there know that. People out there want this. I would have liked to have taken the time to have had a committee hearing on this. But candidly, this bill came up. And because this is already law in so many places--the European Union, 5 other nations, California, 8 other States ready to pass it--and you have retailers who understand and are willing to take voluntary action, it seemed to me the legal standard should be established. That is what this bill does.  I call up my amendment which is at the desk.
