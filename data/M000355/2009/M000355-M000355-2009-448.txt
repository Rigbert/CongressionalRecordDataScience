 President, I rise today to honor a brave Kentuckian and soldier who has been awarded the Silver Star for valor in defense of our country.  SFC Larry Hawks, a native of Edmonson County in my home Commonwealth of Kentucky, received our Nation's third highest award for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States. Those rare few who receive the Silver Star do so because of their display of selfless sacrifice andunparalleled courage under fire and Sergeant First Class Hawks has certainly demonstrated that to his fellow soldiers.  Sergeant First Class Hawks showed his bravery and patriotism to all during a 14-hour battle in 115-degree heat while stationed in Afghanistan on July 25, 2005. That morning on combat patrol in the Oruzgan province, his unit encountered and gave chase to a large number of enemy fighters. Our soldiers soon found themselves facing an intense volley of fire from machine guns, small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.  Without regard for his own safety, Sergeant First Class Hawks came out from behind cover to draw and return enemy fire while directing his unit into position to more effectively engage the enemy. He also directed fire from Apache gunships overhead. He passed up a chance to move to a safer position and insisted on staying in the best vantage point over the enemy.  ``There were times when some of the guys thought that we weren't going to make it,'' Sergeant First Class Hawks was quoted as saying after the ordeal. ``But I was thinking, you may not, but I am coming out of this. That was my whole thought process.''  SFC Larry Hawks's service is continuing proof that there is no finer fighting man on the face of the Earth than the American soldier. Accordingly, a ceremony was held last December at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, in Fort Bragg, NC, for him to receive this honored award.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Sergeant First Class Hawks for the many sacrifices he has made to our country. We Kentuckians are honored to know and be among such heroes.  I also ask unanimous consent that the full article from the Brownsville, KY, Edmonson News of March 19, 2009, detailing SFC Larry Hawks's service and the actions that led to the awarding of his Silver Star, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Edmonson News, Mar. 19, 2009]       SFC Larry Hawks Awarded Silver Star for Defending Comrades       Edmonson County native Larry Hawks, a 1988 graduate of      Edmonson County High School, was recently awarded the      nation's third-highest honor for valor in combat, the Silver      Star.       Sergeant First Class Hawks's extraordinary acts of heroism      while engaged in a military operation in Afghanistan were      witnessed by his comrades.       Hawks, his wife Callie, and their four children Tristan,      10; Lorin, 8; Addie, 6; and Aidan, 4, reside in Salemburg,      N.C.       In a letter to superiors, it was explained by Sfc. Donald      Grambusch that during a 14-hour battle in 115-degree heat,      and taking enemy fire from every angle, Hawks, with disregard      for his own personal safety, returned fire during their ATV      movement which enabled other ATVs in the group to reach      sufficient cover. Hawks then directed Apache gunships fire      onto the enemy, while using his own weapon to defend their      position.       Hawks was recommended for the Distinguished Service Cross      for his bravery.       In addition to the Silver Star, Hawks has attained a long      list of accolades and awards throughout his distinguished      military career.       During his tenure of duty with the 82nd Airborne Division      Hawks served in Panama, Egypt, Desert Shield and Desert      Storm. In 1992 Hawks was assigned to the XVII Airborne Corps'      Long Range Surveillance Co. He also served with the 3rd      Special Forces Group (Airborne).       Hawks was featured in an article by Doug Clark in The      Sampson Independent, a newspaper in Clinton, North Carolina,      on January 25.       Hawks is the son of Tony and Pat Hawks of Wingfield.       His grandparents are the late Larmie and Pernie Hawks, and      the late Lee Elmore and Lula Elmore of Wingfield.                          ____________________
