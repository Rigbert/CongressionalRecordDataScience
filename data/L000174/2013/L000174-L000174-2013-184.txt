President, I don't wish to in any way cut into the time of the senior Senator from Wyoming, but I hope once he and Senator Barrasso have finished speaking--once their time is consumed--we might agree that the vote will still be at 5:30, if possible, or as close to that time as possible.  Our Constitution provides the Senate an important role to play in providing advice to the President and in voting on whether to confirm nominees for our third branch of government. Last month, we were reminded of the importance of these confirmation votes when the Supreme Court handed down several narrowly-decided opinions that are already impacting millions of Americans. As a senior member of this chamber, I have voted on the confirmation of every one of the nine justices currently serving. Since only a tiny percentage of cases brought in Federal court ever end up at the Supreme Court, the Federal courts of appeal are often the courts of last resort for most disputes. I am glad that today we are finally voting to confirm another appellate nominee.  Before the Memorial Day recess, the minority leader asked during a floor debate when Gregory Phillips, the Wyoming nominee to the Tenth Circuit, would receive a vote. When the majority leader immediately offered a vote on that nominee, the minority leader demurred without giving any reason. Senate Republicans have now finally decided to allow the vote on Gregory Phillips to move forward, but there was no reason for this delay in his confirmation vote.  Gregory Phillips is currently the attorney general of Wyoming, a position to which he was appointed by Wyoming's Republican Governor. From 2010 to 2011 he worked in the Wyoming attorney general's office as the special assistant to the Governor for legislative affairs. Prior to working in the Wyoming attorney general's office, he was an assistant U.S. attorney in Wyoming, and spent 14 years in private practice. Attorney general Phillips has also served as a part-time deputy county attorney, an assistant municipal judge and as a state senator. Following law school, he served as a law clerk to the Honorable Alan B. Johnson of the U.S. district court for the District of Wyoming. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Phillips ``well qualified,'' its highest rating.  At his Judiciary Committee hearing, Attorney General Phillips was introduced by his two Republican home State Senators, Senator Enzi and Senator Barrasso, both of whom strongly support his nomination. He was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee nearly 3 months ago. While his confirmation vote has not been delayed quite as long as votes on most of President Obama's nominees, he could and should have been confirmed last May when the majority leader offered.  With the confirmation of Attorney General Phillips, there will be 10 active judges on the Tenth Circuit. According to the most recent data, this means that the number of pending appeals per active judge on that court will drop from 150 to 135. I mention this because another appellate court, the DC Circuit, currently has 177 pending appeals per active judge. Despite that higher caseload, some Senate Republicans argue that the DC Circuit's caseload is too low, and that three of its judgeships should be eliminated. I suspect that many, if not all, of these Senators will vote to confirm Attorney General Phillips, even though his confirmation means that the Tenth Circuit will now have the lowest caseload in the country, just as earlier this year they supported the confirmation of Jane Kelly to the Eighth Circuit, which gave that court the lowest caseload in the country, and just as they supported the confirmation of Robert Bacharach to the Tenth Circuit, which gave that court the lowest caseload in the country. I hope those Senators will reconsider their double standard and not play politics with an independent branch of government.  Some of the same Senate Republicans who are opposing President Obama's three nominees to the DC Circuit are also criticizing him for making too few nominations and somehow claiming that many vacancies without a nominee cannot possibly be the fault of Senate Republicans. I recall that before President Obama made a single judicial nomination, all Senate Republicans sent him a letter threatening to filibuster his nominees if he did not consult Republican home State Senators. They cannot have it both ways.  I take very seriously my responsibility to make recommendations when we have vacancies in Vermont, whether the President is a Democrat or a Republican, and other Senators should do the same. After all, if there are not enough judges in our home States, it is our own constituents who suffer. It should be only a matter of weeks or months, not years, for Senators to make recommendations.  Unfortunately, in some States it appears as if there is no effort being made to recommend qualified nominees to the administration. There are three district vacancies in Georgia without nominees, and the oldest is over 4 years old. There are three district vacancies in Kentucky without nominees, and the oldest is over a year and a half old. There are seven district vacancies in Texas without nominees, and the oldest is over 4\1/2\ years old. Three months ago the Senators from Texas announced a nominations commission, but it is my understanding that it is still not accepting applications. If Senators want new judgeships in their States, they should be working especially hard to ensure that all existing ones are filled. Republican Senators who demanded to be consulted on nominations should live up to their responsibilities and fulfill their constitutional obligation to advise the President on nominations. They should follow the example of Democratic Senators: the administration has received recommendations for all current district vacancies in States represented by two Democratic Senators.  Moreover, the failure of some Republican Senators to help fill vacancies in their own States does not excuse their unwillingness to complete action on the nominations the President has made. I regret that I must correct the record, again, on how Senate Republicans have obstructed judicial nominees over the past 4 years. The continued assertion by Senate Republicans that 99 percent of President Obama's nominees have been confirmed is not accurate. President Obama has nominated 243 individuals to be circuit or district judges, and 197 have been confirmed by the Senate. That is 81 percent, not 99 percent. By way of comparison, at the same point in President Bush's second term, July 8 of his fifth year in office, President Bush had nominated 10 fewer people to be circuit or district judges, but had seen 215 of them confirmed, which is 18 more confirmations. The truth is that 92 percentof President Bush's judicial nominees had been confirmed at the same point, 11 percentage points more than have been allowed for President Obama. That is an apples-to-apples comparison, and it demonstrates the undeniable fact that the Senate has confirmed a lower number and a lower percentage of President Obama's nominees than President Bush's nominees at the same time in their Presidencies.  I noted at the end of last year, while Senate Republicans were insisting on delaying confirmations of 15 judicial nominees that should have taken place in wrap up, we would not likely be allowed to complete work on them until May. That was precisely the Republican plan. So when Senate Republicans now seek to claim credit for their confirmations in President Obama's second term, they are inflating the confirmation statistics. The truth is that only 11 circuit and district confirmations have taken place this year that are not attributable to those nominations Senate Republicans needlessly held over from last year. To use a baseball analogy, if a baseball player goes 0 for 9, and then gets a hit, we do not say he is an all star because he is batting 1.000 in his last at bat. We recognize that he is just 1 for 10, and not a very good hitter, nor would a fair calculation of hits or home runs allow a player to credit those that occurred in one game to the next because it would make his stats look better.  If President Obama's nominees were receiving the same treatment as President Bush's, today's vote would bring us to 215 confirmations, not 198, and vacancies would be far lower. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has noted that it will require 29 more district and circuit confirmations this year to match President Bush's 5-year total. Even with the confirmations finally concluded during the first 6 months of this year, Senate Republicans have still not allowed President Obama to match even the record of President Bush's first term. Even with an extra 6 months, we are still eight confirmations behind where we were at the end of 2004.  The assertion by some Senate Republicans that ``there is no difference in how this President's nominees are being treated versus how President Bush's nominees were treated'' is simply not supported by the facts. Compared to the same point in the Bush administration, there have been more nominees filibustered, fewer confirmations, and longer wait times for nominees, even though President Obama has nominated more people and there are more vacancies. And while Senate Republicans have taken to comparing President Obama's fifth year to President Bush's fifth year, the fact is that there were fewer confirmations then because we had done such good work in President Bush's first term, in particular the 100 confirmations we achieved during the 17 months in 2001 and 2002 when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In fact, from June 9, 2005, until October 20, 2005, there were no consensus judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar. So the only reason there have been more votes this year than in 2005 is that, contrary to Republicans' assertions, we have had more nominees this year, mostly because they were held over from last year by Senate Republicans.  While the routine and sustained delays over the past 4 years are without precedent, Republicans point to June 2004 as the one time that there were a number of President Bush's nominees pending on the floor. I recall that in early 2004, President Bush had bypassed the Senate and recess appointed two controversial nominees to be circuit judges and that around that time we learned that Republican committee staff hacked into a shared server to pilfer Democratic files. Still, we were able to clear nominations by confirming more than 20 consensus nominees in just 1 month. There is nothing like that to explain the years of backlogged judicial nominees during this administration.  Context matters. Anyone can point to this example or that example, but when you look at the whole picture, it is clear that President Obama's nominees have faced unprecedented delays on the Senate floor and that his nominees have been less likely to be confirmed than President Bush's at the same point.  But the context of these statistics also matters. Judicial nominations should not be about partisan tit for tat. Judicial vacancies impact millions of people, all across America, who depend on our Federal courts for justice. When you compare the Senate's record from 2001 to 2005, and from 2009 to 2013, it is clear that we are not meeting the standard we set for how quickly the Senate can act to fill judicial vacancies. Throughout my career, whether as a prosecutor or as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have fought for justice, and to ensure that people have access to justice and can have their day in court. That is why my recent statements have discussed not only the delays in the nominations process, but also the impact of sequestration cuts on our legal system. I continue to hear from judges and other legal professionals about the serious problems sequestration either has caused or will cause if we do not fix it.  Chief Justice John Roberts recently noted that sequestration ``hit [the judiciary] particularly hard. . . . When we have sustained cuts that means people have to be furloughed or worse and that has a more direct impact on the services that we can provide.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article titled ``Chief Justice Roberts: Sequester cuts hitting federal judiciary `hard' '' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement. We should all be doing everything we can to help our coequal branch meet the Constitution's promise of justice for all Americans.  The impact of sequestration on the third branch is compounded by the high level of judicial vacancies. I know we can do better because we have done better. Each day that Senate Republicans refuse to confirm the qualified judicial nominees who have been reviewed and voted on by the Judiciary Committee is another day that a judge could have been working to resolve disputes. Hard-working Americans should not have to wait years to have their cases decided.  Even if it were true, it is not good enough to say that the Senate is treating President Obama's nominees the same as it treated President Bush's. The real question is whether the Senate is meeting its duty to do everything it reasonably can to ensure the American people have access to justice. When Senate Republicans refuse to make recommendations for nominees, and then delay votes on consensus nominees, they are not somehow hurting the President, they are hurting the American people and our justice system.  Today, Attorney General Phillips will finally be confirmed by the Senate, and there are many more nominees the Senate should consider in the coming weeks. Tomorrow, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hear from James Comey, who President Obama has nominated to serve as FBI Director. Later this week the committee will begin the process of considering the first of three current nominees to the DC Circuit. The Judiciary Committee is also scheduled this week to vote on the nomination of B. Todd Jones to serve as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. The ATF has been without a Senate-confirmed Director since 2006. Senate Republicans refused to allow a vote on President Bush's nominee to lead the ATF and I hope they will not attempt to do the same again. Nominees to lead the Labor Department and the Environmental Protection Agency are also awaiting our consideration. I hope the Senate will be able to come together and confirm these worthy nominees without the delay that has befallen so many nominees in the past 4 years.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From The Hill, June 29, 2013]    Chief Justice Roberts: Sequester Cuts Hitting Federal Judiciary                                 ``Hard''                             (By Ben Geman)       Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Saturday said      the sequester is hurting the judicial branch and that he's      hopeful Congress will provide flexibility.       Roberts, speaking at a conference in West Virginia, noted      that the judicial branch of government overall is less than      one percent of the federal budget.       ``You get a whole branch of government under the      Constitution for relative pennies, and the idea that we have      to be swept along because it is good public policy to cut      everybody--I am not commenting on that policy at all--but the      notion that we should just be swept along with it I think is      really unfounded,'' Roberts said of the across-the-board      budget cuts.       ``The cuts hit us particularly hard because we are made up      of people. That is what the judicial branch is. It is not      like we are the Pentagon where you can slow up a particular      procurement program or a lot of the other agencies. When we      have sustained cuts that mean people have to be furloughed or      worse and that has a more direct impact on the services that      we can provide,'' he added, speaking at the Fourth Circuit      Judicial Conference.       Roberts said the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts      is working with congressional appropriators ``to get them to      go to bat for us,'' and that he's hopeful. ``I hope we are      able to make an effective case for why need a little bit more      flexibility than others,'' Roberts said.       And, in a bit of humor, he tried some obvious flattery.       ``I just want to say publicly, that I think our      appropriators in Congress are the best legislators since      Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, and you can quote me on that      if you'd like,'' Roberts said.       In other remarks, Roberts said the Supreme Court justices      are asking too many questions from the bench during oral      arguments.       ``We do overdo it,'' Roberts said. ``The bench has gotten      more and more aggressive.'' He noted that lawyers trying to      present their arguments ``feel cheated sometimes.''       He said that justices do not talk about cases before the      arguments. So they use questions as a way to ``bring out      points that we think our colleagues ought to know about,''      and debate one another through questions to lawyers making      arguments.       But he said, ``That is an explanation. It is not meant as      an excuse.''       ``I do think we have gone too far,'' Roberts said. ``It is      too much and I think we do need to address it a little bit.''       Roberts comments came after a busy week for the court, with      justices handing down rulings striking down a key portion of      the Voting Rights Act and ruling the Defense of Marriage Act      unconstitutional.
