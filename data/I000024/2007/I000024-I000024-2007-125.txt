But getting the Administrator authority to use the Clean Air Act to regulate water quality is something I would have to think about a little bit.  Let me go back and talk a little bit about the amendment we are running concurrently with the other amendments. This is amendment 1666. We have a lot of cosponsors to this. I would invite more to come down. I think people would see this is a very rational way to address one of the problems with the mandates that come with this bill.  We seek to ensure the bill does not pick winners and losers in domestic agriculture. Although high corn prices might be good for corn farmers, it is harmful for livestock and poultry industries.  Now, in my State of Oklahoma, I don't have a dog in this fight, or I guess I could say I have all the dogs in this fight, because we are a corn State, we are a very large livestock State. I have heard from a lot of our people there expressing their concerns.  In fact, 15 industry groups have joined together and sent both Senate leaders a letter expressing their concern that the biofuels title in this bill could harm their industries.  I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of my remarks to have printed in the Record a copy of that letter.
