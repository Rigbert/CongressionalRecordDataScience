 In particular, all of us are grateful for our district directors, as we are for all of our staff. But our district directors are ``us'' for so many instances, for so many constituents, and for so many different events.  They represent us when we cannot be there, when we are here in Washington. They are our eyes and ears on the ground when we are here. They are the angels on our shoulders who remind us that everything we do on a national level needs to benefit our constituents back home.  For the past 30 years, I have been blessed--the Fifth Congressional District has been blessed--to be a colleague of Betsy Bossart.  I love Betsy Bossart, and my constituents love Betsy Bossart.  Before she served as my district director, she was my administrative assistant, the jack of all trades who made sure my office ran smoothly, and served as one of my chief advisers.  Betsy joined my staff on March 3, 1989, 30 years ago, and until she retired--sadly, from my perspective--last month, she served me, the people of the Fifth District, and our country every day.  With her departure, my office--and, indeed, this House--is diminished by the end of her extraordinary service.  Betsy gave her time and energy selflessly for the people of the Fifth District, working many, many late nights, many weekends, and long days.  She has taken meetings with every organization and visited nearly every school and medical facility and government office in the counties I represent.  Betsy Bossart has been so successful as my district director because she is an excellent listener and has a deep wellspring of empathy for people.  She has been a role model, Madam Speaker, for others on my staff and a champion, an advocate for young people coming into public service and waiting to make differences in their communities and in their country.  She has been an unsung hero of my team for three decades.  It is largely because of Betsy's hard work behind the scenes that we are able to organize the Rebuilding Together program--formerly known as Christmas in April--in all five counties in our district. It is a day of service that brings people from all walks of life together to repair homes, revitalize communities, and help our neighbors.  Because of Betsy's efforts, we have the annual Fifth District Women's Luncheon, dedicated to advancing women's equality and raising awareness of women leaders in the Fifth District and our country.  Because of her, we have robust support for the network of early childhood centers in Maryland named in memory of my wife, Judy, who had a wonderful relationship with Betsy as well.  Maryland's Judy Centers will always be a major part of Betsy's legacy, and the thousands of children and families who benefited from their services may not know Betsy or what she did to make the Judy Centers possible, but they will always owe her and her colleagues who partnered with her on that effort a debt of gratitude.  Along with her friend and my friend, Betty Richardson--another longtime member of my team, who has since retired but remains very active in my district--as partners, Betty and Betsy were also instrumental in launching the annual Fifth District Black History Breakfast, now in its 38th year.  All the young people who participate in the annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby have Betsy to thank for being able to use the Capitol Grounds.  Madam Speaker, I will look back with many, many, many fond memories of my time working with Betsy Bossart, my friend, my colleague, my coworker, whom I had the opportunity to work with to advance the interest of our district.  We traveled together to South Africa and met with Nelson Mandela, discussing the important issue of racial justice and unity through history and healing.  We have attended so many events together across Prince George's County and southern Maryland, making sure that every one of our constituent's voices is heard loudly and clearly in Congress.  As majority leader and Democratic whip over the past 16 years, I have had to balance service to our district with my responsibilities to our Caucus and to our country. Betsy has spent every single day of that time making sure that our district always comes first.  I will miss Betsy. I expect to remain her friend throughout my life, but I will miss her daily advice and expertise, though I am relieved that she will always be just a phone call away.  As she retires, Madam Speaker, to spend more time with her husband and their family in Pennsylvania, I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Betsy Bossart for 30 dedicated years, yes, to me, but, more importantly, to our constituents, to our State, and to our country.  Madam Speaker, were I to speak another 2 hours--as some fear--I could not thank Betsy Bossart enough.  God bless Betsy Bossart, a wonderful friend, a wonderful American.                          ____________________
