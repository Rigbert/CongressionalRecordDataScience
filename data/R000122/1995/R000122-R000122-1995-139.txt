Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and salute Al Gunther, a distinguished individual from Rhode Island who is being honored for his outstanding contributions to the Boy Scouts of America on the occasion of his retirement from his position as Ranger of Camp Yawgoog.  He first came to Camp Yawgoog in 1959 with his wife Diane and for the past 36 years he has devoted his time and talents to providing young people with the rewarding experiences of camping. His leadership of Yawgoog was also enhanced by a unique blend of management skill and a special affection for his fellow man.  The Boy Scouts of Rhode Island owe a debt of gratitude to Al Gunther for his dedication and commitment. During his stewardship, Camp Yawgoog has prevailed through fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, blizzards, and other adversities. His efforts have ensured that the camp has not only survived but flourished. Over a quarter of a million boys and campers have benefited from Al Gunther's hard work and from the humanitarian spirit which has prevailed at Camp Yawgoog.  [[Page E976]] I respectfully request that my colleagues join me in saluting Albert R. Gunther and recognizing his contributions to generations of young people, and toward the betterment of our community.                          ____________________
