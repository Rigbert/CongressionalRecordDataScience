 President, I rise today along with Senators Hutchison, Durbin, Snowe, Leahy and Feingold to reintroduce the ``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2005,'' a bill to help the thousands of children who are abducted by a family member each year. We introduced this legislation last Congress, but it is just as needed today as it was then.  Family abductions are the most common form of abduction, yet they receive little attention, and law enforcement often doesn't treat them as the serious crimes that they are.  The Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2005 would provide grants to States for costs associated with family abduction prevention. Specifically, it would assist States with: costs associated with the extradition of individuals suspected of committing the crime of family abduction; costs borne by State and local law enforcement agencies to investigate cases of missing children; training for local and State law enforcement agencies in responding to family abductions; outreach and media campaigns to educate parents on the dangers of family abductions; and assistance to public schools to help with costs associated with ``flagging'' school records.  Each year, over 200,000 children--78 percent of all abductions in the United States--are kidnapped by a family member, usually a non-custodial parent.  More than half of abducting parents have a history of domestic violence, substance abuse, or a criminal record.  Most State and local law enforcement agencies do not treat these abductions as serious crimes. Approximately 70 percent of law enforcement agencies do not have written guidelines on responding to family abduction and many are not informed about the Federal laws available to help in the search and recovery of an abducted child.  Many people believe that a child is not in grave danger if the abductor is a family member. Unfortunately, this is not true, and this assumption can endanger a child's life. Research shows that the most common motive in family abduction cases is revenge against the other parent--not love for the child.  The effects of family abduction on children are very traumatic. Abducted children suffer from severe separation anxiety. To break emotional ties with the left-behind parent, some family abductors will coach a child into falsely disclosing abuse by the other parent to perpetuate their control during or after abduction. The child is often told that the other parent is dead or did not really love them.  As the child adapts to a fugitive's lifestyle, deception becomes a part of life. The child is taught to fear those that one would normally trust, such as police, doctors, teachers and counselors. Even after recovery, the child often has a difficult time growing into adulthood.  Let me give an illustrative example about a girl named Rebekah. On Takeroot.org, a website devoted to victims of family abductions, Rebekah told the story of when her mother kidnapped her.  Her mother was diagnosed as manic and was verbally abusive to her children and husband. Rebekah's father was awarded full custody of her and her brothers. However, one weekend, when Rebekah was 4-years-old, her mother took her to Texas.  Her mother had all Rebekah's moles and distinguishing marks removed from her body and she had fake birth certificates made for Rebekah and herself. As Rebekah grew up, she was told that her father didn't love her and that her siblings didn't want to see her. When the FBI finally found Rebekah, she didn't remember her father and felt very alone.  In addition, in many family abduction cases, children are given new identities at an age when they are still developing a sense of who they are. In extreme cases, the child's sexual identity is covered up to avoid detection.  Abducting parents often deprive their children of education and much-needed medical attention to avoid the risk of being tracked via school or medical records.  In some cases, the abducting parent leaves the child with strangers at an underground ``safe house'' where health, safety, and other basic needs are extremely compromised.  For example, in Lafayette, CA, two girls were abducted by their mother and moved from house to house under the control of a convicted child molester. Kelli Nunez absconded with her daughters, 6-year-old Anna and 4-year-old Emily in violation of court custody orders. Nunez drove her daughters cross-country, and then returned by plane to San Francisco, where she handed the children to someone holding a coded sign at the airport.  The person holding the sign belonged to an underground vigilante group called the California Family Law Center led by Florencio Maning, a convicted child molester. For six months, Maning orchestrated the concealment of the Nunez girls with help from other people. Luckily, police were able to track down the girls, and they were successfully reunited with their father.  California has been the Nation's leader in fighting family abduction. In my State, we have a system that places the responsibility for the investigation and resolution of family abduction cases with the County District Attorney's Office. Each California County District Attorney's Office has an investigative unit that is focused on family abduction cases. These investigators only handle family abduction cases and become experts in the process.  However, most States lack the training and resources to effectively recover children who are kidnapped by a family member. According to a study conducted by Plass, Finkelhor and Hotaling, 62 percent of parents surveyed said they were ``somewhat'' or ``very'' dissatisfied with police handling of their family abduction cases.  The ``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2005'' would be an important first step in addressing this serious issue.  I urge my colleagues to quickly act on this important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 994       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Abduction Prevention      Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress findings that--       (1) each year more than 203,000 children in the United      States (approximately 78 percent of all abducted children)      are abducted by a family member, usually a parent;       (2) more than half of the parents who abduct their children      have a history of alcohol or substance abuse, a criminal      record, or a history of violence;       (3) the most common motive for family abduction is revenge      against the other parent, not protecting the child's safety;       (4) children who are abducted by family members suffer      emotional, psychological, and often physical abuse at the      hands of their abductors;       (5) children who are victims of family abductions are      forced to leave behind family, friends, their homes, their      neighborhoods, their schools, and all that is familiar to      them;       (6) children who are victims of family abductions are often      told that the parent who did not abduct the child has died,      does not love them, or will harm them;       (7) children who are abducted by their parents or other      family members are sometimes forced to live in fear of      discovery and may be compelled to conceal their true      identity, including their real names, family histories, and      even their gender;       (8) children who are victims of family abductions are often      denied the opportunity to attend school or to receive health      and dental care;       (9) child psychologists and law enforcement authorities now      classify family abduction as a form of child abuse;       (10) approximately 70 percent of local law enforcement      agencies do not have written guidelines for what to do in the      event of a family abduction or how to facilitate the recovery      of an abducted child;       (11) the first few hours of a family abduction are crucial      to recovering an abducted child, and valuable hours are lost      when law enforcement is not prepared to employ the most      effective techniques to locate and recover abducted children;       (12) when parents who may be inclined to abduct their own      children receive counseling and education on the harm      suffered by children under these circumstances, the incidence      of family abductions is greatly reduced; and       (13) where practiced, the flagging of school records has      proven to be an effective tool in assisting law enforcement      authorities find abducted children.
