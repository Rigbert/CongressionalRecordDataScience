It is the Republican Party of the President that stopped our consideration of this bill this morning, with the exception of one Senator, Mr. Stevens. And when we are asked time and again, Will you please stand behind the President, maybe we should say to our friends across America who follow this debate: We are standing behind the President; please ask the President's party to stand behind the President. It appears that is where it has broken down.
