President, I rise today to introduce a bill to allow physical and occupational therapists to enroll in the Armed Forces Health Professionals Scholarship Program. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague, Senator Coons of Delaware. Our legislation provides tuition assistance to critical health care professionals in exchange for service as a commissioned medical officer.  Unfortunately, while the need for physical therapists has grown during the last ten years of combat, neither the Department of Defense nor the military services have conducted a separate analysis of the current or future DoD workforce requirements for occupational and physical therapists, even though such an analysis was required by last year's Defense authorization bill.  This legislation would allow the military services to extend the same kind of educational benefits to physical and occupational therapists that are already afforded to physicians, dentists, physician assistants, and even veterinarians.  Physical and occupational therapists at the military's major medical centers serve approximately 600 wounded warriors every day on their road to recovery. More than 32,000 service members have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, including many who have suffered very serious injuries and amputations. Physical and occupational therapists play a critical role in the prevention of injury, rehabilitation, and recovery of wounded warriors. They not only serve in medical facilities, but are also embedded with combat brigade teams on the battlefield. They use their medical training and skill to overcome impairments, regardless of the cause to enable service members to overcome disability and succeed in all aspects of life.  The idea for this bill came directly from a visit I had with a wounded Marine from Maine at the National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland in November. He was severely wounded by an IED in Afghanistan. He lost part of one leg and his other leg contains shrapnel wounds. Both of his arms were wounded, and he has a traumatic brain injury as well. In short, he has very serious wounds that are going to require a very lengthy recovery period. But, his spirits are amazingly strong and upbeat.  However, when I asked him if he had any concerns, while he praised the care he was receiving, he said there was a severe shortage of physical therapists and other trained clinical personnel to help him in what is going to be a very long recovery. He is expected to be at Bethesda for another nine months. It troubles me that he believes there are not a sufficient number of physical therapists to help him and the other wounded warriors who are hospitalized at Bethesda.  While the Department of Defense reports that it does not face a shortage in these professions overall, both the Air Force and the Navy report shortages in physical therapists, physical therapy technicians, and occupational therapists. One out of every four physical therapist positions in the active duty Navy is currently unfilled. So including these medical professions in this existing educational program would help meet this need.  This bill is also endorsed by both the American Physical Therapy Association and the American Occupational Therapy Association, who agree this effort will help curtail a possible shortage of these valuable professionals in the future.  I wish to point out, we are not authorizing additional or new funding inthis bill, it is simply an important insurance policy against a shortfall of these medical professions that will help the Navy and the Air Force fill vacancies. After all, it is these talented and committed professionals who are helping our wounded warriors return to living full and independent lives.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                                 American Physical                                          Therapy Association.     Senator Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the more than 77,000      members of the American Physical Therapy Association, I write      to thank you for your amendment to the National Defense      Authorization Act and your introduction of legislation to      include physical therapists in the Health Professions      Scholarship Program (HPSP).       APTA commends your efforts to add physical therapists to      the HPSP. This legislation will enable more of these highly      qualified professionals to help treat our nation's wounded      warriors and ensure that there will be no shortage in the      future. There should never be any disruption in care for the      reason of inadequate personnel.       As you know, physical therapists play a critical role in      the prevention of injury, rehabilitation, and recovery of      wounded warriors around the world. They not only serve at      medical facilities like the Walter Reed National Military      Medical Center (WRNMMC), but they are also found on the      battlefield with the Army Medical Specialist Corps and are      embedded with combat brigade teams. They aid in shortening      the recovery time of soldiers so they can return to service,      and are a necessary and integral part of the health care      structure of the armed forces.       Thank you for your commitment to improving the      rehabilitation and well being of our wounded warriors. Please      contact Michael Hurlbut, Associate Director of Congressional      Affairs, at [email protected] or 703-706-3160, if you      have any questions or would like any additional information.           Sincerely,                                           R. Scott Ward, PT, PhD,     President.                                  ____                                         The American Occupational                                    Therapy Association, Inc.,                                   Bethesda, MD, December 7, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American      Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), the national      professional association representing the interests of more      than over 140,000 occupational therapists, occupational      therapy assistants and students of occupational therapy, I am      writing to thank you for sponsoring legislation to promote      occupational therapy within the United States military. This      legislation seeks to authorize educational assistance under      the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program for      the pursuit of advanced degrees in occupational therapy and      physical therapy.       Occupational therapy is a skilled health, wellness and      rehabilitation service with the goal of improving function,      independence and quality of life so that individuals can lead      more productive and rewarding lives. Occupational therapists      work within the military from the frontlines in Combat Stress      Control teams throughout the continuum of care to long-term      rehabilitation and stateside community reintegration. While      occupational therapists are present in every branch of the      service the Army has the largest and most prominent role for      occupational therapy; using the professions unique focus on      overcoming impairments regardless of the cause to enable      soldiers to overcome disability and succeed in all aspects of      life.       The current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have dramatically      increased the demand for occupational therapy practitioners      within the military. The signature injuries of these      conflicts include traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic      stress disorder, traumatic amputation and poly-trauma. Within      both the military and the Veterans Administration      occupational therapists work as critical members of the      treatment teams to address each of these conditions.       AOTA and our members in the civilian world and the military      appreciate your leadership and vision in promoting      occupational therapy education and training for service      members so that they can go on to meet the needs of fellow      soldiers and society as a whole. Both within the military and      the private sector, demand for occupational therapy is      expected to increase dramatically and your legislation can      help meet those needs.       We look forward to working with you and your staff to enact      this legislation during this session of Congress so that more      occupational therapists are trained to meet the health care,      rehabilitation and reintegration needs of our service      members.           Sincerely,                                                   Tim Nanof, MSW,                                      Director of Federal Affairs.                                 ______                                   By
