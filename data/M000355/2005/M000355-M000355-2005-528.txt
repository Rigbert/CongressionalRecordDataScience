 Eight minutes 20 seconds.  Mr. McCONNELL. We are talking with the floor staff on the other side about getting additional time on this side since a bit more was used on the other side.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cornyn be given 2 extra minutes, then I be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, followed by Senator Brownback for 5 minutes.
