 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by several high school students at Peoples Academy in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Our topic is: changing the education system. We don't have      any great solutions, or anything, but we just want to      increase the awareness of the fact that there's too much      emphasis put on getting good grades, and having a good score.      And the desire to learn is gone; or if it's not gone, it's      not there very much, or whatever. The result of this is that      students just go through school just . . . playing the      motions, getting good grades, having tests, memorizing and      they're not necessarily learning anything; or discovering . .      . how they are self-learners, like what is the best way for      them to learn, which they can carry with them throughout      life.       Another thing that we think is that teachers seem bored.      They're teaching the same thing again and again and again,      and . . . becomes monotonous; it makes learning more of a      chore. . . .        Along the same lines, we think that perhaps there could be      more courses--there's a lot of courses out there that are      trying to help teachers learn how to become better educators;      but many times the teachers themselves don't have the desire      to become better educated. If those teachers could, instead      of going to classes and things like that and learning how, we      could find the teachers that are considered good teachers,      that actually want to help someone . . . I dare say, that the      majority of people that become teachers don't necessarily      become a teacher and say, ``Well, I want to go out there and      help better the education of our youth, and . . . become      better people. They say, ``This'll be a good paycheck for me.       And that's another thing that is a real problem with the      way the system is set up right now: that money and getting a      good paycheck is how things are judged by, and if you want to      become a doctor, or whatever, it's not because you want to      help cure disease, it's because you want a BMW. And, if these      things are taught in the school, then that's obviously how      it's going to be presented, but if we could . . . help people      understand what they would enjoy doing, and less emphasis on      money. Perhaps trying to help people understand that, ``Well,      hey, money's not the only thing out there, you know, you've      got to go to a job 40 hrs./week, making $50,000/yr., and hate      my job, that's not something that's going to make your life      happy. So, if we could change things, and help . . . people      understand that you have to want to learn; you need to      understand what you need to go out and learn about yourself.       And this is going to help in the school system also,      because if someone's enjoying what they're learning, they're      going to actually go out and do it themselves; they're going      to be interested. I dare say that some people, if not most      people are here today because it's for a class; they have to      be here for a class, not because they're interested in the      political system, but because it's a break. And if that's      going to be the way things are, then nobody's going to be      happy in their life; and that's a bigger issue than simply      educating. (APPLAUSE)       We also feel that . . . you shouldn't have as many required      courses; you have a four-year English requirement to      graduate, and had my 4th year of English, and just sat      through my English classes--I couldn't wait until it was      over, I didn't learn much of anything, I just got by. I think      that there should be more elective classes that you can take,      that you're interested in, so that you have more interest to      learn, I think that would be better for the students. Along      the same lines also, that it is a major problem how general      the courses are . . . The general courses are made to expose      us to a lot of things, so that we can try to find out what we      enjoy. But instead, it actually decreases that, because the      system that's presented is looked at as something that's not      enjoyable. So a kid--maybe does enjoy reading, but perhaps      the way it's presented isn't for him. So, he may go away      thinking, ``I'm no good at English, I can't get it right.''      But that's not necessarily the case. It may be that the      system that the English is being presented [in] is the      problem. So you need to look at that, it's more than just      looking at, ``Well, he's just a bad student.''                          ____________________
