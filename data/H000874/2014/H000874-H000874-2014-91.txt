 I know he has this expectation also, but I hope that we would pass the appropriations bills individually in the manner that we have considered the previous bills on this floor.  I note that the Labor-Health bill has not been marked up in subcommittee, and I would simply ask him, in light of the fact that has not moved through subcommittee yet, if that would be one of the bills that he would anticipate bringing to the floor before September 30.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I do not anticipate that bill coming up next week, but as we look towards the remainder of the July schedule, we will certainly notify the Members for the consideration of the House.
