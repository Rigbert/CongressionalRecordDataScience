President, I am introducing today legislation that will allow the Forest Service to sell an abandoned facility to the city of Bend, OR, to be used for recreational purposes. The idea for this legislation came from the citizens of Bend themselves. They worked with Forest Service personnel in the adjacent Deschutes National Forest and crafted a win-win solution to different problems. What others might have seen as a problem, namely the shutdown of the Pine Nursery facility, they saw as an opportunity--the opportunity to provide a recreational complex for the community and to generate funding for needed facilities in the Deschutes Forest. This legislation would allow them to implement this creative idea.  Faced with the inevitable sale, trade or development of the Forest Service's Bend Pine Nursery, which supplied seedlings for five decades of reforestation work, last spring I met with representatives from the Bend Metro Parks and Recreation District; the city of Bend; the Bend School District; folks from the soccer and Little League baseball programs; and others who are concerned about central Oregon's youth and adults having adequate recreational facilities.  What these folks asked me to do was very straightforward: if the Forest service is going to sell, exchange, or otherwise develop the former Bend Pine Nursery, the community wanted the opportunity to acquire the property for the development of a sports complex, playing fields and other facilities.  My bill simply creates an opportunity for the Bend Metro Parks and Recreation District to work with the people of Bend on whether or not to purchase this property. It does not require purchase by the community, it simply gives the community a right of first refusal to buy the property at fair market value.  At the same time, this legislation allows the Deschutes National Forest to address its need for a new administrative site. Currently, the Deschutes pays approximately $725,000 per year in annual lease and utility costs. This is \3/4\ of a million dollars that is not being spent on the ground, improving the quality of Deschutes National Forest facilities, lands and resources. It is a credit to the leadership of the Deschutes National Forest that they seek a way out from this unnecessary, unproductive and recurring expense.  My bill will enable the Deschutes to use the money raised from the sale of the nursery and other surplus properties in Oregon toward the acquisition--and ownership--of a new administrative site. The cost of a new building is estimated to be about $7 million; as my colleagues can see, the forest is paying almost a million dollars in rent each year. In the words of an ad from today's ``Bend Bulletin'', and I quote: ``Tired of throwing away thousands on rent? Think you can't buy? think again. If you're stuck in the renter rut, try it our way.''  I look forward to a hearing next year on this bill in the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, of whichI am ranking member. I welcome my colleague, Mr. Smith, as an original cosponsor of this innovative bill  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1936       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
