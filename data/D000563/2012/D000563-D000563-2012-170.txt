More recently, the personal story of three of those marines from southern Illinois was brought to my attention.  Most people have heard of the Tuskeegee Airmen and the Buffalo Soldiers, but until recently, the Montford Point Marines were largely unknown to the general public. During the 1940s, segregation and discrimination were pervasive in this country. Unfortunately, the Marine Corps was no exception.  To counteract the injustice, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an Executive order that prohibited racial discrimination in the national defense industry, including Federal agencies. This order forever changed the Marine Corps from an all-white fighting force to one comprised of those willing to serve.  Camp Montford Point, NC, is the site where the first African Americans who joined the Marine Corps were trained. Nearly 20,000 African Americans trained there, many of whom served honorably in World War II. The marines established Camp Montford Point adjacent to Camp Lejeune and those who trained there were known as the Montford Point Marines.  One man who answered the call to serve was Carbondale, IL, resident Archibald Mosley. In 1942, Mosley said that he was a ``girl-crazy'' typical teenager ready to graduate from high school in Jackson County, IL. An exceptional student, Mosley was asked by the principal, along with a handful of other students, to serve in the marines.  Mosley enlisted with two of his friends, Saul Griffin, Jr. and James France. Mosley, because his records indicated that he had some college, was chosen to lead the others. They were sent to train at Camp Montford Point.  The conditions for the recruits at Montford Point were miserable. The white men who trained at Camp Lejeune lived in barracks. The African-American men were housed in huts made of beaverboard--similar to thick cardboard. The huts had little, if any, heat in the winter and no relief from the sweltering temperatures in the summer. Nor did they have access to the same equipment. The African Americans didn't know how bad it was--they weren't allowed into the same areas at their White colleagues.  Amazingly, despite their willingness to die for their country, the Montford Point Marines still faced incredible injustices after the deplorable conditions during training. One situation that has continually bothered Mosley was when German prisoners of war were allowed to eat before the African-American Marines. He couldn't understand why the enemy would be able to eat before one of their marine brothers--it appeared that loyalty didn't extend beyond race.  After World War II, marines were sent home to be congratulated by the President. The Montford Point Marines weren't even recognized for their service.  Decades after the doors opened at Camp Montford Point, in November of last year, Congress finally voted to award these honorable men with the highest civilian award in the United States because of their honorable and noble service to America. They were called to serve and they responded--nearly 20,000 strong.  Despite the poor treatment, despite the poor jobs, despite the substandard conditions, the Montford Point Marines served their country. Before all else, they were Americans. Archibald Mosley and his friends lived and breathed the Marine Corps motto, Semper Fidelis, ``Always Faithful.''  I am thankful that they did. I am also thankful that our Nation took the steps we did to ensure those brave Americans received the recognition they were denied for so many years.  Saul Griffin, Jr. and James France didn't live to see it, sadly, but Reverend Mosley and many of his fellow marines were able to make the trip to Washington this summer to receive the long delayed thanks from a grateful Nation.                          ____________________
