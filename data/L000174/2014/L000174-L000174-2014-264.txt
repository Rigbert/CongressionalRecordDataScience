President, I come to the Senate floor today to talk about a treasured Vermont author, Katherine Paterson. Her award-winning prose has won alcolades near and far, but her writing has reached more than just those who have read her published words. In 2004, she started a letter exchange with an American soldier based in Afghanistan. Upon his return, she helped him launch his writing career.  Trent Reedy of the Iowa Army National Guard was enthralled with Paterson's master work, ``Bridge to Terabithia,'' while deployed to Farah, Afghanistan. Reedy's wife Amanda sent him the book, and he loved it so much that he read it in one sitting and sent a thank you note to the author.  Katherine's husband John, whom I knew as a gentle soul, sorted her mail and made sure that his wife saw the letter from Trent. A correspondence began between the two, and Trent finally revealed his intent to become a writer. Upon his return, Trent visited Katherine and John in Vermont and at Katherine's urging, and with her recommendation, studied writing at the Vermont College of Fine Arts and later wrote his first novel, ``Words in the Dust.''  As someone who considers Katherine and her late husband to be special friends, I was thrilled to read Sally Pollak's article in the Burlington Free Press, ``Soldier finds lifeline in letter exchange with Vermont author.'' In fact I was so pleased, I called Katherine the day the story was published.  In addition to being a Vermont treasure, Katherine is an acclaimed author whose stories will be read for generations. Marcelle and I have enjoyed them, our children have enjoyed them, and now our grandchildren enjoy her stories. Katherine's influence is also felt through the many writers she has mentored, including Trent Reedy.  In honor of Katherine Paterson, I ask that Sally Pollak's story from the February 23, 2014, edition of the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 23, 2014]     Soldier Finds Lifeline in Letter Exchange With Vermont Author                           (By Sally Pollak)       While serving in Afghanistan Trent Reedy wrote Katherine      Paterson to say thank you; the friendship that emerged      changed his life.       The truck pulled into the U.S. Army base in Farah,      Afghanistan, on another scorching desert day. This July,      2004, delivery promised exciting things: The cook was      expecting a load of steak. He had rustled up some potatoes to      serve with the meat.       The soldiers in the unit, housed in a stable with a well      that often ran dry, were eager for a real meal. They'd been      eating field rations called MREs, meals ready to eat. Yet      when the cook opened the coveted steak he almost vomited. The      meat had gone rancid en route, recalled Trent Reedy, a      soldier in the unit. The meal was scrapped.       The truck also carried the mail. In it was a package for      Reedy, sent by his wife in Iowa. She had mailed him a book by      Katherine Paterson, ``Bridge to Terabithia.''       Paterson, who lives in Barre, is an acclaimed novelist who      writes books for children and teenagers. She is a former      National Ambassador for Young People's Literature whose      honors include two National Book Awards and two Newbery      Medals, the first for ``Bridge to Terabithia,'' published in      1977.       Reedy's wife, Amanda, read ``Bridge to Terabithia'' in      sixth grade. She sent her husband the book after he mentioned      to her that the stories he was thinking about concerned young      people. Reedy had never read a Paterson book.       The day it arrived at the army base, he read ``Bridge to      Terabithia'' in one sitting. It     would become a kind of lifeline for a frightened young man in      a faraway place with dreams of writing. Reedy read Paterson's      book in the place that would be the setting for his first      novel. ``Bridge to Terabithia'' was also the starting point      of a friendship between Reedy and Paterson.       ``It was amazing,'' Reedy said the other day by telephone      from his home in Spokane, Wash. ``I needed that reminder that      there was still hope and still beauty in the world. At that      time in my life there was none. There was nothing except guns      and fear. I was really not at all sure that I was ever going      to get out of that place.       ``This book gave me a little bit of beauty at that time,      and I needed it. Not the way I need a new app for my iPad. I      needed it to keep my soul alive.''                        Everything was different       Reedy, 35, was an English major at the University of Iowa      when he enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard. Clinton was      president. Reedy never imagined he'd be deployed to fight in      a war. He had graduated from college and was working two      jobs: substitute teacher and monitoring a security camera at      a store.       Ten years ago, on a shift at his security job, Reedy got a      phone call from his sergeant.       ``Stampede,'' the commanding officer said, using the code      word that signaled the guard soldiers were activated for war,      Reedy said.       ``With one phone call, everything was different,'' he said.       After basic training at Fort Hood, Texas, Reedy was sent to      western Afghanistan. Paterson's book reached him about six      months after the word ``stampede'' altered his life. The day      ``Bridge to Terabithia'' arrived, Reedy had a rare break from      his three-part routine: the unit's mission (providing      security for reconstruction efforts), guard duty, sleep. He      read the book.       ``Bridge to Terabithia'' is about two friends--a boy and a      girl--who create an imaginary forest world where they play      together and share adventures. The world is shattered by an      accident: the girl drowns in the river the friends cross by      rope swing to get to Terabithia. Paterson wrote the book      after her son David's close friend was killed by lightning      when the children were eight.       After reading the book, even as he carried his loaded M16      ``scanning my sector to make sure there weren't any hostiles      in the area,'' all he could think about was Paterson's novel.       ``I thought maybe I can keep going if I remember kids are      still having friendships,'' he said. ``And the adventures of      growing up.''       On Aug. 1, 2004, from Farah City, Afghanistan, Reedy wrote      Paterson a letter. He sent it through her publisher--unsure      if it would reach her. The letter begins with an apology that      he didn't type it. Reedy explains that he is writing from      Afghanistan, where he is on a mission ``in support of      Operation Enduring Freedom.''       He thanks Paterson for a book that ``mesmerized'' him.       ``You wrote an absolutely beautiful novel and I, like      Jessie Aarons, fell in love with Leslie Burke,'' Reedy wrote,      referring to characters in Paterson's book. `` . . . Maybe it      was because she was a spark of beauty in a land and a war      where beauty is of so little importance.''       In Vermont, where Paterson moved with her family 28 years      ago, Reedy's letter made its way to her Barre home. It      arrived in a batch of mail sent from her publisher. Paterson,      81, estimates she gets hundreds of letters a year, many from      students who are encouraged by their teachers to write.       (Paterson described a humorous note: ``You're the best      writer in the world,'' the student wrote. ``Sometime I'm      going to read one of your books.'')                          A writer on my hands       Paterson was married for 51 years to John Paterson, a      pastor who died in September. They raised four children      together, and have seven grandchildren. After John Paterson's      retirement in 1995 from the First Presbyterian Church in      Barre, he took up the practice of reading Katherine      Paterson's mail. Each year, he passed on to Katherine      Paterson a handful of letters among the hundreds he read.      John Paterson selected Reedy's letter and gave it to his      wife.       ``You just read it and weep,'' Katherine Paterson said.      ``And you think this poor, lonely kid out there, not knowing      what was going to happen to him.''       She was struck by another aspect of his letter: ``By the      time I finished that letter,'' Paterson said, ``I knew I had      a writer on my hands.''       The two became pen pals, a friendship whose beginnings      remain a source of happy amazement for Reedy.       ``I didn't need to hear back,'' Reedy said. ``I just wanted      to thank her for letting me keep going. And I thought she      should know that what she's doing is really important.''       Yet he received a response in October, 2004.       ``She talked about how special it feels for a reader to      appreciate this story she had written that seemed, at the      time of her writing it, to be almost too personal to share,''      Reedy recalled.       The next month, on leave in Iowa, Reedy bought all the      Katherine Paterson books he could find and brought them back      to Afghanistan with him.       ``I read those and loved them,'' he said. ``There were some      Afghans who were learning English, and I passed along the      books to them and talked about how much I enjoyed her      books.''       What Reedy initially kept to himself in his correspondence      with Paterson was that he aspired to be a writer. He decided      to share this when it occurred to him he might not make it      home alive. But he never sent her any writing (apart from the      letters), mindful of imposing on her.       Reedy did seek Katherine Paterson's advice about graduate      writing programs, and she recommended Vermont College of Fine      Arts in Montpelier. Paterson is a trustee of the college,      whose low-residency programs include children's and adult      literature.       ``I said `impose,' '' Paterson recalled. `` `Plenty of      people impose on me that I don't like nearly as much as I      like you.' ''       Based on his letters, Paterson offered to write a letter of      recommendation for Reedy. He accepted only after a letter he      expected fell through, she said.       Reedy was accepted at Vermont College of Fine Arts, the      only MFA program he applied to. It was there that he wrote      the manuscript for his first novel, ``Words in the Dust.''      The book, published by Arthur A. Levine Books, tells the      story of an Afghan girl and her family. It concerns the      girl's love for words; and her search for a connection to her      dead mother, and for beauty in a place where it's not so easy      to find that.       Reedy's story was inspired, in part, by a girl he met in      Afghanistan. Like the character in the novel he would write,      the child had a cleft lip. Soldiers in Reedy's unit pooled      their money to pay the girl's transportation to a hospital,      where a U.S. Army doctor performed surgery to repair her      face.       ``She faced this whole thing with this wonderful sort of      quiet courage, this incredible dignity,'' Reedy recalled. ``I      promised her that I would do whatever I could to tell her      story. She couldn't understand me, but that's what I told      her. In the army, we have to keep our promises, so you don't      make many. I think if I hadn't made that promise, I wouldn't      have been able to stick through to the end to write that      book.''       He was also encouraged by Katherine Paterson to continue      writing the book. Her support came amid concerns about cross-     cultural writing: a white man from Iowa writing a novel about      a disfigured girl in war-torn Afghanistan.       ``I asked her if this made any sense, and if she thought it      was a good idea to write this,'' Reedy said. ``And she said,      `Well, I think you should try.' And that was all the      permission I needed.''       Paterson, who was born in China, has written books set in      Japan and China. The notion that a writer can't write about a      foreign culture, its people and places, essentially says      imagination is worthless, she said.       ``Ideally, she could write her own story,'' Paterson said      of Reedy's protagonist. ``But she can't yet. And somebody      needs to tell it for her. And I do believe in the power of      imagination. Tolstoy can write about women very well, and he      has never been one.''                             To be a writer       Reedy's book, with an introduction by Katherine Paterson,      was published three years ago. He dedicated it to Paterson      and his father.       ``I loved the book,'' she said. ``And if my name was going      to call attention to it and my name was going to help promote      it, I'd write an introduction.''       In her introduction, Paterson wrote in part: ``I am      profoundly grateful for an introduction to a land and culture      that are foreign to me through this beautiful and often      heartbreaking tale of one strong and compassionate girl. She      will live on in my heart and, I feel sure, the heart of every      reader of this fine book.''       Before his first trip to Vermont, Reedy wrote once more to      Katherine Paterson. He said he'd be honored, should he be      accepted to Vermont College, to buy her a cup of coffee.      Sure, she said, but Paterson also had an idea: Why don't you      come and stay at our house the night before your residency      begins?       In July, 2006, Katherine Paterson ``and Mr. Paterson,'' to      use Reedy's words, picked him up at the airport in Burlington      and drove him to their Barre home.       He was very nervous about meeting Katherine Paterson, Reedy      said, expecting her to show up in an expensive car and drive      him to her rich mansion. But he found that Paterson,      ``arguably the most successful middle-school author who is      really around,'' drives a regular car and lives in a ``normal      house.''       The MFA program at Vermont College ``gave me my dream,''      Reedy said. Yet Katherine Paterson taught him what it means      to be a writer.       ``Nobody has taught me more about how to be the kind of      writer I want to be than Katherine Paterson has,'' Reedy      said. ``No one has taught me more about how to live as a      writer. She has, I think, modeled the need for humility and      generosity.''       Once, feeling he didn't belong at Vermont College of Fine      Arts and that he was ``hopelessly outclassed,'' Reedy      conveyed this in a letter to Katherine Paterson. He wanted to      steal lines from Emily Dickinson and walk around campus      saying: ``I'm nobody. Who are you?''       Paterson wrote back that she, too, is nobody. If she ever      forgets that, she's in big trouble.                          ____________________
