 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1307, the Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act, introduced by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).  When a major disaster strikes, the American people should know how and where their disaster funds are spent without wading through reams of inscrutable government paperwork.  H.R. 1307 would simplify the data collection process for Federal disaster recovery projects and activities by establishing an online repository to which agencies could submit information on projects and spending.  In order to increase transparency to the public, the bill would also create a page on USASpending.gov for the public to track agency disaster recovery activities and the amount of assistance expended, on a quarterly basis.                              {time}  1415  Federal agencies need to be accountable to the victims of disasters so that they can have peace of mind when they are at their most vulnerable.  I strongly support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
