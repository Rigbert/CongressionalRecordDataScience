 President, the Congress is now close to passing and enacting an intelligence authorization bill for the first time since December 2004. Pending at the Senate desk is House bill H.R. 2701, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which the House passed on February 26, 2010.  On behalf of Senator Bond and myself, I have filed an amendment to this House bill, and have asked the majority leader to request unanimous consent that the amendment, in the nature of a substitute, be approved and that the bill be sent back to the House for its final passage.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to describe the amendment and discuss why the passage of this legislation is of great importance to the Intelligence community and for oversight of intelligence.  In all but three respects, this amendment is identical to Senate bill S. 3611, which the Senate passed in August by unanimous consent. That bill had been negotiated with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and had the support of the administration. However, the House did not act on that bill. Instead, last week, the House sent its legislation to the Senate for consideration.  Per agreement with the House and the executive branch, I am therefore introducing this amendment, which replaces the text of the House bill with the previous Senate bill, with the three changes as follows:  The first change is necessary given that fiscal year 2010, the year for which this legislation was first written, ends later this week. The legislation I have offered today therefore does not include a classified annex that describes authorized funding levels for the intelligence community. The amendment text omits references to the classified annex, as well as other provisions that were specific to fiscal year 2010, that were present in S. 3611. This is reflected through the deletion of six provisions in S. 3611: sections 101, 102, 103, 104, 201, and 348. The amendment includes a new section 101, which is being included at the request of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. This section makes clear that all funds appropriated, reprogrammed, or transferred for intelligence or intelligence-related activities in fiscal year 2010 may be obligated or expended. This provision is necessary to meet the terms of section 504(a) of the National Security Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C. Sec.  414.  This legislation also amends section 331 from the version of the bill previously passed by the Senate concerning notification procedures. The amendment adds text to ensure that in the case of a limited notification of a covert action to the House and Senate leaders and chairmen and ranking members of the two intelligence committees--the so-called ``Gang ofEight''--in place of the full membership of those committees, the basis of the limited notification will be reviewed in the executive branch within 180 days and reasons for continuation of the limited notification will be submitted to the Gang of Eight.  The amendment also adds text to require that in the case of a limited notification, the President shall provide to all members of the intelligence committees a ``general description'' of the covert action. This implements the idea first described by the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1980 that the limited notification procedure is to protect in extraordinary cases certain sensitive aspects of an intelligence activity; the purpose of the authority is not to shield entire intelligence programs from the oversight of the full intelligence committees.  Recent legislation from the Select Committee on Intelligence has included similar provisions to the requirement to provide to all committee members a ``general description.'' The committee's bill, S. 1494, which the Senate passed unanimously in September 2009, included a similar provision, but the version of the bill passed in August 2010, S. 3611, did not.  Of note, the legislative language in this amendment makes clear that the general description of the covert action is to be provided by the President to all members of the committees, consistent with the reasons for not yet fully informing all members of the intelligence committees. The administration agrees that this gives the President sufficient flexibility in extraordinary circumstances to protect sensitive national security information.  Finally, the amendment I am offering includes a new section, section 348, on access by the Comptroller General to the information of elements of the intelligence community. Both S. 1494 and H.R. 2701 included sections on audits of intelligence community elements by the Government Accountability Office, GAO. No GAO provision was included in S. 3611 because, at the time that S. 3611 was reported and then acted on by the Senate, no agreement had been reached on a provision that would be acceptable to both the administration and the Congress.  Section 348 represents a compromise that the Congress and the administration can support. It requires the Director of National Intelligence, DNI, to issue a directive on GAO access. While the directive shall be issued following consultation with the Comptroller General, the amendment is clear that this is to be the DNI's directive. It is the DNI who has the responsibility to craft a directive that is consistent with existing law, both as regards the authority of the Comptroller General under title 31 of the United States Code and the provisions of the National Security Act. The directive shall be provided to the Congress before it goes into effect and the appropriate committees of the Congress can then take whatever legislative or oversight actions they deem appropriate.  The Department of Defense has issued a directive governing GAO access to Defense special access programs. This directive is regarded as having resolved successfully the issues that the Department and GAO had previously encountered. As the DNI carries out the duties of this section, it will be important for him to be mindful of the manner in which individual departments with intelligence components have established procedures governing access by GAO. This is true for the Department of Defense as well as other Departments, such the Department of Homeland Security and its intelligence component, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. We expect that the DNI will coordinate closely with the heads of such departments in order to ensure that the DNI's directive resolves outstanding issues without disrupting GAO's working relationships with such departments.  As written, this section requires the Director of National Intelligence to submit this directive to ``the Congress.'' The intent of this provision is to have this directive broadly available, in unclassified form or classified form as the case may be, to those committees with jurisdiction over the DNI, the 16 intelligence entities in the intelligence community, the departments in which those agencies reside, and the GAO.  There are additional technical, typographical and conforming changes included in this legislation from S. 3611, the intelligence bill passed by the Senate in August 2010. This includes a change in section 322, the business system transformation section, in several places where an action was to be taken by September 30, 2010. Those actions are now required to be taken within 60 days after enactment.  In all other respects, the Feinstein-Bond amendment consists of exactly what the Senate has already passed by unanimous consent. The legislative history of S. 3611 is fully applicable to the provisions of this amendment that are carried over from S. 3611. This legislative history includes the committee report, S. Rep. No. 111-223, and the floor statements and letters placed in the Record on Senate passage of S. 3611, see 156 Cong. Rec. S6795-6799--daily ed., August 5, 2010. S. Rep. No. 111-223 has a detailed section-by-section description of the provisions of S. 3611, including a description of the reconciliation of House and Senate provisions from H.R. 2701, as it passed the House, and S. 1494.  I received today a letter from the general counsel in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Robert Litt, indicating that ``the President's senior advisors would recommend that he sign this bill if it is presented for his signature.'' I will ask that this letter be printed in the Record.  As I noted at the outset, there has not been an intelligence authorization act enacted in nearly 6 years. Prior to December 2004, there had been such a bill every year since the creation of the intelligence committees in the late 1970s.  It is vitally important for the intelligence committees to pass an authorization bill this week. Failure to enact an authorization bill weakens congressional oversight and it denies the intelligence community appropriate updates in the law.  I would like to take a moment to recognize some individuals who have devoted enormous time and effort to reaching this point. First, Senator Kit Bond, the vice chairman of the committee, who has been fighting for this legislation with me in a completely bipartisan way since we began at the beginning of last year. Second, the members of the Intelligence Committee who have contributed important provisions in the bill, and have supported our efforts to keep the bill moving even in some cases where their provisions had to be dropped.  And finally, the staff, who have drafted this bill three separate times and conducted negotiations with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, other offices in the House, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the White House for more than a year. I would like to commend and thank my counsels: Mike Davidson, Christine Healey, and Alissa Starzak for their work. I thank as well Senator Bond's counsels, Jack Livingston and Kathleen Rice.  While there is no classified annex to authorize funding levels in this bill, I appreciate the work begun by Lorenzo Goco and continued by Peggy Evans in putting together the annex that accompanied the intelligence authorization bills that passed the Senate last September and this August.  Finally, I appreciate the work of Tommy Ross, national security adviser to Majority Leader Harry Reid, for his substantial efforts to make sure that the House and the executive branch remained engaged in the negotiations over this bill.  I urge my colleagues to support this Senate amendment to the House bill. If we are able to reach unanimous consent on this measure, it will go back to the House for final passage and presentment to the President. I am hopeful that we can accomplish this prior to recessing later this week for the November elections, and urge support.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from Mr. Robert Litt to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Office of the Director                                     of National Intelligence,                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2010.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Christopher Bond,     Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chairman and Vice Chairman Bond: On June 10,      2010, the Director of OMB wrote to inform you that, on the      assumption that there would be no material changes to the S.      3611, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year      2010, the President's senior advisors would recommend he sign      the bill. The Administration has reviewed the proposed      amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal      Year 2010, embodied in the draft amendment in the nature of a      substitute to H.R. 2701 provided to us on September 24, 2010.      There are two significant changes from S. 3611 passed by the      Senate on August 5, 2010 relating to the Government      Accountability Office (GAO) and congressional notification.      Earlier provisions on these issues were subject to a veto      threat. However, based on our interpretation of the changes,      which I have outlined below, the President's senior advisors      would recommend that he sign this bill if it is presented for      his signature.       The proposed Senate amendment includes a new provision that      would require the Director of National Intelligence to issue      a directive, in consultation with the Comptroller General,      governing access of the Comptroller General to information in      the possession of an Intelligence Community element. Nothing      in this provision changes the underlying law with respect to      GAO access to intelligence information. We interpret this      provision to provide the DNI with wide latitude when      developing the directive to ensure that it conforms with (1)      the statutory provisions governing GAO's jurisdiction and      access to information; (2) the intelligence oversight      structure embodied in the National Security Act; and (3)      relevant opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel of the      Department of Justice.       The second significant change relates to the provision that      alters the current congressional notification framework. It      is important to note at the outset that the Administration      has already indicated that, with respect to the requirement      to provide ``the legal authority under which [an]      intelligence activity is being or was conducted,'' we      construe that requirement only to require that the      Executive Branch provide the committee with an explanation      of the legal basis for the activity; it would not require      disclosure of any privileged information or disclosure of      information in any particular form.       The proposed amendment would significantly change the      earlier version of this provision by requiring that the      Executive Branch provide all congressional intelligence      committee members who do not receive a finding or      notification a ``general description regarding the finding or      notification, as applicable, consistent with the reasons for      not yet fully informing all members of such committee.'' The      Administration has previously threatened to veto the      Intelligence Authorization Bill over a congressional      notification provision that contained similar language. This      provision, however, differs from the earlier provision      because the requirement to provide a ``general description''      is limited to a description that is ``consistent with reasons      for not yet fully informing all members of such committee.''      We interpret this new language as providing sufficient      flexibility to craft a description that the President deems      appropriate, based on the extraordinary circumstances      affecting vital interests of the United States resulting in      the limited notification, and recognizing the President's      authority and responsibility to protect sensitive national      security information in the context of the notice and general      description requirement.       We wish to confirm that you understand and agree with these      interpretations. We would prefer to reduce this      interpretation to writing for inclusion in the amendment      itself, and will work with you to that end; otherwise, we      wish to ensure that you agree with our interpretation of      these provisions. With these understandings, the President's      senior advisors would recommend that he sign this bill if it      is presented for his signature.       The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the      standpoint of the Administration's Program, there is no      objection to the submission of this letter.           Sincerely,                                                   Robert S. Litt,     General Counsel.                          ____________________
