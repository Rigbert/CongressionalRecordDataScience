I recall the Senator from Illinois made the same point in the Judiciary Committee markup. It struck me that the Senator from Illinois was correct in saying this will be a good thing to put on the credit card.  So I asked a couple people who do programming in computers. I said: The Senator from Illinois has been told they can't extrapolate this; they can't put it on the bill. They said: Bull feathers. That's not the case at all. They said: This is the easiest thing to do. They have teenage interns in their company who would be glad, if you just gave them a couple access codes in the credit card companies, to show them how to program that.  If you can program what the minimum payment is--and the minimum payment might come out to something like $118.39, because it is a certain percentage of the overall, which might be $1,229.81--you are dealing in such strange numbers; every credit card bill is different, every minimum payment is different, but they said with the same program that set that up, you can basically put in a couple more lines of code and it can be figured out.  I mention this because I think that is the same experience the Senator from Illinois has had. I mention it because he is so absolutely right on this. This is not going to add any burden to the credit card companies. It is not going to be an additional cost to them because they already have the computers making the basic computations that are necessary.  Frankly, my question is this: Is it not the studied position of my friend from Illinois that if the credit card companies want to let you know how much you are on the hook with them for, they can easily do it?
