 President, today I wish to pay tribute to Sonya Damsker Lefkovits, who is being honored by the Columbiana Chamber of Commerce for her dedication and service to her community.  Sonya was born May 6, 1923, in Memphis, TN, to Louis and Helen Richberger Damsker. Raised in Tyler, TX, Sonya graduated from Tyler High School and went on to attend Louisiana State University, where she earned a degree in public school music. Following her graduation at LSU, Sonya moved to Birmingham to work at the Jewish Welfare Board as its first activities director. It was there that she met her future husband, Norman Leo Lefkovits.  In July, 1947, Sonya married Norman Leo Lefkovits, and she moved to Columbiana to operate the Lefkovits family mercantile store, The Columbiana Leader. Since arriving in Columbiana, AL, nearly 63 years ago, Sonya has been an integral member of her community. In 1949, she became a charter member of the Vignette Club, which gave her the opportunity to participate in various community projects. Among her proudest achievements was working on the building committee during the construction of the Columbia Library when she was chairman of the Columbiana Library Board.  Sonya has also held various community leadership positions. She was a member of the Shelby County High School Band Boosters Club, the womens coordinator for the Columbiana Civil Defense Organization, and cochairman of the Shelby County Civil War Centennial Commemoration. Sonya was an active member of the Shelby County Historical Society. In 1999, Sonya helped to form the Columbiana Merchants and Professional Association, where she worked on the Columbiana Downtown Renovation Committee. She also served as an ambassador to the South Shelby Chamber of Commerce.  Sonya has two children, Norman Leo Lefkovits, Jr. and Marsha Phyllis Lefkovits, both of whom now reside in California. In the early 1980s, Marshaserved with distinction as a member of my staff in Washington, DC. Soon, Sonya will be leaving Columbiana to join her children on the west coast.  I am sure that Sonya will be sorely missed in Columbiana, whose residents will reap the benefits of her contributions to their community for years to come. Regardless of where she resides, I know that she will continue to touch the lives of everyone fortunate enough to meet her.  I wish Sonya luck on her journey west, and I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life and career of my good friend Sonya Lefkovits.                          ____________________
