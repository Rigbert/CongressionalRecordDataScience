 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very simple. It transfers $11,764,000 from the naval petroleum reserve into the low-income weatherization assistance programs.  What we should understand is that last year the weatherization program was hit very hard. In fact, it was almost slashed in half. This bill today recommends an additional 10-percentcut on top of last year's decimating cut.  Let us stand with the millions of people in this country who go cold in the winter, people who stifle in certain climates in the summer, whose health is endangered. This is the United States of America and elderly people should not be forced to go cold in America.                              {time}  1215  Mr. Chairman, I should point out that this is a compromise amendment. The administration properly requested an increase in funding to $150 million. The committee recommends $100 million, and this amendment simply raises that to $112 million.  Mr. Chairman, let me say a word about the Naval Petroleum Reserve from which we take the money. The NPR's operating funds go to running three oil fields which are jointly operated by the Government and Chevron. The productivity of these fields has steadily declined since its peak in 1976. The President earmarked the NPR for sale in fiscal year 1997, indicating, and I quote: ``Producing oil and gas is a commercial, not a governmental activity, which is more properly performed by the private sector.''  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to my friend, the gentleman from Maine [Mr. Longley].
