 President, I rise in opposition to the McCain amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. I am troubled, quite frankly, that I have to defend Federal funding for historic preservation of the Vulcan Monument, which is of great importance to the people of Alabama and the South.  The Vulcan Monument in Birmingham, AL, is a unique and enduring hallmark of the city. It was constructed in 1904 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase and stands as a symbol of economic transformation in the South. Much like the Arch, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Statue of Liberty, and the Liberty Bell represent their respective cities and are symbols representing greater achievements for their communities and our Nation, the Vulcan stands as an important historical landmark for Birmingham and represents the rebirth of industrial development in the South.  I want the record to be clear that while Federal funds are important to the restoration of the Vulcan Monument, city and local fundraising efforts are leading the way towards completing the restoration project. While the Federal share for restoration efforts reaches $3.5 million, private citizens throughout the region have contributed over $10 million.  This is an excellent example of a public-private partnership trying to preserve an important historical treasure for the South and our Nation. It happens to be in Birmingham, AL.  I believe this amendment is misguided, and I pray it will be defeated.
