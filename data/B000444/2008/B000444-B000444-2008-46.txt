 President, currently we are spending $6.3 billion a year. This amendment is based in part on the Congressional Budget Office report that assumes PEPFAR, tuberculosis, and malaria spending for fiscal 2009 will only be $1.5 billion. That false assumption stems from the fact that the Congressional Budget Office is evaluating this authorization act as if it were starting from zero. That is how they get the $35 billion. It is not starting from zero. It is starting from $6.3 billion. Slashing funding will require slashing targets set in this bill, including prevention of 12 million HIV infections; care for 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children; treatment of millions of people with AIDS, according to a formula that climbs as appropriations rise over time; and a major expansion of efforts to combat tuberculosis and malaria together which claim 6.3 million lives a year.
