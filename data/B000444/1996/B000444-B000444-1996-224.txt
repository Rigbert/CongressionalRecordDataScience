 President, in a statement last week I condemned two terrorist bombings which took place in Jerusalem and Ashkelon 12 days ago. I did not think that it would be so soon that events would bring me once again to this floor to condemn another pair of cowardly attacks against innocent people, including young children.  Today, Israelis are justifiably shocked, disgusted, and angry. To bring home just what Israel is experiencing, let me provide a vivid comparison. On a proportional basis, the number of people killed by terrorists in Israel over the past 12 days would be equivalent to over 3,000 Americans killed. Imagine what our reaction would be if over 3,000 Americans were murdered in terrorist attacks in such a short period.  I dare say that our fundamental sense of stability and security as a nation would be shaken to its very core. That is what Israelis are feeling today.  As difficult as it is in this moment of grief and anger, we have to recognize the motive of those behind these dastardly attacks. Their single-minded aim is to end the peace process cold.  We cannot let them have the satisfaction of that kind of victory. We must resist the urge of our raw emotions in the wake of these outrageous attacks. We must not discard the remarkable achievements of the past 3 years, for that would play directly into the hands of the terrorists.  Last week, I urged that the peace process continue. I believe that even more firmly now.  The terrorists can be defeated through a two-pronged strategy. First, there must be intensified efforts to destroy the infrastructure and network that are ultimately behind terrorist actions. In that regard, I commend President Clinton for offering technical assistance to the Israelis and Palestinians in the war against terror. Second, we must prove to the terrorists that their actions are not producing the desired results. That means moving forward undaunted with the peace process.  Last week, I appealed to the Palestinian majority that supports peace to join the battle against terror with renewed vigor because it is their future that is most at stake. I renew that call today. If these attacks continue, then the Palestinian experience with self-government could become a fleeting memory.  Mr. President, in my remarks today I have used the term ``war''--the same term Prime Minister Shimon Peres has used to describe the state of affairs between Israel and Hamas. It is an appropriate term to use, and unlike many wars this one is a clear-cut conflict between good and evil.  A victory by the pro-peace majority of Israelis and Palestinians could lead the way to a thriving, vibrant, and cooperative Middle East. A victory by Hamas and its extremist allies on both sides will mean conflict, bloodshed, and division long into the future.  In this war, as in all of Israel's wars, the United States will stand by Israel and do whatever it takes to ensure victory.  Mr. President, Israel has endured much suffering in its short history, and it has shown remarkable fortitude in the face of terrorism and other attempts to destroy it. The Israeli people have always thwarted the designs of those who have tried every means to eliminate their country. I have no doubt that they will prevail in their present struggle against those who have declared war against Israel, the peace process, and, indeed civilization itself.                          ____________________
