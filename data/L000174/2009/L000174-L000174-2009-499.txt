He and I worked closely together on this so all of these issues we have been discussing came out of our subcommittee with strong bipartisan support.  Both of us were sensitive to a number of things: One, we did not want money going to Hamas; two, we wanted to help Egypt because Egypt has, with some peril to itself, been cooperating with us. Obviously, we are committed to the security of Israel. We put all that in here. So it becomes, in some ways, worse than redundancy.
