 President, on one final matter, over the Senate's history, we have welcomed into our ranks many brave men and women who have served in uniform. From the earliest days of our Republic, when veterans of the Revolution laid down their arms to serve as legislators, the Senate has been the home of patriots who know the true meaning of service and sacrifice. Some of our colleagues have even decided to pull double duty--continuing to serve in the Reserves while suffering the slings and arrows here in the Senate.  We have, today, a unique opportunity to honor one of these colleagues. Earlier this month, the news came that our friend, the junior Senator from Alaska, had attained the rank of colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Reserve. Dan Sullivan has spent the last quarter century as a marine, earning the Defense Meritorious Service Medal and serving on Active Duty in Afghanistan. Those of us who serve here with Senator Sullivan are hardly surprised that someone so ``squared away'' has risen to this milestone.  His promotion is recognized in a special ceremony today here in the Capitol, where, I understand, Senator Sullivan's father will pin on his new rank.  I know this body will join me in congratulating him and in thanking both Senator Sullivan and Colonel Sullivan for all of his service to the Nation.                          ____________________
