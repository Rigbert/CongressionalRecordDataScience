Speaker, the day after Christmas 2002, The Honorable Walter J. Krasniewski passed from this life at the age of 73 years. He was surrounded by his family.  Judge Krasniewski served the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Ohio for 32 years, retiring in 1997. The author of more than 500 legal opinions, during his tenure many of his opinions established case law for the Sixth Circuit. At his retirement before a packed courtroom of judges, attorneys, family and friends there to pay him tribute, Judge Krasniewski was recognized as one of the ten longest-serving judges in U.S. history. A dedicated promoter of the noble profession of the law, Judge Krasniewski was mentor to many people he encouraged in the pursuit of a law career.  Walter Krasniewski graduated from Xavier University, then obtained his law degree from the University of Toledo. After a time in private practice, he was employed by the State of Ohio as an assistant attorney. In 1963, he was appointed by Attorney General Robert Kennedy as an assistant U.S. attorney. He began his long career as a bankruptcy court judge in 1965.  Devoted to his family, Judge Krasniewski also paid careful attention to his community. He was involved in many civic activities and fraternal organizations. His thoughtful countenance was as well known to his associates as it was to those who appeared in his courtroom. Always a gentleman, he was also a true statesman.  Walter Krasniewski was a man committed to family, his faith, his profession, and his country. Truly we will miss this man of vision and integrity. Our heartfelt sympathy to his wife of 45 years, Mary Lou, his children Linda, Leslie, Laurie, and Lawrence, his brothers John and William, his grandchildren and great grandchildren.                          ____________________
