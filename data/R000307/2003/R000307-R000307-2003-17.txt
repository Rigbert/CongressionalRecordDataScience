President, as chairman and vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Rockefeller and I have submitted to the Senate the Report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence of its activities during the 107th Congress from January 3, 2001 to November 22, 2002. The Committee is charged by the Senate with the responsibility of carrying out oversight of the intelligence activities of the United States. Much of the work of the Committee is of necessity conducted in secrecy, yet the Committee believes that the Intelligence Community and this Committee should be as accountable as possible to the public. The public report to the Senate is intended to achieve that goal.                          ____________________
