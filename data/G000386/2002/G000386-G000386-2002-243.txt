 President, I appreciate the efforts by Chairman Baucus for correcting an oversight by Congress when it failed to shift from the general fund to the highway trust fund, 2.5 cents per gallon collected from sales of gasohol. Similar adjustments for other fuels were made by a previous Congress, but not for gasohol.  I also want to thank the chairman for refraining from offering an amendment at this time that would require the general fund to contribute 5.3 cents to the highway trust fund for every gallon of gasohol sold.  It is wise to wait until next Congress when we can look at the big picture. Next year, we need to analyze all revenue sources for the highway trust fund to determine if adjustments are appropriate.  We also need to determine if adjustments are appropriate in the way we spend the Highway Trust Funds that are collected. For instance, we may determine that it makes better sense for mass transit subsidies to come from general funds instead of from the highway trust fund.  We may find that the subsidies for special motor fuels such as propane, methanol, and liquified natural gas should be paid from the general fund instead of the highway trust fund. These three fuels are not paying the full 18.3 cents per gallon. Propane receives a 4.7 cent subsidy, liquified natural gas receives a 6.4 cent subsidy, and methanol receives a 9.15 cent subsidy. Much needs to be addressed as we reauthorize the highway bill, and approaching this very important matter in a piecemeal fashion would be a mistake.                           Aviation Emissions
