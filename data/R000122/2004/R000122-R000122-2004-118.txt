President, I rise today to introduce the Campus Care and Counseling Act along with my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith and my colleague from New York, Senator Clinton. The recent rash of suicides on college campuses has highlighted a mental health crisis. Just this past week, Diana Chien, a 19 year old student at New York University ended her life by jumping off a building. Our own colleagues, the Senator from Oregon, suffered a tragic loss when his son, Garret, took his life last September. Suicides take the lives of over 4,000 children and young adults annually. It is now the third leading cause of death among 10-24 year olds. The rate of suicide has tripled from 1952 to 1995. How many more of our children will be lost before we take action to prevent their untimely demise? When will we start to say to them that there is an answer; that suicide is not the way out; that we can help them feel better; that they can live happier and healthier lives?  College is a time of great intellectual development--and it is also a time of exponential personal and interpersonal growth and change. When children go off to college, we need to be sure that they are going to a place that will help them reach their boundless potential. We also need to make sure that it will also support them through the transition to adulthood and during their greatest hour of need. Additionally, many more adults are going to college, and they too face challenges, particularly in balancing school, work, and family responsibilities. We can and should do more to address the significant lack in this area.  A Chronicle of Higher Education survey found that rates for depression in college freshmen have nearly doubled from 8.2 percent to 16.3 percent. Without treatment, the Chronicle reports that ``depressed adolescents are at risk for school failure, social isolation, promiscuity, self-medication with drugs and alcohol, and suicide.'' A 2003 Gallagher's Survey of Counseling Center Directors found that 85 percent of college counseling centers are reporting an increase in the number of students in need of services, 81 percent were concerned about increasing numbers of students with severe psychological problems, 67 percent reported a need for more psychiatric services, and 6.3 percent reported problems with growing demand for services without an appropriate increase in resources. Clearly, many students with serious needs do not have access to psychiatric or other mental and behavioral health services.  This is an issue that my office has been working on with the American Psychological Association since 2002. In light of the forthcoming debate on the Higher Education Act Reauthorization and the recent spate of college campus suicides, I am introducing the ``Campus Care and Counseling Act.'' This bill amends the Higher Education Act to authorize $10 million in peer-reviewed competitive grants to institutions of higher education to increase access and enhance mental and behavioral health services for our college students. Grants may be used for the prevention, screening, early intervention, assessment, treatment, management, and education activities related to mental and behavioral health problems. Taking into consideration that education creates awareness, these funds may also be used to educate parents, to hire staff, and to expand training. To address the stigma of mental illness, programs funded through this grant will need to focus their efforts on developing outreach strategies to reach those students most in need of services.  My colleagues in the Senate, this is an important bipartisan measure which will help to ensure that our nation's college students will have access to quality mental and behavioral health care so that they receive the help needed to not only survive through their difficult times in college, but also to excel and accomplish all that is within their reach. I want to also thank the American Psychiatric Association and other organizations for their assistance in shaping this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join myself and Senators DeWine and Smith in enacting this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2215       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Campus Care and Counseling      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) In a recent report, a startling 85 percent of college      counseling centers revealed an increase in the number of      students they see with psychological problems. Furthermore,      the American College Health Association found that 61 percent      of college students reported feeling hopeless, 45 percent      said they felt so depressed they could barely function, and 9      percent felt suicidal.       (2) There is clear evidence of an increased incidence of      depression among college students. According to a survey      described in the Chronicle of Higher Education (February 1,      2002), depression among freshmen has nearly doubled (from 8.2      percent to 16.3 percent). Without treatment, researchers      recently noted that ``depressed adolescents are at risk for      school failure, social isolation, promiscuity, self      medication with drugs and alcohol, and suicide--now the third      leading cause of death among 10-24 year olds.''.       (3) Researchers who conducted the study ``Changes in      Counseling Center Client Problems Across 13 Years'' (1989-     2001) at Kansas State University stated that ``students are      experiencing more stress, more anxiety, more depression than      they were a decade ago.'' (The Chronicle of Higher Education,      February 14, 2003).       (4) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug      Abuse, 20 percent of full-time undergraduate college students      use illicit drugs.       (5) The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also      reported that 18.4 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 are      dependent on or abusing illicit drugs or alcohol. In      addition, the study found that ``serious mental illness is      highly correlated with substance dependence or abuse. Among      adults with serious mental illness in 2001, 20.3 percent were      dependent on or abused alcohol or illicit drugs, while the      rate among adults without serious mental illness was only 6.3      percent.''.       (6) A 2003 Gallagher's Survey of Counseling Center      Directors found that 81 percent were concerned about the      increasing number of students with more serious psychological      problems, 67 percent reported a need for more psychiatric      services, and 63 percent reported problems with growing      demand for services without an appropriate increase in      resources.       (7) The International Association of Counseling Services      accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per 1,000 to      1,500 students. According to the 2003 Gallagher's Survey of      Counseling Center Directors, the ratio of counselors to      students is as high as 1 counselor per 2,400 students at      institutions of higher education with more than 15,000      students.     SEC. 3. MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ON CAMPUS.
