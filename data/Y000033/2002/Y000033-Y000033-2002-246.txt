Mr. Speaker, next week the entire construction and construction materials industries are holding a convention, the CONEXPO-CON/AGG, in Las Vegas, NV. More than 125,000 people are expected to attend and over 2,300 exhibitors covering will show their construction material and equipment in 1.9 billion net square feet of indoor and outdoor exhibit space. This convention is one of the best as it draws contractors and construction materials producers from around the world.  Several organizations associated with these events, are conducting their annual conventions in Las Vegas: The Association of Equipment Manufacturers; the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association, the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, the America Road and Transportation Builders Association; the Associated General Contractors of America; the Construction Materials Recycling Association; the Concrete Sawing and Drilling Association; the International Road Federation; the National Fluid Power Association; the National Utility Contractors Association and the Society of Automotive Engineers. I congratulate them for the work they do to keep America moving.  Some important facts about these industries should be noted. The construction industry represents 8 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product and accounts for 5 percent of total U.S. employment. The construction industry puts more than $850 billion of products in place annually and employs more than 8.6 million people. Even in a recession, the construction and construction materials industries added 63,000 jobs. These numbers are staggering and impressive and result from the very successful TEA 21 Act that funds the federal highway road program.  These are America's builders. Through their hard work, the wilderness that was America was transformed into a stronghold of productivity and commerce.  These groups build our roads and highways, airports, and rail beds--the networks that connect our cities, our communities, and our families. They build our homes, our workplaces, our churches, our schools, and our hospitals.  They build and maintain our utilities, including water and sewer facilities, natural gas pipelines and telecommunications systems. They build these underground lifelines that keep America secure and thriving.  Not only do they build--they rebuild. In the true spirit of America they responded after September 11 by sending manpower, materials, equipment, and money to the New York City World Trade Center and the Pentagon to help heal the wounds inflicted on America by the terrorist attacks. Members of these associations continue their efforts to erase these scars that mar our landscape.  The construction and construction materials industries have built Americans' a quality of life and ensured a prosperous future for our country and its people.  We all take pride in the work these ``Builders of America'' do every day. On the eve of CONEXPO-CON/AGG 2002, we extend our sincerest thanks and best wishes to the construction and construction materials industries for a successful trade shows that is ``An Experience to Build On.''                          ____________________
