 President, I rise today to speak about the importance of the Hoover Power Allocation Act of 2011, of which I am a cosponsor.  This legislation passed the Congress after a multiyear effort led by Senator Harry Reid, the bill's lead author, and I thank him for his work.  Upon enactment, Californians will be able to continue buying Hoover Dam's power at the cost of production for the next 50 years.  The legislation allows the people of southern California whose local governments and utilities signed the 50-year contracts that made building Hoover Dam possible to receive 56 percent of the energy produced by the dam for another five decades.  For the people of my State, the Hoover Dam has been a consistent supply of affordable, pollution-free power for decades. The Hoover Dam is one of the largest power plants in the United States, with a capacity of 2,080 megawatts approximately the size of each of California's nuclear powerplants.  Its average production between 1999 and 2008 was about 4.2 billion kilowatt-hours per year, approximately 2.4 billion kilowatt hours of which goes to southern Californians who buy their power from Southern California Edison, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, or members of the Southern California Public Power Agency.  Hoover's power also plays an essential role moving water into parched and populous southern California.  The Metropolitan Water District uses Hoover's power to move its 550,000 acrefeet annual allocation of water from the Colorado River, over five desert mountain ranges, to Los Angeles.  Without Hoover's power, the Metropolitan Water District's cost of moving that water would be inordinately more expensive.  And if California rate payers had to buy that much power at market rates instead of Hoover Dam's 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour cost of production, it would cost approximately $180 million more each year.  And that power would likely come from dirtier, more distant sources, including coal plants.  Instead, continued access to Hoover's low-cost, renewable hydropower will keep rates low as California's utilities bring on new, more expensive renewable power to comply with the State's 33-percent renewable portfolio standard.  The legislation also sets up a process through which new power recipients in California will be determined by the Western Area Power Administration.  As explained in the House committee report accompanying this bill, Congress expects the agency to conduct an open hearing and review the process to determine power allocations fairly and equitably.  The process should provide the opportunity for irrigation districts, rural electric cooperatives, and other eligible entities to receive allocations.  Congress also expects that Western Area Power Administration will evaluate the relevant power requests of potential new Hoover power recipients in an open, thorough, and transparent process to assess both the applicants' power needs and the classes of customers they serve.  The agency should make allocation determinations in an impartial, unbiased, and objective manner, consistent with State and Federal preference standards, and in a way that provides the most benefit to the most Californians.  My colleagues and I also expect that the process and analytical results will be documented and made available for review.  Finally, no discussion of Hoover Dam would be complete without acknowledging efforts to protect endangered species.  Hoover contractors have committed to providing more than $150 million over 50 years to support the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program for the protection of 26 endangered, threatened and sensitive species.  The legislation authorizing the MSCP was enacted in the 111th Congress and signed into law on March 30, 2009.  I thank the parties for reaching this agreement.  The Hoover Dam is an American success story. And it is a renewable energy success story.  During the depths of the Great Depression, Americans stepped forward to help build one of the great engineering marvels of all time.  Between 1931 and 1936, our Nation made a massive effort involving thousands of workers more than 100 of whom lost their lives to build a powerplant unlike anything the world had ever seen.  Many in Congress at the time argued the cost of Hoover Dam was too high.  They argued that government should not be making such large investments in infrastructure.  They opposed efforts to invest in an unproven energy technology like hydropower.  The debate was strikingly similar to debates we are having in this body today.  Luckily for the people of California, believers in American infrastructure and technology won the Hoover Dam debate.  The U.S. Congress provided Federal funds, but only after the Department of the Interior arranged power contracts at prices sufficient to both, No. 1, cover the operating and maintenance charges and, No. 2 repay the capital appropriated by the U.S. Congress within 50 years.  When the communities and utilities of California, led by the City of Los Angeles, stepped forward to sign those contracts, construction began.  As the years have passed, the investment has been repaid and the wisdom of Congress's decision has become apparent.  And now we have enacted a law that continues the legacy of Hoover Dam.  I thank the generations before us for having the foresight to fund the HooverDam, and I hope we can again rekindle the spirit and invest in America.                          ____________________
