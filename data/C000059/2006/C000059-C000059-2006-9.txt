Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Once again, I want to congratulate the crew, the NASA team, the contractors for the successful completion of STS-121. We look forward to future success as we continue our journey exploring the unknown and to do things that require skill, technical expertise, courage, and the will to succeed.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
