''  I ask unanimous consent their letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  National Patient                                          Advocate Foundation,                               Newport News, VA, February 6, 1998.       Dear Senator: The National Patient Advocate Foundation      urges you to vote ``no'' on the cloture vote next Tuesday,      February 10, regarding the motion to proceed to consider S.      1601, the legislation to ban human cloning. A vote ``no'' is      a vote to protect biomedical research. It would also call for      more deliberate debate on this complicated scientific issue.       As an organization that continues to seek insurance      reimbursement for cancer therapies, therapeutic devices and      agents that hold promise of improved quality of life after a      cancer diagnosis, life extension and improvement in      preventing cancer, bio-medical research presents significant      hope for improvement in preventing, detecting and treating      cancer. We have been involved with this issue since early      last summer when the anti-cloning discussion first emerged      when the Ehler's bills was introduced. Our position then and      now is the same. Though we are in full support of no cloning      of human beings, we value the progress being made in bio-     medical research and can not support any initiative that      threatens continued research in this area. Zygotes, diploid      cells and somatic cell nuclear transfer are issues that are      complicated and present myriad opportunities for      misinterpretation without thorough discussions relative to      the impact on bio-medical research that this anti-cloning      legislation poses. We urge your no vote on cloture February      tenth, so that this matter may be addressed in detail in      hearings.       There is no need to rush to legislate. The Food and Drug      Administration has full jurisdiction to ensure that no one      will clone human beings at this time. We urge careful and      deliberate consideration of this legislation to ban cloning.      It should be carefully reviewed by key Committees, which has      not occurred. S. 1601 raises serious questions about its      scope and impact on critical biomedical research seeking      cures for deadly and disabling diseases.       This bill is not confined to``cloning'', which is the      creation of a child genetically identical to another      individual.       It would halt research to develop ``customized'' stem cells      which promise potential new treatments for many diseases and      conditions.       It would outlaw a current medical procedure to treat      infertility which uses eggs which are fertilized and contain      the genetic traits of two individuals, not the clone of one      individual.       Again, we urge you to vote ``no'' on Tuesday's cloture vote      on S. 1601 to protect biomedical research.           Sincerely,                                            Nancy Davenport-Ennis,                                      Founding Executive Director.
