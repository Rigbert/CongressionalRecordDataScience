 While not specifically spelled out in the statutory language of H.R. 1977, it was my intent that this 1-year time-out extended to the entire program as it related to the establishment of minimum standards and codes. I had hoped that this clarification would be made in the conference report, but since there is no report language addressing this issue, I feel it necessary to clarify it here for the record. Indeed, product manufacturers have raised concerns over the methodology and assumptions in Department of Energy's current cost benefit analysis. Similarly, builders have raised concerns over the minimum mandatory standards found in codes enacted by local municipalities or States that use the voluntary products of code and standard organizations over which Department of Energy has significant influence. Builders have told me that these standards are often not responsive to technological innovation, customer needs, or economic consideration of affordability or payback. Therefore, just as there needs to be a time out to review standards-setting activities conducted by the Department of Energy, the same review should apply to its activities relating to residential building codes.
