Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill, and I want to thank my good friend Mr. Ramstad for all of his hard work and for his great work in helping to bring this needed bill before us today.  Given the terrible state of the economy, we need to do all we can to support our charities. We need to promote scholarships, to promote charitable giving and to enhance public disclosure.  I fully support H.R. 7083. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support our charities and to vote ``yes'' for the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
