How? Through sequestration. That's what you voted for.  After the agreement was reached on the Budget Control Act that put the sequester in place, Speaker Boehner said, ``I got 98 percent of what I wanted.'' Now our Republican colleagues are attempting to undo the sequester in a way that let's them off the hook politically but puts America at risk financially.  Democrats have an alternative--Mr. Van Hollen just spoke of it--that would repeal the sequester for a year by asking that the wealthiest in our country, why, because they can help a little more, not because they're bad. God bless them. And by the way, we're most of those as well, folks.  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle, who I know are as deeply concerned about our deficits and debt as I am, will join Democrats in defeating this bill and sending a message that only by working together can we find the solutions we need. America expects that of us.
