 President, I rise to introduce the ``Rebuild ental holdings1Total= 000>America Act of 2003,'' a bill to improve our national transportation ental holdings1Total= 000>and water infrastructure and to stimulate economic growth.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This bill promises to do what the latest tax cut will not: provide an ental holdings1Total= 000>immediate economic stimulus without increasing the Federal budget ental holdings1Total= 000>deficit. Whereas the President's economic advisors have said that the ental holdings1Total= 000>latest tax cut will create 1.4 million jobs by the end of 2004, at a ental holdings1Total= 000>cost of $350 billion, this bill will create as many as 2 million jobs ental holdings1Total= 000>at a tenth the cost.ental holdings1Total= 000>  These jobs could be created in as little as three months, as the bill ental holdings1Total= 000>is specifically designed to fund transportation and water ental holdings1Total= 000>infrastructure projects which are ready to go within 90 days.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Not only would those jobs bring some of the 9 million Americans who ental holdings1Total= 000>are unemployed and seeking jobs back into the workforce, it would ental holdings1Total= 000>generate long-term economic benefits from the increased productivity of ental holdings1Total= 000>our transportation infrastructure.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This bill will do more to stimulate the economy at less cost than the ental holdings1Total= 000>tax cut because it is directed squarely at our most urgent needs. ental holdings1Total= 000>Unlike the recent tax cut, which largely benefits high income taxpayers ental holdings1Total= 000>who are likely to save any windfall they receive, infrastructure ental holdings1Total= 000>spending is necessarily injected into the economy.ental holdings1Total= 000>  According to the Department of Transportation, each $1 billion in new ental holdings1Total= 000>infrastructure investment creates 47,500 new jobs: 26,500 direct jobs ental holdings1Total= 000>for construction workers, engineers, contractors, and other on-site ental holdings1Total= 000>employees, and 21,000 indirect jobs resulting from the spending ental holdings1Total= 000>associated with the investment.ental holdings1Total= 000>  These are jobs our economy desperately needs, particularly in the ental holdings1Total= 000>transportation and nonresidential construction sectors, which have been ental holdings1Total= 000>hit hard by the recent downturn. While new home construction has ental holdings1Total= 000>sustained the homebuilding trades, there are now 715,000 unemployed ental holdings1Total= 000>private construction workers, most of whom were laid off due to a ental holdings1Total= 000>downturn in nonresidential building. That represents an 80 percent ental holdings1Total= 000>increase from three years ago.ental holdings1Total= 000>  As anyone who has taken a hard look at our transportation needs can ental holdings1Total= 000>attest, federal funding for highways, transit, aviation, high-speed ental holdings1Total= 000>rail, and ports, among other areas, remains inadequate.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Without those funds, we are on the verge of falling behind the rest ental holdings1Total= 000>of the developed world in the quality of our infrastructure. I recently ental holdings1Total= 000>visited the port of Hong Kong and was amazed by the automated ental holdings1Total= 000>technology used to process thousands of containers each day with fewer ental holdings1Total= 000>employees than would be required to move an equivalent amount of cargo ental holdings1Total= 000>at even our most advanced ports.ental holdings1Total= 000>  And while many countries around the world, including France, China, ental holdings1Total= 000>Germany, and Japan, now have operating MAGLEV train systems, the United ental holdings1Total= 000>States does not have a single demonstration MAGLEV line operating ental holdings1Total= 000>anywhere in the country.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Increasingly, global industry demands a level of efficiency and ental holdings1Total= 000>reliability which requires substantial upgrades to existing ental holdings1Total= 000>infrastructure. In California, where computer and electronic products ental holdings1Total= 000>account for 51 percent of the State's manufacturing exports, the trend ental holdings1Total= 000>is toward lighter, higher value shipments. Nationwide, shipments of ental holdings1Total= 000>below 1,000 lbs accounted for 18 percent of total value in 1977, and 32 ental holdings1Total= 000>percent of value in 1997, a dramatic increase.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Those changes put a premium on speed and reliability, without which ental holdings1Total= 000>``just-in-time'' manufacturing and lean inventory controls are ental holdings1Total= 000>impossible. A company such as Hewlett Packard, which uses Intel ental holdings1Total= 000>processors made in California in servers which it assembles in Texas, ental holdings1Total= 000>must be able to ship processors without risk of even a 24-hour delay.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This bill takes a big step toward ensuring that level of speed and ental holdings1Total= 000>reliability by dedicating $50 billion to infrastructure upgrades. And I ental holdings1Total= 000>must stress the huge incremental value of that spending in the context ental holdings1Total= 000>of reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st ental holdings1Total= 000>Century, TEA-21, which is expected this year.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Reauthorization of TEA-21 will dedicate more than $250 billion toward ental holdings1Total= 000>transportation projects over the next six years, but even that level of ental holdings1Total= 000>funding will only allow us to tread water. Maintenance of existing ental holdings1Total= 000>infrastructure will consume much of that spending.ental holdings1Total= 000>  To take one example, the Department of Transportation estimates that ental holdings1Total= 000>$20.6 billion is needed annually to maintain and improve performance of ental holdings1Total= 000>public transit systems alone.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The $50 billion provided by the ``Rebuild America Act'' will go ental holdings1Total= 000>beyond current maintenance and actually improve overall productivity by ental holdings1Total= 000>allowing substantial upgrades to go forward. Specifically, the bill ental holdings1Total= 000>provides:ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>       $5 billion in additional authority for Federal-aid highway ental holdings1Total= 000>     capital investments, drawn from the $19 billion surplus in ental holdings1Total= 000>     the Highway Trust Fund.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $3 billion in transit capital and operating grants, drawn ental holdings1Total= 000>     from the surplus in the Highway Trust Fund.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $3 billion in airport development projects, including $2 ental holdings1Total= 000>     billion in airport improvement program grants to enhance ental holdings1Total= 000>     airport safety, efficiency, and capacity.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $14 billion of tax-credit high-speed rail bonds for ental holdings1Total= 000>     infrastructure construction and the acquisition of rolling ental holdings1Total= 000>     stock.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $7.5 billion for capital investment in passenger and ental holdings1Total= 000>     freight rail, including $2.5 billion for Amtrak.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $2.5 billion for port security grants to ports and marine ental holdings1Total= 000>     facility operators.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $11.5 billion for wastewater and drinking water ental holdings1Total= 000>     infrastructure, to be administeredental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>[[Page S9422]]ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>     through the existing Clean Water State Revolving Fund and ental holdings1Total= 000>     Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $1.5 billion to fund investment in currently authorized ental holdings1Total= 000>     water resources infrastructure projects.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $1.5 billion in grants to economically distressed ental holdings1Total= 000>     communities for economic development.ental holdings1Total= 000>       $500 million for the repair and alteration of Federal ental holdings1Total= 000>     buildings.ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>  In my home State of California, the infrastructure needs that could ental holdings1Total= 000>be addressed by this bill are particularly great. Although the just-ental holdings1Total= 000>completed BART link to San Francisco International Airport is a major ental holdings1Total= 000>achievement, we still remain a long way off from the long-term goal of ental holdings1Total= 000>ringing the Bay Area with BART stations.ental holdings1Total= 000>  And despite the recent economic downturn, California's economy ental holdings1Total= 000>remains the engine of much of the country's economic growth, and ental holdings1Total= 000>California's population continues to grow. That puts tremendous demands ental holdings1Total= 000>on our roads, airports, and transit systems, and is one reason why Los ental holdings1Total= 000>Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area are consistently ranked as the ental holdings1Total= 000>top two urban areas in the U.S. with the longest annual delays per ental holdings1Total= 000>rush-hour driver.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This bill will provide a total of $1.8 billion in new funds for ental holdings1Total= 000>California transportation and safe drinking water infrastructure, and ental holdings1Total= 000>more than $1.5 billion more for high speed and passenger and freight ental holdings1Total= 000>rail. All told, the bill will create well over 100,000 new jobs in ental holdings1Total= 000>California.ental holdings1Total= 000>  That could bring us farther toward fulfilling one of California's ental holdings1Total= 000>most urgent needs, a high speed rail link from the Bay Area all the way ental holdings1Total= 000>south to San Diego. Without high speed rail there is little hope of ental holdings1Total= 000>taking some of the pressure off of California's over-burdened highways ental holdings1Total= 000>and airports.ental holdings1Total= 000>  In addition to the transportation improvements contemplated by the ental holdings1Total= 000>bill, I would like to say a few words about the need for additional ental holdings1Total= 000>funds for port security and clean drinking water.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Since the attacks of September 11 it has become clear that our ports ental holdings1Total= 000>should be one of the first lines of defense against attempts to bring ental holdings1Total= 000>weapons of mass destruction into this country. And yet the funds we ental holdings1Total= 000>have dedicated to securing our ports have been woefully inadequate.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Last year I introduced comprehensive legislation to improve security ental holdings1Total= 000>at our ports, and to inspect more of the 16 million containers which ental holdings1Total= 000>come through those ports each year. Currently, only one to two percent ental holdings1Total= 000>of those containers are inspected, and the possibility of a dirty bomb ental holdings1Total= 000>or nuclear device being shipped in via container remains alarmingly ental holdings1Total= 000>real.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This bill provides an additional $2.5 billion for port security, ental holdings1Total= 000>which would go some of the way toward meeting the $6 billion in ental holdings1Total= 000>expenses the Coast Guard anticipates over the next 10 years for ports ental holdings1Total= 000>to comply with security standards imposed under the Maritime ental holdings1Total= 000>Transportation Security Act.ental holdings1Total= 000>  With respect to clean drinking water, a very different, but equally ental holdings1Total= 000>important, priority, this bill provides $11.5 billion for wastewater ental holdings1Total= 000>and drinking water infrastructure investment. That funding is important ental holdings1Total= 000>because the Administration continues to insist on funding cuts for the ental holdings1Total= 000>Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Even level funding will not allow us to upgrade existing water ental holdings1Total= 000>treatment facilities, many of which were built in the 1970s, when the ental holdings1Total= 000>federal government first began to take a major role in the construction ental holdings1Total= 000>of drinking water infrastructure. Many of those facilities will require ental holdings1Total= 000>substantial improvements and overhauls over the next two decades as ental holdings1Total= 000>pipes and equipment fall into disrepair.ental holdings1Total= 000>  In the West, the magnitude of water supply contamination by ental holdings1Total= 000>perchlorate, a chemical used in rocket fuel, has only recently become ental holdings1Total= 000>apparent. The costs of cleaning up perchlorate in California alone will ental holdings1Total= 000>likely stretch into the billions of dollars, and some of those funds ental holdings1Total= 000>must come from the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which ental holdings1Total= 000>would receive $1.5 billion under this bill.ental holdings1Total= 000>  With the Federal budget deficit certain to top $400 billion this ental holdings1Total= 000>year, and with the gross federal debt projected to increase by over $5 ental holdings1Total= 000>trillion by 2013, there is a real question as to where these funds will ental holdings1Total= 000>come from.ental holdings1Total= 000>  I am glad to say, therefore, that this bill is fully offset and would ental holdings1Total= 000>not add at all to our deficit. The bill uses three offsets to recoup ental holdings1Total= 000>the $34 billion cost of the bill, two of which are designed to limit ental holdings1Total= 000>corporate fraud, and the last of which extends customs user fees.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The bulk of the funds used to offset the bill are generated by ental holdings1Total= 000>limiting the ability of large corporations to shelter income from ental holdings1Total= 000>taxation. A recent report by the Joint Economic Committee on corporate ental holdings1Total= 000>fraud at the Enron Corporation speaks to the magnitude of this problem.ental holdings1Total= 000>  For several years Enron reported huge profits to its shareholders, ental holdings1Total= 000>while reporting little or no taxable income to the IRS. We now know ental holdings1Total= 000>that Enron executives treated their tax division as a for-profit entity ental holdings1Total= 000>within the company and set annual revenue targets for the division.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Between 1996 and 1999, Enron reported aggregate profits of $2.1 ental holdings1Total= 000>billion on its income statement, while claiming aggregate losses, for ental holdings1Total= 000>tax purposes, of $3 billion. Some of that gap can be explained by the ental holdings1Total= 000>massive tax deductions Enron took for employee stock deductions, and ental holdings1Total= 000>the rest stemmed from the closely guarded tax-shelter transactions ental holdings1Total= 000>designed for the company by banks, accountants, and legal firms.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This bill closes those Enron-specific loopholes, but also strengthens ental holdings1Total= 000>a very simple provision which will have a big impact on shutting down ental holdings1Total= 000>future loopholes.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The so-called ``Economic Substance Doctrine'' imposed by the bill ental holdings1Total= 000>states that any transaction which has no material economic impact on ental holdings1Total= 000>the business of the company, but which is purely designed for the ental holdings1Total= 000>purpose of tax avoidance, shall be disallowed for tax purposes.ental holdings1Total= 000>  That will allow enhance the ability of tax courts to crack down on ental holdings1Total= 000>companies that engage in off balance sheet transactions, artificial ental holdings1Total= 000>income shifting, uneconomic financing transactions, and other tax ental holdings1Total= 000>avoidance schemes which are not designed to provide any profit to the ental holdings1Total= 000>company beyond a tax savings.ental holdings1Total= 000>  In the same vein, the bill puts an end to the practice of setting up ental holdings1Total= 000>corporate headquarters offshore in order to avoid corporate taxes at ental holdings1Total= 000>home. This practice is not only blatantly unpatriotic, but also creates ental holdings1Total= 000>an imbalanced playing field for companies that abide by the spirit of ental holdings1Total= 000>the law but are forced to compete with firms that don't.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This bill will require such corporate expatriates to continue to pay ental holdings1Total= 000>U.S. taxes even if they move abroad. All told, these provisions fully ental holdings1Total= 000>offset the cost of the infrastructure improvements included in the ental holdings1Total= 000>bill.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Just about any American you talk to will tell you that our economy is ental holdings1Total= 000>not in good shape. A quick look at the front page of newspapers shows ental holdings1Total= 000>that our stock markets remain well below their 2000 high, that more ental holdings1Total= 000>people face long-term unemployment than at any time in the past two ental holdings1Total= 000>decades, and that businesses are not making new investments.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The tax cut which was recently signed into law is the wrong medicine ental holdings1Total= 000>for our economy, and will do little to reverse our current course. In ental holdings1Total= 000>fact, it may well increase uncertainty and act as a long-term drag on ental holdings1Total= 000>the economy by increasing the federal debt and putting pressure on ental holdings1Total= 000>long-term interest rates.ental holdings1Total= 000>  I urge my colleagues to support this bill as a much better means of ental holdings1Total= 000>stimulating economic growth, and one which will pay long-term dividends ental holdings1Total= 000>in terms of improved roads, railways, and water treatment facilities.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Rather than simply hand down a burden of debt to our children and ental holdings1Total= 000>grand-children, this bill would create a lasting legacy of modern ental holdings1Total= 000>infrastructure for their benefit.ental holdings1Total= 000>                                 ______ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>      By
