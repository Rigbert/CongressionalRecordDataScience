  Madam President, for several years we have been debating what to do about the millions of people without health insurance coverage and about prescription drug coverage for seniors under Medicare. We may decide that steel retirees fit into our deliberations on the uninsured. We could otherwise decide as well. But we at least ought to be debating the issues of this legislation and their implication on the uninsured in regard to those bigger issues and not on this legislation.  Bear in mind that there is another irony with the steel legacy cost proposal. Some very large steel companies, LTV and Bethlehem as examples, went bankrupt in part because the 1992 energy tax bill mandated them to pay retiree health care obligations for former coal employees under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act. Over the past 10 years, these now-bankrupt steel companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars paying for the irresponsible health care promises of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association and the United Mine Workers. Think about that.  The shifting of health retiree costs is a vicious circle. This amendment expands the trade adjustment health insurance assistance to steelworkers whose companies permanently closed operations while in bankruptcy. Think about who ends up then paying for it. It is the rest of America. It is the taxpayers, from the single-mother waitress with children who does not have health care for those children and herself; it is the white-collar worker in Silicon Valley who does not have health care; it is the Midwestern farmer who pays for his family's health care out of his own pocket as a self-employed person; it is the other retirees who pay tax on their Social Security benefits.  This amendment then creates a double standard. There is one standard, guaranteed health care for one class of folks, retired steelworkers for a few companies. Then there is another standard for everyone else. Is that fair? Does that make sense?  This bizarre proposal is compounded further by the double standard it creates for steel industry retirees. That is right. What we have is a rifleshot for a couple of companies. I have been one who has fought rifleshots in the Tax Code. Well, my fellow Senators have a rifleshot in front of them, and I hope we can stop it.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The time of the Senator has expired.                             cloture motion
