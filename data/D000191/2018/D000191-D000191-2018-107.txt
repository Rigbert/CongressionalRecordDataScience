Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I certainly support the amendment offered by the gentleman. He listed a number of provisions. I don't want to be repetitive, but I think the call to action regarding uncontained airliner engine failures is critical. That is actually the second uncontained failure of that engine with Southwest Airlines in 18 months, which means that somewhere turbine blades are not a life-limited part. There is something amiss in the manufacturing process, and we need to get to the bottom of that.  We also need to be sure that the proper testing is being done to ensure their integrity as the planes continue to fly.  It also has some language regarding incidents of sexual misconduct on flights I support, but I am preparing and will offer a broader stand-alone provision bill on that subject in the near future.  It modestly increases funding levels for aviation programs and includes a $1 billion annual infusion from the general fund for certain AIP projects, principally for small airports in rural communities.  This falls far short of meeting the needs of all airports and all the gates and terminal work we need, as I mentioned earlier in discussing the lack of a PFC in this bill.  Finally, it creates a newly named position in the FAA, that would be chief technology officer. Currently, the department administrator acts as the chief technology officer. So I am not quite certain what that accomplishes, but I will certainly look forward to monitoring that position and the progress and reports on NextGen that that person produces in the near future.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
