 Chairman, this telecommunications bill cripples consumer protections and should be soundly rejected. It is being touted as pro consumer when, in reality, it will cause inflated rates and will limit consumer choice. It is touted as pro-competition when it actually promotes mergers and the concentration of power.  It ignores the success of the 1992 cable regulations which provided some $3 billion in savings to cable consumers. It deregulates cable rates within 15 months and immediately deregulates cable companies that serve about 47 percent of Vermont's cable subscribers. In rural areas there just aren't enough customers to sustain more than one or two local cable companies. Without sensible regulation, these companies would be able to raise rates on their captive consumers.  Furthermore, if this bill becomes law, the FCC would no longer be allowed to review rate increases when it receives a customer complaint. The greater of 10 subscribers or 5 percent of the subscribers must complain before the FCC can review a rate hike.  This bill also substantially weakens laws that prevent media monopolies and removes the law that prohibits one owner from controlling the major newspapers, networks, and cable stations that serve a community. It makes it easy for a handful of media moguls to buy up every source of news, especially in rural areas. This would lead to less diversity of opinion, more prepackaged programming, and less local programming.  This bill has been widely criticized by virtually all consumer advocacy groups, President Clinton has threatened a veto, and I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.
