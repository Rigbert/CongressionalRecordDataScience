 Chairman, the amendment that I am offering is absolutely nonpartisan. There are many Republicans and Democrats who are increasingly frustrated about the lack of progress being made by the Department of Defense in solving the crisis of the Persian Gulf War syndrome.  This amendment appropriates $10 million to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for emergency research of and treatment for the synergistic impact of chemicals on the soldiers who served in the Persian Gulf and who are currently suffering from gulf war syndrome. This amendment offsets this appropriation by reducing the amount to be appropriated for the Department of Defense, Overseas Contingencies Operations Transfer Fund, which is presently at $1.5 billion, by $10 million.  Mr. Chairman, for over 5 years, the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration have been studying the heartbreaking issue of Persian Gulf War syndrome. And frankly, they have not been successful. That is the issue that we have got to acknowledge today. The truth is that the DOD and the VA have made virtually no progress in understanding the cause of Persian Gulf War syndrome or developing an effective treatment for it. This is a painful truth, but we should recognize it.  Given that reality, I believe that the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs should no longer be solely trusted with the critical task of diagnosing and treating the up to 70,000 gulf war veterans who are suffering today.  From the end of the war until this day, the Pentagon, the VA, and the CIA have not been forthright with the Congress, the public or our veterans about the causes of gulf war syndrome and how we can better treat the veterans who are suffering from it.  Over and over again there has been denial. ``Is there an illness?'' ``Well, no. In the beginning there was no illness.'' Then, after tens of thousands of veterans came forward, ``Yeah, there is an illness, but it is stress.'' ``Were our soldiers exposed to chemical warfare agents?'' Absolutely. ``No, they weren't.''                              {time}  1800  Five years later, oh, yes, some of them. Well, maybe 500. A few months later, well, yes, maybe 20,000. Today, we do not know how many. There may be 130,000. We do not know.  Mr. Chairman, the military theater in the Persian Gulf was a chemical cesspool. Our troops were exposed to chemical warfare agents, leaded petroleum, widespread use of the very strong pesticides, depleted uranium and the smoke from burning oil wells, and they were given a myriad of pharmaceuticals as vaccines. Further, as a result of the waiver from the FDA, they were given pyridostigmine bromide as an anti-nerve gas measure.  Now, Mr. Chairman, the good news is that a number of studies, and I have them right here, study after study from the University of Texas, from Southern Illinois University, from Duke University, from the University of Texas in Houston, what these studies are telling us is these scientists believe that there is a direct link between chemical exposure and pyridostigmine bromide that our soldiers took. In other words, they have made some real progress.  But what is the problem? The problem is that for whatever reason, and I do not want to cast aspersions today, but for whatever reasons neither the Department of Defense nor the VA has been vigilant in looking at that area. They will tell us they are, but they have not had any results, and the truth is they are not moving forward.  Very simply, Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is take $10 million, not a lot of money within the scheme of things, and puts it into an institute, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who are interested in pursuing the link between chemical exposure and Persian Gulf illness.  I think we owe it to the 70,000 men and women who are suffering today, who put their lives on the line in the gulf, to look at this and to go into those agencies of government who want to pursue this issue.  Now, I know that my friends on the other side are not unsympathetic to this effort. I would hope that they would waive, that my friend the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], given the importance of this issue, would waive the point of order and allow us to proceed as rapidly as we can to address this important issue.
