Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to myself.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) last week asked me to schedule a hearing on his corporate responsibility, H.R. 4098, and I agreed. It is an important issue. That hearing is going to be held this Friday. That was the date that we agreed on.  I guess the thanks I get for being bipartisan and agreeing to schedule the bill of the gentleman from Michigan is the attack that I just heard from the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters). The gentlewoman should be more bipartisan in what is said on the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. LaFALCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have been having a deathbed conversion because they have voted against so many of the reforms that they now advocate. But they have to do a little bit of repentance. This bill is not adequate. They have determined their own penance. It is two Hail Marys. We deserve a bill that can be called a complete Rosary. That should be their penance.
