 Bunning):  S. 37. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to permit Kentucky to operate a separate retirement system for certain public employees; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to add Kentucky to the list of States that are permitted to offer ``divided retirement'' plans under the Social Security Act.  Last year, I was contacted by Brian James, President of the Louisville Fraternal Order of Police, FOP, and Tony Cobaugh, President of the Jefferson County FOP. These two law enforcement leaders called my attention to a problem that could jeopardize the retirement security of many of our community's police, fire, and emergency personnel.  In November of 2000, the citizens of Jefferson County and the City of Louisville, Kentucky voted to merge their communities and respective governments into a single entity, which will be known as Greater Louisville. As one might expect, combining two large metropolitan governments in such a short time frame cannot be done without encountering a few difficulties along the way. Jefferson County and the City of Louisville currently operate two very different retirement programs for their police officers. When these two governments merge today, current federal law will require the new government to offer a single retirement plan that could dramatically increase the cost of retirement for both our dedicated public safety officers and the new Greater Louisville government.  Thankfully, when the FOP's leaders called this problem to my attention, they also suggested a simple solution, let the police officers and firefighters choose for themselves the retirement system which best meets their needs.  I rise today to offer legislation that will provide retirement stability to our public safety officers by allowing Kentucky to operate what is known as a ``divided retirement system.''  With passage of my legislation and legislation already passed by the Kentucky General Assembly, Louisville's and Jefferson County's police officers would decide whether or not they want to participate in Social Security or remain in their traditional retirement plan. While future employees will be automatically enrolled in Social Security, no current officers would be forced into a new retirement system as a result of the merger without their approval.  Current Federal law allows twenty-one States the option of offering divided retirement systems. Unfortunately, Kentucky is not one of these twenty-one states. The legislation I am offering today would change that by adding Kentucky to list of states designated in the Social Security Act.  The language I introduce today was included in legislation, H.R. 4070, that passed both the House and the Senate in the 107th Congress. Unfortunately, there were differences in the House and Senate versions of H.R. 4070, unrelated to the Louisville language, that were resolved only shortly prior to the adjournment of the 107th Congress. Unfortunately, the 107th Congress adjourned sine die before this compromise version of H.R. 4070 could be considered by both bodies of Congress.  It is critical that the Senate provide this retirement stability to the brave men and women who protect the citizens of Louisville and Jefferson County everyday. There is extensive precedent for granting Kentucky this authority, and my legislation enjoys the broad, bipartisan support of policemen, firefighters, local and state officials, and the Social Security Administration.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 37       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
