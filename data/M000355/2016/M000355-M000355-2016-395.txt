 President, last night I took action to move to the 2016 Water Resources Development Act, an important authorization bill supporting our Nation's waterways. Chairman Inhofe has worked across the aisle with Ranking Member Boxer to craft this bipartisan bill, and I hope we can reach an agreement to pass it very soon.                          ____________________
