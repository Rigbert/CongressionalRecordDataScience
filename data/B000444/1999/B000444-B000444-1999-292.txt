 President, this is a rhetorical question. The report suggested that Generals Marshall and Stark were also partially responsible. My point is that the idea that the entirety of the blame, that the children and the children of the children of these two men will live forever thinking that they were the only two people responsible for this, is a historical inaccuracy, unfair, and a blemish that is not warranted to be carried by the two proud families whose names are associated with them. It is as simple as that.
