 Larry Corum of London, KY. After serving in the United States military for over 20 years, in 1990 he opened a printing business and now is the manager of the London-Corbin Airport. Both his economic leadership and steadfast service to Laurel County make him a valuable asset to the London community.  Born and raised in Clay County, KY, upon his graduation from high school in 1958, Larry attended Sue Bennett College and Eastern Kentucky University. After graduating from EKU in 1965, he joined the U.S. Air Force and became an officer. While in his first years of service, Larry married his wife, Lois. Throughout his 20-year military career, the couple traveled around the country with their two children, Chris and Gienah. Finally in 1989, he retired from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel and settled in London, KY.  In 1990, Larry opened an American Speedy Printing franchise in the London Shopping Center. After acquiring Durham Printing in 1998, the name of the company changed to Allegra Print and Imaging. In 2008, Larry left the business, entrusting his son, Chris, with running the day-to-day business operations, and became manager of the London-Corbin airport, which is the sixth-largest airport in the State of Kentucky.  Larry has served on many boards in the Laurel County area such as the American Red Cross, the United Way, SCORE, the London-Corbin Airport, Saint Joseph-London, and the executive board of the Chamber of Commerce. His contribution to the London-Laurel County Chamber of Commerce stemmed from a desire to grow the community economically. Through the Chamber of Commerce, Larry was ableto make an economic impact in London and improve the lives of his fellow Kentuckians.  Today, it is my honor to recognize Mr. Larry Corum for his contribution to the Laurel County economy through his own small business and his extensive service to the London-Laurel County Chamber of Commerce. His dedication to the community has made London, KY, an attractive area in which businesses can invest and grow.
