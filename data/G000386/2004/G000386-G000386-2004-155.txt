 President, I would like to pay tribute to Petty Officer 2nd Class Trace Dossett who valiantly gave his life for his country on Sunday, May 2, 2004. Petty Officer Dossett was one of five Navy Seabees from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 14 killed during a mortar attack on the Ramadi Marine base in Iraq. I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife, Angela, their two daughters, Cassidie and Raimi, and his parents, Larry and Cheryl of Wapello, IA.  Petty Officer Dossett was a 1985 graduate of Wapello High School in Wapello, IA. He was respected in the community for his strong mind and sense of devotion to serve our country. Trace joined the Navy shortly after graduating from high school and ended his six year tour in the early 1990s. He joined the Naval Reserve a year ago and was activated in January. I am proud of the patriotism displayed by Petty Officer Trace Dossett and his exemplary commitment to defending America. I offer my condolences to his family and close with the words of his wife, ``Trace died a hero and he would have had it no other way.''                       PFC Brandon Chauncy Sturdy
