Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  In response to the transport, yes, pipelines are generally safer, but theconsequences--look at the case in Michigan--when a pipeline goes are generally much greater, much greater volumes.  Even in the horrific train accidents we have had, the volumes were relatively small that were spilled, even though the consequences--particularly in the one in Canada--were very, very damaging. Minimally, you should have added to the bill requiring them to pay into the oil spill liability trust fund. That would make that slightly less objectionable.
