President, I join my colleagues, Senators Ensign, Dodd, Hatch, and Burr, in introducing the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Therapy and Research Act of 2005. This bipartisan legislation represents a critical step forward in expanding access to lifesaving therapies to millions of patients with conditions that can be treated and even cured with bone marrow or cord blood.  The bill we are introducing today builds upon the already highly successful National Marrow Donor Program that has been in operation since 1987. In addition to reauthorizing this program, our bill calls for the establishment of a formal registry of cord blood units available for transplantation and expands to cord blood transplant recipients many of the program's existing functions, such as donor recruitment, education, information, and patient advocacy, presently available to only bone marrow recipients. It creates an umbrella program, aptly called the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Cell Transplantation Program.  Our legislation also captures many of the key recommendations of the Institute of Medicine, IOM, in their April 2004 report entitled, ``Cord Blood: Establishing a National Hematopoietip Stem Cell Bank Program.'' The report called for a stepped up effort to expand the inventory of cord blood units available for transplantation and, when appropriate, for research. Our bill establishes a grant program for qualified cord blood banks to help facilitate building an inventory of 150,000 new cord blood units. At that level, 95 percent of Americans with a condition that can be treated through a cord blood transplant could find a genetically suitable match. Additionally, the bill establishes an advisory council to consult and make recommendations to ensure the efficient and effective operation of the program.  Another important aspect of this bill is the creation of a demonstration project to study cord blood donations within families where a first degree relative has been I diagnosed with a condition that could benefit from a cord blood transplant. The legislation sets aside 5 percent of the cord blood inventory grants for the collection and storage of cord blood units at no cost to such families. This effort will be beneficial for families who find themselves in the tragic situation of having a sick child with another child on the way whose cord blood could provide a cure to the sibling. This demonstration program ensures that families will have this treatment option available to them.  I believe that the Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Transplantation and Research Act of 2005 represents a strong compromise that upholds the principals my colleagues and I held as essential in developing a combined bone marrow and cord blood program. The bill also builds on the many strengths of the National Marrow Donor Program, which has facilitated over 20,000 transplants since its inception and has built a donor registry of over 5.5 million potential donors.  I urge the support of all of my colleagues for this bipartisan legislation so that we can send it quickly to the President for his signature.                          ____________________[Pages S7429-S7438]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS      By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 1312. A bill to amend a provision relating to employees of the United States assigned to, or employed by, and Indian tribe, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to address conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts involving former Federal officers and employees who represent Indian tribes.  The legislation amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEA), 25 US.C. 450i(j), by limiting the exemption from Federal conflicts of interest laws. Current law exempts from the conflicts laws former Federal officers and employees who ``are employed by Indian tribes'', thus permitting these former Federal employees immediately to lobby the departments they just left and act as agents and attorneys for the tribes. The legislation limits this exemption only to those former Federal employees who are employees of Indian tribes pursuant to self-determination contracts or self-governance compacts.  The bill clarifies what I believe was the intent of the Congress, as evidenced by House Report No. 93-4600 that accompanies the ISDEA, that Federal employees who work in an area that is contracted or compacted to a tribe be able to continue performing their jobs if they become employees of the Indian tribe for purposes of working in the contracted or compacted area. The exception that was made to the conflict laws appeared to have been made in response to the recognition that when Indian tribes took on the responsibility of operating programs traditionally fulfilled by the Federal Government, they would need experienced individuals to fulfill contracted or compacted functions.  Former Federal employees who leave the Federal Government and go to work as outside lawyers or lobbyists for Indian tribes, however, would, under the legislation I am introducing today, be subject to the same conflicts of interest restraints that apply to other former Federal employees who work for other entities. The bill takes effect one year after enactment to allow time for people to familiarize themselves with the new law and for tribes to seek alternative representation if necessary.  Limiting the waiver of conflicts laws in this manner proposed in this bill will address a problem identified by the Inspector General of the Department of Interior. In a report dated February 2002, entitled ``Allegations Involving Irregularities in the Tribal Recognition Process and Concerns Relating to Indian Gaming, the IG laid out a number of contacts by former BIA and DOI officials, who left Federal employment to represent tribes at law firms, to the BIA regarding recognition matters that, but for the exemption from the conflicts rules, they would be barred from making. The IG suggested that these contacts were improper, but not illegal. These contacts were all made by former Federal employees who worked as outside lawyers and lobbyists for tribes. In his testimony before the Senator Committee on Indian Affairs earlier this year, the Inspector General again raised the issue of conflicts of interest and referred to a problem of a ``revolving door'' involving former Department of Interior officials. This legislation seeks to address that problem. I urge my colleagues to support it. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1312       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Conflicts of      Interests in the Representation of Indian Tribes Act of      2005''.     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.       Section 104 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education      Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450i) is amended by striking      subsection (j) and inserting the following:       ``(j) Additional Employment Rights.--       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding sections 205 and 207 of      title 18, United States Code, an officer or employee of the      United States assigned to an Indian tribe under section 3372      of title 5, United States Code, or section 2072 of the      Revised Statutes (25 U.S.C. 48), or an individual that was      formerly an officer or employee of the United States and who      is an employee of an Indian tribe employed to perform      services pursuant to self-governance contracts or compacts      under this Act that the individual formerly performed for the      United States, may communicate with and appear before any      department, agency, court, or commission on behalf of the      Indian tribe with respect to any matter relating to the      contract or compact, including any matter in which the United      States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.       ``(2) Notification of involvement in pending matter.--An      officer, employee, or former officer or employee described in      paragraph (1) shall submit to the head of each appropriate      department, agency, court, or commission, in writing, a      notification of any personal and substantial involvement the      officer, employee, or former officer or employee had as an      officer or employee of the United States with respect to the      pending matter.''.
