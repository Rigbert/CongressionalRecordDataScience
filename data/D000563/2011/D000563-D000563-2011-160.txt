 Two weeks ago, I went to the University of Illinois Children's Hospital. A woman came there who had been suffering from asthma her entire life and talked to me about how there were days when the air was so bad, she couldn't go outside, children there with their parents and doctors telling me exactly the same thing. Yet those who are trying to repeal this air safety rule--Senator Paul and those who support him--are arguing these doctors and patients are wrong. So I wish to ask the Senator, because she was alluding to it here, what kind of medical support do you have for your position that Senator Paul's amendment, if it passes, will endanger the lives of those who are currently suffering from asthma, pulmonary disease, and maybe cardiovascular disease? And tell me what medical groups have come forward on one side or the other, please.
