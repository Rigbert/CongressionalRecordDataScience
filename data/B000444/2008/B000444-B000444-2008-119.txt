 President, I rise today to introduce the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims ProtectionReauthorization Act of 2008. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act was authored 8 years ago by Senator Brownback and the late Senator Wellstone, and since then, through two re-authorizations, has been a tremendous asset in preventing and prosecuting human trafficking crimes. Today, I am honored to be able to introduce legislation to reauthorize these valuable programs with my distinguished colleague, Senator Brownback.  Human trafficking is a major problem worldwide and the challenges remain great. According to the most recent State Department report, roughly 800,000 individuals are trafficked each year, the overwhelming majority of them women and children. The FBI estimates approximately $9.5 billion is generated annually for organized crime from trafficking in persons. The International Labor Organization estimates that, at present, 2.4 million persons have been trafficked into situations of forced labor.  These victims are trafficked in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are kidnapped outright, but many times they are lured with dubious job offers, or false marriage opportunities. The traffickers capitalize on the victims' desire to seek a better life, and trap them with lifetime debt bondages that degrade and destroy their lives.  Since 2000, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act has provided us effective tools, and in this reauthorization, our aim is to take the successes and lessons of eight years of progress and expand our abilities to combat human trafficking. In Title I, the legislation focuses on combating human trafficking internationally by broadening the U.S. interagency task force charged with monitoring and combating trafficking, and increasing the authority to the State Department Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking. Because of the difficulty in accurately understanding the full scope of the problem globally, we also include provisions to coordinate our multiple federal databases, and set a reporting requirement to address forced labor and child labor.  Today's reauthorization bill also expands our ability to combat trafficking in the United States. We've provided for certain improvements to the T-visa program, which protects trafficking victims and their families from retaliation, so that we can have their help in bringing traffickers to justice, without the victim fearing harm to themselves or their loved ones. We also expand authority for U.S. Government programs to help those who have been trafficked, and require a study to outline any additional gaps in assistance that may exist. Finally, we establish some powerful new legal tools, including increasing the jurisdiction of the courts, enhancing penalties for trafficking offenses, punishing those who profit from trafficked labor and ensuring restitution of forfeited assets to victims.  Human trafficking is a daunting and critical global issue. I urge my colleagues to support this reauthorization and work with Senator Brownback and me to pass it in the Senate as quickly as possible.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the bill be printed in the Record.William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act                                 of 2008                     Section-by-Section Description     Section 1. Short title; table of contents        TITLE I--COMBATING INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS     Section 101.

Section 103. Assistance for victims of trafficking in other          countries       Section 103 amends section 107(a) of the TVPA, including      ensuring that programs take into account the transnational      aspects of trafficking, support increased protection for      refugees, internally displaced persons and trafficked      children and emphasize cooperative, regional efforts.     Section 104. Increasing effectiveness of anti-trafficking          programs       Section 104 creates a new section to the TVPA to increase      the effectiveness of anti-trafficking programs by providing      that solicitation of grants be made publicly available and      awarded by a transparent process with a review panel of      Federal and private sector experts, when appropriate. The      provision provides a mandated evaluation system for anti-     trafficking programs on a program-by-program basis. It      requires that priorities and country assessments contained in      the most recent annual Report on Human Trafficking shall      guide grant priorities. It provides that not more than 5      percent of the appropriations may be used for evaluations of      specific programs or for evaluations of emerging problems or      trends in the field of human trafficking.     Section 105. Minimum standards for the elimination of          trafficking       Section 105 amends section 108(b) of the TVPA by clarifying      that in evaluating whether a country's anti-trafficking      efforts convictions of principal actors that result in      suspended or significantly reduced sentences shall be      considered on a case-by-case basis.     Section 106. Actions against governments failing to meet          minimum standards       Section 106 amends Section 110 of the TVPA by providing      that if a country has been on the special watch list for      three consecutive years, such country shall be deemed to be      not making significant efforts to combat trafficking and      shall be included in the list of countries described in      paragraph (1)(C). The subsection includes a Presidential      waiver for up to one year if it would promote the purposes of      the act or is in the national interest of the United States.     Section 107. Research on domestic and international          trafficking in persons       Section 107 amends section 112A of the TVPA by requiring      the establishment and maintenance of an integrated database      within the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, details      the purposes of the database, and authorizes $3 million      annually to the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center to      carry out these activities.     Section 108. Presidential award for extraordinary efforts to          combat trafficking in persons       Section 108 authorizes the President to establish a ``Paul      D. Wellstone Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to      Combat Trafficking in Persons'' for persons who provided      extraordinary service in efforts to combat trafficking in      persons.     Section 109.

Protecting trafficking victims against          retaliation       Subsection (a) of Section 201 amends section 101(1)(15)(T)      of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to provide for      certain changes to the T visa for trafficking victims.      Paragraph (1) allows persons who are brought into the      country,for investigations or as witnesses to apply for such      a visa. It also allows a T visa for persons who are not able      to assist law enforcement because of the physical or      psychological trauma; it also clarifies the existing language      in the T Visa authorization and eliminates the ``unusual and      severe harm'' standard.       Paragraph (2) allows parents and siblings who are in danger      of retaliation to join the trafficking victims safely in the      United States. Subsection (b) modifies certain requirements      of the T Visa contained in section 214(o) of the INA,      including allowing 2 the extension of time for a T Visa in      exceptional circumstances and providing that the Secretary      of Homeland Security may look at certain security and      other conditions in the applicant's home country in making      the determination that extreme hardship exists.       Subsection (d) provides for certain changes to section      245(1) of the INA relating to adjustment of status of T visa      holders, including providing that the Secretary of Homeland      Security may waive the restriction on disqualification for      good moral character for T visa holders applying for      permanent residence alien status if the actions that would      have led to the disqualification are caused by or incident to      the trafficking.

Subsection (c) provides the circumstances in which the      Secretary may suspend a visa or renew a visa, as well as when      the Secretary is not permitted to issue a visa.       Subsection (d) provides the protections and remedies for A-     3 and G-5 visa holders working in the United States.       Subsection (e) ensures protection from removal for visa      holders wanting to file a complaint regarding a violation of      contract or some Federal, State, or local law to allow time      sufficient to participate fully in all legal proceedings.

Section 205. Expansion of authority to permit continued          presence in the United States       Section 205 expands the authority to permit the Secretary      of Homeland Security to permit continued presence of      trafficking victims, including if the alien has filed a civil      action against the trafficking perpetrators (unless the alien      is not showing due diligence in pursuing his civil action).      It also allows for parole into the United States of certain      relatives of trafficking victims with several limitations.     Section 206. Implementation of trafficking victims protection          reauthorization act of 2005       Section 206 amends the Immigration and Nationality act and      requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue interim      regulations on the adjustment of status to permanent      residence for T Visa holders.

Subsection (d)      amends the trafficking statutes to hold accountable those      who knowingly or in reckless disregard financially benefit      from participation in a trafficking venture; it also      amends the forced labor and sex trafficking statutes to      clarify the definition of ``harm'' and ``abuse of the law      or legal process.'' Subsection (e) tightens the      immigration law to ensure that committing or conspiring to      commit trafficking offenses are grounds of inadmissibility      and removability. The provision also creates a new crime      of sex tourism that punishes individuals who go abroad for      sex tourism and sex tour operators that benefit from such      promoting such travel.     Section 223. Jurisdiction in certain trafficking offenses       Section 223 amends chapter 77 of title 18 by increasing the      jurisdiction of the courts to include any trafficking case      found in or brought into the United States, even if the      conduct occurred in a different country, as long as no more      than ten years have passed.
