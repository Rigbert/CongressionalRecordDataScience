Speaker, it is with great honor that I congratulate Mr. James Reyome on his retirement as Public Works Director for the Town of Griffith. James has spent over 40 years of his life dedicated to the interests of the residents of Griffith, Indiana. His career in public service has allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous people.  James has accomplished many visionary goals throughout his career. He started his career with the Griffith Police Department in 1962, where he worked until 1983, spending the last 7 years as Chief of Police. James also worked security at LTV Steel. He then became Lake County Police Chief under then Sheriff Bob Stiglich. In 1997, he was named Town of Griffith Public Works Director, a position his father held for 20 years. However, shortly before assuming the position of Public Works Director, James had a major stroke, followed by 2 milder strokes in 2002 and August 2005, which caused him to speed up his retirement plans.  James's family and friends should be proud of his efforts, as his leadership has served as a beacon of hope throughout the community. His longstanding commitment to improving the quality of life for the citizens in Griffith, Indiana is truly inspirational and should be commended. Our community has certainly been rewarded by the true service, uncompromising dedication, and loyalty displayed by Mr. Reyome.  While James has dedicated a considerable amount of time and energy to his community, he has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest: his family. James and his wife, Anna, have 3 children, 2 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. James Reyome for his outstanding devotion to Indiana's First Congressional District. His unselfish, lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E14]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO MR.
