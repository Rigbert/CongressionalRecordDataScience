This would be a positive stimulus for our economy. These benefits would be paid out until the economy came back and then automatically stop. It also recognizes the structural changes. The high-tech meltdown and the exodus of manufacturing have left many people without jobs. They need our help now.  Our economy is in distress. We have to help these hard-working Americans. We cannot wait any longer because as we wait, they invade their 401(k)s, they extend their credit cards, they do anything to make ends meet. We should help them now.  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Illinois.
