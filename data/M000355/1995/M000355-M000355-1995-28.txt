 It has been sort of bouncing back and forth between the House and the Senate.  The conference report itself on foreign operations was passed by both Houses by very wide margins. It passed in the Senate 91 to 7. It passed in the House, 331 to 71.  This morning the House passed, once again, language offered by Congressman Smith, 237 to 183, which remains in disagreement with the Senate. So what we have extant is an amendment in disagreement. The conference report will not be needed--will not be needed to be voted on again.  So what we have before us this afternoon, upon which there will be a motion to table shortly, is the Smith language.  The Senate defeated this language 53 to 44 on November 1, and, candidly, I expect the outcome of the vote we are about to have to be exactly the same. Let me repeat. The only item in disagreement is amendment 115. That is the only item upon which we are called to vote in a few moments.  The underlying conference report, which we have already approved, enjoys strong bipartisan support. We fund a number of key national priorities including the Camp David accords, aid to the NIS, including Armenia and Ukraine. Also in this bill is an extension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act.  So, again, let me say the conference report itself enjoys very strong, overwhelming bipartisan support. The only item we have before us today is what is known as the Chris Smith language, on abortion.  My colleague, Senator Leahy may want to make a few comments and then I believe the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is going to make a motion to table.  I yield the floor.
