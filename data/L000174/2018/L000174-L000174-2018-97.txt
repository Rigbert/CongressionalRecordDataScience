President, I simply say to the Senator from Alaska, in my having had the honor of serving here with both her father and with the former chair of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, that I hear her saying things that are very similar to what I had heard both of them say. Perhaps Senator Stevens--rest his soul--would have said it with a little bit more emphasis, especially if he had been wearing his ``Incredible Hulk'' tie, but the Senator from Alaska is one of those who believes in the Senate working the way it should and getting things done, and I compliment her efforts.  Senator Shelby and I made a pact that we would try to get these appropriations bills through, which is something that had been stalled for years.
