Chairman, I appreciate the recognition. I would close by indicating that there has been discussion about the burden that this act imposes upon small businesses. And I would, again, wish to contradict that.  I also believe that the administrative requirements of the act are critical to prevent a fraud against government agencies. First, to comply with the IRS and overtime regulations, all law-abiding contractors must retain records on hours worked, wages, and benefits. Second, electronic transmission of data has streamlined reporting. Third, the integrity of the whole program relies on this reporting to avoid kickbacks, misclassification of workers, and cheating under the Davis-Bacon Act. It is important to remember that Federal overtime law, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, requires all employers--not just those that must comply with Davis-Bacon--to keep records.  So, again, I would ask that my colleagues oppose the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Westmoreland). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
