I agree with the Senator that while we are looking for policies and programs that help small farmers and ranchers, we look carefully at all other actions that could make a difference. I believe that the issue of inspection fees charged bison producers should be explored by the Department of Agriculture, and that the Department should provide us with their analysis of this impact early in 1999.
