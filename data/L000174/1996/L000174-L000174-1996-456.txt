President, I would like to note last week a good friend of mine, and one of the best friends my home city of Burlington has, Tom Racine, died after a courageous battle with cancer.  Tom was one of those very special people who seemed to be involved in everything good with our community. As a motivating force, as the chief volunteer, as the hardest worker, he epitomized everything that we see in one who makes a community go forward, with the possibility of one exception. Tom Racine was the person you never saw in the headlines. You hardly heard of him in the press conferences or anything else. He just did the work. Others, often times, got the credit but Tom did the work.  I know so many times when I would run into him on Church Street in Burlington and I would talk about something that he was intimately involved in that was improving our community, I would tell him I read about others who were involved, but I knew he was doing so much of the work and I had not seen a word about him. He would say, ``Pat, you know, that's just the way I am. I just want to get the work done.''  Tom and his wife, Jeanette, ran Bertha Church's store on Church Street for years and years. We would see him there in the store. My wife shopped there, as did my mother, my mother-in-law, my daughter and others. It was more than just a store you would go into. It was a place where everybody knew you by name. Everybody was concerned about you and your family.  But more importantly, Tom and Jeanette Racine were concerned about all of us--Vermonters in the truest sense of the word. Our State has lost one of its most valuable citizens.  My wife, Marcelle, and I expressed our sympathy to Jeanette and the family. I had hoped to be at his funeral on Monday. As we all know, everything was closed down as far as air travel from here, and I was unable to go.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have some editorials and articles from the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 5, 1996]                            Called To Serve       Every community needs at least one civic leader like the      later Tom Racine--more interested in building up community      than his own reputation, so dogged in pursuit of a good idea      Racine once drove a Park-and-Ride van himself when nobody      else would.       Burlington is fortunate to have so many civic-minded      leaders like him. None, however, has been quite as self-     effacing, persevering or nonpolitical. And few have been as      determined to strengthen Burlington's retail economy where it      counts most, downtown, or where it's been more fun,      Centennial Field, home of Burlington's warmly welcomed minor      league baseball franchise, the Vermont Expos.       Racine, who helped found the Church Street Marketplace in      the 1980s and bring the Expos here in the 1990s, died      Wednesday at age 65. What he brought to Burlington as a      person, however, is sure to survive him--his civic work alone      an inspiration to those like him to press on, and a nudge to      others who, unlike him, might never have felt the need to      serve.       Expos' owner Ray Pecor remembers who first put the bug in      his ear to bring minor league baseball back to Burlington--     and who then bugged him . . . and bugged him . . . and bugged      him again until it was done: Tom Racine. Why did that      comeback succeed when others had not? Racine, raised during      baseball's heyday when players still played for fun, knew to      put fans and fun first.       The Marketplace Commission's Molly Lambert remembers how      that Park-and-Ride attempt to make downtown more pedestrian-     friendly plan failed--but not until Racine had squeezed out      the last drop of hope by volunteering to drive himself.       Mayor Peter Clavelle remembers Racine's habit of checking      his politics and his ego at the door--the secret of his      success with all manner of politicians.       Born in Maine, raised and educated in Brandon, he was,      nonetheless, a Burling- tonian through and through--first as      a graduate of the University of Vermont, later as a partner      in downtown retailing and as president of the Downtown      Burlington Development Association, then as chairman of the      Burlington Public Works Commission. In all his civic work, he      took the unpaid way.       Anyone who thinks Vermonters can afford to lose such old-     fashioned civic-mindedness isn't paying attention. As more      state and federal aid runs dry, sooner or later all of us      will be asked to answer similar calls.       How many of us who do will say a lot about what kind of      communities Vermonters build for generations to come.                                                                    ____                                               [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 4, 1996]                     Baseball, Downtown Leader Dies                           (By Mike Donoghue)       Tom Racine, the man who helped build a new downtown for      Burlington and minor league baseball clubs for Vermont, died      Wednesday in Fletcher Allen Health Care.       Racine, 65, was general manager for the Vermont Expos for      the past two seasons, but may be better known for helping      create the Church Street Marketplace.       Molly Lambert, director of the Church Street Marketplace,      noted Racine had done yeoman's work in promoting downtown.      She said Racine was president of the Downtown Burlington      Development Association when Church Street was turned into an      outdoor pedestrian mall in 1981. Two years later the      association gave him the Nate Harris award for promoting      downtown.       Racine and his wife, Jeanette, bought Bertha Church, an      intimate apparel shop on the Marketplace, in 1974.       Racine also served on the Burlington Public Works      Commission and was its chairman. The city named the      educational wing at the new public works building after him.       He also won sports awards. The New York-Penn League in 1994      named him executive of the year for running the minor league      team, which is affiliated with the Montreal Expos.       Racine, who was diagnosed with lung cancer last year, was      admitted to the hospital about a week ago for unrelated      medical problems, according to his son, Bill Racine. After      further complications, he died early Wednesday, his son said.      Racine also leaves another son, Robert, and a daughter, Lori.       Lambert said Racine was quick to give a hand to anybody.      She said he was one of the first businessmen to befriend      socialist Bernie Sanders when he was elected mayor.       Jeanette Racine said it was her husband's friendship with      Sanders that helped bring minor league baseball back to the      state in 1983 in the form of the Vermont Reds of the Eastern      League. The Reds eventually left, but the city later got the      Mariners and then the Expos.       Bill Racine said the message that he got from his father is      that ``we all have a little something to give to our      community.''                                                                    ____             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 4, 1996]                Baseball Community Mourns Loss of Racine                          (By Patrick Garrity)       Tom Racine was a baseball man.       So say those who knew and worked alongside the Vermont      Expos general manager, who died Wednesday morning after a      battle with cancer. He was 65.       The man who helped bring baseball back to Burlington should      be remembered for his business savvy and his dedication to      his work. But most of all, Racine should be remembered for      his love for the game.       ``He loved his work and loved to come to work,'' said Kyle      Bostwick, Racine's assistant with the New York-Penn League      team. ``More often that not, he was the first person into the      office or the ballpark and the last person to leave.''       Racine was involved as a booster for the Vermont Reds and      Mariners organizations in the 1980s, then worked feverishly      with Burlington businessman Ray Pecor to bring a NY-Penn team      to Vermont. Pecor was not available to comment on Racine's      passing, but the general manager's work was recognized in a      statement prepared by the team:       ``Tom Racine was the motivation for bringing baseball back      to Burlington. If not for his persistence and encouragement      towards the local community, baseball in Burlington may not      have happened.''       ``He always stressed to us to make sure the fans were taken      care of, and I think that was because he was one himself,''      Bostwick said. ``Every one of his decisions, be it directly      or indirectly, was for the fun of the fan. . . .''       Racine's success with the Expos' organization clearly was      evident, as more than 230,000 fans streamed through      Centennial Field's turnstiles the past two years. He was      named 1994 NY-Penn Executive of the Year after the team set      attendance records in its inaugural season.       ``He was very well respected by his colleagues in the      league,'' said NY-Penn president Bob Julian. ``He was just a      real man of the community. He loved Burlington, he loved      baseball, and I think he had a ball doing his job. He loved      the game.''       A season-ticket holder since the days of the Vermont Reds,      John Douglas of Essex Junction said Racine developed a      rapport with fans and sought to make an Expos' game an      enjoyable experience.       ``Once, Tom mentioned to me that baseball is a game that is      supposed to be enjoyed,'' Douglas said. ``Consequently, he      had that in mind when he was setting things up for Mr.      Pecor.''       ``He was a gentleman who was very knowledgeable about the      business of baseball. . . . ``Mr Pecor lost a very, very      trusted, highly competent individual, and we're going to miss      him.''                                                                    ____             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 5, 1996]                             Thomas Racine       Thomas Racine, 65, died Wednesday, Jan. 3, 1996, following      a brief illness.       He was born April 24, 1930, in Brunswick, Maine, the son of      Dr. Wilfred and Marion Racine. The family moved to Brandon,      Vt., in 1943, where he graduated from Brandon High School in      1948. Following a year in the Army, Tom received his B.A.      from UVM in 1953.       Tom worked in the pension department at Connecticut General      Insurance in Hartford for five years before returning to      Burlington. He was employed as a sales representative for      Proctor & Gamble and Maidenform until 1973, when he and his      wife, Jeanette, purchased Bertha Church, a retail shop they      have managed together ever since.       Always a baseball enthusiast, in 1994 Tom received what for      him was an opportunity of a lifetime: a chance to serve as      general manager of the newly organized Vermont Expos baseball      team of the NY-Penn League. In 1994 he was honored by being      voted ``Executive of the Year'' by his peers in the league.      He actively pursued his general manager's duties until the      time of his death.       Community issues were a driving force in Tom's life. As co-     chair of the Downtown Burlington Development Association from      1978 to 1982 and 1985 to 1987, he was a catalyst behind      creation of the Church Street Marketplace. He was a founder      of the Transportation and Parking Council and promoted      numerous public parking alternatives. In 1983, he received      the Nathan Harris Award in recognition of his efforts to      improve the economic vitality of the business district. He      served on the Public Works Commission from 1987 to 1993, the      last three years as chairman. He served as head of the      Downtown Middlebury Association from 1992 to 1993, a position      from which he helped spread the secrets of Burlington's      economic success.       While baseball was his passion and downtown Burlington his      consummate interest, he was also devoted to youth activities.      He coached Little League and umpired high school and college      baseball, filmed South Burlington High School football games      for 12 years, volunteered for early morning duty with area      youth hockey and served on various Boosters clubs. He also      loved golf and the art of joke-telling.       Besides his wife, Jeanette, he is survived by two sons,      William of Phippsburg, Maine, and Robert of Rutland; a      daughter, Lori MacNeill of Mansfield, Mass.; and eight      grandchildren.                          ____________________
