Speaker, I strongly support much of what H. Con. Res. 352 has to say about the valuable contributions people of Indian origin have made to the United States. As the resolution notes, people of Indian origin have made contributions in a wide variety of disciplines, including science, technology, the arts and public service.  However, I am concerned that H. Con. Res. 352 presents a uniformly positive view of U.S. trade relations with India that is unjustified. While the resolution mentions the export of U.S. goods to India, it fails to acknowledge the rampant export of American jobs to India.  U.S. trade policies, including our policies toward India, have failed American workers. The U.S. has lost millions of high-paying manufacturing jobs. Now, service sector jobs are increasingly shifting overseas. Around 400,000 service jobs, including 27,000 technology jobs, were siphoned off to India, China and other low-wage havens last year.  Morgan Stanley estimates the number of U.S. jobs exported to India will double to about 150,000 in the next three years. A University of California-Berkeley study found U.S. firms exported 30,000 service sector jobs to India while eliminating 226,000 jobs in the U.S.  It's not hard to see why: computer programming jobs in the U.S. that pay $60,000-$80,000 a year go for as little as $8,952 in China, $5,880 in India, or $5,000 in Russia.  The U.S. economy will never be on sound footing, and workers will never enjoy job security, as long as Congress and the Administration perpetuate the discredited dogma of ``free'' trade. The Bush Administration argues in its latest Economic Report of the President that, ``When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than make or provide it domestically.'' I disagree with the Bush Administration's argument that ``it makes more sense'' to flood the U.S. market with goods and services from low-wage havens like India just because it's cheaper.  I am disappointed that H. Con. Res. 352 does not present a more balanced view of U.S. trade relations with India.                          ____________________
