Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a hero from my congressional district. Last week I was informed that Sgt. Ryan C. Young of my hometown of Corona, California passed away due to complications from injuries sustained while fighting in Fallujah, Iraq on November 8, 2003. Today I would ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to his country.  Ryan was born on June 29, 1982, in Orange, California. After graduating from Norco High School in 2000, he enlisted in the Army. He was assigned to A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, based in Fort Riley, Kansas as an infantryman and was deployed to Iraq in September.  On November 8, 2003, while riding in an armored vehicle with other U.S. troops, his vehicle was hit by an explosive device. Ryan was sent to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland but later passed away from complications from his injuries on December 2, 2003. He was 21 years old and leaves behind a wife, mother and father.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Ryan, who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. My thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude for their sacrifice go out to his wife and family. There are no words that can relieve their pain. Ryan was awarded the Purple Heart and will be laid to rest at the Riverside National Cemetery where he will be close to home and those who love him.  His wife and family have all given a part of themselves in the loss of their loved one and I hope they know that their son and the sacrifice he has made will not be forgotten.                          ____________________
