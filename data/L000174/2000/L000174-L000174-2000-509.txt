82, the Senate companion bill. Our amendment was accepted by unanimous consent. I thank Senator McCain, the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, the Ranking Member of the Committee, for holding the Senate position in conference with minor revisions and, thus, including our amendment in the final bill.  I look forward to President Clinton signing the Aircraft Safety Act of 2000 into law as part of the conference report on the Air Transportation Improvement Act, H.R. 1000.                               Exhibit 1                                Office of the Attorney General                                                    Washington, DC     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed is proposed legislation, ``The      Aircraft Safety Act of 1999.'' This is part of the      legislation program of the Department of Justice for the      first session of the 106th Congress. This legislation would      safeguard United States aircraft, space vehicles, passengers,      and crewmembers from the dangers posed by the installation of      nonconforming, defective, or counterfeit parts in civil,      public, and military aircraft. During the 105th Congress,      similar legislation earned strong bi-partisan support, as      well as the endorsement of the aviation industry.       The problems associated with fraudulent aircraft and      spacecraft parts have been explored and discussed for several      years. Unfortunately, the problems have increased while the      discussions have continued. Since 1993, federal law      enforcement agencies have secured approximately 500 criminal      indictments for the manufacture, distribution, or      installation or nonconforming parts. During the same period,      the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received 1,778      reports or suspected unapproved parts, initiated 298      enforcement actions, and issued 143 safety notices regarding      suspect parts.       To help combat this problem, an interagency Law      Enforcement/FAA working group was established in 1997.      Members include the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI);      the Office of the Inspector General, Department of      Transportation; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service;      the Office of Special Investigations, Department of the Air      Force; the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Department      of the Navy; the Customs Service, Department of the Treasury;      the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the      FAA. The working group quickly identified the need for      federal legislation that targeted the problem of suspect      aircraft and spacecraft parts in a systemic, organized      manner. The enclosed bill is the product of the working      group's efforts.       Not only does the bill prescribe tough new penalties for      trafficking in suspect parts; it also authorizes the Attorney      General, in appropriate cases, to seek civil remedies to stop      offenders from re-entering the business and to direct the      destruction of stockpiles and inventories of suspect parts so      that they do not find their way into legitimate commerce.      Other features of the bill are described in the enclosed      section-by-section analysis.       If enacted, this bill would give law enforcement a potent      weapon in the fight to protect the safety of the traveling      public. Consequently, we urge that you give the bill      favorable consideration.       We would be pleased to answer any questions that you may      have and greatly appreciate your continued support for strong      law enforcement. The Office of Management and Budget has      advised us that, from the perspective of the Administration's      program, there is no objection to the submission of this      legislation proposal, and that its enactment would be in      accord with the problem of the President.           Sincerely,                                                       Janet Reno,                                                 Attorney General.                                                 Rodney E. Slater,                                      Secretary of Transportation.                                                 William S. Cohen,                                             Secretary of Defense.                                                 Daniel S. Goldin,                                              Administrator, NASA.
