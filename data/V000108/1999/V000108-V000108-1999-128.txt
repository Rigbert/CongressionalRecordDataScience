Speaker, northwest Indiana lost an outstanding citizen last month. Paul William Tanner, Sr., who devoted his life to our county, passed away on March 10, 1999.  Throughout his life, Mr. Tanner served as an exceptional example of a good American. As a United States Army World War II veteran of the North African campaign against General Rommel, Mr. Tanner demonstrated the enduring qualities of loyalty, honor, devotion, and service to our country.  While serving in the Armed Forces during World War II, he suffered shrapnel wounds and was captured by the Germans. Following his capture, he was forced to march to Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, from where he was flown to Italy, where he remained for about a month. During his stay in Italy, he was fed one small bowl of cabbage daily. From Italy, he was forced to march to various countries, including Austria and Germany. As a prisoner of war, Mr. Tanner was required to work on a farm thrashing barley, and while performing this difficult manual labor, he inhaled thick dust which weakened his lungs. He contracted tuberculosis, which led to a lifelong debilitating battle with bronchitis and emphysema. After gaining his freedom and returning to the United States, Mr. Tanner completed his college education and became a public school teacher. His weakened lungs forced him to take an early retirement and led to his eventual death at the age of 76.  Mr. Speaker and my distinguished colleagues, I ask you to join me in commending Mr. Paul William Tanner, Sr., for his dedication to this country. His family and friends can be proud of his strong devotion and service to the United States. He will be missed by all who loved him.                          ____________________
