 Yet, it speaks to exactly the charge made by Dr. Whitehurst; namely, that the culture within the FBI is to overstate lab results to get a conviction. They do this by withholding any data that might show the opposite.  That makes me think of an analogy, Mr. President. Imagine me standing by a dog. You ask me if my dog bites. I say ``no.'' You reach down to pet the dog, and he bites you. You say, ``I thought you said your dog doesn't bite.'' And I say, ``That's not my dog.''  The point is, I withheld valuable information to keep you from having an informed judgment. That is what the FBI does, according to Dr. Whitehurst, and in this specific case according to Dr. Tobin. And when the IG's investigative report comes out next month, we'll see if there are other examples that need following up.  In an interview with Federal investigators, Dr. Tobin called this ``forensic prostitution.'' Those were hiswords, Mr. President. Forensic prostitution. It must be really bad when a senior, supervisory agent in the FBI's own lab calls that practice ``forensic prostitution.'' What does that say about the standards in the lab? And does not that back up what was charged by Dr. Whitehurst? Of course it does.  The impact of the Tobin memo, in my view, is not whether it would change the outcome of the Alcee Hastings case. I have heard arguments on both sides. I don't know, for instance, whether it would make enough of a difference for me to have changed my vote to convict Mr. Hastings. One thing is for sure: Agent Malone sure thought it was important. But is not it simply a matter of fairness for Mr. Hastings?  And that is not the only issue. The impact is much broader, much more serious. It raises questions about the integrity of the criminal justice process, especially the FBI's role. It raises the inference, in this highly visible case before the American people, that other evidence could have been tainted.  This alleged wrongdoing by an FBI agent wasn't done to a terrorist, or a mad bomber. He was a sitting Federal judge, a man who held a position of prestige and influence in a separate and coequal branch of our Government. The testimony was used in a court of law, and before the U.S. Congress.  Senior officials in the FBI knew about this. Nothing was done to correct the record. And nothing was done to discipline the agent. Is this because the culture in the FBI condones this? Is Dr. Whitehurst correct? Is Dr. Tobin correct, that forensic prostitution is condoned?  Last night, Director Freeh issued a statement saying that this was the first time he was aware of the Tobin memo. I don't understand this, Mr. President. The Justice Department's inspector general looked into this matter. It is in the report that has been sitting on Mr. Freeh's desk since January 20. How can he say that this is the first time he has heard of this?  Instead, he has his deputy, Weldon Kennedy, out making misleading statements to the public about how the IG didn't find any problems in the lab. I detailed this in my statement yesterday. And now we hear the Director telling us he was unaware of an issue that was on his desk for over a month.  There is another serious issue, Mr. President. There appears to be a missing document. The Tobin memo was written after the fact of Agent Malone's allegedly false testimony. But the original report by Dr. Tobin of the testing he did on the evidence has been missing. Director Freeh's statement last night alludes to that document and the fact that it was sent to the chief counsel of the 11th Circuit, which found Judge Hastings unfit to serve.  However, there was not a copy of that report within FBI headquarters, where it should have been. The reason it should be there is in case the inspector general or others wanted to investigate what happened. The fact of Mr. Freeh document, and that the eleventh circuit has it, does not answer the relevant question.  Also not mentioned in the Freeh statement are concerns about the public's perception of all this. The public's confidence in Federal law enforcement is already on the wane. The FBI lab situation will only add to that. I sense that the FBI is still dancing around the truth and full disclosure. Nothing short of the truth can and will be tolerated.  I have written today to the Justice inspector general requesting that he investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the original Tobin analysis. I have also written today to the Attorney General asking that the IG take the lead on this investigation because of possible conflicts of interest for the FBI.  Finally, Mr. President, let me reiterate a warning I made yesterday about action against Dr. Whitehurst or any of the other scientists who might come forward. This Congress will not tolerate action against Dr. Whitehurst, or any other individual who might come forward with the truth. And that message goes for Justice Department officials, as well, who have now removed authority from the FBI for any action taken against Dr. Whitehurst.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Tobin memo, plus attachments, and the two letters I sent today, to which I referred earlier.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Memo To: Section Chief Ken Nimmich.       From: SA William A. Tobin.       Subject: Exceptions to Testimony of SA Michael P. Malone in      the Matter of U.S. District Judge Alcee S. Hastings.       Purpose: To advise of exceptions taken to testimony of SA      Malone in 11th Circuit judicial inquiry, Atlanta, Georgia.       Details: In preparation for anticipated congressional      testimony on August 3, 1989, SA Tobin reviewed the transcript      of the 11th Judicial Circuit testimony in Atlanta, Georgia,      of SA Malone. Because of the potential for serious conflict      and substantial embarrassment to the Bureau, an audience was      requested with you late in the day of August 3, 1989, wherein      you requested the specific details of may objections, my      exceptions to SA Malone's testimony, and technical analysis      as to the effect of the testimony.       Attached hereto are the requested exceptions and analysis,      as well as two photographs of test breaks.       Recommendations: None. For information only. exceptions to testimony of sa malone re u.s. district judge alcee l.                                 hastings       1. p. 113, line 2: Metallurgical testing procedures      utilized were not ``winging it''. I did not have to ``design      a test''. The apparatus is, in fact, designed to test any      solid material (including hairs).       This statement, repeated in various forms several      additional times, undermines the legal value of the      metallurgical testing as not in compliance with the Frye and      ``generally accepted guidelines'' rules.       2. p. 116, line 23: False statement. SA Malone had no      participation in the tensile testing, and had only requested      to watch because he had ``. . . never seen such a test . .      .'' and wanted to see how they were conducted.       3. p. 117, line 11: False statement. Either the writing is      that of SA Tobin or the evidence has been altered subsequent      to the tensile testing. On every nonmetallic item in which I      have induced tensile failure on behalf of the FBI Laboratory,      I have placed evidence or plain white tape at the fracture in      order to identify Laboratory-induced failures, with Sharpie      Marking Pen writing ``test tear'' and an arrow pointing to      the failure. If my recollection serves me correctly, I      believe I noticed when I saw the purse some time later that      my own markings had been removed and those of SA Malone had      replaced them.       4. p. 117, lines 21-23: False statement. Photos were made      outside the presence of SA Malone by SA Tobin during the      course of metallurgical examinations.       5. p. 118, lines 17, 18: False statement. Neither the test      tears nor the photographs were made by SA Malone.       6. p. 120, line 22: Not true. I did not have to ``jury rig      it'' . . . I used standard test fixtures for this type      material and specimen. The equipment was designed for any      solid material of suitable configuration. The testing was in      conformance with the Frye and ``generally accepted      guidelines'' rules, contrary to the manner in which the      testimony is presented.       7. p. 123, line 23: False statement, particularly following      the specific words ``actually'' and ``yourself''.       8. p. 124, lines 3-5: Incorrect. In fact, designers and      users abhor sudden breaks because of the potential for      catastrophic loss of life. Designers, therefore, attempt to      insure gradual failures so that it is not instantaneous. The      terms ``gradual'' and ``slowly'' are deceptive and relate      only to the strain rate selected by SA Tobin for the testing:      almost any strain rate could have been selected for the test.       9. p. 124, lines 6, 7, and 15: The tears did not proceed      (propagate) on a ``. . . diagonal line across the entire      strap until finally the entire strap went.'' The effect of      this ``observation'' is to enhance differences between the      questioned tear and the test tears. In addition,      characterization of the test tears as ``diagonal across the      entire strap'' puts the failure mode in a different category      (when reviewed by a metallurgist or materials scientist), not      supported by either expectations or actual test behavior.       10. p. 124 line 24: Use of the term ``pressures'' is not      appropriate and is not interchangeable with ``force'' posing      a potential technical review problem. On a strap      approximately \3/4\" wide and \1/8\" thick, a force of 29      lbs. results in approximately 309 lbs/in \2\ on the same      cross sectional area results in a force of 2.7 lbs exerted on      the strap, a significant difference on technical review.       11. p. 126, lines 1-3: same comments as #9 above.       12. p. 127, lines 13-15: same comments as #5 above.       13. p. 126, line 9:       14. p. 129, line 9: Direct contradiction to laboratory (AE)      findings supported by data. Presents apparently and      potentially exculpatory information as incriminating.       15. p. 129, line 11: Contrived/fabricated response and      false. Renders metallurgical test data very likely      inadmissible because such data can be deemed to fail the Frye      test and the ``generally accepted guidelines''.       16. p. 130, line 14, 15: Deceptive, if not outright false.       17. p. 130, line 24: Not true. The figure is not      meaningless with regard to the strap.       18. p. 131, line 14: Contradicts #17 above, and not      accurate. ``Pressures'' likely vary along the entire length      of strap.       19. p. 132, lines 2: Unfounded and in direct contradiction      to laboratory test data. In fact, test data indicates the      strap would not be capable of supporting or hanging 30      pounds. Aggravates incriminating nature of evidence/data and      omits assumptions, premises or qualifying stipulations which      might be viewed as potentially exculpatory.       20. p. 133, line 15: Inaccurate and deceptive.       21. p. 133, line 19: Failure initiation and propagation      assessment is completely fabricated.       22. p. 134, lines 3-8.       23. p. 135, lines 6-10: Completely fabricated failure      propagation assessment.       24. p. 135, line 21: ditto.       25. p. 136, line 4: ??? as to where cut started. Unfounded      and not supported by data.       26. p. 143, line 17: Unfounded. There is not data or      indication that the cut was made by a person.       27. p. 144, line 24 and p. 145, lines 7, 8: Inaccurate      observations and contrary to expected and actual test data.       Again suppresses apparent exculpatory material behavior and      presents test specimens as incriminating data.                                  ____                          Effect of Testimony       The misrepresentations and misstatements in the transcript      would, on review by metallurgical/materials personnel,      represent a glaring pattern of conversion of what should have      been presented as neutral data into incriminating      circumstances by complete reversal of established laboratory      test data with scientifically unfounded, unqualified and      biased testimony. [See exceptions # 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19,      21, 23, 24, 26, 27].       Additionally, the transcript reveals a pattern of complete      omission of crucial conditions, caveats, premises and/or      assumptions which may be viewed as tending toward exculpatory      in nature. Even Mr. Doar had to intercede to bring the      testimony back to reality (see p. 146, line 14).       As an example, existing laboratory reports indicate that      the strap failed consistently at approximately 29.2 lbs. and      that a weight up to that of an individual can be exerted on      the strap by anyone attempting to break the strap. After      applying what is one of the weakest motions for exerting      force by an individual (pulling an object with both hands      exerting forces in opposite directions), he testified that,      as a 200 lb. ``weightlifter'', he could not break the strap.      [It does not require an expert to visualize how an individual      might apply loads greater than what SA Malone exerted]. The      strong inference is that it is impossible to accidentally or      intentionally exert a breaking load on the straps and,      therefore, the strap must be cut to successfully break it.      Another example [exception # 26] is the statement that a      person made the cut.       The opinions expressed in the transcript can not be viewed      as constituting professional differences. The witness has no      apparent academic or empirical training to provide such      testimony. Even had the witness undertaken the minimal      studies for such testimony, to include Introduction to      Materials, Strength of Materials, Engineering Materials,      Behavior of Matter, Properties of Materials, Materials and      Advanced Materials Laboratories, Mechanical Testing &      Laboratory, and Failure Analysis courses or their equivalents      (26 credit hours of study), he has not conducted any such      testing, utilized the test apparatus, or even observed its      use in the prior 15 years or more.       The testimony, almost in complete entirety, relates to      materials strain or deformation, stress applications, tensile      test procedures, tensile data, and failure (propagation)      assessment. It was very apparent even before SA Malone      testified in Atlanta, Ga., that the metallurgical      examinations and test results would be of importance to the      inquiry, but I was told that I was not needed. From the early      stages of judicial proceedings I was queried a number of      times for information as to these topics with an explanation      of ``personal curiosity''. However, both the number of      queries and complexity (specificity) indicated more than a      casual interest. I cautioned SA Malone about attempting to      present the metallurgical data without some of the crucial      caveats, premises or assumptions which must be made, such as      system constraints (eg., wearer's hand grasping the strap),      lack of complete specimen adjustment to applied forces      (varies with the manner in which individual is carrying      purse), initial condition statements, strain rate      considerations, and manner of stress application. All of      these cautions have been ignored and omitted in the      testimony, and all of them can be viewed as exculpatory in      nature.       Contributing to the perception of complete exculpatory      information suppression, review of the transcript reveals no      indication that the Chief Judge or the 11th Circuit panel was      in receipt of FBI Laboratory report 51025051 S RU; in fact,      it suggests the contrary.       Further, the metallurgical test data may well be rendered      inadmissible because the witness states that I was ``. . .      winging it'', that I had to ``jury rig'' and ``fiddle'' with      the test apparatus, and that ``. . . nobody in our . . . lab      had ever done a test like this, and I have never heard of any      studies being published, it's almost a meaningless figure . .      .''. Testifying as, what the court thought was, an expert in      that area, this is a fairly strong indictment of the testing.      These statements beg for a ruling of inadmissability in view      of the Frye and ``generally accepted guidelines'' standards.       These exceptions were originally discussed with Section      Chief Ken Nimmich because of a potential for serious and      embarrassing conflict in congressional testimony tentatively      scheduled for August 3, 1989. Not unexpectedly, our testimony      was not needed in the congressional proceedings. However,      this is being made a matter of record to indicate that the      testimony is not reflective of the metallurgical testing,      test data and guidance provided.       Overall, the exceptions to the testimony of SA Malone do      not affect the technical assessment that the purse strap has      been cut.                                  ____                                                    U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 26, 1997.     Hon. Janet Reno,     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General: I am writing in reference to my      meeting on February 24, 1997 with the DOJ Inspector General      during which I requested an investigation into the matter of      an alleged missing document detailing an initial F.B.I.      analysis of the tests performed on evidence in the case      against Alcee L. Hastings.       According to a February 25, 1997 statement released by      F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh, the F.B.I. will be looking into      this matter also. I have attached a copy of his statement.       I have asked the Inspector General to investigate this      matter for reasons of ensuring the public's confidence in      resolving this matter. In this regard, I believe it is better      for an independent investigation rather than one by the      F.B.I. Questions have been raised in the public arena in      recent years regarding the F.B.I.'s ability to investigate      itself. An independent investigation will ensure that there      is no question of all the facts being disclosed.       Please provide a response to this letter by close of      business on Friday, February 27, 1997. Your assistance is      greatly appreciated.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,         Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and            the Courts.                                  ____         U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on            Administrative Oversight and the Courts                                Washington, DC, February 26, 1997.     Hon. Michael R. Bromwich,     Inspector General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Inspector General: I am writing in reference to our      meeting on February 24, 1997 during which I requested that      you look into the matter of an alleged missing document      detailing an initial F.B.I. analysis of the tests performed      on evidence in the case against Alcee L. Hastings. You agreed      to see what you could find out.       According to a February 25, 1997 statement released by      F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh, the F.B.I. will be looking into      this matter also. I have attached a copy of his statement.      However, because of potential conflict of interests, I      believe it is extremely important that your office take the      lead in this matter.       Therefore, as Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on      Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I formally request      that you proceed with this investigation, especially in light      of the attached statement by Director Freeh.       Please respond to this request by March 5, 1997. Your      assistance is greatly appreciated.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E.
