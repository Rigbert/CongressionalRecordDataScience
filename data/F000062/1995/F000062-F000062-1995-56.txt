 So I would be hopeful that we could end the debate on the size and shape of the continuing resolution, pass a clean continuing resolution, send this resolution to the President, and I would urge him to sign it.  I would then urge the parties to reach across the aisle and begin to discuss how we can resolve the differences in the reconciliation bill.  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.
