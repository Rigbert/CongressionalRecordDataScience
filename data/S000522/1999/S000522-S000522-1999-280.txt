Mr. Speaker, today I am reintroducing the Meal Tax Reduction Act. This legislation, which I also introduced in the last session of Congress, is designed to alleviate some of the tax code inequities that hurt the food service industry. As many of my colleagues know, the food service industry is the only business specifically excluded from normal business expense deduction rules. My legislation is aimed at restoring fairness to current law.  The Meal Tax Reduction Act would partially restore the deduction permitted for meals and entertainment expenses to 80 percent. While I believe we should eventually reinstate the meal tax to 100 percent, this legislation takes the first steps to gradually restore the tax to at least the pre-1993 level of 80 percent.  Under the Balanced Budget Act, transportation workers can already deduct a higher percentage of their meal expenses than other workers, and transport workers will eventually be able to deduct 80 percent of their food expenses. My legislation would simply extend the deductions already put in place for the transportation industry, so that fairness is ensured for everyone.  This important legislation would eventually allow someone starting a small business, working away from home on a construction job, or traveling away on business to take a reasonable tax deduction for food expenses.  Since the law was changed in 1993 to a 50 percent meal tax deduction there has been a notable has had a negative effect on the restaurant sector of our economy. And the restaurant industry employs millions of people. Restoring the meal tax deduction would help create new jobs in our economy, often for people who are trying to enter the workforce for the first time. If welfare to work is to be fully implemented, we need to create the kind of entry level positions and entrepreneurial opportunities that are often the first steps up the ladder to the American Dream.  In addition, law penalizes and de-legitimizes the food service. The Meal Tax Reduction Act would begin moving the restaurant industry toward parity with other businesses. The act immediately increases the meal tax deduction to 60 percent next year, and eventually to 80 percent by the year 2008. My legislation gradually fixes the meal tax inequity.  Lastly, I want to note that since the introduction of my legislation last year, that support for meal tax equity has been steadily increasing. In fact, Chairman Bill Archer of the Ways and Means Committee has included meal tax reductions in his comprehensive tax plan tat are very similar to legislation for which I have been advocating. There is nothing like an idea whose time has come.                          ____________________
