I say to those listening to this debate that Senator Wellstone of Minnesota has been a consistent voice on the floor of the Senate on the issue of health care. Many of us visit that issue and believe it is important. He has dedicated his life in Congress and the Senate to champion the cause of good health care for all Americans and is recognized nationally for his leadership on issues such as coverage of those who suffer from mental illness.  To put the agenda of the Senate in perspective for a moment, because the Senator raises an important question about 40 million Americans who have no health insurance, and many who are underinsured today, and the fact that this Congress refuses to even debate the issue or discuss the issue when we reach out for a good program that Senator Kennedy, Senator Wellstone, and I supported to extend health insurance coverage to children of working families in many States, and reaching out in other areas, but we seem to be reluctant to address what most American families have to address every single day--the lack of security, and the lack of peace of mind when it comes to health insurance--I would like the Senator from Minnesota to comment on the fact that we are in possibly one of the greatest periods of prosperity in the history of the United States. We are talking about surpluses under the budget that may reach $2 trillion. The only suggestion from the Republican side of the aisle is that we should use $1 trillion of the surplus--almost half the surplus--to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America rather than addressing working families who are uninsured and people who are looking for the peace of mind by having some protection when it comes to basic health care.  Will the Senator from Minnesota reflect on what we have done on the floor of the Senate over the last 2 weeks in the context of what I consider the high priority he has raised?
