Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), who chaired the special committee on election reform and held hearings all over this country and heard from literally hundreds of citizens on the issues confronting them at election time. ``Revitalizing Our Nation's Election System'' is a report issued by the Waters Commission, which was extraordinarily helpful to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and me in bringing this legislation to fruition. I thank her for that. I thank her for the contributions she has made. I am honored to serve with her.
