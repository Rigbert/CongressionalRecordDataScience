President, last Thursday, September 6, after less than 12 hours of debate, the Senate passed by a vote of 81 to 12 the fiscal year 2008 State, Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I think it was the shortest amount of time we have taken to debate and pass this bill. I also think that on the whole we can be satisfied with the outcome. It is a bipartisan bill, and while neither I nor Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the subcommittee who played an indispensable role in getting it done, supports every provision in the bill, that is the nature of the process.  I also know there are things in this bill the administration supports and things they don't like. I would remind them that our allocation was $700 million below the President's budget, and the President underfunded a number of programs that have strong bipartisan support--the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and malaria, to give one example. I would hope the White House would recognize that we tried hard to fund not only the President's priorities but also the requests of Senators of both parties. This is, as sometimes the White House needs to be reminded, a government of equal branches.  Senate conferees were named immediately after final passage, and I look forward to sitting down with the House to finish this bill so we can send it to the President for signature as soon as possible.  Mr. President, the last vote on the State, Foreign Operations bill did not occur until late at night, and Senators were anxious to go home. I want to take this opportunity to again thank Senator Gregg and his staff, Paul Grove, minority clerk for the subcommittee, whose good humor and penchant for thoroughness and bipartisanship have served the committee extremely well. I also want to thank Michele Wymer, who joined the subcommittee's minority staff this year. Michele has been a pleasure to work with. She did a superb job last week on the floor keeping track of the flurry of amendments.  On the majority side, I want to thank Kate Eltrich, who for the past 5 years has handled the State Department Operations appropriations. Kate's budgetary skills, dating from her time at OMB during the Clinton administration, are a great asset to the subcommittee. She has done an excellent job and is someone whose judgment I have great confidence in. Nikole Manatt joined the subcommittee staff earlier this year, and she has already distinguished herself as energetic, willing and capable of taking on any project, and is a pleasure to work with. J.P. Dowd, my legislative director, spent most of last Thursday on the Senate floor helping out in more ways than I can count. I want to thank Tim Rieser, the majority clerk, who has worked for the Senate for 22 years, either as a staff member in my office or, since 1989, for the Appropriations Committee. Tim was my lead staff member on this bill. Tim and Paul Grove have worked together to draft these bills year after year, and to deal with the amendments on the floor. Last Thursday, we disposed of 73 amendments. That is no small feat, and the staff deserves our thanks for the long hours and hard work that made it possible.  Among the other Appropriations Committee staff whose contributions to this process were indispensable are Richard Larson and his outstanding staff in Editorial and Printing, and chief clerk Bob Putnam and Jack Conway, who make sure our numbers add up as they are supposed to.  The funds in this bill support lifesaving programs for the poorest people in Africa. They help protect the economic and security interests of this country and our allies from South America to South Asia. In a world as complex and dangerous as this, we should be doing far more to exert U.S. leadership, particularly in countries and regions plagued by poverty, injustice, and conflict or where the United States is regarded unfavorably or misunderstood. We have done our bestwith what we have to spend, and if used wisely, the funds in this bill will advance U.S. interests and improve the lives of countless people less fortunate than we are.                          ____________________
