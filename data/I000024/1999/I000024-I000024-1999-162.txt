 Here is the problem: I appreciate the voluntary aspect of it; unfortunately, the voluntary aspect of this only funds about 5 percent, and about 95 percent is public funds, for which we are responsible.  Before the esteemed chairman of the committee arrived, I talked about how strapped we are. I believe the bill we are debating today is inadequate in terms of proper funding, but it is the best we can do, so we support it.  I can think of military construction projects right now that would love to have a little extra funding, and it does relate to our security interests.  I am happy to work with the Senator from Colorado on any kind of a compromise that will give oversight of the CAP to the Air Force so that they will have some degree of control.  If 95 percent of the funding of the CAP is taxpayers' dollars, the taxpayers have to have some degree of control. We have a lot of other anecdotal accusations. I don't want to get into that. Things like this are going on and things like this will continue to go on in any entity in society that doesn't have any oversight. I can cite some examples in another committee. We served on the Environment and Public Works Committee where one of the agencies has had no oversight over the past 5 or 6 years and was getting out of hand. They have to have oversight. Those people are dealing with public funds and the public has to have oversight.  My concern is what will happen if we don't do this. If we don't do this, as I suggested, the Secretarys of the Air Force may decide to sever relations, and then we really have a serious problem with CAP. I think there is not a person in here who is not a strong supporter of the CAP --certainly these three Senators are among the strongest. We are attempting to save it.
