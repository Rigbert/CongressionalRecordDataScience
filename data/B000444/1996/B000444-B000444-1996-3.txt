 President, in this time of two worker households, working parents are increasingly faced with the difficult task of balancing work and family.  Every day in this country, families must find a way to meet the challenges that await them at home after a long day on the job. Some days it seems impossible to maintain a career while trying to figure out a way to get the shopping done, put dinner on the table and pick up the kids at soccer practice.  That is why today, Mr. President, I am proud to stand here to announce that Delaware companies are taking the lead and making it easier for working parents to balance their careers and families.  One particular company, MBNA America, which is based in Wilmington, DE, was recently honored as one of the top 10 family-friendly companies by Working Mother magazine.  This is the second straight year that MBNA has been named as one of the top ten companies for working mothers and the fifth straight year that it has been named in the top 100.  Also, in the September 16 issue of Business Week, MBNA was named as one of the top 10 businesses in terms of their work and family strategies. This is the first time that Business Week has rated companies for their family friendly practices, and it shows that businesses are most successful if they take their work and family strategies seriously.  Speaking about MBNA, Business Week stated that ``the bank won the highest grades from employees, who cited strong programs and job flexibility.''  MBNA is to be commended for instituting policies and programs that are sensitive to the realities of two income families.  For example, MBNA offers three on-site day care centers that serve MBNA employees. I have had the opportunity to visit one of the two centers that are in Delaware, and I cannot stress enough what a benefit it is for workers to be able to take advantage of these day care centers. In Delaware, these centers give the parents of around 400 children the peace of mind that their child is in good hands.  Also last year, 109 men and 264 women took advantage of childbirth leave of absences that averaged 13 weeks. This is a wonderful opportunity for parents to be there for those precious first weeks of their child's life.  Another important benefit that is offered by the company is adoption assistance of up to $5,000. This allows employees to provide a stable home and family to a child who needs that love and stability so badly. Just another way that companies can help build strong families.  Employees can take advantage of $849,000 in company-sponsored college scholarships that allow those who wish to better themselves the opportunity to do so. After all, education is the greatest investment this country can make.  Working Mother magazine also applauded MBNA for having flexible work hours by utilizing job-sharing strategies and compressed work weeks.  And, the study showed that women account for a high percentage of executive positions at MBNA. Women make up 39 percent of vice presidents at MBNA and 16 percent of all senior executives are women.  Besides MBNA, two other Delaware companies were honored recently as family friendly companies. DuPont and DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical were named as two of the top one hundred companies by Working Mother magazine for their leadership in creating job strategies that are sensitive toward families. DuPont was also named in Business Week's top10n list, and other companies with facilities in Delaware, such as Hewlett-Packard and Nations Bank, have been praised for their family oriented policies.  Mr. President, these work strategies that take into account everyday family life do not just benefit the employees, but also the employer. There is little doubt that recruitment, retention, morale, and therefore productivity all increase when companies implement family-friendly policies.  I am proud that MBNA and other Delaware companies have emerged as leaders in creating family work strategies, and I hope that this trend continues throughout Delaware and throughout the country.                           ____________________
