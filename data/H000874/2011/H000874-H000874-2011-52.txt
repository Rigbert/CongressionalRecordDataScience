I continue to have the strongest faith in the American worker, that they are the most talented and most productive in the world. We should not be rolling back their protections. Instead, we should focus on helping to get more Americans back to work.  And as for the NLRB, the real trauma is it is now a pro-worker and employer NLRB, as opposed to simply a pro-employer NLRB. That's the problem you have.  The courts ought to ensure equal treatment. The NLRB ought to ensure equal treatment. It has not been doing that for some period of time; and now, in my view, it is. God bless them. That's what they should do.  Employers and employees ought to get a fair shake and a fair election, and I agree with that premise. Timing is obviously of concern to both parties. I would hope we would defeat this bill, and then if we want to talk about assuring elections, let us do so to protect democracy and protect workers.
