 President, my amendment would make statutory changes to the Defense Conversion Loan Guarantee Program authorized last year. These revisions are necessary to optimize the program's task of providing financial and technical assistance to small, defense-dependent firms adversely impacted by defense downsizing.  The Defense Conversion Loan Guarantee Program is a joint Small Business Administration/Department of Defense program which provides loan guarantees and technical assistance to small firms adversely affected by defense reductions. This program would provide SBA guaranteed businesses and communities adversely affected by defense downsizing and base closures.  In order to fully maximize this important program, there are three areas in the existing law which need to be modified:  First, the portion of DOD funds used for salaries and expenses;  Second, the current restrictive eligibility requirements which limit the number of participants in the program; and  Third, the duration of the program.  My amendment would implement these statutory changes without requiring any new appropriation of funds.  In the wake of extensive U.S. Defense downsizing and military base closures, this program is both necessary and vital to helping small businesses retain the jobs of Defense workers and create new employment opportunities in communities affected by economic dislocation. I am pleased to offer this amendment and thank my colleagues for their support.     the defense department's financial management training program
