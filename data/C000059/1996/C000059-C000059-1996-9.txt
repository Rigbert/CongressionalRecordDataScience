Speaker, H.R. 1786 is the result of cooperative efforts of the Alaska Federation of Natives, the Bristol Bay Native Association, the Department of the Interior, and Resources Committee staff.  This bill is necessary to allow approximately 40 local residents of the Alaska Peninsula to harvest traditional red fish within the boundaries of Katmai National Park. Red fish is spawned out sockeye salmon which has traditional significance for the residents of this region. The harvest of redfish takes place from August to October each year. When Katmai National Park was designated in the 1930's, the local residents were prohibited from the taking of fish by traditional means. This bill would allow the local residents to again harvest this culturally significant red fish by traditional means.  I want to thank Bristol Bay Native Association, Department of the Interior, the Alaska Federation of Natives and staff for their work on this bill.  I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial bill.                             general leave
