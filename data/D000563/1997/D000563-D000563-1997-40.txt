President, I rise today to applaud Lithuania and Poland for their efforts in promoting peace and security in Central and Eastern Europe. This past weekend, Lithuania and Poland hosted an international conference in Vilnius on the subject of coexistence between nations and good neighborly relations. The conference brought together the leaders of 11 countries--Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania, Belarus, Finland, and Russia--to discuss practical ways to promoting peaceful relations among their peoples. Lithuania and Poland pointed to improvements in their own relationship as a model for other nations. I also commend President Clinton for recognizing the leadership of Lithuania and Poland on this issue, by sending the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs as the United States representative to the Vilnius conference.  In convening this conference, Lithuania and Poland stressed the essential connections between democratic institutions, free markets, and peace. Democratic institutions are founded on the values of tolerance and respect for individual and minority rights; values which promote good relations between neighbors. Free markets are providing the people of that region with unprecedented opportunities to improve their lives in material terms, giving them an incentive to put aside old animosities and differences. And of course, peace provides an environment in which democratic institutions and free markets can flourish. The work of the Vilnius conference advances majorAmerican foreign policy goals: security in the North Atlantic region and the expansion of democratic institutions and free markets.  Lithuania and Poland are meeting their responsibilities in the new Europe. They are leading the way in forging a new pattern of politics in Europe, as Secretary of State Albright called for during her trip to Lithuania last July. During her visit, Secretary Albright stated that any new members of NATO must be producers of security, not merely consumers. Mr. President, by reaching out to their neighbors--including Russia--Lithuania and Poland are showing themselves to be producers of security. They are, in short, excellent candidates for NATO membership. We in the Senate should do all we can to encourage Lithuania and Poland in their efforts to promote security in the North Atlantic region and to support their membership in NATO.                          ____________________
