Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, today we commence debate on H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015. This bill culminates a multiyear, multi-Congress effort to ensure that folks in Michigan and every corner of the country have access to affordable and reliable energy. It has been nearly a decade since we last considered a broad energy package and a lot--a lot--has changed.  Back then, the energy situation looked downright dire: declining domestic oil and natural gas output, increasing reliance on imports, and energy prices that seemed like they had nowhere to go but up. Remember 7 years ago they were $3.84 a gallon.Manufacturers were leaving and fleeing overseas in pursuit of cheaper energy.  But thankfully, because of breakthrough innovation, a little American ingenuity, and a lot of hard work, we are now experiencing game-changing energy abundance that has, in fact, redefined America's standing at home, as well as around the globe. Now Michigan and many parts of the country are enjoying a welcome manufacturing renaissance thanks to reliable and affordable energy. It is well past time that our laws rooted in energy scarcity caught up to our newfound 21st century reality.  The first order of business is to allow the private sector to expand the Nation's energy infrastructure. The Keystone XL pipeline is certainly one of the most well-known examples of energy infrastructure projects being delayed and ultimately denied, but it is far from the only one.  We have a Federal permitting process that is not designed to expeditiously handle the many projects necessary to bring online the Nation's growing energy output and to meet energy needs of homeowners and businesses. How can it be that in this century we can't get energy to consumers in some parts of the country? We need to fix that problem. This bill does that.  H.R. 8 has several useful provisions to make the approval process more timely for projects such as interstate natural gas pipelines, LNG export facilities, and new hydropower, which we discussed during a hearing with the FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, just today. And I would add that these streamlining provisions were done so in a manner that keeps the environmental and safety protections intact.  Perhaps the biggest changes brought on by our energy abundance are geopolitical. Where we once feared rising dependence on the likes of OPEC, now we can, in fact, control our energy destiny and use our new standing as an energy superpower to help our allies and friends around the world and engage in energy diplomacy. However, this is a new role for the U.S., and we don't have in place the means to act globally on energy policy yet. This bill changes that.  Using the Department of Energy's Quadrennial Energy Review as a guide, this bill begins the process of incorporating energy security and diplomacy considerations into the decisionmaking process. It also creates forums through which we can coordinate with our North American neighbors, as well as our allies and trading partners around the world, on energy policy.  Unfortunately, the energy news over the last decade hasn't been all that good. Cyber threats and electromagnetic pulses pose a growing and more sophisticated risk to the Nation's electricity system. We need new measures to better address these and other threats to the grid, and this bill, H.R. 8, has a number of important provisions.  I would add that while our energy abundance is a real blessing, it does not in any way reduce the importance of energy efficiency. H.R. 8 again includes a number of updates to energy efficiency policy, including measures to help the Federal Government use energy more wisely, as well as improvements to existing energy efficiency programs that have proven problematic.  A decade ago, no one, no one here, could have imagined where we would be in 2015 and how much the energy script would be flipped in our favor. It is a new day, but now that we are here, it is time to bring our energy policy in line with those new realities. It is time that we put the scarcity mindset in the rearview mirror and say yes to energy and yes to jobs.  I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Edward R. Royce,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Royce: Thank you for your assistance      regarding H.R. 8, North American Energy Security and      Infrastructure Act of 2015.       I appreciate your willingness to discharge the Committee on      Foreign Affairs from further consideration of H.R. 8 so that      it can proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I agree that      the Committee on Foreign Affairs does not waive jurisdiction      over the subject matter contained in this or any other      legislation.

I will place a copy of our exchange of letters on this      matter in the Congressional Record during floor consideration      of H.R. 8.       Thank you for your work and cooperation on H.R. 8.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and            Government Reform,                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2015.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 8, the North      American Energy Security     and Infrastructure Act of 2015. As you know, the Committee on      Energy and Commerce received an original referral and the      Committee on Oversight and Government Reform a secondary      referral when the bill was introduced on September 16, 2015.      I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this      legislation before the House of Representatives in an      expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on      Oversight and Government Reform will forego committee action      on the bill.       The Committee takes this action with our mutual      understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 8 at      this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject      matter contained in this or similar legislation.      Specifically, the Oversight Committee's jurisdiction is      primarily triggered by provisions in the bill related to 5      U.S.C. 552, known as the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I      appreciate that our committees have had fruitful discussions      regarding these provisions and have come to an agreement      related to section 4122 of the reported bill. Negotiations      regarding sections 1104, 1105, and 1106, the application of      FOIA as it relates to critical electric infrastructure      security, the Strategic Transformer Reserve and Cyber Sense,      are currently ongoing. I have full confidence that our      committees will arrive at a mutually agreeable compromise,      which respects the Oversight Committee's interest in      narrowing FOIA exemptions, prior to floor consideration of      the bill.       I request your support for the appointment of conferees      from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during      any House-Senate conference convened on this or related      legislation. Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange      of letters on this matter be included in the bill report      filed by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, as well as in      the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to      memorialize our understanding           Sincerely,                                                   Jason Chaffetz,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2015.     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Chaffetz: Thank you for your assistance      regarding H.R. 8, North American Energy Security and      Infrastructure Act of 2015. I appreciate your willingness to      forego action on the bill in the Committee on Oversight and      Government Reform.       I agree that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 8 at this      time, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform does      not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained      in this or similar legislation. I am confident that our      committees will arrive at a mutually agreeable compromise on      the ongoing negotiations between our committees prior to      floor consideration of the bill.       I will support your request for the appointment of      conferees from the Committee on Oversight and Government      Reform during any House-Senate conference convened on this or      related legislation. In addition, I will include a copy of      our exchange of letters on this matter in the Congressional      Record during floor consideration of H.R. 8           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives,               Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,                                Washington, DC, November 24, 2015.

I request you urge the Speaker to name      members of the Committee to any conference committee named to      consider such provisions.       Please place a copy of this letter and your response      acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the      Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on      the House Floor.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Shuster,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                Washington, DC, November 24, 2015.
