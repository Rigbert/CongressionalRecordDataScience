Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in behalf of this resolution. On our side of the aisle, we know Howard Baker to be a partisan Republican, but he was much more and is much more than that. He was appropriately, as a leader in his party, partisan when partisanship was called for. But he was, as the gentleman from Tennessee has said, an American first, not only a great leader in his own right but the son-in-law of a great Republican leader as well, Everett Dirksen.  Howard Baker is the kind of politician that America needs. In a time when we tend to yell and scream at one another, in a time when we tend to try to embarrass one another and show one another up, Howard Baker is an example of the best of public service.  Howard Baker revered the U.S. Senate, and in his career brought luster to that institution as well as to his own name, because Howard Baker understood that Americans expected us and expect us still to work together, recognizing our differences but recognizing that consensus in the final analysis is the way we make progress.  Therefore, as a member of the other party, if you will, but a friend of Howard Baker, and not only that, an admirer of Howard Baker, and an admirer of that for which he stood as a public servant, I gladly, on behalf of my party as well as on behalf of the Democratic side of the aisle and the committee, rise in support of this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
