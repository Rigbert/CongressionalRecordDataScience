President, it is very clear from Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina that America is now learning how to be prepared for disasters. Many more positive things happened as a result of the threat of Hurricane Rita than happened just a few weeks before in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. We now know that it is not a question of pointing the finger of blame, but those of us in leadership in Washington need to get to the bottom of this--not so we can decide who was wrong in days gone by but, frankly, to make sure this doesn't happen again.
