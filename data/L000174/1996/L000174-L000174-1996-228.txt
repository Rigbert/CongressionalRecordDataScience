These are not provisions that cover alien terrorists. It is safe to say that there is not a single Member of this body who wants to allow alien terrorists into our midst. That is not a partisan issue; every single Member of this body is against terrorists. We can accept that as a point of fact.  There are a number of other provisions in the antiterrorism law that the President signed last week that cover the exclusion of those affiliated with foreign terrorist organizations. They forbid the grant of asylum to alien terrorists.  We are not seeking to defend alien smuggling or false documentation used for that purpose. That is already a crime. Senators DeWine, Hatfield, Kerry, and I totally agree on that.  But we know that there are some circumstances and there are some oppressive regimes in the world from which escape may well entail the use of false papers. We want to make sure that we do not create barriers to true refugees and those deserving asylum, and prevent them from making an application for asylum.  Let me give an example, using first a hypothetical and then go to some real examples. You are in a country with an oppressive regime. You are in a country where you are being persecuted for your religious beliefs or your political beliefs. In fact, you may even face death for your religious beliefs or your belief in democracy. You know that the arm of that government is out to get you. These are not cases of just paranoia; they may already have gone and killed members of your family for similar beliefs. You look at the one great beacon of freedom: the United States of America. You figure, ``How do I get there?''  Now, you are facing the possibility of a death penalty for your religious beliefs. Do you think you could walk down to the government that is out to kill you for those religious beliefs and say, ``Could I please have a passport? Here is my name and address. And, by the way, I want to book passage, I want a visa and I want to go directly to the United States.''  We all know what would happen in a case like that. The realty of the situation is that people in those circumstances are probably going to get a forged or a false passport. They are not going to go on a flight that will go directly to the United States because that is something the government may be watching. They are going to go to another country--maybe a neighboring country, maybe two or three countries--and then make it to the United States.  Under the immigration law that is before us, once they got here, because they used false passports and went through other countries, they are probably going to be summarily sent back. Summarily being sent back is in an equal amount of time to the summary execution or imprisonment that they face when they arrive back in their home country.  Now, let us be realistic. The Justice Department does not want these provisions and has not requested them. They were not recommended by the Jordan Commission. The Department has told us that they want a type of standby authority in case of immigration emergency, similar to what I have proposed in this amendment.  Think of some of the history of this country. Fidel Castro's daughter came to this country and was granted asylum, for appropriate reasons, and, of course, with great political fanfare. But Fidel Castro's daughter did not fly directly to the United States with a passport bearing her name. She took a false passport, she went to Spain, and then came here. Under this new law, we would likely have said, ``Sorry, you are out.''  The most recent and famous example of why we must not adopt the summary exclusion provisions of this bill is, of course, the case of Fauziya Kasinga and her flight from Togo to avoid female genital mutilation. We first talked about that case here in the Senate a couple of weeks ago.  There have been two extremely positive developments since then. First, the INS filed a brief with the Board of Immigration Appeals, arguing--I believe for the first time--that the fear of female genital mutilation should present a sufficient cause to seek asylum in the United States.  I do not think there should have been any question about this. If there is any doubt, we should amend this bill or law without hesitation to ensure that flight from such practices are covered by our asylum policies, as the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] has already suggested.  Second, last Thursday, April 25, after more than a year in detention under conditions that subjected her to unnecessary hardship, Ms. Kasinga was finally released by INS to await determination by the Board on her asylum application.  Her case was first reported on the front page of the April 15 New York Times by Celia Dugger. Both she and her newspaper deserve a great deal of credit for bringing this to our attention.  Ms. Kasinga has sought for 2 years to find sanctuary in this country, only to be detained, tear-gassed, beaten, isolated and abused.  Well, now we all realize how bad this is. It is something that should outrage men and women alike. I believe it doesoutrage men and women in this country.  Unfortunately, one thing has not changed yet, that is the provision I am seeking to amend in this bill. The provisions in the bill would still summarily exclude Ms. Kasinga, and others like her, from ever making an asylum claim. She traveled through Germany on a false British passport in order to escape mutilation in Togo. Under the bill before us, she would be subjected to summary exclusion at the border without judicial review.  In fact, does anybody in this body believe that an immigration officer at her point of entry would, as a matter of first impression, have agreed with her claim that fear of female genital mutilation was a proper ground to seek asylum?  We should, instead, restore protections in our laws to protect her ability to get a fair opportunity to be heard.  On April 19, Anthony Lewis wrote a column for the New York Times that captured the essence of this issue. In his column, he notes, ``The asylum provisions effectively impose the absurd presumption that anyone who flees a country without proper papers is not a genuine refugee.'' As Mr. Lewis puts it, ``Political asylum is one saving grace in a world of too much political brutality. Why should Americans want to undermine the asylum concept?'' Indeed.  This is what has always distinguished the United States in our 200 years of constitutional history--200 years as a Nation protecting democracy and individual freedoms and rights more than any other country in existence. No wonder people seek asylum in the United States. No wonder people facing religious persecution, or political persecution, or physical persecution, look to the United States, knowing that we are the symbol of freedom. But that symbol would be tarnished if we were to close our doors.  Mr. President, in Mr. Lewis' column, he wrote: ``The Senate will in fact have another chance to consider the issue when it takes up the immigration bill.''  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Lewis' column be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Apr. 19, 1996]                           Slamming the Door                           (By Anthony Lewis)       Boston.--The case of 19-year-old Fauzlya Kasinga, who says      she fled her native Togo to avoid the rite of female genital      mutilation, has aroused much sympathy. She arrived at Newark      Airport in 1994, told officials she was using someone else's      passport, sought asylum, was turned down and has been held in      prison ever since. The Board of Immigration Appeals will hear      her appeal on May 2.       But in future we are not likely to know about desperate      people like Ms. Kasinga. If their pleas for asylum are turned      down by a low-level U.S. immigration officer, they will not      be allowed to appeal--and review by the courts will be      barred. They will be sent back at once to the land where they      face persecution.       This extraordinary change in our law is part of the      counter-terrorism bill awaiting President Clinton's      signature. It is not directed at terrorists. It applies to      anyone seeking asylum who arrives here with false documents      or none--the situation of many people fleeing persecution.       The issue raised in Fauzlya Kasinga's case, female genital      mutilation, is an important one: Does that cruel practice      come within the grounds for asylum? But the new summary      process of exclusion will affect many more people seeking      asylum for traditional reasons: the man fleeing a Nigerian      Government that executed his political colleagues, for      example, or the Vietnamese who escaped from a re-education      camp.       The asylum provisions effectively impose the absurd      presumption that anyone who flees a country without proper      papers is not a genuine refugee. By that test Fidel Castro's      daughter was not a true refugee because she fled Cuba with a      false passport. Nor were Jews who fled the Nazis without      papers.       Political refugees are not the only losers. The bill      trashes the American tradition of courts as the arbiters of      law and guarantors of freedom. I have seen a good deal of      nastiness in the work of Congress over the years, but I do      not remember such detailed and gratuitous cruelty.       The bill gives virtually final authority to immigration      officers at 300 ports of entry to this country. Each is      directed to interview people seeking asylum and exclude them      if he finds that they do not have ``a credible fear of      persection.'' That phrase is unknown to international law.       The officer's summary decision is subject only to      ``Immediate review by a supervisory office at the port.'' The      bill prohibits further administrative review, and it says,      ``no court shall have jurisdiction'' to review summary      denials of asylum or to hear any challenge to the new      process. (Our present system for handling asylum applications      works efficiently, so there is no administrative need for      change.)       Stripping away the protection of the courts may be the most      alarming feature of the legislation. It is reminiscent of the      period after the Civil War, when a Congress bent on punishing      the South took away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to      consider cases that radical Republicans thought the Court      would decide against their desires.       Political asylum is one saving grace in a world of too much      political brutality. Why should Americans want to undermine      the asylum concept? And why should a bill supposedly aimed at      terrorists be used as a vehicle to keep the victims of      official terrorism from finding refuge?       Why should senators as decent as Orrin Hatch, chairman of      the Judiciary Committee, stand still for such harshness? The      asylum restrictions originated in the House and were kept in      the bill by conferees, so the Senate was presented with a      fait accompli. A motion by Senator Patrick Leahy to send the      terrorism bill back to conference on that issue failed, 61 to      38.       President Clinton has been so eager for an anti-terrorism      bill that he is not likely to veto this one, over the asylum      sections any more than over the gutting of habeas corpus. But      he could call on Congress to reconsider the attack on      political asylum.       The Senate will in fact have another chance to consider the      issue when it takes up the immigration bill, which has in it      a similar provision for summary exclusion of asylum-seekers.      On reflection, Senator Hatch and other's should see the      threat to victims of persecution and to our tradition of law.
