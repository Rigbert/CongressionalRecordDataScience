 President, this morning the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 10:30. Under the agreement reached last night, at 10:30 the Senate will begin consideration of the supplemental appropriation for Iraq and Afghanistan security. The order provides for debate only until 12:30. We expect amendments to be offered during today's session and therefore rollcall votes will occur throughout the day.  Yesterday, after the Appropriations Committee finished its work on the legislation and reported the bill to the full Senate, the two leaders came to the floor to reach the agreement to begin consideration of the bill today. As stated last night in the colloquy, the Senate will consider amendments to the legislation this week. Following the recess, we will resume the bill with the expectation of completing all action by the end of that week.  As we begin the process, the leader is asking for the cooperation of all Members in advance and thanks everyone for their willingness to cooperate to try to push this bill through to completion the week after we return from the recess.                          ____________________
