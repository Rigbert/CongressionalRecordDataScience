President, I normally do not do movie reviews, but for this Thursday's premiere of ``The Exonerated'' on CourtTV, I feel compelled to make an exception. ``The Exonerated'' tells the harrowing true stories of six innocent people who were convicted and sentenced to death.  Since February 2000, I have worked to prevent more innocents from meeting the same fate, and last year the Innocence Protection Act was finally passed and signed into law. The reforms it enacts will create a fairer system of justice, where the problems that have sent innocent people to death row are less likely to occur, where the American people can be more certain that violent criminals are caught and convicted instead of the innocent people who have been wrongly put behind bars for their crimes, and where victims and their families can be more certain of the accuracy, and finality, of the results.  The film of ``The Exonerated'' was adapted from a play of the same title by Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen, which was performed last year at the Kennedy Center. Those who were unable to see the play will have the chance to watch the movie on CourtTV this Thursday, January 27, at 9 p.m.  Since 1973, some 117 innocent people have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence. Six of these stories are told in ``The Exonerated.'' While the Innocence Protection Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, the task before us remains getting the new law funded. Watching these true-life accounts will help explain why funding the Innocence Protection Act should be a high priority that Congress and the administration must not ignore.                          ____________________[Page S563]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                             THE EXONERATED
