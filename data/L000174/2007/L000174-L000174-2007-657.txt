I enjoyed being a prosecutor. But I also was well aware that we acted within checks and balances. Courts had their role, prosecutors had their role, defense attorneys had their role. It only worked when everybody did what they were supposed to, including the executive.  I was also a prosecutor and on the board of the National District Attorneys Association at the time of COINTELPRO, a program of spying on Americans who disagreed with the war in Vietnam, and even, we found out later, spying on Martin Luther King because he was speaking so radically as to suggest that we might actually want equality between people, no matter what their color might be, in this country.  Our Government was spying on people who objected to war. Our Government was spying on people who wanted integration in America. I don't want us to go back to that point.  I shudder to think what might have happened if J. Edgar Hoover had had all the electronic capabilities we have today. The only way we stop this--it makes no difference if we have a Democratic or Republican administration--the only way we stop it is with the checks and balances we have built in.  FISA and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court came about because of illegal spying on Americans who were not committing any unlawful act, but were simply questioning what their Government was doing. Many of usworry that has happened now. We have seen, for example, that the Department of Defense has had surveillance, has even recorded movies, of Quakers protesting war. Quakers always protest wars.  Madam President, I ask for 2 additional minutes, under the same agreement.
