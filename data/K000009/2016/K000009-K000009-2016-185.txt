Speaker, I rise today to recognize Michael Rubinger, President and CEO of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC).  Mr. Rubinger will be retiring from LISC later this month after 17 years as its creative and results driven CEO. During his tenure, LISC has grown into one of the largest and most well respected non-profits focusing on community and economic development in distressed neighborhoods throughout the country.  LISC equips struggling communities with the capital, strategy and technical expertise to make change imaginable. Working with local leaders, LISC invests in housing, health, education, public safety and employment--all basic needs that need to be addressed at the same time for communities to succeed.  Michael Rubinger was hired as a LISC program officer shortly after the establishment of the organization. He now completes his more than four decades of service to the organization and leaves in place a reliable, constructive, and innovative partner in community redevelopment made stronger by his stewardship and leadership and the lasting impact that his career has made on the community development field.  Among other notable achievements, Michael oversaw the development and implementation of LISC's Building Sustainable Communities initiative, a transformative approach to investing in communities which focuses on proving a comprehensive framework to meeting the needs of the community, including investments in housing, economic development, income and wealth building, education, health, and community safety.  LISC and hundreds of neighborhoods across the country are stronger because of Michael Rubinger's vision for healthy and robust communities. He knows the importance of hearing the voices of those in the community and of making sure that key local stakeholders come together to find common ground.  Michael is leaving LISC on a high note. 2015 was among the best years in LISC's history, including a record number of program and investment milestones, such as financing 21,000 affordable homes and apartments, opening its 80th Financial Opportunity Center in order to help residents build a more stable future, and establishing new partnerships nationwide. All of that contributed to LISC's $1.3 billion in program and investment activity for 2015, an amazing accomplishment.  I have seen firsthand his influence in Toledo, Ohio. His comprehensive approach to revitalization was evident when LISC opened its Toledo office in 1989. It was my honor to introduce LISC to Toledo back then, and I am proud to be associated with the organization that has helped distressed neighborhoods across Ohio.  With 16,000 Toledo homeowners unable to afford the cost of major exterior maintenance, Toledo LISC, the Toledo Fair Housing Center and the Lucas County Land Bank created the Martin Luther King, Jr. Inclusive Communities initiative to help those in need.  In 2015, nearly 150 families were provided with a complete roof and gutter replacement. The roof and gutter replacements have helped individual homeowners, who live at or below 120 percent AMI, to preserve their property while shoring up Toledo's housing stock overall.  These homeowners also participated in financial literacy and homeownership counseling workshops offered by two LISC-backedFinancial Opportunity Centers (FOCs). The FOCs provided counseling and education to 234 homeowners who applied under the program.  I am especially proud of Toledo LISC's work but also know that these efforts are not unique to Toledo--that similar stories have occurred in the 30-plus cities where LISC offices are located, as well as in the over 14,000 rural counties that LISC serves through its national rural program, Rural LISC.  It is with great admiration that I pay tribute to Michael Rubinger and to his legacy of service on behalf of low-income families and communities. His unwavering dedication to making communities better and more viable through economic development initiatives in hundreds of urban and rural areas should be commended.  I know my colleagues in the House of Representatives will join me in congratulating Michael Rubinger on his retirement and in thanking him for his noble choice to spend his most productive years in making America and her neighborhoods better for his efforts.                          ____________________
