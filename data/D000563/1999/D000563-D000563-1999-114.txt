President, I rise today in recognition of the tremendous economic contributions made by women business owners in Illinois and to recognize the work of the Women's Business Development Center, a woman's business training and technical assistance center that has assisted over 30,000 women in realizing their dreams of business ownership.  The newest statistics from the National Foundation for Women's Business Ownership confirm that women entrepreneurs now make up more than 38 percent of all business and continue to be the most dynamic, fastest growing sector of our Nation's economy. I am proud to tell you that there are now 384,700 women-owned businesses in Illinois, employing 1.5 million workers and generating $195 billion in annual sales, a growth of 139 percent in 7 years.  Women business owners in Illinois area vibrant sector of our State economy and strong advocates for women's business ownership nationwide. Recently one of Illinois's own, Sheila G. Talton, president and CEO of Unisource Network Services, Inc., headquartered in Chicago, was appointed to serve on the National Women's Business Council. Unisource Network Services provides network interrogation consulting, including voice, data and multimedia consulting. Ms. Talton, who has 20 years of experience in the information systems and telecommunications field, formed the company in 1986 and sales are projected at $17 million this fiscal year. The company services an elite class of Fortune 500 companies, major educational and health care institutions and public agencies.  Unisource Network Services exemplifies the type of high-growth business that is attractive to investors in Illinois and around the country. In fact, Ms. Talton financed the growth of her technology company with venture capital investments. Unfortunately her story is usual; I'm told that most women entrepreneurs are having difficulties raising the capital they need to take their technology-based companies to the next level. Though women are starting high-growth business at unprecedented rates, they currently access less than 5 percent of all venture capital investments.  Mr. President, the strength of the economy of Illinois and the Nation depends upon the success of enterprises like Unisource. The opportunities to launch and grow businesses and the demand for training and capital have never been greater. In order for these new businesses to flourish, we must ensure that their access to capital and markets is unimpeded and that they have information and resources they need to compete at the speed of the Internet.                          ____________________
