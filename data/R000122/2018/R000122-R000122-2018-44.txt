President, the Reed amendment would name a fellowship program on behalf of Senator John McCain. I can't think of anything more fitting, in addition to the naming of this bill, than naming this fellowship program on behalf of Senator McCain.  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in voting unanimously for Senator McCain's fellowship program.  Thank you.
