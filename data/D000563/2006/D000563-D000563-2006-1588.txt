President, I thank the Senator from Delaware.  I wish to add, we brought up this whole issue of this secret list last week, and Senator Specter came to the floor and he said he believes for a variety of reasons he cannot tell us, cannot disclose to the public, the contributors, the businesses that will contribute to this fund and how much they are going to be asked to give. So we are dealing with an amount, $140 billion, that many people question. Serious groups have analyzed it and said it is not nearly enough. And when it comes to the contributions from businesses to create the fund, we are dealing with a secret list.  This may be the first time in the history of the Senate we have spoken on the floor openly about how things are determined. Apparently this one company that has been mentioned on the floor created a list of businesses and decided how much, under the criteria, they would be paying in.
