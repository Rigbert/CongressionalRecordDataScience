 In the interim before they appear, I wanted to just make a couple of budget points, at least as I understand them.  The committee, I believe the Appropriations Committee as well, has the INS-anticipated budget numbers--Senator Kennedy referred to them--that the total cost to implement the bill, according to the INS, is $3,132,307,000. The amount of the first year's cost is $1.187 billion. There is $743 million additional in the President's budget, which leaves a net deficit of $187,959,000.  Of the $40 billion we appropriated after the 9-11 attacks, $20 billion to New York City and $20 billion for discretionary funding, it is my understanding the administration has allocated all but $327 million of that $10 billion. I don't know whether that money is available to be put into this program. We certainly will look and determine that.  I agree with those in the Senate who believe homeland defense is extraordinarily important; that this asymmetrical warfare we are engaged in is going to last a substantial period of time, perhaps a decade or more; and that when we took this oath of office, we ought not only uphold the Constitution but also protect and defend our people. Therefore, if we are really to carry this out, this becomes a very high priority item.  I am hopeful the money will be appropriated. I believe it will. There is now a commitment on both sides of the aisle to do so. It is going to take much more money than we even recognize at the present time, but I believe the American people want us to do that. Therefore, we certainly should.  I don't see any of the other Senators in the Chamber at this time. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter by Bruce Josten on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supporting the bill.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    March 1, 2002.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of      Commerce, I would like to urge you to bring to the floor as      soon as possible the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry      Reform Act of 2001 (H.R. 3525/S. 1749). As you know, the      Chamber and its members have been long concerned about the      security and efficiency of our borders for commerce and      travel. We believe this legislation goes a long way toward      achieving those goals and is particularly necessary following      the tragic events of September 11. The legislation has broad      bipartisan support, and already passed the U.S. House of      Representatives by voice vote on December 19, 2001.       This legislation takes a careful and reasoned approach to      the issue of border security, and we strongly support the      provisions to increase resources for technology and personnel      for our Immigration and Customs Services, enhance data      sharing capabilities expand pre-clearance and pre-inspection      programs, and direct Federal agencies to work with our NAFTA      partners to ensure our joint security while enhancing the      flow of legitimate commerce and travel across shared borders.      These changes are long overdue.       While we understand that Congress must provide adequate      funding if the ambitious deadlines set forth in the      legislation are to be met, further delay in this legislation      will only postpone the needed reforms that can provide both      security and efficiency to our inspections processes. Such      changes will allow business to look to the future of cross-     border travel and trade with some sense of stability.       We look forward to working with you to secure passage of      this legislation, and working with the Congress and the      Administration on its implementation.           Sincerely,                                                  R. Bruce Josten.
