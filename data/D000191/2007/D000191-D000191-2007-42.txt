Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  The President is not reading in full the War Powers Act. It says the President's constitutional powers ``are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.''  My amendment actually allows that exact language. If our troops are attacked, if we are attacked, if our territories are attacked, then the President could retaliate. So I am restating the war powers.  In this case we also heard about a declaration of war from the gentlewoman from Nevada. The Congress has the authority to take up a declaration of war tonight, tomorrow, anytime it deems fit against Iran. Nothing in this amendment would prevent a Congress from declaring war.  It is just saying if you want to have a preemptive war under the Constitution of the United States, a preventive war, then you need to come to Congress under article I, section 8.  If you believe in the Constitution of the United States and the powers of this branch, vote for this amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
