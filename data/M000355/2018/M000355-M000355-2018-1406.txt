 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 2:30 p.m., Tuesday, May 8; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the Engelhardt nomination; finally, that all time during recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks count postcloture on the Engelhardt nomination.
