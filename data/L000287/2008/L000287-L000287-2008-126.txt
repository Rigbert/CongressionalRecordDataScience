Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Atlanta's greatest icons. A humble man who loved his job and worked hard to be the best he could be, Erby Walker became one of downtown Atlanta's most beloved figures. Presidents, celebrities, athletes and Atlantans alike came to know Erby Walker as the heart and soul of the Varsity, Atlanta's most famous drive-in diner and a downtown landmark.  Erby Walker started his career at the Varsity in 1952 sweeping up after customers at the tender age of 15.  Back then the diner was segregated--whites worked the counter, blacks worked in the back--but in 1964 the diner was integrated and Erby Walker was promoted to the counter, the first black man to work there. And work he did. He worked so hard that the owners of the Varsity sent Erby and his family to Disney World, all expenses paid--twice. He received awards, honors and recognitions--he was even inducted into the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau Hospitality Hall of Fame.  It was Erby who first asked, ``What'll ya have?''--a question still asked today when customers approach the counter and just one of the many phrases Erby coined as he shaped the Varsity into a place as famous for its unique vernacular as for its food.  Over the years, I have brought many friends to the Varsity. When I brought former President Clinton, Erby greeted him warmly, saying, ``What'll ya have, Mr. President?''  Erby Walker loved his job; he loved the Varsity and, most of all, he loved Atlanta and the thousands of customers she brought to hiscounter every day. Madam Speaker, Erby Walker was an Atlanta icon and his service to his community must not be forgotten.                          ____________________
