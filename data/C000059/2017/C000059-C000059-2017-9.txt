 EPA has been directed by the President to take a second look at the methane rule promulgated by the Obama administration. In conjunction with a review, EPA has attempted to provide the regulated community with some certainty by postponing some of the implementation dates; however, the courts have blocked that from happening.  In light of these challenges, the time may be right for a temporary pause on the enforcement of those requirements, so I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time until closing.
