 President, everybody wishes to vote. The majority leader and I have a central disagreement here as to what has been said on the floor of the Senate. We will still be on this bill next week. It will be an opportunity to continue the conversation and, hopefully, get the kind of process that will allow all Senators to participate on the No. 1 issue in America.
