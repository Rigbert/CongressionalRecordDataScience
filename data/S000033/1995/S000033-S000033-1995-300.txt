  Mr. Speaker, what a terrible rule. Cutbacks for heating programs for low income, for senior citizens, cutbacks in education, cutbacks for veterans, cutbacks for WIC. But we are not allowed to discuss cutbacks in corporate welfare, cutbacks in military spending.  Let us vote this rule down and develop a fair system of priorities for this country.
