 Kelly and Ricky Klein own Groennfell Meadery in Colchester, VT. In fact, this is Kelly with her very pretty little daughter, Nora.  Groennfell Meadery is part of a growing industry in Vermont. We are a small State. We have the most craft breweries per capita in the Nation, and they create jobs. They support small businesses. They bring people to Vermont from all over the country. Business has been good. Kelly and Ricky have been planning an expansion. Recently, they were approved for a $1.3 million Small Business Administration loan. They were going to buy three new stainless steel fermenter tanks. They were going to move to a bigger facility, double their production, hire additional people, and bought additional supplies in anticipation of it. What happened? Their loan from the SBA is now on hold because of the Trump shutdown. It is not clear if it will ever come through. So instead of expanding, they have to use their own money. They have to use their stockpiles of mead. They have to take out a loan to make payroll. They are really hurting, but they told me one thing, even in this difficult time.  Even in this difficult time, they said they were more concerned for people who have lost paychecks and lifesaving benefits and with others in their industry who have been harder hit. It is a sense of community and empathy. I wish President Trump had that same sense of empathy and caring that they do.  We have to end this shutdown. I call on the majority leader--the Republican leader--to bring up the bills, which we have already passed by an overwhelming majority, that would reopen this government. Democrats and Republicans have voted for them. All we need is for the Republican leader to bring them up.  Stop the shutdown. Let people go back to their businesses.  I yield the floor.
