 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Stuart Taylor, Jr. of the National Journal, has been among the more insightful and persuasive voices emerging against the so-called reformers' campaign finance effort.  In the January 1, 2000 edition of that publication, in a piece entitled The Media Should Beware of What it Embraces, Mr. Taylor cautions the media to reconsider its hypocrisy in so zealously attacking the first amendment freedom of every other participant in the political process.  This is especially significant because at one point not long ago, Mr. Taylor had advocated banning party soft money.  I ask unanimous consent that this article by Mr. Taylor and an article by Michael Barone, which ran in U.S. News, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the National Journal, Jan. 1, 2000]              The Media Should Beware of What It Embraces                        (By Stuart Taylor, Jr.)       The uncritical enthusiasm of most media organizations for      abolishing ``soft money'' and restricting issue advertising      by ``special interests'' prompts this thought: How would the      networks and The New York Times like a law imposing strict      limits on their own rights to editorialize about candidates?      After all, if some of their favored proposals were to be      enacted, the media would be the only major interest still      enjoying unrestricted freedom of political speech.       A few liberal legal scholars have proposed such laws as a      long-term component of any     ``reform'' aimed at purging the influence of private money      and promoting true political equality. Associate Professor      Richard L. Hasen of Loyola University Law School (Los      Angeles) put it this way in the June issue of the Texas Law      Review:       ``If we are truly committed to equalizing the influence of      money on elections, how do we treat the press? Principles of      political equality could dictate that a Bill Gates should not      be permitted to spend unlimited sums in support of a      candidate. But different rules [now] apply to Rupert Murdoch      just because he has channeled his money through media outlets      that he owns. . . . The principle of political equality means      that the press too should be regulated when it editorializes      for or against candidates.''       Far-fetched? Politically impossible? Blatantly      unconstitutional?       Perhaps. But I'm not the only one worried about the lack of      a stopping point on the slippery slope that runs from such      seemingly modest proposals as the McCain-Feingold bill to the      notion of censoring New York Times editorials. Listen to      former acting Solicitor General (and former Deputy White      House Counsel) Walter Dellinger, the most widely respected      constitutional expert to come out of the Clinton      Administration:       ``I've been struck by how shallow the thought has been      about whether McCain-Feingold is a good idea. There's a      credible argument that political parties may be the least bad      place for monies to be funneled, and yet that's where money      would be limited.       ``[And] it's odd to see the press clamoring for restricting      independent spending on campaigns by everybody other than the      media. Even assuming that it would be desirable to say to one      individual or group that you may not spend more than X      dollars for television ads--while allowing another individual      to buy a television network and spend as much as he wishes      promoting a candidate or a party--it may be impossible under      the First Amendment to restrict the `media,' and it may be      technically impossible in the age of the Internet to draw      lines between the `media' and everyone else.''       Part of Dellinger's point is what more-conservative critics      of campaign finance restrictions stress: that each      incremental step advocated by us reformers would create new      problems and new inequities, fueling demands for more and      more sweeping restrictions on political speech.       I say ``us reformers'' because I have been among the      advocates of banning unlimited gifts of soft money to the      political parties. (See NJ, 9/11/99, p. 2535.) But while John      McCain and Bill Bradley have been riding a wave of media      acclaim for pushing various reforms, I've been having second      thoughts.       Banning soft money has considerable attraction because it      would stop corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals from      giving political parties the huge gifts that emit such a      strong stench of corruption, or at least of influence-     peddling.       But unless accompanied by a major increase in the caps on      individual contributions of ``hard money''--which most      campaign finance reformers vehemently oppose--a soft-money      ban could muffle the voices of the parties and their      candidates while magnifying the influence of the independent      groups (``special interests'') that have already come to      dominate some election campaigns. These include ideologically      based groups ranging from the National Right to Life      Committee on the right to the Sierra Club on the left.       Would it make sense to shift power from broad-based      political parties to ideologically driven interest groups      that are relatively unknown to the electorate? Dellinger      thinks not: ``It wasn't a political party that did the Willie      Horton ad. It was an independent expenditure group. . . .      They are free to do drive-by political character      assassinations without political accountability.''       In part for this reason--and in part because of the simple      urge to quiet their critics--many members of Congress insist      that any soft-money ban be coupled with restrictions on fund      raising by independent groups that use issue ads to influence      elections.       The House-passed Shays-Meehan bill would restrict fund      raising by such independent groups. And while those      restrictions have been stripped from the Senate bill (McCain-     Feingold) in order to pick up more votes for the effort to      abolish soft money, most reformers see that move as only a      temporary, tactical concession.       A further complication is the likelihood that the current      Supreme Court majority would strike down the Shays-Meehan      restrictions on independent groups, even it if upheld the      provision abolishing soft money. The reason is that the      danger of corruption that has persuaded the Justices to      uphold caps on hard-money contributions to candidates (and      that might persuade them to uphold a ban on soft-money      contributions to parties) seems far more remote when      independent groups are raising and spending the money.       Indeed, the urge of many reformers to restrict independent      groups has less to do with preventing corruption than with      equalizing the political clout of all citizens by reducing      that of people (and groups) with money. And that goal clashes      with the Court's crucial holding in 1976, in Buckley vs.      Valeo, that ``the concept that government may restrict the      speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance      the relative voices of others is wholly foreign to the First      Amendment.''       Suppose, however, that Congress does eventually abolish      soft money and tightly restrict issue ads and that the      Supreme Court goes along--and thereby abandons its First      Amendment ruling in Buckley. One result would be to weaken      the political parties and the independent groups alike by      restricting their fund raising.       Another result, liberal and conservative scholars agree,      would be to enlarge greatly the power of the big media      companies, because they would be the only major organizations      still free to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to      amplify their speech about political campaigns. A.J.      Liebling's line--``freedom of the press is guaranteed only to      those who own one''--would become truer than he ever      imagined. In such an environment, what justification would      remain for continuing to exempt the institutional media from      the pervasive regulation of everyone else?       Would the media be protected by their image of themselves      as disinterested, politically neutral guardians of democracy?      Hardly. The public is already properly skeptical of the      accuracy and fairness of the big media companies. Many of      them are already owned by commercial conglomerates, such as      General Electric (which owns NBC and half of MSNBC), Disney      (which owns ABC), and Rupert Murdoch's empire (which owns the      Fox network, The New York Post, The Weekly Standard, and      more). Many are even big soft-money donors.       And a media monopoly on freedom of political speech would      enhance the already considerable incentives for monied      interests seeking political clout to go into the media      business.       Could the media count on the Supreme Court to strike down      any congressional restrictions on their rights to      editorialize? Dellinger believes so. I'm a bit less      confident. For if we ever reach that point, Buckley vs. Valeo      will already be dead, the First Amendment will be      unrecognizable, and political speech will no longer be deemed      a fundamental freedom, but rather a privilege to be rationed.       In such a ``post-Buckley era,'' Hasen enthuses, ``op-ed      pieces or commentaries expressly advocating the election or      defeat of a candidate for federal office could no longer be      directly paid for by the media corporation's funds. Instead,      they would have to be paid for either by an individual (such      as the CEO of the media corporation) or by a PAC set up by      the media corporation for this purpose. The media corporation      should be required to charge the CEO or the PAC the same      rates that other advertising customers pay for space on the      op-ed page.''       This scenario seems very remote now. But it suggest some      questions that we should ask ourselves before jumping aboard      the campaign finance reform bandwagon: How far do we want to      go? Is there a good place to stop? Who will be at the      controls? And will we be any happier in the end that the      campaign finance reformers of 1974 have been with the system      they helped create?                                  ____                    [From U.S. News, Nov. 15, 1999]                       Money Talks, as It Should                          (By Michael Barone)       ``How a company lets its cash talk,'' read the headline in      the New York Times last month. The article tells of the      success of Samuel Heyman, chairman of GAF Corp., in lobbying      for a bill to change rules for asbestos lawsuits. The article      sets out how much money Heyman, his wife, and GAF's political      action committee have contributed to politicians and both      parties, and the reader is invited to conclude that this      billionaire and his company are purchasing legislation that      will benefit them. Money buys legislation, which equals      corruption: It is the theme articulated by John McCain in the      Senate last month and on the campaign trail; it was the      premise of questions asked at the Hanover, N.H., candidates'      forum and taken for granted by Al Gore and Bill Bradley in      their responses; it is the mantra of countless editorial      writers and of Elizabeth Drew in her book The Corruption of      American Politics.       But is it true? Careful readers of the Times's ``cash      talks'' story can find plenty of support for another      conclusion: ``Strong arguments talk.'' For 25 years, asbestos      lawsuits have transferred billions of dollars from companies      that once manufactured asbestos (it was banned in the 1970s)      to workers exposed to asbestos and their lawyers. Asbestos      causes sickness in some but by no means all workers many      years after exposure. But most claimants who have recovered      money are not sick and may never be, while those who are sick      must often wait years for claims to be settled. The biggest      winners in the current system are a handful of trial lawyers      who take contingent fees of up to 40 percent and have made      literally billions of dollars.       Heyman's proposal, altered somewhat by a proposed House      compromise, would stop nonsick plaintiffs from getting any      money, while setting up an administrative system to determine      which plaintiffs are sick and to offer them quick settlements      based on previous recoveries. The statute of limitations      would be tolled, which means that nonsick plaintiffs could      recover whenever signs of sickness appear. Sick plaintiffs      would get more money more quickly, while companies would be      less likely to go bankrupt; 15 asbestos firms are bankrupt      now, and the largest pays only 10 cents on the dollar on      asbestos claims. The two groups who lose, according to      Christopher Edley, a former Clinton White House aide and      Harvard Law professor who     has worked on the legislation, would be nonsick plaintiffs      who might get some (usually small) settlements under the      current system and the trial lawyers who have been taking      huge contingent fees.       These are strong arguments, strong enough to win bipartisan      support for the bill, from Democratic Sens. Charles Schumer      and Robert Torricelli as well as House Judiciary Chairman      Henry Hyde and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. You would      expect Hyde and Lott to support such a law, but for Schumer      and, especially, Torricelli, it goes against political      interest: Torricelli chairs the Senate Democrats' campaign      committee, and Democrats depend heavily on trial lawyer      money. One can only conclude that Schumer and Torricelli were      convinced by strong arguments, which was certainly the case      for Democrat Edley, who was writing about cases long before      Heyman's bill was proposed. When McCain charged that the      current campaign finance system was corrupt, Republican Mitch      McConnell challenged him to name one senator who had voted      corruptly. Certainly no one who knows the issues and the      senators involved would have cited this case.       Air pollution? And not just this case. When a government      affects the economy, when it sets rules that channel vast      sums of capital, people in the market economy are going to      try to affect government. They will contribute to candidates      and exercise their First Amendment right to ``petition the      government for a redress of grievances,'' i.e., lobby. Both      things will continue to be true even if one of McCain's      various campaign finance bills is passed. There is no      prospect for full public financing of campaigns (Gore says      he's for it, but he has never really pushed for it); one      reason is that it leaves no way to prevent frivolous      candidates from receiving public funds. (Look at the zoo of      candidates competing for the Reform Party's $13 million pot      of federal money). Reformers speak of campaign advertisements      as if they were a form of pollution and try to suppress issue      ads as if no one but a candidate (or newspaper editorialist)      had a First Amendment right to comment on politicians'      fitness for office. And to communicate political ideas in a      country of 270 million people you have to spend money.       The idea that the general public interest goes      unrepresented is nonsense. There is no single public      interest; reasonable people can and do disagree about every      issue, from asbestos lawsuits to zoo deacquisitions. This      country is rich with voluntary associations ready to      represent almost anyone on anything; any interest without      representation can quickly get some. Even when the deck seems      stacked, as it has for trial lawyers on asbestos regulation,      there will be a Samuel Heyman with, as Edley puts it, ``the      moxie to act on his convictions.'' Money talks, as it always      will in a free society. But in America, and on Capitol Hill,      strong arguments can talk louder, and do.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been encouraging to see the evolution of this debate over the years. While the New York Times and Washington Post are a broken record, repeating ad nauseam the tired and disproven cliches of the reform industry, there has been a marked increase in dissents put forth op-eds and scholarly works.  Among the leading columnists who has weighed in on behalf of the first amendment perspective is Charles Krauthammer.  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Krauthammer's column of March 23, 2001 in the Washington Post be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 23, 2001]                        McCain's Costly Crusade                        (By Charles Krauthammer)       Pharmaceutical companies live on patent protection. They      make their profits in the few years they enjoy a monopoly on      the drugs they have discovered. They fight fiercely to      protect their turf, and given generously to politicians to      make sure they protect that turf too.       Who, then, do you think has just issued a report showing      that changes in law and regulation have effectively doubled      the drug companies' patent protection time? Some tiny,      Naderite public interest group? Some other representative of      the little guy?       No. A nonprofit institute founded and largely funded by the      insurance companies. Insurance companies, you see, pay the      bill for patent protection by drug companies. And they don't      like it. There is more than one 800-pound gorilla in this      room.       You wouldn't know that from hearing John McCain talk about      how special interests buy their way in Washington. They try      to, but they run up against the classic Madisonian structure      of American democracy. Madison saw ``factions,'' what we now      call interests, not only as natural, but as beneficial to      democracy because they inevitably check and balance each      other.       His solution to the undue power of factions? More factions.      Multiply them--and watch them mutually dilute each other. For      two centuries we followed the Madisonian model. But now      McCain's crusade calls for restriction rather than      multiplication: curtailing the power--and inevitably the      right to petition and the right to free speech--of special      interests.       True, money in politics in corrupting; opponents of McCain      should admit as much. Generally one can't prove quid pro      quos. But it is obvious that legislators are more attentive      to the views of those who give money. Otherwise, they      wouldn't give it. The problem, however, is that like all      attempts to banish sin from public life--Prohibition, for      example--campaign reform comes at a fearful price.       There are three basic ways to conduct effective political      speech: own a printing press; buy a small piece of space (or      time) in a medium owned by others, say, 30 seconds on TV or a      page in a newspaper; or bypass the media and directly support      a political actor--candidate, leader, party--whose views      reflect yours.       McCain-Feingold would drastically restrict the third, by      banning ``soft money'' contributions to parties. The Snowe-     Jeffords amendment would drastically restrict the second by      curtailing political ads by outside groups.       This is bad policy, first of all, on principle. Free speech      is the first of all the amendments not by accident. It is the      most important. Which is why we regulate it with the most      extreme circumspection. It borders on the comic that the      First Amendment should be (correctly) interpreted as      protecting nude dancing and flag-burning but not political      speech. And there are few more effective ways for someone who      does not own a printing press to express and promote his      political views than by contributing to a party that reflects      them.       Hence, the second problem with McCain-Feingold. It purports      to eliminate the influence of money and power in politics. In      fact, it eliminates only some influence. It does not end      influence peddling. It only skews it.       By restricting Madison's multiple factions, McCain-Feingold      radically tilts the playing field toward (a) incumbent      politicians, who enjoy the megaphone of public office; (b)      the very rich, who can buy unlimited megaphone time (which is      why so many now populate the Senate); and (c) media moguls,      who own the megaphones.       The conceit of McCain-Feingold is that politicians      prostitute themselves only for big corporate or individual      contributors. But they give far more care and feeding,      flattery and deference to the lords of the media. It stands      to reason.       They can be helped or hurt infinitely more by the New York      Times or network news shows than by any lobbyist. By      restricting the power of contributors, McCain-Feingold      magnifies the vast power of those already entrenched in      control of information.       How to mitigate the effects of money? By demanding absolute      transparency, say, full disclosure on the Internet within 48      hours of a contribution, so that contributions can be the      subject of debate during, not after, the campaign. And by      requiring TV stations, in return for the public licenses that      allow them to print money, to give candidates a substantial      amount of free air time.       Far better to reduce the demand for political money rather      than the supply. For the Robespierre of American politics,      however, such modest steps are almost contemptible. McCain's      mission is not the mitigation of sin but its eradication. Yet      like all avengers in search of political purity, McCain would      leave only wreckage behind: a merely different configuration      of influence-peddling--and far less freedom.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, William Raspberry has also made some astute observations on this issue over the years. In the March 23, 2001 Washington Post, in a column entitled ``Campaign Finance Frenzy,'' Mr. Raspberry makes a refreshing observation, conceding that while he is drawn to ``reform'' he is not sure just what ``reform'' means. What is it? A fair question.  ``I don't quite get it,'' Mr. Raspberry writes. He's for it but confesses to not being sure what it is.  I venture to guess Mr. Raspberry speaks for a lot of people who are not intimately familiar with the McCain-Feingold bill and the jurisprudence which governs this arena.  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Raspberry's column be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 23, 2001]                        Campaign Finance Frenzy                         (By William Raspberry)       When it comes to campaign finance reform, now being debated      in the Senate, I don't quite get it.       I know what the problem is, of course: People and      organizations with big money (usually people and      organizations whose interests are inimical to mine) are      buying up our politics--and our politicians. It is      disgraceful, and I'd like it to stop.       What I don't get is how the reform proposals being debated      can stop it.       Up to now, I've been too embarrassed to say so. I think I'm      for McCain-Feingold, but that's largely because all the      people whose politics I admire seem to be for it. Besides,      John McCain looks so sincere (I don't really     have a picture of Russ Feingold in my mind) and the Arizonan      has made campaign finance reform such an important matter      that he was willing to risk offending a president of his own      party. I'm attracted to people of principle.       Similarly, I've been denouncing the substitute lately put      forward by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) because my colleagues      who know about these things say it is a sham--even a step      backward. I don't like shams.       The problem is (boy, this is humiliating!) I don't know      what I want.       Do I want to keep rich people from using their money to      support political issues? Political parties? Political      candidates? No, that doesn't seem right.       Didn't the Supreme Court say money is speech, thereby      bringing political contributions under the protection of the      First Amendment? That pronouncement, unlike much that flows      out of the court, makes sense to me. If you have a First      Amendment right to use your time and shoe leather to harvest      votes for your candidate, why shouldn't Mr. Plutocrat use his      money in support of his candidate? If it's constitutional for      you to campaign for gun control, why shouldn't it be      constitutional for Charlton Heston and the people who send      him money to campaign against it?       If money is speech--and it certainly has been speaking      loudly of late--how reasonable is it to put arbitrary limits      on the amount of permissible speech? Is that any different      from saying I can make only X number of speeches or stage      only Y number of rallies for my favorite politician or      cause?       But if limits on money-speech strike me as illogical, the      idea that there should be no limits is positively alarming.      Politicians--and policies--shouldn't be bought and sold, as      is happening far too much these days.       The present debate accepts the distinction between ``hard''      and ``soft'' contributions--hard meaning money given in      support of candidates and soft referring to money contributed      to political parties or on behalf of issues.       McCain-Feingold would put limits on hard money      contributions and, as I read it, pretty much ban soft money      contributions to political parties. Hagel would be happy with      no limits on contributions to parties but has said he might,      in the interest of expediency, accept a cap of, say, $60,000      per contribution.       Hagel's view is that the soft money given to parties is not      the problem, since we at least know where the money is coming      from. More worrisome, he says, are the ``issues''      contributions that can be made through nonpublic channels and      thus protect the identity of the donors.       Why has money--hard or soft--come to be such a big issue?      Because it takes a lot of money to buy the TV ads without      which major campaigns cannot be mounted. Politicians jump      through all sorts of unseemly hoops for money because they're      dead without it.       So why aren't we debating free television ads for political      campaigns? Take away the politician's need for obscene sums      of money and maybe you reduce the likelihood of his being      bought. We'd be arguing about how much free TV to make      available or the thresholds for qualifying for it, but at      least that is a debate I could understand.       All I can make of the present one is that I'm for campaign      finance reform, and I'm against people who are against      campaign finance reform. I just don't know what it is.                          ____________________
