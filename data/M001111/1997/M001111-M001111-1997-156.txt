 President, thanks to Take Our Daughters to Work Day, young girls from all over the country will be given the opportunity to accompany adults to the workplace. Today, young girls will be given the opportunity to shadow an adult mentor--and gain experience in a work environment. What better way to enable girls to explore their future and gain exposure to a wide range of career options?  The focus of this one day event is to bring awareness to the development and education of young girls. Research suggests that young girls often receive less attention in school and suffer from lower expectations than boys. This difference can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence, particularly during the difficult years of adolescence. Lower expectations and self esteem can later prevent them from achieving their maximum potential. This in turn can hinder their own personal and professional development. Therefore, adolescence is a crucial time period for adults to intervene in the lives of young girls. Adults need to take the time to show girls that they can set high goals and pursue their dreams. Today's events will offer inspiration and encouragement to millions of young girls--and show them that adults are committed to helping them--so they can fully expand their horizons and pursue their dreams.  In 1995, women comprised 46 percent of the paid labor force. The composition of the work force has changed significantly, and opportunities have continued to increase for women. Despite these gains, women's wages, on average, still remain below men's. We cannot accept the gap that still exists between men and women. Even though the gap is narrowing--we must continue to work on this issue. Women still experience barriers to non-traditional career roles. A study by the Glass Ceiling Commission found that women occupy only 5 percent of senior level management of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies. Women only comprise 11 percent of the technical workforce. This needs to change. America's future depends on it. Women need to be encouraged to seize opportunities and explore non-traditional careers. This includes developing skills that will prepare them for high wage jobs and management positions that offer higher salaries in the workforce.  Women are increasingly becoming responsible for the financial well-being of their families. We need to ensure that young girls are prepared for the workforce--and have the opportunity to live up to their full potential. We can only do this if we have a community effort. Today, more than ever--young girls need role models and mentors--so that they can achieve success.                          ____________________
