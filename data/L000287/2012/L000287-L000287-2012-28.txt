Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Georgia State Representative Joe Heckstall on the occasion of his retirement from the Georgia General Assembly. For thirty-one years, Joe has served the people of Georgia, first as a City Councilman for the City of East Point, Georgia and then as a State Representative from Georgia's 62nd House District. These many years of publicservice make him the longest serving elected official in the history of South Fulton County, Georgia.  Throughout his time in office, Joe has fought valiantly for those who face social and economic challenges, especially veterans and minorities, and he has strived to bring businesses and prosperity to the communities he represents. I know that he will be greatly missed by his constituents.  I commend Joe for his courageous efforts to break racial barriers throughout his career. He was elected the first African American City Councilman of East Point, and as a Councilman, he helped the city become one of the first in America to celebrate the Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday before it became a State or Federal holiday.  Outside of government, Joe is an active member of the Greater Atlanta community, having worked as a real estate salesman, corporate personnel assistant, motivational speaker, school teacher, and teen counselor. He is known for his love of people and his encouraging attitude.  I wish Joe and his wife, Andrea, the very best with their future endeavors.                          ____________________
