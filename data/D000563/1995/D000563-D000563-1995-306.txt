Chairman, I rise in support of the Boehlert amendment. People who are listening to this debate who do not own land may wonder what difference it makes whether we have wetlands or how many of them. What it boils down to is this: These wetlands act as filters for our underground water supply that we all rely on. When the wetland system, the natural system, fails, we have to step in at great expense to build filtration plants to make sure that the water we drink is pure.  As taxpayers, we have a vested interest in helping mother nature do her job, because it is very expensive to build filtration systems to try to make up for mistakes which we have made. That is why this is an important debate. In my part of the world, in the Midwest, where there is a lot of row crop farming, there is a lot of concern about wetlands.  I have to concede the critics are right. The administration of the wetlands program is far from exemplary and should be improved. The Boehlert amendment does that. The Boehlert amendment is a much more sensible choice than the alternative. He follows the National Governors Association, gives to the Department of Agriculture the power to delineate what a wetland is, and sensible farming practices are allowed. I think we should support this amendment as a commonsense approach to help the environment and to reduce the tax burden which all families will face if our wetlands fail.  Let me close by saying this: I have listened to this debate over the last 2 days. The references to ``gestapos'' and ``heavy handed tactics by the Federal agencies'' fuel the gross national paranoia which we see so much of in this country. I beg my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to temper their rhetoric and realize that some people who have violence in their heart listen for these code words. We have an important debate here that does not have to reach that level.
