Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, New Jersey's Bergen Record published a lengthy investigative report about the partial-birth abortions. I was appalled to read that a single facility in New Jersey--Metropolitan Medical in Englewood--performs at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions every year. This is three times the number of brain suction abortions that the National Abortion Federation, NARAL, and other pro-abortion groups have estimated are preformed annually throughout the country.  This revelation belies the statement of Bill Clinton that the process of sucking a baby's brains out moments before his or her full delivery is limited to 500 children per year nationally. Even if the lower number were true, however, I am stunned that he or anyone else could belittle the horror of partial-birth abortion by saying it only kills 500 children each year. This death toll exceeds the Oklahoma City bombings--an act of terrorism we have all condemned as barbaric.  What is equally as frightening is the fact that the same Record article reveals the most partial-birth abortions in New Jersey were done to teenagers, and they were done as elective procedures, not for medical reasons. Let me quote form the article.       ``We have an occasional amnio abnormality, but it's a      minuscule amount,'' said one of the doctors at Metropolitan      Medical, an assessment confirmed by another doctor there.      ``Most are Medicaid patients, black and white, and most are      for elective, not medical, reasons: people who didn't      realize, or didn't care, how far along they were. Most are      teenagers.''  This contradicts everything the abortion President has said to justify his veto of the partial-birth abortion ban bill passed by both the House and the Senate. President Clinton should stop hiding from the truth.  An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that partial-birth abortions are infanticide and should be banned. Bill Clinton is now not only ignoring the American people, but facts and figures coming from the States and the press.                          ____________________
