Speaker, we hear these debates and they sound so simple on both sides. The public must be very confused. They want low taxes. And the gentleman from Texas talks about putting taxes down. The problem the gentleman from Texas has is he is a member of a party that has controlled this country's government at the Federal level for almost a decade. The President has a veto pen, and he has not allowed any spending that he didn't like.  The problem, of course, is for a decade their premise has been that they can spend money, and they spent money at twice the rate that was spent under the Clinton administration for 8 years. Spending. But they didn't pay for what they bought, because they call that taxes. And they are correct. If you buy things and you pay for them at the Federal level, you pay for them with tax revenues. Now we have a very simple solution, you can stop buying things. But they didn't stop buying things, they doubled the rate of growth of spending from about 3\1/2\ to 7 percent. And they cut revenues.  Now you don't have to be much of a mathematician or an accountant to know what happens: Budgets, deficits, spiraled.  Now, of course, they didn't worry about that because the Vice President of the United States, the Republican Vice President, said debt doesn't matter. That's what he said. And you could see that they really meant it because they have added $1.6 trillion, and that is with a ``T,'' to the debt, deficit, spending.  And by the end of this year, they will have doubled the national debt, and they have been in control of everything and could stop spending in its track with a Bush veto.  And they said if we did that, the economy would blossom and of course their candidate for President says the underpinnings of our economy are sound.  I will tell you, my neighbors don't think that is the case. They are paying more for groceries and they are paying more for gasoline. They are losing jobs. They are having a tough time.  My constituents are better off than most. But this country is having a tough time. And all of the things that they said their tax cuts would produce and their economic program would produce, just like Herbert Hoover and Calvin Coolidge, proved to be dead flat wrong.  Employment, we were going to spur employment, spur growth. Under Bill Clinton, the average monthly addition of jobs was 216,000 per month. Under this President, under your economic program, I don't know whether any of you know how many jobs you have produced over the last 90 months, but I will tell you, 38,000 per month. What is the problem with that? The problem with that is you need 100,000 jobs per month to stay even.  Bill Clinton in the first 8 months of his last year, which is analogous to this year, added 1.4 million jobs in the job market.                              {time}  2145  Under your economic program, President Bush has lost 600,000. That's a net turnaround of 2 million jobs lost in this economy; not producing 1.4 and losing 6.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here on Sunday, at a quarter of 10 at night. Why? For the worst financial disaster that we've seen in this country since the Depression, or the Coolidge and Hoover years. Debt didn't matter then either under Mr. Coolidge or Mr. Hoover. Debt doesn't matter, said the Vice President of the United States.  We're here on this rule because we believe debt does matter. And I understand what the gentleman from California said. We have a philosophical disagreement. That philosophical difference of agreement is we want mental health parity, but we know it's got to be paid for. We want energy independence and alternative energy research and wind and solar, but we know somebody's got to pay for it. The average American family knows that. They want solar heating in their home they know somebody's got to pay for it.  Now we're here, because right now, as a result of failure of this economic program, they can't get a loan because we've incurred so much debt that people have locked up because they're not sure loaning money is a safe thing for them to do. That's why we're here tonight, because of the failure of an economic program that was fiscally irresponsible and was, from a regulatory perspective, neglectful. No oversight. No fiscal responsibility.
