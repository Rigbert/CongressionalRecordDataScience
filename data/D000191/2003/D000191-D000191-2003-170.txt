  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, House Majority Whip Blunt said GOP Members find no urgency to act for a child tax credit, but there was an incredible urgency in this House a couple of weeks ago when we acted in the dark of the night to extend an average $93,500 tax break to every millionaire in America.  Then the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Myrick) said, if we give people a tax break that do not pay taxes, it is welfare. Excuse me, someone who earns $27,000 a year pays $1,890 in FICA taxes. They pay taxes, regressive taxes; and guess what, every penny of those FICA taxes that is supposed to go into the Social Security surplus, the lockbox, that that side of the aisle used to support, that the President used to support, is being borrowed and being mailed in big checks to the wealthy. She may call that welfare; I call it Reverse Robin Hood.                          ____________________
