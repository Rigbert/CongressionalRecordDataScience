As previously announced, on Friday the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. On Saturday, Members are advised that the House will meet at 9 a.m., which is the custom, with recorded votes as early as 10 a.m. This is a change from the previously announced schedule.  For those Members who said they couldn't hear me, let me tell you a little story Senator Sarbanes used to tell. He was giving a speech once and a man in the back of the room said, ``I can't hear you.'' And immediately somebody in the front of the room jumped up and said, ``I can; and I'll trade places with you.''  Now back to this exciting weekend that we're about to have. On Saturday, as I said, we'll come in at 9 a.m., which is the custom, with recorded votes as early as 10 a.m. This is a change from the previously announced schedule. In addition, on Sunday, the House will meet at 1 p.m. for legislative business. On Monday, Members are advised votes could be earlier than 6:30 p.m. Now, many of you will be here on Sunday and not go home. We're going to try to work that out. I wanted to talk to the minority leadership, the Republican leadership, on this issue.  These are also changes that were not previously announced. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. In addition, we will consider H.R. 3644, the Ocean, Coastal, and Watershed Education Act; and H.R. 1612, the Public Lands Service Corps Act. In addition, we will consider the health care legislation, which is now posted on the House Rules Committee Web site. We will consider that with 72 hours notice to all the Members of that posting.
