 The other aspect of this that people ought to focus on, with respect to what the Senator from Oklahoma is talking about, is that time that the physician spends with the patient in the office presents a pretty good chance that some of those discussions they have there in the office are going to help keep that patient out of the hospital, and all sides ought to see that as a constructive goal.  So I want my colleague from Oklahoma to know that in the discussions he and I have had--and I appreciated the way my colleague said with a smile we don't agree on everything--the concept he is talking about with respect to doctors and time in the office--is something that ought to be incorporated into this, and it is my intention to work with my colleague on that.
