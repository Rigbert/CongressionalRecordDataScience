 I had hoped as we began debate on this important bill to modernize America's patent system that the Senate would focus specifically on this measure designed to help create jobs, energize the economy and encourage innovation.  I had hoped that we would consider relevant amendments, and pass the bill. The America Invents Act is a key part of any jobs agenda. We can help unleash innovation and promote American invention, all without adding a penny to the deficit.  This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I said at the outset that I hoped the Senate would come together to pass this needed legislation and do so in the finest tradition of the Senate. I thank the Republican manager of the bill and the assistant Republican leader for their support and efforts on this bill.  Unfortunately, we have become bogged down with nongermane, nonrelevant, extraneous discussions and amendments.  Earlier this week, Senators who were focused on our legislative effort and responsibilities joined in tabling an amendment that has nothing to do with the subject matter of the America Invents Act.  Extraneous amendments that have nothing to do with the important issues of reforming our out-of-date patent system so that American innovators can win the global competition for the future have no place on this important bill. They should not be slowing its consideration and passage.  If America is to win the global economic competition, we need the improvements in our patent system that this bill can bring.  We must now dispose of another such amendment so that we may proceed to final passage of the America Invents Act and help inventors, American businesses and our economic recovery.  I take proposals to amend the Constitution of the United States seriously. I take seriously my oath as a Senator to support and defend the Constitution and to bear true faith and allegiance to it.  Over the years I have become more and more skeptical of recent efforts to amend the design that established the fundamental liberties and protections for all Americans. I believe the Founders did a pretty good job designing our fundamental charter.  I likewise take seriously the standard set in article V of the Constitution that the Congress propose amendments only when a supermajority of the Congress deem it ``necessary.'' While there have been hundreds of constitutional amendments proposed during my service in the Senate, and a number voted upon during the last 20 years, I have been steadfast in my defense of the Constitution.  The matter of a so-called balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is not new to the Senate. Indeed, I believe the first matter Senator Hatch moved through the Judiciary Committee when he chaired it and I served as the ranking member was his proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  I strongly opposed it, but I cooperated with him in his effort to have the committee consider it promptly and vote.  I wish others would show the managers of this bill that courtesy and cooperation and not seek to use this bill as a vehicle for messages on other matters.  The Judiciary Committee has considered so-called balanced budget amendments to the Constitution at least nine times over the last 20 years. The Senate has been called upon to debate those amendments several times, as well, in 1982, 1986, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1997. Despite the persistent and extraordinary efforts of the senior Senator from Utah, they have not been adopted by the Congress.  The only time the Senate agreed to the proposed constitutional amendment was in 1982. On that occasion, the House of Representatives thought the better of it. On the subsequent five occasions, as Senators came to understand how the proposed amendment undercut the Constitution, it was defeated.  Now another Senator has adopted this cause.  He has proposed a different, even more complicated proposed constitutional amendment. That will require study in order to be understood. It will require working with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights.  While the new Senator from Utah is a member of the Judiciary Committee and a member of the Constitution subcommittee, he has not consulted with me about his proposal, nor, as far as I know, with the chairman of the subcommittee, the senior Senator from Illinois.  Instead, he preemptively seeks to raise the matter on this important bill, which is designed to create jobs, encourage American innovation and strengthen our economy.  For the last 20 years, the so-called balanced budget amendment has been a favorite slogan for some. For some others of us, we have done the hard work to actually produce a balanced budget and, indeed, a surplus.  Rather than defile the Constitution, we have worked and voted to create a balanced budget and a budget surplus. In 1993, without a single Republican vote to help us, Democrats in the Congress passed a budget that led to a balanced budget and, indeed, to a budget surplus of billions of dollars by the end of the Clinton administration.  That surplus was squandered by the next administration on tax breaks for the wealthy and an unnecessary war that cost trillions but went unpaid for. Those misjudgments were compounded by financial fraud and greed that led to the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. That is what we have been seeking to dig out from under since 2008.  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter received from American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, in opposition to the Lee amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                       AFSCME,                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 2011.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the      American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,      I am writing to urge you to oppose Senator Lee's amendment to      S. 23, providing that it is the sense of the Senate that      Congress should pass and the states should agree to an      amendment to the Constitution requiring a Federal balanced      budget.       A constitutional balanced budget amendment is a simplistic      answer to a complicated issue and would serve only to further      weaken our economy and move us away from fiscal      responsibility at a time of much economic uncertainty. It      would require large, indiscriminate spending cuts during      economic downturns, precisely the opposite of what is needed      to stabilize the economy and avert recessions.       The immediate result of a balanced budget amendment would      be devastating cuts in education, homeland security, public      safety, health care and research, transportation and other      vital services. Any cuts made to accommodate a mandated      balanced budget would fall most heavily on domestic      discretionary programs, but ultimately, there would be no way      to achieve a balanced budget without cuts in Social Security      and other entitlement programs as well. A balanced budget      amendment would likely disproportionately affect unemployed      and low-income Americans.       There are also serious concerns about the implementation of      such an amendment and how it would involve the courts in      matters more appropriately resolved by the legislative and      executive branches of government. Budgetary decisions should      be made by officials elected by the people, not by unelected      court officials with no economic or budget expertise.       I urge you to oppose the Lee amendment and to oppose any      effort to adopt an amendment to the Constitution requiring a      balanced budget.           Sincerely,                                              Charles M. Loveless,                                          Director of Legislation.
