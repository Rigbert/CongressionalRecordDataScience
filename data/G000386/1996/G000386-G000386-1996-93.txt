 This shows that, in fact, only 17 U.S.-flag commercial vessels actually delivered goods in the war zone. This chart was provided by the military sealift command. I did not put these figures together; I got them from the military sealift command.  Only five APL vessels--these are U.S. flags--went into the war zone; only three sea-land U.S.-flag vessels went into the war zone; only four watermen,and their U.S.-flag vessels went into the war zone; only five Lykes U.S.-flag vessels went into the war zone; total--total, only 17 U.S.-flag vessels delivered goods into the war zone. That is 17 compared to 500 trips into the war zone, so that means overwhelmingly--I hope you understand, overwhelmingly--17 trips versus 500 trips, U.S. The remaining were foreign flag, foreign crew.  I am sure the Senator from Alaska did not mean his remarks to be in support of my amendment to make sure American-flag ships deliver all the way. But his statement that he was making is a statement in support of that amendment. I am sure it was not intended to be that way, but he gives a rational argument for that amendment, a strong statement for that amendment.  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          U.S. CARRIER OWNED/CONTROLLED VESSELS USED FOR SMESA          ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Number of                                                                vessels                                            Total    U.S.-flag   actually  U.S.-flag                               vessels   component    going    component                                 used                into the                                                                  gulf             ------------------------------------------------------------------------APL.........................         30         23         12          5Farrell.....................          4          4          0          0Lykes.......................         12         12          5          5Sea-Land....................         36         19         13          3Waterman....................          4          4          4          4                             -------------------------------------------      Total.................         86         62         34         17------------------------------------------------------------------------
