 President, I rise today to honor a man who has dedicated his life's work to education in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Dr. George D. Edwards is the founding president and CEO of Big Sandy Community and Technical College, BSCTC, and he will step down from that position in January of 2015.  Although Dr. Edwards is originally from Virginia, it is fair to consider him an adopted son of the Bluegrass State. He first came to Kentucky in 1970 to attend Berea College, and upon finishing his undergraduate studies, he decided he wasn't in a hurry to leave. Dr. Edwards went to Murray State University to earn his master of business administration and master of economics, and despite some absences from the Commonwealth in the interim--including when he earned his doctor of education from the University of Southern Mississippi--he returned to Paintsville where he has lived for the last 14 years.  When Dr. Edwards first moved to eastern Kentucky in 2000, he became the third president of Prestonsburg Community College and the first CEO for the Big Sandy Community and Technical College District. When the colleges merged in 2003 to become Big Sandy Community and Technical College, he became the institution's first president and CEO.  In this capacity Dr. Edwards has worked tirelessly to strengthen Big Sandy's commitment to its students. He has cultivated ties with the area's business community through his work with the local chambers of commerce, he has instituted an honors program for students, a Leadership institute for faculty and staff, and created a music and drama program for students and the community. He has also overseen over $23 million in infrastructure projects on campus.  Although Dr. Edwards and his wife, Dr. Joyce Edwards, plan to move to Verona, VA, in their retirement, their impact on the State and the region will undoubtedly remain. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exemplary educator, Dr. George D. Edwards, and wishing him well in his future endeavors.  Mr. President, the Big Sandy Community and Technical College recently published an article on their Web site detailing the life and career of Dr. George D. Edwards. I ask unanimousconsent that the article be printed in full in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                             [Aug. 5, 2014]          Founding President/CEO of BSCTC Announces Retirement       After 14 years, Dr. George D. Edwards, founding president      and CEO of Big Sandy Community and Technical College (BSCTC),      will step down as college president and CEO on January 5,      2015. He will work on a special assignment through June 30,      2015.       ``This is a bittersweet day for our family,'' said Dr.      Edwards. ``I have had the honor of working with a dedicated      board of directors, foundation board, a great leadership      team, and a group of passionate faculty and staff who are      committed to our mission. Together, we have made great      strides in providing the people of the Big Sandy region a      comprehensive community and technical college that is devoted      to student success, access and transfer.''       Dr. Michael B. McCall, founding president of the Kentucky      Community and Technical College System (KCTCS), issued the      following statement on Dr. Edwards' retirement: ``Dr.      Edwards' outstanding leadership during the past 14 years has      enabled BSCTC to provide the local community with educational      programs in high-wage, high-demand fields, designed to      enhance the eastern Kentucky economy. We are currently      working with Dr. Edwards to ensure a seamless transition plan      is in place as we move forward in our mission to provide      Kentuckians with a quality postsecondary education that is      both accessible and affordable.''       Dr. Edwards and his wife, Dr. Joyce Edwards, plan to      relocate to Verona, Va. upon his retirement.       ``This will allow us to be within two hours of all of our      children and grandchildren,'' he said. ``Family is very      important to Joyce and me, and we look forward to spending      time with them, traveling and volunteering in the      community.''       Dr. Edwards became the third president of Prestonsburg      Community College and the founding president of the Big Sandy      Community and Technical College in November 2000, shortly      after the passage of House Bill 1 which created KCTCS. Under      his leadership, Prestonsburg Community College and Mayo      Technical College together formed Big Sandy Community and      Technical College in 2003.       Student success has been the cornerstone of Dr. Edwards'      administration. Since 2008, the college has increased      credentials awarded to students by 140 percent and graduates      earning associate degrees by 64 percent.       Dr. Edwards has overseen more than $23 million in building      projects during his tenure. BSCTC opened the Student Center      in 2002 and the Postsecondary Education Building and East      Kentucky Science Center and Planetarium in 2004. The Mayo      campus benefitted from a more than $7.5-million renovation in      2002. Additionally, more than $4 million have been spent on      infrastructure upgrades in the areas of technology and      sustainability.       Dr. Edwards' strong and compassionate leadership has led to      many accomplishments, including: the creation of the Floyd      County and Johnson County Early College Academies; a highly      responsive Workforce Solutions program; the creation of the      Big Sandy Singers, Big Sandy Idol and Fine Arts department;      the Honors Scholarship program; leadership development for      employees; and the continued growth of the Big Sandy College      Educational Foundation, Inc.       ``I'm most proud of the students we've helped,'' said Dr.      Edwards. ``It's rewarding to be in a position and represent      an institution that has unwavering commitment to students.      It's also been rewarding to watch our employees grow and      develop over the years. I hope that my efforts have made a      difference.''       Karen Sellers, chair of the BSCTC board of directors, said      Dr. Edwards transformed an already well respected community      college into a remarkable place to work and study.       ``As a result of his strategic leadership, BSCTC has seen      significant growth in student enrollment, faculty achievement      and campus improvements,'' she said. ``Dr. Edwards has done a      terrific job of reaching out to the business community,      fundraising and recruiting talented students, faculty and      staff. Every step of the way, he has reminded this community      of the vital importance of Big Sandy Community and Technical      College.''       Charles ``Rusty'' Justice, vice chair of the BSCTC board of      directors, said: ``I would like to thank Dr. Edwards for his      leadership of this wonderful institution over the last 14      years. Under his guidance he has overseen growth and progress      in all facets of the organization. I would also like to thank      him for his friendship. He is a man of intelligence and      character and I have benefited from that relationship.''       Bobby McCool, chief institutional officer, said Dr.      Edwards' leadership has elevated the importance of      postsecondary education in economic development.       ``Big Sandy Community and Technical College has brokered      the dialogue of conversation on the role of our college in      workforce development,'' he said.       Dr. Nancy B. Johnson, provost at BSCTC, said Dr. Edwards'      leadership and commitment to students and communities served      by the college has been phenomenal.       ``The many successful programs initiated--increased      scholarship access; the improvement of facilities; the access      to technology and its infusion into the learning process; the      responsiveness to workforce needs; and the continual      encouragement and support to faculty and staff through      professional development opportunities--all provide evidence      of this leadership and commitment. Working as a member of his      team at Big Sandy has truly been a gift for me.''                          ____________________
