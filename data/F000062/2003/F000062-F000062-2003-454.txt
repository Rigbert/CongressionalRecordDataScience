 President, I urge everyone to vote for this amendment. This would restore the President's number for the Millennium Challenge account. This account is very specific. It is to go for economic assistance and improvements in undeveloped countries. I think all of us know that our budget in this area is surprisingly small. We rank next to last in industrialized countries. As Mr. Lugar has so ably pointed out, the Iraq war should show us the need, indeed, is great.  I hope everyone on this side of the aisle will vote to restore this $1.15 billion and offset it with the account 920.  I yield the floor.
