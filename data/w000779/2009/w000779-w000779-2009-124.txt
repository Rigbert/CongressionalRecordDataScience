President, I would close this discussion with Senator Bennett by saying that I think, having listened to his comments with respect to Social Security and knowing of our work together on health care, if anything, we have seen during this last couple of weeks of discussion about the economic stimulus how important it is going to be to bring the Senate together in the months ahead in a bipartisan way to tackle these most significant economic questions. You are not going to fix Social Security and you are not going to fix health care on a narrowly partisan approach. The Senator has made that clear with the ideas he has advanced on Social Security.  It is a pleasure to team up with the Senator on health care. I look forward to joining with him in following up on the Social Security proposal he has made this afternoon. I thank him for his work.
