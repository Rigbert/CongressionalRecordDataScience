  I will be talking with the Senator from Oklahoma, over the next short while, to figure out the order in moving to his amendments for votes, as he has requested. We do have another amendment that had been offered by Senator McCain, amendment No. 2375, which we would like to get a vote on before the caucus luncheons.                           Amendment No. 2375  So I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2375 be made the pending business.
