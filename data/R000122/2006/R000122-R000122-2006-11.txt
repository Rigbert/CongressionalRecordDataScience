I got to know Bob Gates in that same context of bipartisan foreign policy deliberation at the Aspen Strategy Group with a group of individuals. Some of our colleagues were there, including Senator Feinstein and others. But it is chairedby Brent Scowcroft, who was the National Security Adviser for President George Herbert Walker Bush, and cochaired by Joe Nye, who was in the Clinton administration.  Bob Gates is someone who brings to the foreign policy arena this sense of reaching out to both sides. In fact, as he pointed out yesterday--and I think the Senator heard--one of the tasks he sees that he must perform is to create a bipartisan consensus to sustain the long war against terror beyond Iraq, beyond the current dilemmas we are facing. He will do that by reaching out, by listening, again, ultimately, by evaluating the ideas, not simply the source of those ideas.
