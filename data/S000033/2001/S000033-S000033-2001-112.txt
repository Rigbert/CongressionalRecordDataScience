 Chairman, this tripartisan amendment is cosponsored by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Quinn). It would provide $2 billion in advance funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, for fiscal year 2002. I understand that the point of order is going to be asked for, and I am very disappointed that this important amendment will not get a chance to be voted upon today.  From California to Vermont, every American knows that energy costs are skyrocketing. LIHEAP is the primary program that provides assistance to help lower-income families pay their energy bills, and there has been no time when more people are going to need LIHEAP assistance than now. According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, 19 States have reported that they are either out of LIHEAP funds or have very low balances.  Mr. Chairman, this is simply unacceptable. In the richest country in the world, not one family should go without heat this winter, not one senior citizen should choose between heating their homes or affording their prescription drugs. Not one child should come home to a refrigerator empty of food because the heating bill is too high. But, Mr. Chairman, this is exactly what will happen if we do not substantially increase funding for LIHEAP.  Let me take this opportunity to thank the committee and the chairman, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) for doubling the President's totally inadequate request for LIHEAP emergency funding, but because of the severe energy crisis that we are in, the committee's number is still far too low.                              {time}  1830  It should not be acceptable for any Member of Congress or the President that more than 17 million Americans who are eligible to receive LIHEAP have been left behind because of insufficient funding. In fact, since 1985, LIHEAP funding has declined by 70 percent after adjusting for inflation.  Mr. Chairman, at this point I yield to my colleague from California. Mr. Chairman, how much time do we have remaining?
