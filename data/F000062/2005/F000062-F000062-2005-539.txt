 President, this is a bipartisan sense of the Senate. President Bush, when he was Governor, used this program. The Governor of my State, Governor Schwarzenegger, supports it. It is a huge item, as has been stated by Senators Kyl and Cornyn, for border States.  This is a tremendous responsibility to the Federal Government. It is an unfunded mandate. It is a program that should not be allowed to lapse.  We have come to the floor with this sense of the Senate to ask the Senate to pass this resolution so that those of us on the authorizing committee and on Appropriations can move to get this job done.  As I mentioned, this is a 7-year reauthorization. The amounts requested for each year are spelled out in the resolution. This is a total Federal responsibility, and I am hopeful that the Senate will accept their responsibility.  I yield the floor at this time and reserve the remainder of my time.
