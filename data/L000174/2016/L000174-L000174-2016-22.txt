President, history is dotted with the stories of trailblazers. People who shape the public discourse at a pivotal moment in time or change the direction of the debate. One of those trailblazers is Barbara Mikulskim, the longest serving woman in Senate history, the first woman to represent Maryland in the U.S. Senate, and the first woman to chair the Senate's Appropriations Committee. She is tough. She is direct. She is dedicated. She is a fighter. She is a leader.  Barbara Mikulski has always fought for our families and our children. From her roots as a social worker and community activist to the levels of leadership in the Senate, she has held firm to her adage that she is not just the Senator from Maryland, she is the Senator for Maryland. From her first years in the Senate until now, she has promoted education, nutrition, healthcare, and gender equality in the Senate.  She led our historic efforts to pass the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act--shouting from the rooftops the simple principle that women deserve equal pay for equal work. She continued that legacy with the Paycheck Fairness Act. Wouldn't it be a fitting tribute if the Senate considered and approved that commonsense legislation before she retires?  Like others in this Chamber, she was a vocal and steadfast supporter of Violence Against Women Act and our most recent efforts to reauthorized and expand those lifesaving programs. She led the efforts to ensure that the Affordable Care Act made clear that no one should be discriminated against in preventive care. Who can forget her fierce advocacy to make the letter of the law clear that being a woman is not a preexisting condition?  And when Barbara assumed the mantle chairing the Appropriations Committee, she brought with her the tough but fair grit that has been her hallmark in the Senate. When asked about earmarks, her retort was simple: ``I've told senators that if you're opposed to earmarks, I'll honor that and won't include any for your state.'' You always know where you stand with Barbara Mikulski.  Thirty years ago, when she first came to the Senate, women filled just two seats in this body. When the Senate convenes next year, there will be 21. I hope it won't be another 30 years for the Senate to be truly representative of the country we serve.  A lifelong Baltimore resident, ``Senator Barb'' has never forgotten her roots, probably because she never left. She remains a Marylander through and through, dedicated to her State and never forgetting that listening to your constituents is the most important job of all. When Senator Mikulski announced her retirement, she told her constituents that the question came down to whether she wanted to spend her time ``raising money or raising hell to meet your day-to-day needs?'' That is Barbara. This rang through in her farewell speech today to the Senate.  We often talk of the lions of the Senate. Barbara Mikulski ranks among them. I will miss her fierce advocacy, her counsel, her commitment, her tenacity, and her grit. I value her friendship, and we will miss her.                          ____________________
