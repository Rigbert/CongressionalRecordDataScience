 The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).  The amendment was agreed to.               Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. McClintock  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part C of House Report 113-215.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:     SEC. 508. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN ACTIONS REGARDING FOREST                    SERVICE ROADS AND TRAILS.       The Forest Service shall not remove or otherwise eliminate      or obliterate any legally created road or trail unless there      has been a specific decision, which included adequate and      appropriate public involvement, to decommission the specific      road or trail in question. The fact that any road or trail is      not a Forest System road or trail, or does not appear on a      Motor Vehicle Use Map, shall not constitute a decision.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 351, the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment guarantees that the public has the full opportunity to comment before a forest road is closed or destroyed.  These roads are vital to tourism, and tourism is vital to the economy of these communities. Yet the U.S. Forest Service has become very aggressive in recent years in shutting down these roads, restricting public access to the public lands, and replacing Gifford Pinchot's inclusionary vision for the Forest Service, which he once described as serving ``the greatest good for the greatest number in the long run,'' into an exclusionary vision that can best be described as: look, but don't touch.  The Forest Service has now bypassed Congress and has adopted a rule that effectively allows it to close any road that it deems to be unnecessary or undesirable without environmental review or public consultation or comment. My amendment simply reasserts Congress' authority to protect public access to the public lands and requires that road or trail closures follow the established process of public notification and input.  Under this provision, the Forest Service can still decommission trails or roads that it considers obsolete, but only after ``adequate and appropriate public involvement.'' That's it. Before you decommission or destroy an existing road or trail, you have to ask the public. It codifies one of Pinchot's maxims for what he called ``the behavior of foresters in public office.'' He said: It is more trouble to consult the public than to ignore them, but that is what you are hired for.
