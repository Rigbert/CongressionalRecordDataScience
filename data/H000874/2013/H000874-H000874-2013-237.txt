In stark contrast, there have been only seven terrorists convicted by the military commissions in Guantanamo. Five of these, by the way, were pleas.  To quote General Colin Powell from 2010:       We have 300 terrorists--it's now less--who have been put in      jail not by a military commission but by a regular court      system . . . We ought to remove this incentive that exists in      the presence of Guantanamo to encourage people and give      radicals an opportunity to say, ``You see? This is what      America is all about.''  That's Colin Powell.  We should be proud of our Nation's long history of bringing to justice those who commit crimes that threaten the peace and freedom of innocent people around the world. Guantanamo is a stain on that record. It should be closed.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
