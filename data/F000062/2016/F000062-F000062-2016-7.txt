 Trinko. This is a Supreme Court case in which the Court took a commonsense view of the same clause as we have in this bill and concluded that clause prevented any modification to existing law.  I also want to talk about process. The bill before you today is the result of 3 years of painstaking and public work. I first introduced a version of this bill in July of 2015. That bill received significant public input, including a Senate energy committee hearing last October. Based on feedback, I revised that bill and then circulated a public discussion draft in December of that year. We incorporated feedback from a variety of stakeholders, including environmentalists, water districts, and State and Federal agencies. We made dozens of changes.  Incorporating all of this, I then introduced a revised bill in February of 2016. That revised bill received a second Senate hearing in the committee in May. The administration testified at that time that the bill complied with the Endangered Species Act and relevant biological opinions.  The short-term operational provisions in this bill are largely the same as the bill I introduced in February. We also made the savings clause and environmental protections even stronger, referencing them no fewer than 36 times. I truly believe the long-term provision, as well as the environmental protections, would not be included in any bill under a Congress that we might expect in the future.  While the short-term provisions will alleviate some suffering, I believe that the most important part of the bill is actually the long-term section. In California, we have depended on a water system that is overallocated and overstressed. I want to explain that.  We have two big water systems. One is the State water system, put forward by Governor Pat Brown in the middle 1960s, when California had 16 million people. The other is the Central Valley Water Project, bonded and paid for by agriculture water contractors. That was put forward in the 1930s.  By census, California today is 39.1 million people, and the number of undocumented in addition to that is estimated to be 2.5 million. I often say, and it is conservative, the State today is 40 million people with a water infrastructure created when we were 16 million people.  To address the demands of a growing population and changing climate, we have long-term provisions that include $550 million in authorizations for programs, including fish and wildlife protection, desalination, storage, recycling, and water grant programs. Over the course of 3 years of work, we heard the concerns of many people about the loss of salmon. And I've been told that the pumps actually were not to blame for the high mortality rates of salmon in the past 2 years. In fact, only 56 out of an allowable 1,017 salmon were caught at these pumps. I said I was disappointed. The word is surprised. The problem has been a malfunctioning cold water valve at Shasta Dam that meant there was not enough cold water for fish in the Sacramento River. According to NOAA Fisheries, these mistakes resulted in a salmon kill of 95 percent in 2014 and a salmon kill of 98 percent in 2015. Of the $150 million in the energy and water appropriations I have acquired the past two years, we have used some to fix this problem and Shasta, in addition to other infrastructure problems. We also have $43 million of environmentally beneficial bills, some of which can be used to make sure we avoid a devastating loss to salmon.  Let me tell you what that $43 million includes: $15 million for habitat restoration projects, $15 million for fish passage projects, $3 million for a long-wanted delta smelt distribution study requested by Fish and Wildlife, and a program to reduce predator fish. Let me tell you what a big problem that is in the delta. People add predator fish such as striped bass to be able to encourage a fishing industry. The smelt go where the turbid waters are. The fishing magazines say if you want to catch fish, go to the turbid water. So fishermen go to the places where the striped bass are feeding on the endangered species. Additionally, in this bill, we have money to eliminate what has been a huge growth of water hyacinth, which drain the nutrients from the water.  I would also say we have about a dozen sewage treatment plants that put millions of gallons of 1.75 million gallons of ammonia per year into the delta. The delta is a troubled place, and let there be no doubt about it. There are a lot of islands, there is farming, and the soil is peat. When the levees leak, the peat soil goes into the delta, throws off trihalomethanes, and pollutes the water further.  We add $10 million to connect important wildlife refuges to sources of water, and the bill also includes $515 million that can go to a new kind of water infrastructure for California.  This includes $30 million for design and construction of desalination plants. These projects actually do work. What I am told is what we need to secure is a third-generation membrane because the energy coefficient of desal has been negative. With a third-generation membrane, you can turn that deficit into a positive coefficient.  The bill also includes $335 million for storage and groundwater projects. The only way we will be able to weather future droughts is by holding water in wet years for dry years, and that means more storage, including groundwater storage. We have money in there for WaterSMART, and this will help fund water supply and conservation. We have $50 million included for the existing Colorado River System Conservation Program. To date, this popular program has resulted in 80,000 acre-feet of water saved throughout the West, including through projects in Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming.  I wish to address my colleagues' concerns that this bill will allow the next administration to build dams all over the country without any congressional approval, and this is simply not true. Let me set the record straight about how storage projects work under this bill. The drought language here gives Congress veto authority through control of appropriations for any storage project. This means that reclamation will do the same rigorous studies it hasalways done, including feasibility studies and environmental impact statements.  Reclamation would then submit a list of recommended projects to Congress, and Congress would decide how to fund them. If Congress has concerns, it doesn't fund the project. It is that simple. This will allow Federal funding to go to qualified, environmentally mitigated, and cost-beneficial projects on the same timeframe as projects funded under the California State water bond. That is just common sense, making sure the Federal Government partners with States such as California to ensure the best projects get funding but only with Congress's approval.  It was said on this floor that groundwater projects are the best solution for California water problems, and this bill helps build those groundwater projects. Again, this proposal made so much sense 1 year ago that my colleague from California cosponsored the measure. Moreover, this is not the Federal Government building projects that States and local governments oppose. To the contrary, the bill sets up a process where the Federal Government can contribute up to 25 percent of the cost of projects built by States or local agencies in collaboration with a broad range of local agencies.  The Federal Government cannot contribute more than 25 percent of the cost. They have to work with the States and local agencies that would fund the rest.  This provision has also been the subject of two public hearings and the Obama administration supported it.  The Obama administration stated the following in relationship to the water storage programs in the bill at the May 26 hearing in the Energy Committee:       We are finding that State and local jurisdictions are      developing their own funding for many of these types of      projects and would like to have a federal partner but are      unable to wait for an authorization for Reclamation to      participate in such a project. Consequently, we are of the      view that in addition to the traditional Reclamation paradigm      for study, authorization, then participation in federal water      projects, Congress should revisit a standing authorization      that allows some kind of investment in the state and local      projects as contemplated.  I want to talk about the offsets on the bill. On this floor, it has been said that this is a sweetheart deal that would cost the taxpayers billions of dollars, and that is simply flatly untrue.  In fact, the CBO budget office has said that the bill will save Treasury $558 million, and that is the truth.  As I said, California is home to more than 40 million people and our major water infrastructure hasn't been significantly changed in the past 50 years when we had 16 million. We must modernize the system, both the infrastructure and operational flexibility, or I fear we risk eventually becoming a desert State.  To the best of our ability, we have addressed concerns raised by environmentalists, water districts, Federal and State agencies, and the ag sector. This bill has bipartisan support in both Houses, and I believe these provisions will place California on a long-term path to drought resiliency.  I wish to say thank you. A lot of people have had a very hard time through this drought. It is my hope that we can get this bill passed and then, on a bipartisan basis, this Congress, both Senate and House, can see that we do what we can to abate this drought and also begin to build a new water infrastructure in California.  I thank the Chair.
