Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1553, the National Weather Service and Related Agencies Authorization Act of 1999 authorizes a total of $1.391 billion for fiscal year 2000 and $1.468 billion for fiscal year 2001 for the National Weather Service, the NOAA office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Programs, the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service and related facilities. The NWS, supported by the Atmospheric Research and NESDIS programs, provides around-the-clock weather and flood warning and forecast services to the general public for the protection of life and property. The NWS data is used by private sector, commercial and weather service firms which provide specialized forecasts for a variety of business uses.  The additional funds authorized by this bill will, first, provide an increase of nearly 10 percent in the lead time for tornado warnings, particularly to those areas of the Nation such as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, the Midwest and the Southeast that are subject to devastating tornadoes; second, also provide an increase of 10 percent in forecast accuracy of the onset of freezing temperatures, particularly important for agricultural regions; third, provide an increase of nearly 5 percent in the forecast accuracy of heavy snowfall and severe storm warnings; and last, maintain current capabilities and hurricane forecasts and flood warnings. I commend the bill to the House for its adoption.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
