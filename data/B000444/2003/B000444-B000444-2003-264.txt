 President, I have a minor point, but the Record should be clarified. When I was referring to what my friend from Michigan said about the difference between the declaration and his condition--one being binding, one not--I referred to the word ``consult.'' It goes beyond that. The ambiguous language really is in the declaration. In his proposal is ``any action relevant'' to paragraphs 2 or 3 of article 4 of the treaty, which is the action relevant to the extension or withdrawal--that is the language that was taken by him, properly so, from the declaration, and that is the part that is ambiguous, not the word ``consult.''  At any rate, it is a distinction without a great difference.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
