President, I speak today to recognize the importance of breastfeeding as a child and maternal health issue. Breastfeeding is widely accepted as the most complete form of nutrition for infants, and it provides an array of benefits for both infants and mothers.  Yet many mothers who choose to breastfeed find themselves in situations where they are discouraged, or even prohibited, from breastfeeding. I submitted a Senate resolution today to recognize the many benefits of breastfeeding and to encourage States to protect the rights of women to feed their children.  My home State of Illinois recently adopted legislation to exempt breastfeeding mothers from the State's public indecency laws. The impetus behind the State initiative came in no small part from a woman named Kasey Madden, a young mother turned advocate after she was asked one too many times not to breastfeed her infant daughter.  Kasey was at her local fitness center one day, exercising to get back into shape after pregnancy but also caringfor five-month-old Sadie. Sadie was in the day care center at the gym. At the moment, she was mad, and she was hungry. Kasey picked up the baby and sat down to let her nurse. Imagine how she felt when the gym manager came to her and asked her to leave the child care center, in case anyone there might be offended.  Today, Sadie is a healthy, red-haired, energetic toddler. Kasey knows more than she ever thought she would about how to affect public policy. That fitness center and every place like it in the State of Illinois now must respect the right of women to breastfeed their babies. I am not sure that gym manager realized what he was starting the day he asked Kasey Madden not to breastfeed her baby in the gym's child care center, but I commend Kasey. She recognized the value of breastfeeding--not just for Sadie--but for moms and babies everywhere who are frowned on or even prevented from breastfeeding.  The American Academy of Pediatricians and other organizations affiliated with the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee strongly support the Healthy People 2010 goal to increase the percentage of mothers who breastfeed to 75 percent.  I urge my Colleagues to join me in this Resolution to express the Sense of the Senate acknowledging the exceptional health benefits of breastfeeding and encouraging States to protect and promote a woman's right to breastfeed.                          ____________________[Pages S2376-S2377]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS                                 ______                                  SENATE RESOLUTION 403--RECOGNIZING THE BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING, AND                            FOR OTHER PURPOSES
