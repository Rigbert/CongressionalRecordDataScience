Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu) so very much for his excellent, excellent summary of what this program has done. I want to thank him also for mentioning all of the organizations that support our efforts here.  I want people to have this one photo in their mind. If we look at total Trichart showing petroleum consumption in the United States, the growing share of imports that are a part of that is apparent. This is just a staggering set of statistics to keep in mind as we witness our nation become more and more and more dependent on imported petroleum. Here, this chart presents the one picture to keep in our minds.  The other one is this: we are at the dawn of the new fuels age. Less than 1 percent, less than 1 percent of what we currently produce in this country do we make ourselves from agriculturally based fuels. The potential literally is unlimited. This bill takes us another small step to open this window to begin to fuel ourselves and put those dollars in our pockets.  So I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I ask the membership for their support on this Kaptur-Herseth amendment.
