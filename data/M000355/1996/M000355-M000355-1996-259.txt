 President, as my colleagues well know, I do not frequently venture down to the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue. The current occupant of the White House and I do not always see eye to eye. But, times change and I am anxiously awaiting the opportunity to set aside political differences in order to join the President in welcoming to Washington the 1996 NCAA Division I National Champions, the University of Kentucky Wildcats.  Mr. President, University of Kentucky basketball enjoys a proud history, one unequaled by any other school. In fact, in this season of unparalleled achievements, Kentucky not only earned bragging rights for the year, but they also became the winningest program in college basketball history. With their victory in the Mideast Regional Final, the Wildcats overtook the University of North Carolina and returned to their perch atop basketball's elite.  This fact is further demonstrated by the yearend Sagarin basketball Ratings. These figures compiled by basketball expert Jeff Sagarin factor in numerous variables, including schedule strength, to determine the top teams in Division I NCAA. This year, Kentucky posted a yearend rating of 103.26, which put the Wildcats not only in first place for the year, but also made it the top rated team in the 22-year history of these figures.  As for history, let's review a few quick facts about this Wildcat team. On their way to a 34-to-2 record, the Cats defeated every team on their schedule at least once by a minimum of 7 points. They scored 86 points in one-half against the LSU Tigers. Mr. President, for those of my colleagues who may not follow college basketball closely, allow me to put this achievement in terms more readily understandable. Scoring 86 points in one half is equivalent to Bob Dole winning the Presidency before the polls in the Midwest even close, which, by the way, I anticipate he will do. Finally, the Wildcats did something that nobody believed was possible in this age of parity in college athletics: they played the entire Southeastern Conference regular season without losing a single game. A perfect 16 and 0.  Rupp, Issel, Groza, Givens, Macy, Mashburn, Hall, and now Pitino. The Fabulous Five, Rupp's Runts, the Fiddlin' Five, Pitino's Bombinos, the Unforgettables, and now the Untouchables. UK basketball enjoys a tradition unequaled by any other program. Mr. President, I believe this tradition will continue to grow for decades to come.  I urge my colleagues to join me in extending congratulations to this team of outstanding young men, a group distinguished not only by their athletic achievements but their character as well. As an unabashed college basketball fanatic, I want to personally thank Coach Pitino, Athletic Director C.M. Newton, and President Charles Wethington for restoring dignity, excitement, and honor to this proud program. Their leadership provides an example all of us in public life would do well to emulate.                          ____________________
