Speaker, it is my great honor to commend the Circle of Serbian Sisters of Northwest Indiana. This distinguished organization is holding its fifth annual benefit at St. Elijah's Serbian Orthodox Church Hall in Merrillville, IN, this Sunday, October 12, 1997.  The Circle of Serbian Sisters of Northwest Indiana is the combined effort to four Circle of Serbian Sisters organizations, each of which has about 200 members. The presidents of the Circle of Serbian Sisters organizations are: Ms. Helen Tezich, from St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in East Chicago; Ms. Natalie Tica, from St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in Schererville; Ms. Ann Rudman, from St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville; and Ms. Milica Bodrozic, from St. Elijah Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville.  Some 5 years ago, these organizations unified to assemble this humanitarian fundraiser in order to provide aid to orphaned and refugee children in the former Yugoslavia. This year alone, three women--Milica Bodrozic, Mira Radakovich, and Violet Sekulich--who are from various kolos--circles--personally distributed monie's to various orphanages and families in financial need. And 2 years ago, the Circle of Serbian Sisters sent over 7,000 packages and vaccines to displaced children, who are forced to live in refugee camps and shelters. These individually wrapped packages consisted of underwear, sweat suits, andcandy. The Circle of Serbian Sisters of Northwest Indiana works with the International Orthodox Christian Charities and Serbian Orthodox Church in the former Yugoslavia.  Four priests who have supported this effort from the very beginning are: Father Steve Kovacevich, from St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in East Chicago; the Very Reverend Father Milan Savich, from St. George Serbian Orthodox Church in Schererville; the Arch Priest John Todorovich, from St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church; and Father Lazar Kostur, from St. Elijah Serbian Orthodox Church.  This year, the Circle of Serbian Sisters will be honored with the presence of His Grace Right Reverend Longin, Bishop of Dalmatia and Auxiliary Bishop to His Holiness Patriarch Pavale. His Grace Right Reverend Longin is also the Administrator of New Gracanica, seated in Third Lake, IL.  Mr. Speaker, during this difficult time in the former Yugoslavia, the mission of the Circle of Serbian Sisters of Northwest Indiana offers renewed hope in the humanity of all people. I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Circle of Serbian Sisters and wishing them well on their fifth annual banquet, as well as the continued success of their humanitarian efforts.                          ____________________
