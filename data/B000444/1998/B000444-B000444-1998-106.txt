 President, I would ask to engage the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, in a brief colloquy regarding a portion of the report which accompanies the bill, calling on the Border Patrol to examine the potential cost savings and border surveillance capabilities of a variety of types of aircraft. I support the committee's effort to seek more information to improve the cost effectiveness and efficiency of our border surveillance effort--against both illegal immigration and drugs. But, I also believe that we must review all types of aircraft, including both manned and unmanned airships. Is it the Committee's intent that such airships also be considered in the study and report?
