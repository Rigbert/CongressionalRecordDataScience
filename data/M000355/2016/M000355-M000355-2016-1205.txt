 President, in the meantime, we took a step forward yesterday by confirming the new FDA Commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf. In a recent meeting with Dr. Califf, I expressed my concerns regarding the epidemic at hand and the need for more action by the FDA.  I was encouraged by Dr. Califf's recognition that the opioid epidemic is a serious problem and the FDA must do a better job of addressing it. Dr. Califf received broad bipartisan support yesterday in the Senate, and we look forward to working with him. I will continue to hold him accountable to lead the FDA in a new direction to help prevent dependence and abuse of prescription opioids.                          ____________________
