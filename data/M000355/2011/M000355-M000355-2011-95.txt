 President, it is with sadness that I come to the floor today to commemorate a brave Kentuckian who lost his life in service to his country.  U.S. Army SPC Brandon S. Mullins of Owensboro, KY, was killed on August 25, 2011, in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, when insurgents attacked his vehicle with an improvised explosive device. He was 21 years old.  For his heroic service, Specialist Mullins received several awards, medals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.  Brandon Mullins inherited a proud military tradition. He was the third generation in his family to wear the Nation's uniform. His father Thomas was a military police officer, and as a child Brandon and his brother Shaun used to love to play with his dad's old MP mementoes. They also loved to play on a World War II-era tank that was on display in a park near Brandon's childhood home.  As a kid, Brandon loved sports. Hockey was his favorite. He and his family enjoyed going to Nashville Predators games, but Brandon's favorite team was the Detroit Red Wings.  Brandon also played hockey in high school and was the MVP of his league. He thrived under pressure. One time, Brandon's team found itself in a shoot-out situation for victory in a high-stakes playoff game. Brandon asked his coach to put him in as the goalie. He wanted a chance to step up in a clutch moment for his teammates and, sure enough, his team won the game.  Brandon also enjoyed being outdoors. He was a hunter, a fisherman, and a hiker. His family described him as fearless when it came to physical challenges. He started rollerblading at the age of 4. He is remembered as high spirited, generous, and very popular.  Brandon's family was certainly not surprised when Brandon grew up and enlisted in the military. ``He wanted the tough job,'' his mother Catherine said. ``He wanted to fight. He was competitive.''  Brandon's brother Shaun had enlisted before him, and so in February 2010 Brandon enlisted in the Army. He deployed to Afghanistan in May of 2011 with Company C, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, based out of Fort Wainright, AK. Once again, he thrived under pressure, this time in the demanding task of fighting for our country.  ``Brandon matured very quickly,'' his father Thomas said.       From the time he entered basic training . . . you could see      a big change in his life. He was headed in the right      direction with his life.  Brandon loved being in the Army, and would send letters back home about how cool basic training was. Brandon's fellow soldiers quickly took to the new recruit from Owensboro.       ``I can honestly say I've never met anyone like Mullins,''      said SSG Matthew Mills, Brandon's squad leader.  SPC Deroderick Jackson, another one of Brandon's fellow soldiers, said this:       He was just a big help to me. Every time he saw I had a      hard time, he made me smile and told me to get it together.      On a mission with the Afghan National Army, I was real tired      and they were going real fast and [Brandon] said, ``You've      got this, brother!''  Another fellow soldier, COL Todd R. Wood, recalls that Brandon:     . . . was best described as the epitome of selfless service--     he took on details others did not want, he did not complain,      he just did it, and usually with a smile. He carried the      heaviest loads and helped out everyone he could. He was      always concerned about others first.  Brandon's fellow soldiers also recall he had a fun side. ``I remember he was really goofy,'' said Private First Class Adam Baldridge.       One time I remember we got in trouble and we were getting      smoked until we almost had a tear rolling down our cheeks. He      just turned and looked at me and said, ``Just remember, they      can't smoke rocks.''  We are thinking of Brandon's loved ones today, as I recount his story for my colleagues in the Senate, including his parents Thomas and Catherine Mullins, his brother PFC Shaun Erik Mullins, his sister Bethany Rose Mullins, and many other beloved family members and friends.  This past September 11 was the tenth anniversary of the brutal terrorist attacks that ushered in a new era of military readiness and resolve for America. On that day, the Mullins family held a memorial service for Brandon. More than 800 people came to show their respects.  The funeral procession, led by 576 motorcycles, traveled from Good Shepherd Church to Owensboro Memorial Gardens at a slow, somber place--taking 1 hour to drive 11 miles.  On that day, CPT Sean J. Allred of the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, wrote Thomas and Catherine Mullins a letter.       I hope that through writing this letter you may know how      your son lived as a warrior and will continue to live in our      hearts and in our victories.       Know that your son was a brother to all men in his Platoon      and all who knew him . . . Brandon was a credit to you and      how you raised him. I am forever indebted to him and will      honor his memory in future actions.  Captain Allred's sentiments are shared by this Senate. Our Nation can never repay the debt owed to Specialist Mullins or the sacrifice he made that weighs so heavily on his family. But we can honor his service and ensure that he will never be forgotten by his country. It is thanks to heroes such as SPC Brandon S. Mullins that America enjoys the freedoms we do today.                          ____________________
