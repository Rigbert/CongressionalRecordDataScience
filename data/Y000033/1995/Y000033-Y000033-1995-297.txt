Mr. Speaker, the time is late, but it always amazes me where we can have people talk about they have not had an opportunity. The only real change in this whole legislative process is a change of the date at the bequest of the administration. That is all it is. The rest of it has been voted overwhelmingly by this committee.  But the thing that bothers me most, I hear people say we have not had an opportunity. We have not been able to read it. That is nonsense. They have had all these months to read it. One date changed, from 1997 to 1996, and that is it, which I did not like. Because I think we have to harvest those trees that are rotting today on their stumps because they burned, again because the forests were not managed.  To have someone say they are going to affect the fisheries, have you ever seen where the area has been burned and the soil has been eroded because the structure has been diluted because of fire? That is going to affect the fisheries? Nonsense, and you know that.  This is an attempt to destroy by opposition to this bill the infrastructure of the logging industry, which is important to this community. This bill needs to be passed because we are salvaging something in fact that is a waste today.
