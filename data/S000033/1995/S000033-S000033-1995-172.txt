 Chairman, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hoke] makes a very important point, and I hope the Members are listening. We have heard some Members say, this adds $2 billion to the Treasury. It is used for deficit reduction, et cetera, et cetera. Wrong. It is an insurance fund.  If my memory is correct, we have some $6.3 billion in liabilities out there. In point of fact, if we kill OPIC, then we would have $2 billion to use for deficit reduction. Right now, as the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hoke] indicates, this is an insurance fund.
