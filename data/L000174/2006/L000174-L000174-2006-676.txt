President, I thank my friends from Tennessee and Texas for their courtesy.  I commend the Senator from Maryland. I enthusiastically--enthusiastically--cosponsor this amendment. It is going to bring relief to employers by easing the shortfall of seasonal workers. I know it is desperately needed in Vermont.  Last May we passed, and the President signed into law, assistance for small and seasonal businesses by enacting a special exemption.
