Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 333) supporting the goals and ideals of a National Weekend of Prayer and Reflection for Darfur, Sudan.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 333       Whereas, on July 22, 2004, Congress declared that genocide      was taking place in Darfur, Sudan;       Whereas, on September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L.      Powell testified to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations      that ``genocide has been committed in Darfur'';       Whereas, on September 21, 2004, President George W. Bush      stated to the United Nations General Assembly that ``the      world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in      the Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government has      concluded are genocide'';       Whereas Article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and      Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, done at Paris December      9, 1948, and entered into force January 12, 1951, states that      ``[t]he Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether      committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime      under international law which they undertake to prevent and      to punish'';       Whereas fundamental human rights, including the right to      freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, are protected      in numerous international agreements and declarations;       Whereas the United Nations Security Council, in Security      Council Resolution 1591, condemned the ``continued violations      of the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement of 8 April 2004 and the      Abuja Protocols of 9 November 2004 by all sides in Darfur and      the deterioration of the security situation and negative      impact this has had on humanitarian assistance efforts'';       Whereas scholars estimate that as many as 400,000 have died      from violence, hunger, and disease since the outbreak of      conflict in Darfur began in 2003, and that as many as 10,000      may be dying each month;       Whereas it is estimated that more than 2,000,000 people      have been displaced from their homes and remain in camps in      Darfur and Chad;       Whereas religious leaders, genocide survivors, and world      leaders have expressed grave concern over the continuing      atrocities taking place in Darfur; and       Whereas it is appropriate that the people of the United      States, leaders and citizens alike, unite in prayer for the      people of Darfur and reflect upon the situation in Darfur:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,  That the House of Representatives--       (1) supports the goals and ideals of a National Weekend of      Prayer and Reflection for Darfur, Sudan;       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe      that weekend by praying for an end to the genocide and crimes      against humanity and for lasting peace in Darfur, Sudan; and       (3) urges all churches, synagogues, mosques, and religious      institutions in the United States to consider the issue of      Darfur     in their activities and to observe the National Weekend of      Prayer and Reflection with appropriate activities and      services.
