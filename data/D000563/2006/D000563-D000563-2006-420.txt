I said: Since we are adding to the debt which we are leaving to our children and families, is there any limit to the amount of debt you would create in America to provide tax breaks for people who are the wealthiest? And he would not reply to that, which suggests to me--I would ask the Senator from Nevada--that when the majority leader and the majority whip both said they really favor repeal of the estate tax--repeal, complete repeal of the estate tax--that they are prepared to incur whatever debt is necessary and leave that to future generations in order to benefit the wealthy few in America.  We have reports from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that the number of people to be benefited in 1 year in America from this estate tax reform is 8,200 people.
