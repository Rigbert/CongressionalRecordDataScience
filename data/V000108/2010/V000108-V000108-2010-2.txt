Camp for bringing this bill to the floor. I want to thank Mr. Ryan and Mr. Murphy for their very, very good work on this bill.  This is a jobs issue, and there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that that is what we are talking about today.  In 1990, in the State of Indiana, 226,000 more people worked in manufacturing than in government. This year, 7,000 more people work in manufacturing than government, because 165,000 manufacturing employees lost their jobs. That is 165,000 families in the State of Indiana alone that lost good-paying manufacturing jobs. One of the causes is the currency manipulation by the Chinese Government.                              {time}  1650  We were told by the last administration if we just dialogue with the Chinese, we would solve this problem. We are told by the current administration, if we just dialogue with the Chinese, we will solve this problem. We were told by the Chinese on May 18, 2007, if we just dialogue on this problem, we will solve it.  The solution is on the floor today. I would ask my colleagues to strongly support passage of H.R. 2378, and give this administration the intestinal fortitude to stop dialoguing with the Chinese and to take serious action on jobs.  I strongly support H.R. 2378, the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act. I am proud to have the opportunity to speak in support of this bill that takes an important step in leveling the playing field for United States manufacturers.  At the outset of my remarks, I would like to applaud the leadership of the Ways and Means Committee, especially Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Camp for bringing this legislation to the Floor. I would also like to commend Representative Tim Ryan, the sponsor of the legislation, and Representative Tim Murphy, the Vice Chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, for their tireless efforts advocating for this much-needed bill.  As the Chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, I would like to focus my remarks on the steel industry. In the world of steel, China is of paramount concern. In 2009, China produced 47 percent of the world's total output of steel, which is 567.8 million tons. This is more than double the amount that China produced in 2003. By comparison, last year the United States produced approximately 60 million tons of steel, compared with approximately 100 million tons in 2003. While multiple factors contributed to China's unprecedented increase in production, paramount among them is China's currency manipulation. The undervalued Yuan is perpetuating a destructive trade imbalance and costing American jobs.  Congress must ensure that the U.S. remains a competitive place for manufacturing investment. This requires the U.S. to reverse the unsustainable imbalance that has allowed other nations to adopt policies supporting excessive exports of manufactured goods to the U.S., while we export debt and manufacturing jobs. And we must take action now, as evidenced by a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute, which estimates that the rising trade deficit with China will cost the U.S. over one-half of a million jobs in 2010.  I believe that the passage of H.R. 2378 represents a turning point in the battle to combat unfair Chinese trading practices. And I hope that its passage finally gives the Administration the intestinal fortitude to stop ``dialoguing'' with Beijing and start enforcing our trade laws.  Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Representatives Ryan and Murphy and the Committee for bringing this important legislation to the Floor, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure.
