 President, I ask to be recognized for the purposes of a colloquy.  Senator Kohl, the legume plant pathologist position currently working in the CRIS titled ``Improving Disease Management of Soil-borne Diseases of Edible Legumes'' is being eliminated in a reorganization proposed by USDA ARS.  Root diseases are fast becoming a major problem in all of the production areas. These root diseases cause a loss of yields and quality of pulse crops.  A reduction of research support by USDA ARS at this time of rapidly increasing acreages of pulses in ND, MT, SD and NE is unacceptable. Eliminating this research could substantially hurt the entire pulse crop industry.  Within the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture appropriations, there is funding provided for a legume pathologist focused on root diseases. Due to the reorganization of the ARS Prosser facility, this pathologist will not be funded unless that position is moved to the ARS Pullman facility. The need for this project is clear and should be supported by ARS. In order to continue this vital research it is clear that it will need to be moved to ARS Pullman.  I ask that the conference report accompanying the Agriculture bill include language directing ARS to transfer the legume pathologist position and the $250,000 from the Vegetable and Forage Legume Research Unit at Prosser, WA, to the Grain Legume Genetics and Physiology Research Unit at Pullman, WA. This requires no new funding, as it will solely involve the transfer of the legume pathologist from Prosser to Pullman.  This will allow ARS to continue its research on pulse crops at no additional costs.  Senator Kohl, would you support this language moving the legume pathologist position from Prosser, WA, to Pullman, WA?
