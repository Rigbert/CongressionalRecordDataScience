You do not file the kind of detailed patent that you do in this country. We have a different kind of patent system, and the proof is in the pudding. Look at this country compared to the places that we are competing with.  So it seems to me that we should be about the task of saying, if we have created a good system, how do we make the system here function better for our people rather than getting ourselves into a position where we are arguing to rubberstamp an agreement that is going to harmonize the United States with countries whose systems are flat, who commercialize the inventions made here, and we will disadvantage our own people by getting them caught up in all types of litigation.  Why are we making it harder for the people of the United States to protect their intellectual property?  Mr. Chairman, I submit this for inclusion in the Record.Mutual Understanding Between the Japanese Patent Office and the United                    States Patent and Trademark Office       Actions to be taken by Japan:       1. By July 1, 1995, the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) will      permit foreign nationals to file patent applications in the      English language, with a translation into Japanese to follow      within two months.       2. Prior to the grant of a patent, the JPO will permit the      correction of translation errors up to the time allowed for      the reply to the first substantive communication from the      JPO.       3. After the grant of a patent, the JPO will permit the      correction of translation errors to the extent that the      correction does not substantially extend the scope of      protection.       4. Appropriate fees may be charged by the JPO for the above      procedure.       Actions to be taken by the U.S.:       1. By June 1, 1994, the United States Patent and Trademark      Office (USPTO) will introduce legislation to amend U.S.      patent law to change the term of patents from 17 years from      the date of grant of a patent for an invention to 20 years      from the date of filing of the first complete application.       2. The legislation that the USPTO will introduce shall take      effect six months from the date of enactment and shall apply      to all applications filed in the United States thereafter.       3. Paragraph 2 requires that the term of all continuing      applications (continuations, continuations-in-part and      divisionals), filed six months after enactment of the above      legislation, be counted from the filing date of the earliest-     filed of any applications invoked under 35 U.S.C. 120.
