 Although you and I discussed this matter during committee consideration of the bill, I am pleased to have the opportunity to explain this matter to the rest of our Senate colleagues. Many details of this new proposed agency performance based organization structure will have to be sorted out in the authorization process, including the funding proposal. In order to give the authorizing committees as much time as possible before making a final decision regarding this proposal, the Senate Appropriations Committee did not include any appropriated funds or bill language for the SLSDC for fiscal year 1998.
