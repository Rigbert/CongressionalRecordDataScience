Wait until February, and your paychecks are going to be bulging.  From what my friend from Pennsylvania has just said, using this new data that we just got from the Joint Committee on Taxation, what we have picked up--and my friend from Pennsylvania has clearly done his homework--is that something like 60 million taxpayers with an annual income of $200,000 or less will get practically nothing--maybe $100 a year in tax relief or a tax increase. So I think what my colleague is talking about--I would like him to walk me through the numbers he used--is that it directly contradicts what we have been hearing last night, where one Republican Senator after another was saying: It is just going to be good times come February because your paycheck is going to bulge.  Would my colleague just repeat what he found?
