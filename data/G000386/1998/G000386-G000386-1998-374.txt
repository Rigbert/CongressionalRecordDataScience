 President, this playing with the numbers is of a piece with another fact. The administration has consistently avoided providing Congress and the public with accountable standards of performance on drug control as required by law. Although the law creating the national drug strategy requires annual quantifiable performance measures, this administration has not complied with the law from its first day. Although the present drug czar has repeatedly promised such standards, we have yet to see them. And what they propose to send us is not a report on performance but a methodology for reporting on performance.  If that system is ever put into place, we won't seek any accountability based on them until after this administration leaves office. Does this oversight strike you as paying serious attention to drug policy? Not to mention the law?  But this is not all. What the administration has also proposed is a formulafor downgrading the whole effort to have a national strategy. The administration's proposal for reauthorizing the drug czar's office drops the idea of a national strategy for an annual report. It proposes a 10-year strategy document instead. The effect of this sleight-of-hand is to reduce the drug strategy to a proforma exercise, which, by the way, is another means to dodge accountability. This administration will leave office without ever having provided a serious accounting for its drug policy. If present trends continue, it will leave office having presided over a renewed drug epidemic.  It is in keeping with a number of other things the administration has done to signal its real feelings about the war on drugs.  In keeping with this pattern, this administration has one of the worst records I know of in responding to congressional requests. I am not talking about responding to all the requests for information in response to major investigations. I am talking about responses to the normal business of Government. I am still waiting for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Justice Department to respond to questions from a hearing last May. Lest you think the questions were a burden, I only asked three. I am still waiting.  We only recently received responses from the administration to a hearing from last October, and not even all those are in. I also have requests of or correspondence to the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, and others that are months old. It routinely takes this administration, 3, 4, 5, even 6 months to answer a letter, respond to a request, or provide answers to complete the record of hearings. And the answers are often pretty slim and uncommunicative. This is an administration that needs to do a lot of explaining.  The administration is now proposing to undermine the laws on cocaine sentencing. Let me note at the outset, that contrary to the impression in some quarters, the United States does not, I repeat, does not fill its jails with nonviolent drug offenders. It does not fill its jails with simple users. The majority of felons in our jails for drug crimes are there for trafficking and violent crimes. In the face of the drug epidemic, Congress passed and the public supported tougher sentencing for dealers and traffickers who pushed crack to our kids.  Now, however, the administration is planning to walk backwards on crack. The administration plans to deal with a disparity in crack and powder cocaine sentencing by reducing sentencing for crack. Instead of lowering the boom they're lowering the standards. This is hardly a message to be sending at a time when use of drugs is on the rise. But it is in character with what we have seen.  From our borders to our streets, we see a similar image. We see disarray and a lack of seriousness. Let me share with you one last example to illustrate why I am a little frustrated. Recently, $3.5 million was set aside on ONDCP's budget to assist parent groups in prevention work with youth. Keep that number, $3.5 million in mind. Remember, it was intended to support parent groups. Also keep in mind that these groups have a long track record of working with parents on drug prevention. Now, here goes. Of that $3.5 million, ONDCP pocketed $500,000 that did not go to the parent groups. That leaves $3 million. So far so good. That money was transferred to the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) at HHS. Of that, it appears that CSAP kept $600,000, presumably for administrative costs. That leaves $2.4 million for parent groups. Of that, CSAP awarded a private contractor, with no experience in parent movements and drug prevention, some $900,000. The purpose was to develop a program for parent groups. Never mind that the parent groups were the experts. Never mind that the contractor then had to spend its money talking to these same parent groups on how to help parent groups. Never mind that the parent groups have disavowed the resulting study and the proposed prevention effort as unworkable. That left roughly $1.5 million for the parent groups. That is to be spread over 2 years. It is to be shared by several different groups. The result? Each group will receive less than $70,000 a year, hardly enough to cover their costs. Is it any wonder that so many prevention groups have a hearty dislike for CSAP. This is hardly a reassuring story. It is, unfortunately, not atypical. It is a small example that explains a lot.  These are only some of the examples of problems in our drug control program. I will have more to say about failures and shortcomings in our international efforts later. The story there is just as grim.                               Exhibit 1                  Dubious Data Made Headlines in 1997       Each year at this time, the Statistical Assessment Service,      a Washington research organization that abbreviates itself      STATS, releases its annual list of the most absurd, amusing      and alarming science and statistical news stories of 1997.       Herewith, a few of the group's choices. The full list may      be found on the World Wide Web at www.stats.org.       Study Links Cancer Deaths to Site--Associated Press, Sept.      11.       The AP reported on a new study that linked low levels of      radioactivity to cancer deaths among nuclear workers. The      researchers found that 29 percent of all deaths among former      employees of the Rocketdyne Santa Susana Field Laboratory      were attributable to cancer.       Sounds pretty scary, but compared to what? For the general      population, 35 percent of all deaths of those between 44 and      65 years of age are attributable to cancer, as are 25 percent      for all deaths of those over 44, according to the National      Center for Health Statistics. So the workers died from cancer      at about the same rate as anyone else.                      your child's brain on drugs       Teen Drug Use Dips Down--Associated Press, Aug. 7.       Drug Use Rising Among Young Adults--Associated Press, a few      hours later the same day.       These dueling headlines were based on the same National      Household Study on Drug Abuse survey, which found that      illicit drug use among the young was up, alarmingly in some      cases. The AP's first headline and the story accompanying it      illustrate the perils of data slicing--focusing on only one      segment of the study population--and a failure to appreciate      a concept called statistical significance. According to the      study, young people between ages 12 and 15 did report a      slight decline in the use of marijuana.       But another age bracket, dubbed ``young adults'' 18 to 25,      showed a significant increase in marijuana use. More      importantly, the drop among younger people was not      statistically significant, which means there's a fair chance      that the apparent decrease was due to sampling error.                        younger than springtime       Premature Puberty: Is Early Sexual Development the Price of      Pollution?--E-The Environmental Magazine, Nov./Dec. issue.       In April, a study published in the medical journal      Pediatrics reported that the mean age of onset of      menstruation occurred at 12.2 years for African American      girls and 12.9 years for white girls.       As The Washington Post correctly reported, this meant that      American girls were ``developing pubertal characteristics at      younger ages than currently used norms,'' which were based on      a study of British girls in the 1950s.       But many journalists interpreted the findings as an      alarming new trend toward lower ages for puberty.       This produced scary headlines such as ``Girls Facing the      Perils of Puberty Earlier'' (Hartford Courant), ``Puberty      Find Could Point to Danger'' (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette) and      ``Girls Hitting Puberty at an Earlier Age; Some Worry      Environmental Estrogens Could be Behind a New Study's      Findings'' (Des Moines Register).       These fears of pollution-induced puberty ignored the fact      that, as The Post reported, ``the age at which girls first      menstruate hasn't changed much since 1950.''
