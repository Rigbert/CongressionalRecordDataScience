 President, today I am pleased to join with Senators Durbin and Kennedy in introducing the Firearms by Foreign Convicts Clarification Act. This bill would close a loophole that exists in current law, by stating that people convicted of foreign felonies and domestic violence, just like people convicted of similar American crimes, cannot possess firearms in the United States.  I imagine that most Americans may be surprised, as I was, to learn that foreign felons actually have greater gun rights than American citizens who have been convicted of felonies and domestic violence in our own courts. Our country has been trying to keep guns out of the hands of criminals for at least the last 40 years, since the landmark Gun Control Act of 1968. Unfortunately, in 2005 the Supreme Court created a gaping loophole in this longstanding felon-in-possession law.  That happened in the case of Small v. United States, where a majority of the Court essentially held that foreign convictions don't count for the purpose of being a felon in possession of a firearm. This was not because the Justices somehow thought that exempting foreign convictions from our felon-in-possession laws was wise public policy. In fact, as Justice Thomas noted in his dissent, ``the majority's interpretation permits those convicted overseas of murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, terrorism and other dangerous crimes to possess firearms freely in the United States.''  The problem in Small was that a majority of the Court felt that our 1968 law had not been written clearly enough. Although Congress had said that a person convicted of a felony ``in any court'' could not possess a firearm, the majority said that this phrase, ``any court,'' might have been meant to apply only to ``any American court'' rather than what the legislation actually said--``any court.''  The Federal felon-in-possession law had already been applied to foreign felons in several prosecutions since 1968, but the Court found unpersuasive both this history and the statute's express language. Dissenting Justices Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy accused the majority of creating a novel canon of legal construction that will ``wreak havoc'' with established rules of extraterritorial construction. But whatever we may think of the Court's analysis, there is no doubt that the Small decision is now the law of the land. And if we want to close this legal loophole, it is clear that we need to pass some clarifying legislation. The bill I introduce today would do just that.  Under this bill, section 921 of Title 18, the definitions section, would be amended to state clearly that ``[t]he term `any court' includes any Federal, State, or foreign court.'' Similar changes would be made in other sections of the Gun Control Act, where there are references to ``state offenses'' or ``offenses under state law, the bill would expand these terms to include convictions of foreign offenses and offenses under foreign law.  In other words, the bill would make clear that if someone is convicted in a foreign court of an offense that would have disqualified him from possessing a gun if that conviction had been handeddown in the U.S., the same laws relating to gun possession will be applied. The only exception will be if there is reason to think the conviction entered by the foreign jurisdiction is somehow invalid.  In that situation, this bill would create an exemption, allowing a person convicted in a foreign jurisdiction to challenge its validity. Under the bill, a foreign conviction will not constitute a ``conviction'' for purposes of the felon-in-possession laws, if the foreign conviction either (1) resulted from a denial of fundamental fairness that would violate due process if committed in the United States, or (2) if the conduct on which the foreign conviction was based would be legal if committed in the United States.  I expect that these circumstances will be fairly rare, but the bill does take them into account and will provide a complete defense to anyone with an invalid foreign conviction. And in any event, it is clear that we should not keep in place a policy in which the tail wags the dog. The current state of the law is that we essentially treat every foreign conviction as invalid. And that is simply illogical.  An example of why we need to fix this law occurred in 2001, when U.S. agents with bulletproof vests raided the New York hotel room of suspect Rohan Ingram. Ingram was found with 13 firearms and had an extensive criminal background, including at least 18 convictions for crimes such as assault and use of firearms during crimes. Law enforcement had flagged him as ``armed and dangerous.'' But because all of his convictions had occurred in foreign courts, his felon-in-possession charge was eventually thrown out of court. That is simply not a tolerable state of affairs in a post- 9/11 world.  Particularly in these times, America cannot continue to give foreign-convicted murderers, rapists and even terrorists an unlimited right to buy firearms in the United States, including even assault weapons that they might try to send to colleagues abroad, or use to develop a cache of weapons to use to kill our citizens within the United States. American citizens convicted of identical crimes at home are denied the ability to buy and possess such firearms, and the time has come to fix this loophole so that foreign convicts are placed in the same category.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1316       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
