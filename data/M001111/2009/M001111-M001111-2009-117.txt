 President, for the information of my colleagues, the funding levels contained in the bill are consistent with the budget resolution the Senate passed and agreed to this Spring. We are $1.2 billion below the level of funding requested by the President.  We worked very hard to balance the important safety, transportation and accounting needs of this Nation. We urge you to defeat this amendment.
