Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today to urge strong support for H.R. 390, the bipartisan Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act.  I want to begin by offering my special thanks to Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy for his strong and sustained support for the victims of genocide, forthis bill, and for the work of his amazing staff, especially Luke Murry, who has done yeoman's work on making sure that this moves forward; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, for their work; as well as our friends on the Senate side.  I especially want to thank Ed Royce, our chairman, and Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their wonderful support for this bill, and for all the Members.  I want to thank Anna Eshoo, who has been tenacious in her support for genocide-targeted communities in Iraq and Syria, and Matt McMurray, her chief of staff, who has also been a great friend to work with on this legislation.  My thanks to Mary Noonan, my chief of staff; Piero Tozzi, my staff director for the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee; Nathaniel Hurd at the U.S. Helsinki Commission, who has been lead staffer on the bill; David Trimble, senior fellow at the Religious Freedom Institute; and so many others who have been a part of this effort to get this across the finish line.  Mr. Speaker, in September of 2013, I chaired my first of 10 congressional hearings focused in whole or in part on Christians, Yazidis, and other religious and ethnic minorities targeted by ISIS for genocide and other atrocity crimes, frustrated and deeply disappointed that the previous administration was failing to direct aid to these survivors and to support criminal investigations into the perpetrators. Three years later, on September 8, 2016, I introduced H.R. 5961.  It was clear then, as it is now, that local overstretched, underfunded groups on the ground were being forced to fill a huge gap, like the Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, supported by the Knights of Columbus under the extraordinary leadership of Carl Anderson and by Aid to the Church in Need. To date, the Knights of Columbus has contributed $20 million and Aid to the Church in Need has contributed more than $60 million to the response for these people who are the survivors of genocide. Without this support from private charities, Mr. Speaker, many people, especially children, would have died or have been afflicted with serious disease or disability.  Where was the United States? Nowhere to be found.  Just before Christmas of 2016, I led a delegation to Erbil at the invitation of the Chaldean Archbishop of Erbil, Bashar Warda, who was heroically leading the effort to sustain more than 70,000 Christians who had fled ISIS, as well as some Yazidis and Muslims.  There I met with genocide survivors, almost all of whom told me that they had family members who were murdered, tortured, beaten, and raped by ISIS. Their stories were tragic beyond words and heartbreaking beyond words, but members of my delegation and I were in awe of their deep and abiding faith in God, their resiliency, and their courage. They simply would not quit. They would move on and try to live a life and try to thrive.  We visited a camp of 6,000 internally displaced persons, managed by the archdiocese, that the U.S. Government had not even visited until just before our trip in 2016, even though it was only 10 minutes away from the consulate. I was told I shouldn't go because it was too dangerous. I asked, ``Was there a specific threat?'' and there wasn't.  When we got there, we were met by about 250 to 300 children, all about fourth or fifth graders or thereabouts, singing Christmas carols, and I felt, ``Boy, that is a real threatening situation.'' It was foolish in the extreme.  They needed our help. They were not getting enough food. They were not getting enough medicine, and their shelter was very meager, to say the least.  On January 10, 2017, I introduced H.R. 390, a stronger version of the previous bill. The House unanimously passed it--again, totally bipartisan--on June 6. On October 11, the Senate passed it with a slightly amended version, which is why it is here before the House today for reconsideration.                              {time}  1800  H.R. 390 authorizes the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Secretary of State to direct humanitarian, stabilization, and recovery assistance to these communities to enable them to survive and someday thrive in Iraq and Syria.  It also authorizes the Secretary and the Administrator to fund entities conducting criminal investigations into ISIS perpetrators who committed atrocity crimes in Iraq. The evidence these entities collect and preserve will be used to apprehend, prosecute, and convict perpetrators in a range of court settings.  We have learned from the courts in Rwanda, in Sierra Leone, as well as the court in Yugoslavia, you have to capture this information. You have to get the testimonies from survivors and eyewitnesses to effectuate effective prosecutions.  The surviving religious and ethnic communities have begun to receive some targeted aid from the United States under the leadership of Vice President Pence, USAID Administrator Green, and Secretary Pompeo. The governments of Hungary and Poland, as well, have stepped up to provide assistance to those in need.  However, we have to move quickly on this bill and on implementation on this. As Archbishop Warda, the head of Chaldean Catholic Church there, told me today: ``Christians in Iraq are still at the brink of extinction. H.R. 390 is vital to our survival. If it becomes law, implementation must be full and fast. Otherwise, the help it provides will be too late for us.''  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
