 President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the efforts of Senators Levin, Voinovich, Hutchison, myself, and others to modify the USA PATRIOT Act formula for homeland security grants. This formula, as currently interpreted by the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, greatly disadvantages larger States.  Unfortunately, as Senator Levin stated earlier, it looks as though we will not be able to use the Homeland Security Appropriations bill to make such a modification. Any such amendment would face a point of order and fail.  However, we will be back. I intend to continue to raise this issue in the Senate until we finally change existing law to ensure that the DHS has the authority to distribute homeland security money fairly to all States.  In my view, the Department should distribute homeland security funds according to population or, at a minimum, according to threat and vulnerability assessments, location of critical infrastructure, and population density.  On March 7, 2003, DHS released their State-by-State allocations for the $566 million State Homeland Security Grant Program.  Although this program is described as being distributed on the basis of population, smaller States received a higher level of funding on a per capita basis than larger States.  For instance, California received $1.33 per capita while Wyoming received $9.78 per capita. This means that residents of Wyoming received more than five times what residents of California received. The national average was $1.98 per capita.  However, if you look at all the homeland security grants awarded by the DHS Office of Domestic Preparedness, ODP, for FY 2003, the numbers are even worse. This fiscal year, California received $4.85 per capita in ODP homeland security grants and Wyoming received $35.67 per capita. In other words, residents of Wyoming received more than seven times what residents of California received.  I do not want to pick on Wyoming or focus inordinately on California. The issue is not about any State in particular. It is about the fact that States with large populations and large amounts of critical infrastructure are more vulnerable to terrorism and also generally subject to more credible terrorist threats.  However, since I represent California in this distinguished body, I do want to explain why I believe that California--as other populous States has been shortchanged on homeland security grants.  California is what people in the counterterrorism field called a ``target-rich'' environment. We have two of the biggest seaports in the country, Disneyland, the Golden Gate Bridge, two of the biggest ports in the country, some of the busiest airports in the country, and much else as well.  Moreover, with the release of a congressional report today on intelligence failures by the FBI and CIA, the American people now know that at least several of the September 11 hijackers had numerous links with California. And, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I can assure you that terrorists and their sympathizers continue to operate in California.  Finally, we have all heard about credible threats to important tourism and commercial sites in California--and those are just the ones that have become public.  However, in spite of all this, my State received this fiscal year less than one-seventh per capita of ODP homeland security grants than the least populous State--a State that is not a target-rich environment, has little if any connection with any terrorists, and has been subject to few if any terrorist threats.  In my view, that is absurd.  Americans in every State should be more afraid knowing that a disproportionate amount of homeland security money is flowing into States that may not need that money.  The reason that homeland security grant allocations favor small States is because of the way that ODP applies Sec. 1014 of the PATRIOT Act.  Under the USA PATRIOT Act, ODP gives each State .75 percent and each territory .25 percent of the appropriation for homeland security grants.  For the 50 States and five territories, these amounts total approximately 40 percent of the total appropriation.  However, the USA PATRIOT Act is silent on how ODP should distribute the remaining 60 percent. ODP has opted to distribute the remaining 60 percent based on population.  It is worth pointing out that the USA PATRIOT Act does not require that the .75 minimums be allocated first and then the remainder distributed according to population. ODP could, under the USA PATRIOT Act, distribute all the money according to population and then bump up any State that has not received .75 percent.  If ODP followed this method, it would mean millions of additional dollars for more populous States. I would urge ODP to look into using such a method.  In any event, because of the USA PATRIOT Act formula, California only received $149 million of the $1.87 billion appropriated in FY 2003 for the ODP State homeland security grant program about 8 percent of the total.  However, California has over 12 percent of the population and a disproportionate amount of the country's critical infrastructure--all terrorist targets of opportunity.  If this money had been allocated according to population, California would have received $76 million more for homeland security just this fiscal year.  There is no question that the USA PATRIOT Act formula greatly disadvantages California and other States with high threat potential. These are States that possess densely populated areas and critical infrastructure such as landmark buildings, large gathering places, stadiums, amusement parks, tall buildings, underground transit, bridges, and ports.  Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge has made this very point over and over. For example, in a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, he expressed frustration with the USA PATRIOT Act formula and urged that Congress enact legislation that would require such money to be distributed based on the likely terrorist theat and vulnerability of a given area.  Most reasonable observers agree. It is ludicrous to pour homeland security money into small, rural States that are at little risk of terrorist attack and shortchange States that have densely populated centers and/or have critical infrastructure.  It is also worth noting that the .75 small State minimums are not applied to other grant programs. In an exhaustive survey of Federal grant programs, we could find only two grant programs that used such a high percentage for State minimums: State homeland security grants and sport fish restoration grants.  While an argument could be made that perhaps less populous States deserve more sport fish restoration money, that argument fails with regard to homeland security. The fact remains that the areas most vulnerable to terrorist attack are large cities and those with critical infrastructure, which tend to be in more populous States.  Grant programs other than for homeland security or sport fishing restoration have either no small State minimums, percentages ranging from .25 percent to .50 percent, or minimum dollar figures.  The current formula for allocating homeland security grants is unfair and illogical. And, to be brutally honest, it wastes taxpayers' money by sending to it to areas where it may not be needed. I urge my colleagues to support efforts to modify this formula.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart listing Homeland Security grants per capita.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        FISCAL YEAR 2003 ODP HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS PER CAPITA                      [Grant dollars in thousands]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             Per capita        Rank and state           ODP grants    2000 Census    spending------------------------------------------------------------------------1.
