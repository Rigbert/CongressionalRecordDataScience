And what they're saying is that, well, you know, it isn't our fault that this happened. It's the fault of those Americans down there who lost their jobs and they maybe won't be able to pay their mortgages, right? Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why did they lose their jobs, and why can't unemployment benefits at least be used in the interim to help people stay in their homes for the next year until we can try to get this economy to recover?  And so the very institutions that are not working out loans at the local level and making billions and billions and billions of dollars more in profits and in bonuses are saying to us, Oh, it's not our fault. It's the fault of the American people who wanted to own a house. You know, it's really their problem that they got put out of work, when, in fact, these institutions aren't loaning money to our small businesses that want to employ people. They're not doing mortgage workouts at the local level. They are not taking any principle write-downs, which they could do, and in a formal FDIC bank regulatory process that would happen. They're not serious. They're not serious at the bargaining table. They are not even returning calls to our Realtors at the local level. We're trying to reach accommodation on short sales. We've been trying to reach accommodation on short sales for 2 years. They're standing up the Realtors across this country as we get more and more foreclosures around this Nation. We have to focus on the big six.
