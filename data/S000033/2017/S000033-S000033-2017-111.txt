 President, in the U.S. Senate, it is the Parliamentarian's office that determines whether a reconciliation bill is in compliance with the rules of the Senate. That is not the function of the chairman of the Budget Committee. If it were, we could save taxpayers' money and get rid of the Parliamentarian's office, but that is not what we should be doing.  I am extremely concerned, therefore, that the chairman of the Budget Committee, in an apparently unprecedented manner, appears to have made that determination himself with regard to the Trump-Ryan healthcare bill that was passed several weeks ago in the House. As I understand it, the Parliamentarian has made a narrow ruling with respect to the jurisdiction of a provision in this bill that would eliminate healthcare subsidies for low-income Native Americans.  I look forward to hearing from the Parliamentarian as soon as possible on the broader ruling on whether the Trump-Ryan healthcare bill is in compliance with the instructions contained in the budget resolution requiring this bill to save at least $1 billion in the HELP Committee and at least $1 billion within the Finance Committee.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Oregon.               HONORING THE HEROES OF THE PORTLAND ATTACK
