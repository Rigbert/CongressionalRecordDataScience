President, today I am introducing the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act.  On August 26, 2004, President Bush signed Executive Order 13352 promoting a new approach to conservation within the Federal government's conservation and environmental departments. This Executive Order was offered to ensure that Federal agencies pursue cooperative conservation actions designed to involve private landowners rather than simply making mandates which private landowners must fulfill.  An example of this new cooperative conservation is the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. Since 1987, the Partners Program has been a successful voluntary partnership program that helps private landowners restore fish and wildlife habitat on their own lands.Through 33,103 agreements with private landowners, the Partners Program has accomplished the restoration of 677,000 acres of wetlands, 1,253,700 acres of prairies and native grasslands, and 5,560 miles of riparian and in-stream habitat. Partners Program agreements are funded through contributions from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service along with cash and in-kind contributions from participating private landowners. Since 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has provided $3,511,121 to restore habitat in Oklahoma through the Partners Program, to which private landowners have contributed $12,638,272.  In Oklahoma, 97 percent of land is held in private ownership. Since 1990, a total of 124,285 acres in Oklahoma has been restored through 700 individual Partners Program voluntary agreements with private landowners. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service District Office in Tulsa currently reports that at least another 100 private landowners are waiting to enter into Partner's projects as soon as funds become available.  As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, a new approach to conservation is especially important to me. All conservation programs should create positive incentives to protect species and, above all, should hold sacred the rights of private landowners. A positive step toward those aims is authorization of the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program which has already proven to be an effective habitat conservation program that leverages federal funds and utilizes voluntary private landowner participation. To date, the Partners Program has received little attention. My bill will build on this successful program to provide additional funding and added stability.  I am pleased to author legislation to authorize a program with a proven record in positive and actual conservation.                                 ______                                       By
