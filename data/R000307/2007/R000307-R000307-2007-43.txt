As a result of this and storms associated with the system, 12 Kansans are confirmed dead--and I fear that number may still rise--and all of the 1,500 residents of Greensburg have been displaced.  What we have experienced in Greensburg is unlike any other event in recent Kansas history. The hospital is gone. The schools are gone. Every church is gone. Virtually every business in the community is gone, including all of Main Street. Estimates are that fully 95 percent of the structures in the town are damaged and destroyed.  But this is not all. Even as cleanup is starting, more storms continue to pound our State. Flooding and strong storms continue to compound the problem.  Too often, while government does not communicate and work well as partners in times of need and emergency, sometimes we could double that for Congress. However, this weekend my fellow Kansas Congressman and the Governor of Kansas and I all toured the devastated town of Greensburg. We were accompanied by our State's top-notch emergency officials. I spoke extensively with all levels of FEMA, in an effort to make sure they had everything they needed to move into place, and I talked to President Bush to give him a personal update from a McDonald's in Pratt, KS. Let me tell you, there is nothing quite like speaking to the President of the United States from a phonebooth in a local McDonald's to let the surrounding residents know their Government does mean business.  The President has been very supportive. We have been notified by the White House that he will be making a trip to Kansas to personally view the damage and visit with the people of Greensburg. The credit for this not only falls on Federal shoulders but those of our National Guard, all of the first responders, Red Cross, and many volunteers who, along with President Bush and the FEMA team and our State officials, are now working 24/7 to make it possible for the residents of Greensburg to rebuild and return home.  I stood here this winter, following a blizzard that buried much of western Kansas, and proclaimed the resiliency of Kansans, our willingness to help each other and our sheer determination when faced with great odds. That determination is being tested again, but I have no doubt in the coming days and weeks and months that the story of Greensburg will progress from one of horrible tragedy to one of optimism and hope for the future as we help one another rebuild, one brick at a time. It may be possible, indeed likely, that as we move forward, we may need additional emergency assistance or legislation from Congress to assist the residents of the town that no longer exists. I put our Senate leadership and all our colleagues on notice today that we will likely be coming to you with any requests for assistance to rebuild this Kansas community.                          ____________________
