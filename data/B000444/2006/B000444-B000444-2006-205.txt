 President, today, I am introducing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Implementation Act of 2006. This legislation will provide $41.625 billion over the next 10 years to help ensure that we implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.  Back in July of 2004, the 9/11 Commission--with distinguished bipartisan leadership from former Republican Governor Tom Kean and former Congressman Lee Hamilton--issued its report with recommendations of what the government should do to help better protect the Nation.  Nearly a year and a half later, they issued a so-called report card to tell us how well the government had been doing at implementing their recommendations.  Well, it doesn't look good. That report card was riddled with Cs, Ds, Fs, and incompletes.  Most Americans believe that we've taken the obvious steps to close the gaps in our homeland defense. They believe that at the very least, we have a plan, that we've set priorities, and that we know what the next steps are.  But, let me quote from the Commission's report card from December on what we've done to assess the risks and vulnerabilities of our critical infrastructure--transportation, communications, and industrial assets.  Here's what they say--and I quote--``no risk and vulnerability assessments have actually been made. No national priorities are yet established. No recommendations have been made on the allocation of scarce resources. All key decisions on homeland security are at least a year away.''  We all remember 9/11, when we learned for the first time that local police, fire, and rescue units could not communicate with each other and could not communicate with Federal agencies. We saw how this inability probably resulted in many deaths that could have been prevented. Well, we learned during Hurricane Katrina that things are no better today. No better today.  The one place I think most Americans think we've probably done pretty well--passenger screening--actually got an ``F.'' The 9/11 commission reports stated that, in fact, ``few improvements have been made to the existing passenger screening system since right after 9/11.'' With respect to checked bag and cargo screening for commercial flights, the 9/11 Commission gave a score of ``D'', stating that ``improvements have not been made a priority by Congress or the Bush Administration.''  This is unacceptable. This Administration hasn't even filled in the very obvious gaps in our homeland defense. We haven't done it. We simply haven't done it.  The bill that I am introducing today will ensure that we address the most obvious gaps in our homeland defense. It begins with those areas where the Commission graded us and the President as ``F'' and ``D.'' And, it addresses those areas that were outside the scope of the report but are commonsense things that we should be doing, such as securing the rails and providing funding for local law enforcement.  And it's pretty basic. We have done nothing much to deal with the problems most Americans know relate to homeland security. We are safer but not nearly safe enough. The bipartisan commission that got great grades from everybody in the Nation felt compelled on their own dime, their own money, their own resources, not funded by the government, to continue to issue reports and to hold hearings. And they issued a report on December 5 that is, quite frankly, embarrassing and dangerous.  We can and we have to marshal all our country's resources in this struggle. Do you think that the American people would rather us spend this money on securing our ports, our chemical plants, our railroads, our cities, or give it back as a tax break for the wealthiest Americans? Given the choice, the American people said, let's make our streets safer. I'm confident they think we should make the country safer. This legislation will help take us down that path, and I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By
