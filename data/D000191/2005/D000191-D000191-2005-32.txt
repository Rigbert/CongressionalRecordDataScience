  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, the Republicans are preparing for Thanksgiving, like many Americans. But early this morning they slaughtered the turkey. They chopped student loans, school lunch, foster care, long-term care, and Medicaid for struggling families. Now they are preparing to serve a huge portion, with gravy, to Americans with generous new tax breaks and extended tax cuts to those who earn more than $300,000 a year and who clip coupons for a living, hard-working Americans them.  They are a little worried about kind of the mixed metaphor here, whether or not they will be called Scrooge, and some people will confuse Thanksgiving and Christmas. So they might put the bird back in the freezer and wait until closer to Christmas and hope that the struggling students and families forget what was taken from them to help those who earn over $300,000 a year.  So that is the big decision on the Republican side of the aisle today. When does the turkey, composed of benefits that should have gone to struggling families, as a gift to the wealthy, get delivered, Thanksgiving or Christmas? Tough choice. Stay tuned.                          ____________________[Page H10912]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   REPUBLICANS CUT CRITICAL PROGRAMS  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
