Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump), the chairman of our full committee, for yielding me this time and for being a cosponsor and also extend my thanks to my good friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) as well for cosponsoring and for the bipartisanship that he brings to the committee.  I also want to thank a number of other Members. There are 42 cosponsors of this resolution, including the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), and several other Members who are deeply committed to remembering all veterans, but in particular those who fought in the Battle of the Bulge.  Mr. Speaker, today the House will rightly honor the Americans and allied forces who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. As the son of a World War II combat infantryman who fought in the other major theatre in World War II, he fought in New Guinea, the Philippines, and several islands in the Pacific, I urge all Members to enthusiastically support House Joint Resolution 65, which was introduced to recognize the 55th anniversary of the largest battle in the history of U.S. modern warfare, the Battle of the Bulge.  H.J. Res. 65, as amended, was marked up in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs as well as the Committee on International Relations, and, hopefully, will get the unanimous support of this body.  Let me also thank the veterans of the Battle of the Bulge Association, an organization that was formed back in 1981. They now have about 10,000 members. And the idea behind it is to perpetuate the memory of the sacrifices involved during the battle, to preserve historical data and sites relating to the battle, and to foster international peace and good will, and to promote friendship among the battle survivors as well as their descendants.  I also want to thank Stan Wojtuski, the National Vice President of Military Affairs for the Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge for his work on this resolution, and Mrs. Edith Nowels, a constituent of mine living in Brielle, New Jersey. She has worked very closely in crafting this resolution, and I am very grateful for that.  I think it is very important to point out that Edith Nowels' brother, Bud Thorne, was killed in action during the battle, and was awarded the Medal of Honor along with 17 others who received that highest of medals for their valor and bravery. There were also 86 servicemen who were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for their valor during this vital battle.  According to the citation presented to his family, Corporal Thorne single-handedly destroyed a German tank. And in the words of the citation, ``Displayed heroic initiative and intrepid fighting qualities, inflicted costly casualties on the enemy and insured the success of his patrol's mission by the sacrifice of his life.''  I would like to take just a very brief moment, Mr. Speaker, to provide a brief overview of the battle so that my colleagues will gain a better understanding as to why this chapter in World War II deserves special recognition today. One of the most decisive battles in the war in Europe, the Battle of the Bulge began on December 16, 1944, when the German Army, in an effort to trap the allied forces in Belgium and Luxembourg, launched an attack against what were perceived as a weak line of American and allied troops. Their goal was to submit the allied forces in Belgium and Luxembourg and race to the coast towards Antwerp.  Adolf Hitler and his generals knew the German Air Force could not maintain regional air superiority, so they were banking on bad weather and relatively green and a fatigued American troops, who were greatly outnumbered. At the outset of the battle, the German troops, forming three armies, numbered approximately 200,000 versus 83,000 Americans. Their goal was to capture bridges over the Meuse River in the first 48 hours of the attack and then press on to Antwerp.  At the time of their initial attack, the Germans had more than 13 infantry and 7 panzer divisions, with nearly 1,000 tanks and almost 2,000 larger guns deployed along the front of about 60 miles. Five more divisions were soon to follow, with at least 450 more tanks. Although the Americans were caught by surprise, they tenaciously fought back in those early days of the attackin December, holding the line in the north while the Nazis pushed through in the middle of the bulge towards the Meuse River.  One incident which particularly hardened the Americans and allied forces as to the intent of the German Army was the Malmedy Massacre. Eighty-six American POWs were murdered by the Nazis as they moved towards the capture of the Meuse River. The same German unit which was responsible for this infamous massacre eventually killed at least 300 American POWs and over 100 unarmed Belgium civilians. News of these horrific events outraged and further galvanized the will of American forces to prevail.  Recognizing what they were up against, General Eisenhower transferred the command of all American troops north of the bulge to British General Montgomery. Those south of the bulge were under the command of General Bradley. Meanwhile, the Germans were being slowed down by the dogged defense of the town at St. Vith by Brigadier General Hasbrouck. St. Vith was strategically important due to the number of key roads which met in the town and were essential to the German drive towards Antwerp.  General Patton's Third Army, under the command of General Bradley, was proceeding north to cut through the southern flank of the German bulge in the lines and provide relief to Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, whose refusal to surrender to his German counterparts at Bastogne on December 22 is forever known in history with that famous phrase, when he just said back to the Germans, ``Nuts.'' He would not surrender. He just said nuts to them, and they wondered what that meant.                              {time}  1100  He was not going to give in. As more American reinforcements arrived, eventually totaling 600,000 troops, they assisted in holding up the northern and southern flanks of the Nazi advances. Hitler's generals found that they were running out of fuel and that their hope of seizing allied fuel supplies was becoming a pipe dream and their race to the Meuse river slowed down to a crawl. While Adolph Hitler insisted on pressing with air strikes against advancing allied reinforcements, his generals knew that they had been beaten, and he eventually authorized the retreat of his armies at the end of January.  Mr. Speaker, the cost in lives from this engagement is astronomical and absolutely staggering. The American armies had more than 81,000 casualties; and of these, 19,000 men were killed in action. The British had 1,400 casualties with 200 killed. Both sides lost as many as 800 tanks each, and the Germans lost 1,000 planes. All told, it was one of the largest pitched battles in history with more than three times the number of troops from both the North and the South that engaged in the Battle of Gettysburg. Three times the size of Gettysburg. In the words of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and I quote, in addressing the House of Commons, he said, ``This is undoubtedly the greatest battle of the war and will I believe be regarded as an ever-famous American victory.''  Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will support this resolution. The veterans of the Battle of the Bulge every year travel to Europe and reacquaint themselves with those with whom they fought side by side and those that they liberated. They will be meeting again soon in both Luxembourg and Belgium. I hope we will go on record supporting their efforts, their valor and this resolution puts all of us on record in that regard.

However, the half century      that now separates us from that conflict has exacted its toll      on our collective knowledge. While World War II continues to      absorb the interest of military scholars and historians, as      well as its veterans, a generation of Americans has grown to      maturity largely unaware of the political, social, and      military implications of a war that, more than any other,      united us as a people with a common purpose.       Highly relevant today, World War II has much to teach us,      not only about the profession of arms, but also about      military preparedness, global strategy, and combined      operations in the coalition war against fascism. During the      next several years, the U.S. Army will participate in the      nation's 50th anniversary commemoration of World War II. The      commemoration will include the publication of various      materials to help educate Americans about that war. The works      produced will provide great opportunities to learn about and      renew pride in an Army that fought so magnificently in what      has been called ``the mighty endeavor.''       World War II was waged on land, on sea, and in the air over      several diverse theaters of operation for approximately six      years. The following essay is one of a series of campaign      studies highlighting those struggles that, with their      accompanying suggestions for further reading, are designed to      introduce you to one of the Army's significant military feats      from that war.       This brochure was prepared in the U.S. Army Center of      Military History by Roger Cirillo. I hope this absorbing      account of that period will enhance your appreciation of      American achievements during World War II.                                               Gordon R. Sullivan,                       General, United States Army Chief of Staff.                            Ardennes-Alsace                    16 December 1944-25 January 1945       In his political testament Mein Kampf (``My Struggle'')      Adolf Hitler wrote, ``Strength lies not in defense but in      attack.'' Throughout World War II, attempts to gain or regain      the initiative had characterized Hitler's influence on      military operations. Thus, when the military situation in      late 1944 looked darkest on the Western Front, an enemy      offensive to redress the balance of the battlefield--and      thereby cripple or delay the Allied advance--should have come      as no surprise.       Hitler's great gamble began during the nights of 13, 14,      and 15 December, when the initial assault force of German      armor, artillery, and infantry gradually staged forward to      attack positions along the Belgian-German-Luxembourg border.      This mustered force, with more than 200,000 men in thirteen      infantry and seven panzer divisions and with nearly 1,000      tanks and almost 2,000 guns, deployed along a front of 60      miles--its operational armor holdings equaling that on the      entire Eastern Front. Five more divisions moved forward in a      second wave, while still others, equipped with at least 450      more tanks, followed in reserve.       On the Allied side the threatened American sector appeared      quiet. The 15 December daily situation report for the VIII      Corps, which lay in the path of two of Hitler's armies,      noted: ``There is nothing to report.'' This illusion would      soon be shattered.                           Strategic Setting       In August 1944, while his armies were being destroyed in      Normandy, Hitler secretly put in motion actions to build a      large reserve force, forbidding its use to bolster Germany's      beleaguered defenses. To provide the needed manpower, he      trimmed existing military forces and conscripted youths, the      unfit, and old men previously untouched for military service.      Panzer divisions were rebuilt with the cadre of survivors      from units in Normandy or on the Eastern Front, while newly      created Volksgrenadier (``people's infantry'') divisions were      staffed with veteran commanders and noncommissioned officers      and the new conscripts. By increasing the number of automatic      weapons and the number of supporting assault gun and rocket      battalions in each division, Hitler hoped to make up for      hurried training and the lack of fighting fitness. Despite      the massive Allied air bombardment of Germany and the      constant need to replace destroyed divisions on both the      Eastern and Western Fronts, where heavy fighting continued,      forces were gathered for use in what Hitler was now calling      Operation Wacht am Rhine (``Watch on the Rhine'').       In September Hitler named the post of Antwerp, Belgium, as      the objective. Selecting the Eifel region as a staging area,      Hitler intended to mass twenty-five divisions for an attack      through the thinly held Ardennes Forest area of southern      Belgium and Luxembourg. Once the Meuse River was reached and      crossed, these forces would swing northwest some 60 miles to      envelop the port of Antwerp. The maneuver was designed to      sever the already stretched Allied supply lines in the north      and to encircle and destroy a third of the Allies' ground      forces. If successful, Hitler believed that the offensive      could smash the Allied coalition, or at least greatly cripple      its ground combat capabilities, leaving him free to focus on      the Russians at his back door.       Timing was crucial. Allied air power ruled the skies during      the day, making any open concentrations of German military      strength on the ground extremely risky. Hitler, therefore,      scheduled the offensive to take place when inclement weather      would ground Allied planes, or at least limit their attacks      on his     advancing columns. Because the requisite forces and supplies      had to be assembled, he postponed the starting date from      November until mid-December. This additional preparation      time, however, did not ease the minds of the few German      generals and staff officers entrusted with planning Wacht am      Rhine.       Both the nominal Commander-in-Chief West Field Marshal Gerd      von Rundstedt and Army Group B commander Field Marshal Walter      Model, who had primary responsibility for Wacht am Rhine,      questioned the scope of the offensive. Both argued for a more      limited attack, to pinch out the American-held salient north      of the Ardennes around Aachen. Borrowing a bridge-players      term, they referred to Hitler's larger objectives as the      grand slam, or big solution, but proposed instead a small      solution more compatible with the limited force being raised.       Rundstedt and Model believed that Hitler's legions were      incapable of conducting a blitzkrieg, or lightning war,      campaign. The twin swords that had dominated the field during      the 1940 drive across France, tanks and air power, no longer      existed in the numbers necessary to strike a decisive blow,      nor was the hastily conscripted infantry, even when led by      experienced officers and sergeants, up to the early war      standards. Supply columns, too, would be prone to      interdiction or breakdown on the Eifel's limited roads. To      Hitler's generals, the grand slam was simply asking for too      much to be done with too little at hand.       The determining factor was the terrain itself. The Ardennes      consists of a series of parallel ridges and valleys generally      running from northeast to southwest, as did its few good      roads in 1944. About a third of the region is coniferous      forest, with swamps and marshes in the northlands and deep      defiles and gorges where numerous rivers and streams cut the      ridges. Dirt secondary roads existed, making north-south      movement possible, with the road centers--Bastogne and      Houffalize in the south, and Malmedy and St. Vith in the      north--crucial for military operations. After the winter's      first freeze, tanks could move cross-country in much of the      central sector. Fall 1944, however, brought the promise of      mud, because of rain, and the advancing days of December, the      promise of snow. Either could limit the quick advance needed      by Wacht am Rhine. Once the Meuse River, west of the      Ardennes, was gained, the wide river itself and cliffs on the      east bank presented a significant obstacle if the bridges      were not captured intact. Since the roads and terrain leading      to Antwerp thereafter were good, the German planners focused      on the initial breakthrough and the run west to the Meuse.      The terrain, which made so little sense as an attack avenue      northwestward, guaranteed the surprise needed.       Previous offensives through the Ardennes in World War I and      early in World War II had followed the major roads      southwestward, and had been made in good weather. The      defenses then had always been light screens, easily pushed      away. In 1940 the weakly opposed German armor needed three      days to traverse the easier terrain in the southern Ardennes      in good weather, on dry roads. For Wacht am Rhine, the      American line had to be broken and crushed immediately to      open paths for the attacking panzers; otherwise, the      offensive might bog down into a series of fights for roads      and the numerous villages on the way to the Meuse.      Precious fuel would be used to deploy tanks to fight      across fields. More importantly, time would be lost giving      the defenders the opportunity to position blocking forces      or to attack enemy flanks. Only surprise, sheer weight of      numbers, and minimal hard fighting could guarantee a      chance at success. If the Americans fought long and well,      the same terrain that guaranteed surprise would become a      trap.       The Ardennes held little fascination for the Allies, either      as a staging area for their own counterattacks or as a weak      spot in their lines. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the      Supreme Allied Commander, had concentrated forces north and      south of the area where the terrain was better suited for      operations into Germany. Field Marshal Sir Bernard L.      Montgomery's 21 Army Group to the north began preparations      for the planned crossing of the Rhine in early 1945. Lt. Gen.      Omar N. Bradley's 12th Army Group to the south and Lt. Gen.      Jacob L. Devers' 6th Army Group in the Alsace region would      also launch attacks and additional Rhine crossings from their      sectors.       Located in the center of Bradley's sector, the Ardennes had      been quiet since mid-September. Referred to as a ``ghost      front,'' one company commander described the sector as a      ``nursery and old folk's home. . . .'' The 12th Army Group's      dispositions reflected Bradley's operational plans. Lt. Gen.      William H. Simpson's Ninth Army and most of Lt. Gen. Courtney      H. Hodges' First Army occupied a 40-mile area north of the      Ardennes, concentrating for an attack into the Ruhr      industrial region of Germany. Lt. Gen. George S. Patton,      Jr.'s Third Army was in a 100-mile sector south of the      forest, preparing a thrust into the vital Saar mining region.      In between, the First Army hold 88 miles of the front with      only four divisions, two ``green'' units occupying ground to      gain experience and two veteran units licking wounds and      absorbing replacements; an armored infantry battalion; and      two mechanized cavalry squadrons. Behind this thin screen was      one green armored division, whose two uncommitted combat      commands straddled two separate corps, as well as a cavalry      squadron and an assortment of artillery, engineer, and      service units.       Bradley judged his decision to keep the Ardennes front      thinly occupied to be ``a calculated risk.'' Nor was he alone      in not seeing danger. Probability, not capability, dominated      Allied thinking about the Wehrmacht's next moves on the      Western Front in mid-December 1944. Commanders and      intelligence officers (G-2) at every level--from the Supreme      Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), to the      divisions holding the line--judged that the Germans were too      weak to attempt regaining the initiative by a large-scale      offensive. Despite their awareness that enemy units were      refitting and concentrating across the line, they concluded      exactly what Hitler had intended them to conclude. Knowing      that the Germans were concerned with major threats to both      the Ruhr and the Saar, Eisenhower's G-2 believed that they      probably would use the uncommitted Sixth Panzer Army,      suspected to be in the northern Eifel, to bolster their      weakening northern defenses, or at least to cripple the      impending Allied push toward the Ruhr. Both Hodges' and      Patton's G-2s viewed the enemy as a reflection of their own      operational plans and thus assessed the German buildup as no      more than preparations to counterattack the First and Third      Armies' assaults.       With only enough troops in the Ardennes to hold a series of      strongpoints loosely connected by intermittent patrols, the      Americans extended no ground reconnaissance into the German      sector. Poor weather had masked areas from aerial      photography, and the Germans enforced radio silence and      strict countersecurity measures. Equally important, the      Allies' top secret communications interception and      decryption effort, code-named Ultra, offered clues but no      definitive statement of Hitler's intentions. Yet Wacht am      Rhine's best security was the continued Allied belief that      the Germans would not attack, a belief held up to zero      hour on 16 December--designated by the Germans as Null-tag      (``Zero-Day'').                              Battle Plans       Field Marshal Model's attack plan, called Herbstnebel      (``Autumn Fog''), assigned Lt. Gen. Josef ``Sepp'' Dietrich's      Sixth Panzer Army the main effort. Dietrich would attack      Hodges' First Army along the boundary separating Maj. Gen.      Leonard T. Gerow's V Corps in the north from Maj. Gen. Troy      H. Middleton's VIII Corps to the south, brushing aside or      overrunning the V Corps' 99th Infantry Division and a cavalry      squadron of the VIII Corps' 14th Cavalry Group before driving      for the Meuse and Antwerp. South of the Sixth Panzer Army,      Lt. Gen. Hasso von Manteuffel's Fifth Panzer Army would hit      the VIII Corps' 106th Infantry Division and part of its 28th      Infantry Division, tearing open Middleton's thin front and      adding a secondary effort. Farther south, Lt. Gen. Erich      Brandenberger's Seventh Army would attack the remainder of      the 28th as well as the VIII Corps' 4th Infantry Division and      then cover the advance of the panzers as far as the Meuse      River. An airborne drop and infiltration by small teams      disguised in American uniforms were added to create havoc in      the American rear.       North of the Sixth Panzer Army, the six divisions of Lt.      Gen. Gustav von Zangen's Fifteenth Army had a dual role. In      addition to fighting and thereby holding American divisions      in the crucial Aachen sector, Zangen would attack southward      on order after Dietrich's panzers had broken the American      line, a variation of the pincers attack originally preferred      by Hitler's generals.       The Sixth Panzer Army was to attack in two waves. The first      would consist of the LXVII Corps, with the newly organized      272d and 326th Volksgrenadier Divisions, and the I SS Panzer      Corps, with the 1st and 12th SS Panzer, the 12th and 277th      Volksgrenadier, and the 3d Parachute Divisions. The 150th      Special Brigade and a parachute contingent would seize      terrain and bridges ahead of the main body after the two      corps broke through the American defenses. Dietrich planned      to commit his third corps, the II SS Panzer Corps, with the      2d and 9th SS Panzer Divisions, in the second wave. The Sixth      Panzer Army's 1,000-plus artillery pieces and 90 Tiger tanks      made it the strongest force deployed. Although Dietrich's      initial sector frontage was only 23 miles, his assault      concentrated on less than half that ground. Relying on at      least a 6:1 troop superiority at the breakthrough points, he      expected to overwhelm the Americans and reach the Meuse River      by nightfall of the third day.       According to Dietrich's plan, the LXVII Corps would secure      the Sixth Panzer Army's northern flank. By sidestepping      Monschau to seize the poorly roaded, forested hills and      upland moors of the Hohe Venn, the LXVII's two divisions      would block the main roads leading into the breakthrough area      from the north and east. Simultaneously, the I SS Panzer      Corps to the south would use its three infantry divisions to      punch holes in the American line and swing northwesterly to      join the left flank of the LXVII Corps. Together, the five      divisions would form a solid shoulder, behind which the      panzers of the I and II SS Panzer Corps would advance along      the Sixth Panzer Army's routes leading west and northwest.       Three terrain features were critical to Dietrich's panzer      thrust: the Elsenborn ridge, the Losheim Gap, and the Schnee      Eifel ridge. The Elsenborn ridge, a complex series of fingers      and spurs of the southern Hohe Venn, controlled access to two      of the westerly panzer routes; a third passed just to the     south. The 277th Volksgrenadier Division would attack into      the east defenses of the ridge, and to the south the 12th      SS Panzer Division would debouch from its forest trail      approaches into the hard roads running through and south      of the ridge.       Further to the south the Losheim Gap appears as open      rolling ground between the Elsenborn ridge to the northwest      and the long, heavily wooded Schnee Eifel ridge to the      southeast. Measuring about 5 miles wide at the German border      and narrowing throughout its roughly 14-mile length as it      runs from northeast to southwest, the gap is an unlikely      military avenue, subdivided by lesser ridges, twists, and      hills. Its roads, however, were well built and crucial for      the German advance. Over its two major routes Dietrich      intended to pass most of his armor.       The Sixth Panzer Army shared the Losheim Gap as an avenue      with its southern neighbor, the Fifth Panzer Army. Their      boundary reflected Hitler's obsession with a concentrated      attack to ensure a breakthrough, but the common corridor      added a potential for confusion. The Sixth Panzer Army was to      attack with the 12th Volksgrenadier and the 3d Parachute      Divisions through the northern portion of the gap, while the      Fifth Panzer Army's northern corps, the LXVI, would open its      southern portions. Additionally, the LXVI Corps had to      eliminate the American forces holding the Schnee Eifel on the      southern flank of the gap and seize the crucial road      interchange at St. Vith about 10 miles further west.      Manteuffel wanted part of the 18th Volksgrenadier Division to      push through the southern part of the gap and hook into the      rear of the Schnee Eifel, the remainder of the division to      complete the encirclement to the south of the ridge, and the      62d Volksgrenadier Division to anchor the LXVI's flank with a      drive toward St. Vith.       To the south of the Losheim Gap--Schnee Eifel area, along      the north-south flowing Our River, the Fifth Panzer Army's      major thrusts devolved to its LVIII and XLVII Panzer Corps,      aligned north to south with four of their five divisions in      the assault wave. Each panzer corps had one designated route,      but the Fifth Panzer Army commander did not plan to wait for      infantry to clear them. Manteuffel intended to commit his      armor early rather than in tandem with the infantry,      expecting to break through the extended American line quickly      and expedite his advance to the west. The LVIII's 116th      Panzer and 560th Volksgrenadier Divisions were to penetrate      the area astride the Our River, tying the 106th and 28th      Divisions together, and to capture the three tank-capable      bridges in the sector before driving west to the Meuse. To      the south the XLVII's 2d Panzer and 26th Volksgrenadier      Divisions were to seize crossings on the Our and head toward      the key Bastogne road interchange 19 miles to the west. The      Panzer Lehr Division would follow, adding depth to the corps      attack.       Covering the Fifth Panzer Army's southern flank were the      LXXXV and LXXX Corps of Brandenberger's Seventh Army. The      LXXXV's 5th Parachute and 352d Volksgrenadier Divisions were      to seize crossings on the Our River, and the LXXX's 276th and      212th Volksgrenadier Divisions, feinting toward the city of      Luxembourg, were to draw American strength away from      Manteuffel's main attack. The 276th would attack south of the      confluence of the Our and Sauer Rivers, enveloping the 3-mile      defensive sector held by an American armored infantry      battalion, and to the south the 212th, after crossing at      Echternach, would push back the large concentration of      American artillery in the sector and anchor Army Group B's      southern flank. The Germans had a fairly good idea of the      American forces opposing them. Facing Dietrich's Sixth Panzer      Army was the V Corps' 99th Infantry Division. Newly arrived,      the 99th occupied a series of forward positions along 19      miles of the wooded Belgian-German border, its 395th, 393d,      and 394th Infantry regiments on line from north to south,      with one battalion behind the division's deep right flank      available as a reserve. Gerow, the V Corps commander, was      focused at the time on a planned attack by his 2d Infantry      Division toward the Roer River dams to the north and had      given less attention to the defensive dispositions of the      99th. This small operation had already begun on 13 December,      with the 2d Division passing through the area held by the      99th Division's northernmost regiment. Two battalions of the      395th Infantry joined the action. Slowed by pillboxes and      heavy defenses in the woods, the 2d's attacks were still      ongoing when the enemy offensive begin on the sixteenth.       To the south of the 99th Division the First Army had split      responsibilities for the Elsenborn ridge--Losheim Gap area      between Gerow's V Corps and Middleton's VIII Corps, with the      corps boundary running just north of the village of Losheim.      Middleton's major worry was the Losheim Gap, which      potentially exposed the Schnee Eifel, the latter held by five      battalions of the newly arrived 106th Division. When Bradley      refused his request to withdraw to a shorter, unexposed line,      the VIII Corps commander positioned eight battalions of his      corps artillery to support the forces holding the Losheim      Gap--Schnee Eifel region.       South of the corps boundary the 18th Cavalry Squadron,      belonging to the recently attached 14th Cavalry Group,      outposted the 9,000-yard Losheim Gap. Reinforced by a company      of 3-inch towed tank destroyers, the 18th occupied eight      positions that gave good coverage in fair weather but      could be easily bypassed in the fog or dark. To remedy      this, Middleton had assigned an additional cavalry      squadron to reinforce the gap's thin line under the 14th      group. The cavalry force itself was attached to the 106th      Division, but with the 106th slowly settling into its      positions, a coordinated defense between the two had yet      to be decided. As a result, the reinforcing squadron was      quartered 20 miles to the rear, waiting to be ordered      forward.       South of the Schnee Eifel Middleton's forces followed the      Our River with the 106th Division's 424th infantry and, to      the south, the 28th Division. After suffering more than 6,000      casualties in the Huertgen Forest battles in November, the      28th was resting and training replacements in a 30-mile area      along the Our. Its three regiments--the 112th, 110th, and      109th Infantry--were on line from north to south. Two      battalions of the 100th Infantry held 10 miles of the front      and the division's center while their sister battalion was      kept as part of the division reserve. The 110th had six      company-sized strongpoints manned by infantry and engineers      along the ridge between the Our and Clerf Rivers to the west,      which the troops called ``Skyline Drive.'' Through the center      of this sector ran the crucial road to Bastogne.       South of the 28th Division the sector was held by part of      Combat Command A of the newly arrived 9th Armored Division      and by the 4th Infantry Division, another veteran unit      resting from previous battles. These forces, with the 4th's      northern regiment, the 12th Infantry, positioned as the      southernmost unit in the path of the German offensive, held      the line of the Sauer River covering the approaches to the      city of Luxembourg. Behind this thinly stretched defensive      line of new units and battered veterans, Middleton had few      reserves and even fewer options available for dealing with      enemy threats.                    opening attacks, 16-18 december       At 0530 on 16 December the Sixth Panzer Army's artillery      commenced preparation fires. These fires, which ended at      0700, were duplicated in every sector of the three attacking      German armies. At first the American defenders believed the      fires were only a demonstration. Simultaneously, German      infantry moved unseen through the dark and morning fog,      guided by searchlight beams overhead. Yet, despite local      surprise, Dietrich's attack did not achieve the quick      breakthrough planned. The LXVII Corps' attack north and south      of Monschau failed immediately. One division arrived too late      to attack; the other had its assault broken by determined      resistance. The 277th Volksgrenadier Division's infiltrating      attacks followed the preparation fires closely. The Germans      overran some of the 99th Division's forest outposts, but they      were repulsed attempting to cross open fields near their      objectives, the twin villages of Krinkelt-Rocherath. By      nightfall the Americans still contested the woods to the      north and east of the villages. The 99th's southern flank,      however, was in great peril. The 12th Volksgrenadier Division      had successfully cleared the 1st SS Panzer Division's main      assault avenue, taking the village of Losheim in the early      morning and moving on to separate the VIII Corp's cavalry      from its connection with the 99th.       South of the American corps boundary the Germans were more      successful. Poor communications had further strained the      loosely coordinated defense of the 106th Division and the      14th Cavalry Group in the Losheim Gap. The German predawn      preparation fires had targeted road junctions, destroying      most of the pole-mounted communications wire interchanges.      With their major wire command nets silenced, the American      defenders had to rely on radio relay via artillery nets,      which the mountainous terrain made unreliable.       The attack in the Losheim Gap, in fact, was the offensive's      greatest overmatch. The 3d Parachute Division ran up against      only one cavalry troop and a tank destroyer company holding      over half the sector, and its southern neighbors, the two      reinforced regiments of the 18th Volksgrenadier Division, hit      four platoons of cavalry. Although some American positions      had been bypassed in the dark, the attacking Germans had      generally cleared the area by late morning. Poor      communications and general confusion limited defensive fire      support to one armored field artillery battalion. More      importantly, the cavalry's porous front opened the American      rear to German infantry; by dawn some of the defenders'      artillery and support units behind the Schnee Eifel      encountered the enemy. Subsequently, many guns were lost,      while others hastily clogged the roads to find safer ground.       The uncoordinated defense of the 106th Division and 14th      Cavalry Group now led to tragedy. The cavalry commander      quickly realized that his outposts could neither hold nor      survive. After launching one abortive counterattack northward      against 3d Parachute Division elements with his reserve      squadron, he secured permission to withdraw before his road-     bound force was trapped against the wooded heights to his      rear. This opened the V and VII Corps boundary and separated      the cavalry, Middleton's key information source on his      northern flank, from the Schnee Eifel battle. Throughout the      day of 16 December the 3d pushed north, ultimately      overrunning the cavalry's remaining outposts and capturing a      small force of the 99th Division. But all of these scattered      forces fought valiantly so that by dark the Sixth Panzer      Army's route was still clogged     by units mopping up bypassed Americans and their own supply      and support rains. To the south the 18th Volksgrenadier      Division's attack in the Losheim Gap had slid by the cavalry,      but failed to clear the open ridge behind the Schnee Eifel.      South of the Schnee Eifel the rest of the 18th was unable to      push through the defenders to catch the 106th's units on top      of the Schnee Eifel in a pincer. Further south the 106th's      42th Infantry had blocked the path of the 62d Volksgrenadier      Division across the Our River. By dark the 106th had thus      lost little ground. It had committed its reserve to block the      enemy threat to its south and was expecting Combat Command B,      9th Armored Division, shifting from V Corps reserve, to      conduct a relieving attach via St. Vith toward the Schnee      Eifel. But while the defenders moved to restore their      positions, the 18th, by searchlight and flare, continued to      press south from the gap.       South of the 106th Division, the 28th Division fended off      the Fifth Panzer Army's thrusts. In the north the 112th      Infantry held back the LVIII Panzer Corps' two divisions,      while the 110th Infantry blocked the paths of the XLVII      Panzer Corp's three in the center. The 110th's strong points,      which received some tank reinforcement from the division      reserve, held firm throughout the sixteenth, blocking the      route westward. By dark, although German infantry had crossed      the Our and started infiltrating, American roadblocks still      prevented any armor movement toward Bastogne.       South of the fifth Panzer Army, Brandenberger's Seventh      Army also failed to break through the American line. The 28th      Division's 109th Infantry managed to hold on to its 9-mile      front. Although the LXXXV Corps' two divisions had seized      crossings on the Our and achieved some penetrations between      the regiment's company strong-points, they failed to advance      further. Similarly, the Germans' southernmost attack was held      by the 4th Division's 12th Infantry. The LXXX Corps'      divisions met with heavy resistance, and by nightfall the      Americans still held their positions all along the Seventh      Army front, despite some infiltration between company      strongpoints.       Hitler responded to the first day's reports with unbridled      optimism. Rundstedt, however, was less sanguine. The needed      breakthrough had not been achieved, no major armored units      had been committed, and the key panzer routes were still      blocked. In fact, the first day of battle set the tone for      the entire American defense. In every engagement the      Americans had been outnumbered, in some sectors facing down      tanks and assault guns with only infantry weapons. Darkness,      fog, and intermittent drizzle snow had favored the      infiltrating attackers; but, despite inroads made around the      defenses, the Germans had been forced to attack American      positions frontally to gain access to the vital roads. Time      had been lost and more would be spent to achieve a complete      breakthrough. In that sense, the grand slam was already in      danger.       American senior commanders were puzzled by the situation.      The Germans apparently had attacked along a 60-mile front      with strong forces, including many new units not identified      in the enemy order or battle. Yet no substantial ground had      been lost. With many communications links destroyed by the      bombardment and the relative isolation of most defensive      positions, the generals were presented with a panorama of      numerous small-unit battles without a clear larger      picture.       Nevertheless, command action was forthcoming. By nightfall      of the sixteenth, although response at both the First Army      and 12th Army Group headquarters was guarded, Eisenhower had      personally ordered the 7th Armored Division from the Ninth      Army and the 10th Armored Division from the third Army to      reinforce Middleton's hard-pressed VIII Corps. In addition,      shortly after midnight, Hodges' First Army began moving      forces south from the Aachen sector, while the Third Army      headquarters, on Patton's initiative, began detailed planning      to deal with the German offensive.       Within the battle area the two corps commanders struggled      to respond effectively to the offensive, having only      incomplete and fragmentary reports from the field. Gerow, the      V Corps commander in the north, requested that the 2d      Division's Roer River dams attack be canceled; however,      Hodges, who viewed the German action against the 99th      Division as a spoiling operation, initially refused.      Middleton, the VIII Corps commander in the south, changed his      plans for the 9th Armored division's Combat Command B,      ordering it to reinforce the southern flank of the 106th      Division. The newly promised 7th Armored Division would      assume the CCB's original mission of relieving troops on the      Schnee Eifel via St. Vith. Thereafter, mixed signals between      the VIII Corps and the 106th Division led to disaster.      Whether by poor communications or misunderstanding, Middleton      believed that the 106th was pulling its men off the Schnee      Eifel and withdrawing to a less exposed position; the 106th's      commander believed that Middleton wanted him to hold until      relieved and thus left the two defending regiments in place.       By the early morning hours of 17 December Middleton, whose      troops faced multiple enemy threats, had selected the      dispositions that would foreshadow the entire American      response. Already ordered by Hodges to defend in place, the      VIII Corps commander determined that his defense would focus      on denying the Germans use of the Ardennes roadnet. Using the      forces at hand, he intended to block access to four key road      junctions: St. Vith, Houffalize, Bastogne, and the city of      Luxembourg. If he could stop or slow the German advance west,      he knew that the 12th Army Group would follow with massive      flanking attacks from the north and south.       That same morning Hodges finally agreed to cancel the V      Corps' Roer dams attack. Gerow, in turn, moved the 2d      Division south to strengthen the 99th Division's southern      flank, with reinforcements from the 1st Infantry Division      soon to follow. The First Army commander now realized that      Gerow's V Corps units held the critical northern shoulder of      the enemy penetration and began to reinforce them, trusting      that Middleton's armor reinforcements would restore the      center of the VIII Corps line.       While these shifts took place, the battle raged. During the      night of 16-17 December the Sixth Panzer Army continued to      move armor forward in the hopes of gaining the breakthrough      that the infantry had failed to achieve. The Germans again      mounted attacks near Monschau and again were repulsed.      Meanwhile, south of Monschau, the 12th SS Panzer Division,      committed from muddy logging trails, overwhelmed 99th      Division soldiers still holding out against the 277th and      12th Volksgrenadier Divisions.       Outnumbered and facing superior weapons, many U.S. soldiers      fought to the bitter end, the survivors surrendering only      when their munitions had run out and escape was impossible.      Individual heroism was common. During the Krinkelt battle,      for example, T. Sgt. Vernon McGarity of the 393d Infantry,      99th Division, after being treated for wounds, returned to      lead his squad, rescuing wounded under fire and single-     handedly destroying an advancing enemy machine-gun section.      After two days of fighting, his men were captured after      firing their last bullets. McGarity received the Medal of      Honor for his actions. His was the first of thirty-two such      awards during the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign.       Ordered to withdraw under the 2d Division's control, the      99th Division, whose ranks had been thinned by nearly 3,000      casualties, pulled back to the northern portion of a      horseshoe-shaped line that blocked two of the I SS Panzer      Corps' routes. Although the line was anchored on the      Elsenborn ridge, fighting raged westward as the Germans      pushed to outflank the extended American defense.       During the night of the seventeenth the Germans unveiled      additional surprises. They attempted to parachute a 1,000-man      force onto the Hohe Venn's high point at Baraque Michel.      Although less than half actually landed in the area, the      scattered drop occupied the attention of critical U.S.      armored and infantry reserves in the north for several days.      A companion special operation, led by the legendary Lt. Col.      Otto Skorzeny, used small teams of English-speaking soldiers      disguised in American uniforms. Neither the drop nor the      operation gained any appreciable military advantage for the      German panzers. The Americans, with their resistance      increasing along the Elsenborn ridge and elsewhere, were      undaunted by such threats to their rear.       Further south, however, along the V and VIII Corps      boundary, the Sixth Panzer Army achieved its breakthrough. In      the Losheim Gap the advanced detachment of the 1st SS Panzer      Division, Kampfgruppe Peiper, moved forward through the      attacking German infantry during the early hours of the      seventeenth. Commanded by Col. Joachim Peiper, the unit would      spearhead the main armored assault heading for the Meuse      River crossings south of Liege at Huy. With over 100 tanks      and approximately 5,000 men, Kampfgruppe Peiper had      instructions to ignore its own flanks, to overrun or bypass      opposition, and to move day and night. Traversing the woods      south of the main panzer route, it entered the town of      Buellingen, about 3 miles behind the American line. After      fueling their tanks on captured stocks, Peiper's men murdered      at least 50 American POWs. Then shortly after noon, they ran      head on into a 7th Armored Division field artillery      observation battery southeast of Malmedy, murdering more than      80 men. Peiper's men eventually killed at least 300 American      prisoners and over 100 unarmed Belgian civilians in a dozen      separate locations. Word of the Malmedy Massacre spread, and      within hours units across the front realized that the Germans      were prosecuting the offensive with a special grimness.      American resistance stiffened.       Following a twisted course along the Ambleve River valley,      Kampfgruppe Peiper had completed barely half of its drive to      the Meuse before encountering a unit from 9th Armored      Division and then being stopped by an engineer squad at the      Stavelot bridge. Unknown to Peiper, his column had passed      within 15 miles of the First Army headquarters and was close      to its huge reserve fuel dumps. But the Peiper advance was      only part of the large jolt to the American command that day.      To the south the 1st SS Panzer Division had also broken      loose, moving just north of St. Vith.       As Kampfgruppe Peiper lunged deep into the First Army's      rear, further south the VIII Corps front was rapidly being      fragmented. The 18th Volksgrenadier Division completed its      southern swing, encircling the two regiments of the 106th      Division on the Schnee Eifel. While a single troop of the      14th Cavalry Group continued to resist the German spearheads,      the 106th's engineers dug in to block the crucial Schoenberg      road 2 miles east of St. Vith, a last ditch defense, hoping      to hold out until the 7th Armored Division arrived.       St. Vith's road junctions merited the priority Middleton      had assigned them. Although the I SS Panzer Corps had planned      to pass north of the town and the LVIII Panzer Corps to its      south, the crossroad town became more important after the      German failure to make a breakthrough in the north on 16-17      December. There, the successful defense of the Elsenborn      ridge had blocked three of the Sixth Panzer Army's routes,      pushing Dietrich's reserve and supply routes southward and      jamming Manteuffel's Losheim route. South of the Losheim Gap      the American occupation of St. Vith and the Schnee Eifel      represented a double obstacle, which neither Dietrich nor      Manteuffel could afford. With thousands of American soldiers      still holding desperately along the Schnee Eifel and its      western slope village, the Germans found vital roads still      threatened. Further west, the possibility of American      counterattacks from the St. Vith roadnet threatened      Dietrich's narrow panzer flow westward as well as      Manteuffel's own western advance. And from St. Vith, the      Americans could not only choke the projected German supply      arteries but also reinforce the now isolated Schnee Eifel      regiments.       For the 106th Division's men holding the Schnee Eifel, time      was running out. The 7th Armored Division's transfer south      from the Ninth Army had been slowed both by coordination      problems and roads clogged by withdrawing elements. Led by      Combat Command B, the 7th's first elements arrived at St.      Vith in midafternoon of 17 December, with the division taking      command of the local defense immediately. That night both      sides jockeyed in the dark. While the 18th Volksgrenadier      Division tried to make up lost time to mount an attack on the      town from the northeast and east, the 7th, whose units had      closed around St. Vith in fading daylight, established a      northerly facing defensive arc in preparation for its attack      toward the Schnee Eifel the next day.       South of St. Vith the 106th Division's southernmost      regiment, the 424th Infantry, and Combat Command B, 9th      Armored Division, had joined up behind the Our River. From      the high-ground positions there they were able to continue      blocking the 62d Volksgrenadier Division, thereby securing      the southern approaches to St. Vith. But unknown to them, the      28th Division's 112th Infantry was also folding rearward and      eventually joined the 424th and the 7th Armored Division,      completing a defensive perimeter around the town. During the      night of 17 December, with these forces combining, Middleton      and the commanders in St. Vith believed that the VIII Corps'      northern flank would be restored and the 106th trapped      regiments relieve.       On 18 December Middleton's hopes of launching a      counterattack toward the Schnee Eifel faded as elements of      three German divisions converged around St. Vith. Although      situation maps continued to mark the last-known positions of      the 106gh Division's 422d and 423d Infantry on the Schnee      Eifel, the massive weight of German numbers ended any rescue      attempts. Communicating through a tenuous artillery radio      net, both regiments believed that help was on the way and      that their orders were to break out to the high ground      behind the Our River, a distance of between 3 and 4 miles      over difficult enemy-held terrain.       The following day, 19 December, brought tragedy for the      106th Division. The two stranded regiments, now behind the      Schnee Eifel, were pounded by artillery throughout the day as      the Germans drew their circle tighter. With casualties      mounting and ammunition dwindling, the 423d's commander chose      to surrender his regiment to prevent its annihilation. The      422d had some of its troop overrun; others, who were both      segmented and surrounded, surrendered. By 1600 most of the      two regiments and their attached support has thus been      captured. Nevertheless, one battalion-sized group evaded      captivity until the twenty-first, and about 150 soldiers from      the 422d ultimately escaped to safety. The confused nature of      the final battles made specific casualty accounting      impossible, but over 7,000 men were captured.       The tragedy of the Schnee Eifel was soon eclipsed by the      triumph of St. Vith. Every senior German commander saw the      ``road octopus''--the omnidirectional junction of six roads      in the town's eastern end--as vital for a massive      breakthrough, freeing up the Sixth Panzer Army's advance. For      the Americans, holding St. Vith would keep the V and VIII      Corps within a reasonable distance of each other; without the      town the enemy's spearheads would widen into a huge salient,      folding back toward Bastogne further south. With intermittent      communications, the St. Vith defenders thus operated with      only one order from Middleton: ``Hold at all costs.''       Despite a ``goose-egg'' position extending 12 miles from      east to west on tactical maps, the St. Vith defense literally      had no depth. Designed to fight on the move in more favorable      terrain, the four combat commands of the 7th and 9th Armored      Divisions found themselves moored to muddy, steep sloped      hills, heavily wooded and laced with mud trails. The first      action defined the defense's pattern. Unengaged commands sent      tanks and halftracks racing laterally across the perimeter to      deal with penetrations and infiltrators, with the engaged      tanks and infantry holding their overextended lines as best      they could. After two days of sporadic attacks, the German      commanders attempted to concentrate forces to crush the      defense. But with clogged roads German preparations for a      coordinated assault encountered continuous delays.       Although the VIII Corps' northern flank had been at least      temporarily anchored at St. Vith, its center was in great      danger. There, the 28th Division's 110th Infantry was being      torn to bits. After failing repeatedly to seize crossing on      the Our, Manteuffel had passed some of the 116th Panzer      Division's armor through the 2d Panzer Division to move up      the Skyline Drive ridgeline and enter its panzer route. Thus      by 17 December the 110th had elements of five divisions bull-     dozing through its strongpoints along the ridge, forcing back      the 28th's northern and southern regiments that were      attempting to maintain a cohesive defense. The 2d entered      Clervaux, in the 110th's center, by a side road and rolled on      westward toward Bastogne; holdouts in Clervaux continued to      fight from within an ancient castle in the town's eastern      end. To the south some survivors of the ridge battle had      fallen back to join engineers defending Wiltz, about 4 miles      to the rear, and the southern approach to Bastogne. Even      though the 110th has suffered over 80 percent casualties, its      stand had delayed the XLVII Panzer Corps for a crucial forty-     eight hours.       The southern shoulder provided VIII Corps' only clear      success. The 4th Division has absorbed the folded back      defenses of the 109th Infantry and the 9th Armored Division's      Combat Command A, thus effectively jamming the Seventh Army's      attack. With the arrival of the 10th Armored Division, a      provisional corps was temporarily formed to block any advance      toward the city of Luxembourg.       The events of 17 December finally demonstrated the gravity      of the German offensive to the Allied command. Eisenhower      committed the theater reserve, the XVIII Airborne Corps, and      ordered three American divisions training in England to move      immediately to north-eastern France. Hodges' First Army moved      the 30th Infantry and 3d Armored Divisions south to extend      the northern shoulder of the penetration to the west.      Although Bradley remained the least concerned, he and Patton      explored moving a three-division corps from the Third Army to      attack the German southern flank.       Allied intelligence now began to discern German strength      objectives with some clarity. The enemy's success apparently      was tied to gaining the Meuse quickly and then turning north;      however, most of the attacking divisions were trapped in      clogged columns, attempting to push through the narrow      Losheim Gap and enter the two panzer routes then open. The      area, still controlled by the VIII Corps, seemed to provide      the key to stabilizing the defensive effort. Somehow the VIII      Corps, whose center had now been destroyed, would have to      slow down the German drive west, giving the Americans time to      strengthen the shoulders north and south of the salient and      to prepare one or more major counterattacks.       Middleton committed his only reserves, Combat Command R of      the 9th Armored Division and seven battalions of corps and      army engineers, positioning the units at critical road      junctions. Teams formed from tank, armored infantry, and      engineer units soon met the 2d Panzer Division's lead      elements. Outgunned in a frontal fight and disadvantaged      by the wide-tracked German tanks' cross-country capability      in the drizzle-soaked fields, Middleton's armored forces      were soon overwhelmed, even though the fighting continued      well into the night. By dawn on the eighteenth no      recognizable line existed as the XLVII Panzer Corps' three      divisions bore down on Bastogne.       Late on 17 December Hodges had requested the commitment of      SHAEF reserves, the 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions.      Promised to Middleton by the morning of the nineteenth, the      VIII Corps commander intended to use them at Houffalize, 17      miles south of St. Vith, and at Bastogne, 10 miles further      south, as a solid block against the German advance to the      Meuse. But until the airborne divisions arrived, the VIII      Corps had to hold its sector with the remnants of its own      forces, mainly engineers, and with an armored combat command      from the 10th Armored Division, which was beginning to enter      the battle for the corps' center.       Middleton's engineer ``barrier line'' in front of Bastogne      slowed the German advance and bought critical time, but the      arrival of Combat Command B, 10th Armored Division, at      Bastogne was crucial. As it moved forward, Middleton      dispatched three armored teams to the north and east during      the night of the eighteenth to cover the road junctions      leading to Bastogne. A key fight took place at Longvilly,      just a few miles east of Bastogne, where the remnants of the      9th Armored Division's Combat Command R and the 10th's Team      Cherry tried to block the Germans. Three enemy divisions      converged there, trapping the CCR force west of the town and      annihilating it and then surrounding Team Cherry. But even as      this occurred, the lead elements of the 101st Airborne      Division passed through Bastogne to defensive positions along      the villages and low hills just to the east of the town.      Joining with the CCB's three armor teams and the two      battalions of engineers from the barrier line, the 101st      formed a crescent-shaped defense, blocking the five roads      entering Bastogne from the north, east, and south.       The enemy responded quickly. The German commanders wanted      to avoid being enmeshed in any costly sieges. So when      Manteuffel saw a hole opening between the American defenses      at St. Vith and Bastogne, he ordered his panzer divisions to      bypass both towns and move immediately toward     their planned Meuse crossing sites some 30 miles to the      northwest, leaving the infantry to reduce Bastogne's      defenses. Although Middleton had planned to use the 82d      Airborne Division to fill the gap between Bastogne and St.      Vith, Hodges had been forced to divert it northwest of St.      Vith to block the Sixth Panzer Army's advance. Thus only the      few engineers and support troops defending the road junctions      and crossings along the narrow Ourthe River west of Bastogne      lay in the path of Manteuffel's panzers.                   command decisions, 19-20 december       Wacht am Rhine's timetable had placed Dietrich's and      Manteuffel's panzers at the Meuse four days after the attack      began. The stubborn American defense made this impossible.      The Sixth Panzer Army, the designated main effort, had been      checked; its attacks to open the Hohe Venn's roads by direct      assault and airborne envelopment had failed, and Kampfgruppe      Peiper's narrow armored spearhead had been isolated. To the      south the Fifth Panzer Army's northern corps had been blocked      at St. Vith; its center corps had advanced nearly 25 miles      into the American center but was still meeting resistance;      and its southern corps had been unable to break the Bastogne      roadblock. The southern flank was in no better straits.      Neither the Seventh Army's feint toward the city of      Luxembourg nor its efforts to cover Manteuffel's flank had      gained much ground. Hitler's key requirement that an      overwhelming force achieve a quick breakthrough had not      occurred. Six divisions had held twenty, and now the American      forces, either on or en route to the battlefield, had      doubled. Nevertheless, the Sixth Panzer Army's II SS Panzer      Corps had yet to be committed, and additional divisions and      armor existed in the German High Command reserve. The      unspoken belief among Hitler's generals now was that with      luck and continued poor weather, the more limited objectives      of their small solution might still be possible.       Eisenhower's actions had also undermined Hitler's      assumption that the Allied response would come too late. When      ``Ike'' committed two armored divisions to Middleton on the      first day of fighting and the theater reserve on the next, a      lightning German advance to the Meuse became nearly      impossible. Meeting with his commanders at Verdun on 19      December, Eisenhower, who had received the latest Ultra      intelligence on enemy objectives, outlined his overall      operational response. Hodges' First Army would break the      German advance; along the southern flank of the German      penetration Patton's Third Army would attack north, assuming      control of Middleton's VIII Corps from the First Army; and      Middleton's Bastogne positions would now be the anvil for      Third Army's hammer.       Patton, content that his staff had finalized operational      planning, promised a full corps attack in seventy-two hours,      to begin after a nearly 100-mile move. Devers' 6th Army Group      would take up the slack, relieving two of Patton's corps of      their frontage. In the north Montgomery had already begun      moving the British 30 Corps to backstop the First Army and      assume defensive positions behind the Meuse astride the      crossings from Liege to Namur.       Eisenhower began his Verdun conference saying, ``The      present situation is to be regarded as one of opportunity for      us and not disaster.'' That opportunity, as his generals      knew, hung not on their own operational plans but on the      soldiers on the battlefield, defending the vital St. Vith and      Bastogne road junctions, holding on to the Elsenborn ridge,      and blocking the approaches to the city of Luxembourg, as      well as on the soldiers in numerous ``blocks'' and positions      unlocated on any command post map. These men knew nothing      of Allied operational plans or even the extent of the      German offensive, but in the next days, on their      shoulders, victory or disaster rested.       One unavoidable decision on overall battlefield      coordination remained. Not one to move a command post to the      rear, General Bradley had kept his 12th Army Group      headquarters in the city of Luxembourg, just south of the      German attack. Maj. Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg's Ninth Air Force      headquarters, which supported Bradley's armies, stayed there      also, unwilling to sever its direct ties with the ground      forces. But three German armies now separated Bradley's      headquarters from both Hodges' First Army and Simpson's Ninth      Army in the north, making it difficult for Bradley to      supervise a defense in the north while coordinating an attack      from the south. Nor would communications for the thousands of      messages and orders needed to control and logistically      support Bradley's two northern armies and Vandenberg's two      northern air commands be guaranteed.       Eisenhower, therefore, divided the battlefield. At noon on      20 December ground command north of the line from Givet on      the Meuse to the high ground roughly 5 miles south of St.      Vith devolved to Montgomery's 21 Army Group, which      temporarily assumed operational control of both the U.S.      Ninth and First Armies. Shifting the ground command raised a      furor, given the strained relations Montgomery had with      senior American commanders. Montgomery had been successful in      attacking and occupying ``ground of his own choosing'' and      then drawing in enemy armored reserves where they could be      destroyed by superior artillery and air power. He now      intended to repeat these tactics, planning to hold his own      counterattacks until the enemy's reserves had been spent or a      decisive advantage gained. The American generals, however,      favored an immediate counteroffensive to first halt and then      turn back the German drive. Equally disconcerting to them was      Montgomery's persistence in debating command and strategy, a      frequent occurrence in all coalitions, but one that by virtue      of his personal approach added to the strains within the      Allied command.       The British 2d Tactical Air Force similarly took control of      the IX and XXIX Tactical Air Commands from Vandenberg's Ninth      Air Force. Because the British air commander, Air Chief      Marshal Sir Arthur ``Maori'' Coningham, had long established      close personal relations with the concerned American air      commanders, the shift of air commands passed uneventfully.                   first army battles, 20-27 december       Eisenhower and Montgomery agreed that the First Army would      establish a cohesive defensive line, yielding terrain if      necessary. Montgomery also intended to create a corps-sized      reserve for a counterattack, which he sought to keep from      being committed during the defensive battle. The First Army's      hasty defense had been one of hole-plugging, last stands, and      counterattacks to buy time. Although successful, these      tactics had created organizational havoc within Hodges'      forces as divisional units had been committed piecemeal and      badly jumbled. Complicating the situation even further was      the fact that the First Army still held the north-south      front, north of Monschau to Elsenborn, while fighting      Dietrich's panzers along a nearly east-west axis in the      Ardennes.       Blessed with excellent defensive ground and a limited      lateral roadnet in front of V Corps positions, Gerow had been      able to roll with the German punch and Hodges to feed in      reserves to extend the First Army line westward. Much of the      Sixth Panzer Army's strength was thus tied up in road jams of      long columns of vehicles. But American success was still far      from certain. The V Corps was holding four panzer divisions      along the northern shoulder, an elbow-shaped 25-mile line,      with only parts of four U.S. divisions.       To the west of the V Corps the 30th Infantry Division, now      under Maj. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway's XVIII Airborne Corps,      marched south to block Kampfgruppe Peiper at Malmedy and,      along the Ambleve River, at Stavelot, Stoumont, and La      Gleize. To the south of Peiper the XVIII's other units, the      82d Airborne and 3d Armored Divisions, moved forward to the      area between the Salm and Ourthe Rivers, northwest of St.      Vith, which was still in danger of being isolated. By 20      December the Peiper force was almost out of fuel and      surrounded. During the night of the twenty-third Peiper and      his men destroyed their equipment, abandoned their vehicles,      and walked out to escape capture. Dietrich's spearhead was      broken.       North of St. Vith the I SS Panzer Corps pushed west. Part      of the LVIII Panzer Corps had already bypassed the defenders'      southern flank. Standing in the way of Dietrich's panzers was      a 6-mile line along the Salm River, manned by the 82d      Airborne Division. Throughout the twenty-first German armor      attacked St. Vith's northwestern perimeter and infantry hit      the entire eastern circumference of the line. Although the      afternoon assault was beaten back, the fighting was renewed      after dark. To prevent being trapped from the rear, the 7th      Armored Division began pulling out of its advanced positions      around 2130. The other American units around the town      conformed, folding into a tighter perimeter west of the town.       Ridgway wanted St. Vith's defenders to stay east of the      Salm, but Montgomery ruled otherwise. The 7th Armored      Division, its ammunition and fuel in short supply and perhaps      two-thirds of its tanks destroyed, and the battered elements      of the 9th Armored, 106th, and 28th Divisions could not hold      the extended perimeter in the rolling and wooded terrain.      Meanwhile, Dietrich's second wave of tanks entered the fray.      The II SS Panzer Corps immediately threatened the Salm River      line north and west of St. Vith, as did the LVIII Panzer      Corps circling to the south, adding the 2d SS Panzer Division      to its drive. Ordering the St. Vith defenders to withdraw      through the 82d Airborne Division line to prevent another      Schnee Eifel disaster, Montgomery signaled them that ``they      come back with all honor.''       Mud threatened to trap much of the force, but nature      intervened with a ``Russian High,'' a cold snap and snowstorm      that turned the trails from slurry to hard ground. While the      Germans seemed temporarily powerless to act, the St. Vith      defenders on 23 December, in daylight, withdrew across the      Salm to reform behind the XVIII Airborne Corps front.      Ridgway estimated that the successful withdrawal added at      least 100 tanks and two infantry regiments to his corps.       The St. Vith defense purchased five critical days, but the      situation remained grave. Model's Army Group B now had twelve      full divisions attacking along roughly 25 miles of the      northern shoulder's east-west front. Hodges' army was holding      with thirteen divisions, four of which had suffered heavy      casualties and three of which were forming in reserve.      Montgomery had designated Maj. Gen. J. Lawton ``Lightning      Joe'' Collins' VII Corps as the First Army's counterattack      force, positioning its incoming divisions northwest of      Hodges' open flank, hoping to keep them out of the defensive      battle. He intended both to blunt the enemy's assault and      wear down its divisions by withdrawing the XVIII Airborne     Corps to a shorter, defendable line, thus knitting together      the First Army's fragmented defense. Above all, before      launching a major counterstroke, Montgomery wanted to cripple      the German panzers with artillery and with constant air      attacks against their lines of supply.       The Russian High that blanketed the battlefield brought the      Allies one tremendous advantage--good flying weather. The      week of inclement weather promised to Hitler by his      meteorologists had run out--and with it the ability to move      in daylight safe from air attack. The Allied air forces rose      to the occasion. Night bombers of the Royal Air Force's      Bomber Command had been attacking those rail yards supporting      the German offensive since 17 December. In the five days of      good weather following the Russian High, American day bombers      entered the interdiction effort. As Allied fighter bombers      patrolled the roads throughout the Ardennes and the Eifel,      the Ninth Air Force's medium bombers attacked targets west of      the Rhine and the Eighth Air Force's heavy bombers hit rail      yards deeper into Germany. Flying an average of 3,000 sorties      daily during good weather, the combined air forces dropped      more than 31,000 tons of bombs during the first ten days of      interdiction attacks.       The effects on the ground battle were dramatic. The      sluggish movement of fuel and vehicles over the Ardennes' few      roads had already slowed German operations. The added strain      on resupply from the bombing and strafing now caused halts up      and down the German line, making coordinated attacks more      difficult. Still, panzer and infantry units continued to      press forward.       From Christmas Eve to the twenty-seventh, battles raged      along the First Army's entire front. The heaviest fighting      swirled around the positions held by Ridgway's XVIII Airborne      Corps and Collins' VII Corps, the latter having been      piecemealed forward to extend the First Army line westward.      While the XVIII Corps battled the Sixth Panzer Army's last      attempts to achieve a northern breakthrough, the VII Corps'      3d Armored and 84th Infantry Divisions held the line's      western end against the LVIII and XLVII Panzer Corps. These      units had become Model's new main effort, swinging wide of      Dietrich's stalled attack, and they now had elements about 5      miles from the Meuse. Upon finding the 2d Panzer Division out      of gas at the German salient's tip, Collins on Christmas Day      sent 2d Armored Division, with heavy air support, to encircle      and destroy the enemy force.       The First Army's desperate defense between the Salm and      Meuse Rivers had stopped the Sixth and Fifth Panzer Armies,      including six panzer divisions. The fierce battles--at places      as Baraque de Fraiture, Manhay, Hotton, and Marche--were      epics of valor and determination. Hitler's drive for Antwerp      was over.                   third army battles, 20-27 december       The 20 December boundary shift transferred Middleton's VIII      Corps and its Bastogne garrison to Patton's Third Army, which      was now moving forces from as far away as 10 miles to attack      positions south of the German salient. Bastogne had become an      armed camp with four airborne regiments, seven battalions of      artillery, a self-propelled tank destroyer battalion, and the      surviving tanks, infantry, and engineers from two armored      combat commands--all under the 101st Airborne Division's      command.       Manteuffel had ordered the Panzer Lehr and the 2d Panzer      Divisions to bypass Bastogne and speed toward the Meuse, thus      isolating the defenders. As the 26th Volksgrenadier Division      and the XLVII Paner Corps' artillery closed in for the kill      on 22 December, the corps commander's emissary arrived at the      101st Division's command post, demanding surrender or      threatening annihilation. The acting division commander,      Brig. Gen. Anthony C. McAuliffe, replied ``Nuts,'' initially      confounding the Germans but not Bastogne's defenders. The      defense held.       For four days bitter fighting raged in a clockwise rotation      around Bastogne's southern and western perimeter, further      constricting the defense within the low hills and patches of      woods surrounding the town. The infantry held ground, with      the armor scurrying to seal penetrations or to support local      counterattacks. Once the overcast weather had broke, the      defenders received both air support and aerial resupply,      making it imperative for Manteuffel to turn some of his      precious armor back to quickly crush the American defense, a      large deadly threat along his southern flank.       Meanwhile, as Bastogne held, Patton's Third Army units      streamed northward. Maj. Gen. John B. Millikin's newly      arrived III Corps headquarters took command of the 4th      Armored and 26th and 80th Infantry Divisions, in a move      quickly discovered and monitored by the Germans' effective      radio intercept units. In response, Brandenberger's Seventh      Army, charged with the crucial flank guard mission in      Hitler's offensive, rushed its lagging infantry divisions      forward to block the expected American counterattack.       Jumping off as promised on 22 December some 12 to 15 miles      south of Bastogne, III Corps divisions achieved neither the      surprise nor momentum that Bradley and Patton had hoped. No      longer a lunge into an exposed flank, the attack became a      frontal assault along a 30-mile front against infantry      holding good defensive terrain. With Bastogne's garrison      totally surrounded, only a quick Third Army breakthrough      could prevent the brilliant holding action there from      becoming a costly disaster. But how long Bastogne's defenders      could hold out was a question mark.       To the east, as Millikin's III Corps moved against      hardening enemy resistance along the Sure River, Maj. Gen.      Manton S. Eddy's XII Corps attacked northward on a front      almost as wide as the III Corps'. Taking control of the 4th      Infantry and 10th Armored Divisions and elements of the 9th      Armored Division, all units of Middleton's former southern      wing, Eddy met greater difficulties in clearing the ridges      southeast of Bastogne. Meanwhile, the 35th and 5th Infantry      Divisions and the 6th Armored Division moved northward to      strengthen the counterattacks. Millikin finally shifted the      main effort to the west, where the 4th Armored Division was      having more success. Following fierce village-by-village      fighting in frigid temperatures, the 4th linked up with      Bastogne's defenders at 1650 on 26 December, lifting the      siege but setting the stage for even heavier fighting for the      Bastogne sector.               nordwind in alsace, 31 december-5 january       By 21 December Hitler had decided on a new offensive, this      time in the Alsace region, in effect selecting one of the      options he had disapproved earlier in favor of Wacht am      Rhine. With the Fifteenth Army's supporting thrust canceled      due to Dietrich's failure to break the northern shoulder, and      with no hope of attaining their original objectives, both      Hitler and Rundstedt agreed that an attack on the southern      Allied front might take advantage of Patton's shift north to      the Ardennes, which Wehrmacht intelligence had identified as      under way. The first operation, called Nordwind      (``Northwind''), targeted the Saverne Gap, 20 miles      northwest of Strasbourg, to split the Seventh Army's XV      and VI Corps and retake the Alsace north of the Marne-     Rhine Canal. If successful, a second operation, called      Zahnartz (``Dentist''), would pursue objectives westward      toward the area between Luneville and Metz and into the      Third Army's southern flank. Lt. Gen. Hans von      Obstfelder's First Army would launch the XIII SS Corps as      the main effort down the Sarre River valley, while to the      southeast four divisions from the XC and LXXXIX Corps      would attack southwesterly down the Low Vosges mountain      range through the old Maginot Line positions near Bitche.      A two-division panzer reserve would be held to reinforce      success, which Hitler believed would be in the Sarre River      sector. Reichsfuehrer Heinrich Himmler's Army Group      Oberrhein, virtually an independent field army reporting      only to Hitler, was to pin the southern flank of the      Seventh Army with holding attacks. The new offensive was      planned for the thirty-first, New Year's Eve. However, its      target, the U.S. Seventh Army, was neither unready nor      unwarned.       Lt. Gen. Alexander M. Patch's Seventh Army, part of Devers'      6th Army Group, which also included the French First Army,      had been among the theater's unsung heroes. After conducting      assault landings on the coast of southern France in August      1944, the small army had chased a significantly larger force      northward; but, much to the chagrin of his commanders, Patch      had been ordered not to cross the Rhine, even though his      divisions were among the first Allied units to reach its      banks. In November the Seventh Army had been the Western      Front's leading Allied ground gainer. Yet, when Patton's      Third Army found its offensive foundering, Patch, again      following orders, had sent a corps northward to attack the      Siegfried Line's southern flank, an operational lever      designed to assist Patton's attack.       On 19 December, at the Verdun conference, the 6th Army      Group was again relegated to a supporting role. Eisenhower      ordered Devers to assume the front of two of Patton's corps      that were moving to the Ardennes, and then on the twenty-     sixth he added insult to injury by telling the 6th Army Group      commander to give up his Rhine gains by withdrawing to the      Vosges foothills. The switch to the defense also scrapped      Devers' planned attacks to reduce the Colmar Pocket, the      German foothold stretching 50 miles along the Rhine's western      banks south of Strasbourg. Held in check by two corps of      General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army, this      area was the only German bridgehead in Devers' sector. But by      Christmas Eisenhower saw a greater threat than the Colmar      Pocket opening on his southern front.       Allied intelligence had confirmed that a new enemy      offensive in the Alsace region was imminent. Eisenhower      wanted the Seventh Army to meet it by withdrawing to      shortened lines to create reserves, essentially ceding      northern Alsace back to the Germans, including the city of      Strasbourg. Not surprisingly, Devers, Patch, and de Lattre      objected strongly to the order. In the end, rather than      withdraw, Devers shifted forces to create a reserve to      backstop the key enemy attack avenues leading into his front      and ordered the preparation of three intermediate withwrawal      lines forward of the defensive line designated by Eisenhower.       By New Year's Eve, with two U.S. divisions withdrawn from      the Seventh Army and placed in theater reserve, the 6th Army      Group's front resembled the weakened defense that had      encouraged the German Ardennes offensive. Patch's six      divisons covered a 126-mile front, much of it along poor      defensive ground. Feeling that the Saree River valley just      north of the Low Vosges would bear the brunt of any attack,      Patch assigned Maj. Gen. Wade Haislip's XV Corps a 35-mile      sector between Sarreguemines and     Bitche, with the 103d, 44th, and 100th Infantry Divisions      holding from northwest to southeast, backed by the      experienced French 2d Armored Division. Maj. Gen. Edward H.      Brooks' VI Corps took up the balance of Patch's front from      the Low Vosges southeast to Lauterbourg on the Rhine and then      southward toward Strasbourg. Brooks' corps had the veteran      45th and 79th Infantry Divsions and the 14th Armored Division      in reserve. Patch inserted Task Force Hudelson, a two-     squadron cavalry force, reinforced with infantry from the      uncommitted 14th Armored Division at the boundary joining the      two American corps.       The deployment of three additional units--Task Force Linden      (42d Infantry Division), Task Force Harris (63d Infantry      Division), and Task Force Herren (70th Infantry Division)--     demonstrated how far Devers and Patch would go to avoid      yielding ground. Formed from the infantry regiments of three      arriving divisions and led by their respective assistant      division commanders, these units went straight to the Seventh      Army front minus their still to arrive artillery, engineer,      and support units that comprised a complete division. By      late December Patch had given the bulk of Task Force      Harris to Haislip's XV Corps and the other two to Brooks,      who placed them along the Rhine between Lauterbourg and      Strasbourg.       Despite knowledge of the impending Alsace offensive, the      exact location and objectives were unclear. Troop buildups      near Saarbruecken, east of the Rhine, and within the Colmar      Pocket pointed to possible thrusts either southwestward down      the Sarre River valley or northward from the Colmar region,      predictions made by the Seventh Army's G-2 that proved to be      remarkably accurate.       On New Year's Eve Patch told his corps commanders that the      Germans would launch their major offensive early the next      day. Actually, first combat began shortly before midnight all      along the XV Corps front and along both the southeastern and      southwestern approaches from Bitche toward the Low Vosges.      The XIII SS Corps' two reinforced units, the 17th SS      Panzergrenadier and 36th Volksgrenadier Divisions, attacked      the 44th and 100th Division, whose prepared defense in depth      included a regiment from Task Force Harris. The Germans made      narrow inroads against the 44th's line near Rimling during      fighting characterized by constant American counterattacks      supported by French armor and Allied air attacks during clear      weather. After four days of vicious fighting the XIII SS      Corps' initial offensive had stalled.       The XC and LXXXIX Corps attacked near Bitche with four      infantry divisions abreast. Advancing through the Low Vosges,      they gained surprise by forgoing artillery preparations and      by taking advantage of fog and thick forests to infiltrate      Task Force Hudelson. As in the Losheim Gap, the defending      mechanized cavalry held only a thin line of strongpoints;      lateral mobility through the rough snowladen mountain roads      was limited. The light mechanized forces were soon overrun or      bypassed and isolated by the 559th, 257th, 361st, and 256th      Volksgrenadier Divisions. The Germans gained about 10 miles      during Nordwind's first four days, heading directly for the      Saverne Gap that linked the XV and VI Corps.       Both American corps commanders responded quickly to the      threat. Haislip's XV Corps plugged the northwestern exits to      the Low Vosges with Task Force Harris, units of the 14th      Armored and 100th Divisions, and a regiment from the 36th      Infantry Division, which Eisenhower had released from theater      reserve. Brooks' VI Corps did the same, stripping its      Lauterbourg and Rhine fronts and throwing in Task Force      Herren, combat engineers converted to infantry, and units of      the 45th and 75th Infantry Divisions to plug holes or block      routes out of the Low Vosges.       While units fought for twisted roads and mountain villages      in subfreezing temperatures, Obstfelder's First Army      committed the 6th SS Mountain Division to restart the advance      on the Saverne Gap. In response, Patch shifted the 103d      Infantry Division eastward from the XV Corps' northwestern      wing to hold the southeastern shoulder of the Vosges defense.      By 5 January the SS troopers managed to bull their way to the      town of Wingen-sur-Moder, about 10 miles short of Saverne,      but there they were stopped. With the Vosges' key terrain and      passes still under American control and the German advance      held in two salients, Nordwind had failed.       Meanwhile, the original SHAEF withdrawal plan, especially      the abandonment of Strasbourg, had created an Allied crisis      in confidence. Supporting Devers' decision not to withdraw,      the Free French government of General Charles de Gaulle      enlisted British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's support      to amend Eisenhower's orders. Fortunately, Patch's successful      defense temporarily shelved the SHAEF withdrawal plan, but      Alsace was not to be spared further German attacks. Hitler's      armored reserve and Himmler's Army Group Oberrhein had not      yet entered the battle.                           erasing the bulge       North of the Alsace region the Allied commanders were      concerned with reducing the enemy's Ardennes salient, now      called the ``Bulge.'' From the beginning of Wacht am Rhein      they had envisioned large-scale counterattacks. The decisions      as to where and how the attacks would be launched, however,      underscored their different perspectives. The theoretical      solution was to attack the salient at its base. Patton had in      fact planned to have the Third Army's right flank corps, the      XII, attack further eastward toward Bitburg, Germany, along      what he referred to as the ``honeymoon trail.'' Bradley,      however, as the commander responsible for the southern      attack, wanted to cover the shortest distance to relieve      Hodges' beleaguered First Army units. Overruling Patton, he      designated Houffalize, midway between Bastogne and St. Vith,      as a primary objective. Middleton's reinforced VIII Corps,      the westernmost force, would drive on Houffalize; the middle      force, Millikin's III Corps, would remain on Middleton's      right flank heading for St. Vith; and Eddy's XII Corps would      serve as an eastern hinge. Bradley's choice made the best use      of the existing roads; sending Millikin's IIII Corps along      advantageous terrain corridors avoided the favorable      defensive ground on the successive ridges east of Bastogne.      Once linked with the First Army, the 12th Army Group's      boundary would revert to its original northern line. Only      then would Bradley send the First and Third Armies east into      the Eifel toward Pruem and Bitburg in Germany. Bradley      further solidified his plan by committing newly arriving      reinforcements--the 11th Armored, 17th Airborne, and 87th      Infantry Divisions--to the west of Bastogne for Middleton's      VIII corps.       Montgomery had eyed Houffalize earlier, viewing the      approaches to the town from the northwest as excellent for a      corps-sized attack. His own extended defensive line on the      northern shoulder of the bulge and the piecemeal entry of      Collins' VII Corps into battle further west did not shake his      original concept. Much like Bradley, he saw an interim      solution as best. Concerned that American infantry losses in      Gerow's V Corps had not been replaced, and with the same      terrain and roadnet considerations that had jammed the German      assault westward, Montgomery ruled out a direct attack to the      south at the base of the bulge. As December waned,      Rundstedt's remaining armored reserves were centered near St.      Vith, and the roadnet there offered inadequate avenues to      channel the four U.S. armored divisions into an attack.      Unwilling to weaken his western flank now that his reserve      had been committed, Montgomery seemed more prone to let the      VII Corps attack from its present positions northwest of St.      Vith. Eisenhower raised the issue of committing the British      30 Corps. But having deactivated units to rebuild the corps      for use in his projected Rhineland offensive, Montgomery      agreed to move it across the Meuse to assume Collins' vacated      front, a transfer that would not be completely accomplished      until 2 January. From there, the 30 Corps would conduct      limited supporting attacks. Although Hodges, as First Army      commander, would select the precise counterattack axis, he      knew Montgomery's repeated preference for the VII Corps to      conduct the main effort and also Bradley's preference for a      quick linkup at Houffalize. Hodges' decision was thus      predictable. The VII Corps would constitute the First Army's      main effort, aimed at Houffalize. Ridgway's XVIII Airborne      Corps would cover the VII's northeastern flank, and, like      Millikin's III Corps, its advance would be pointed at St.      Vith. The Germans would thus be attacked head on.       Timing the counterstrokes also raised difficulties. The      American generals wanted the First Army to attack      immediately, claiming the Germans had reached their high-     water mark. Montgomery demurred, citing intelligence      predictions of an imminent offensive by the II SS Panzer      Corps--an assault he welcomed as it fit his concept of      weakening enemy armor further rather than conducting costly      attacks. Contrary to Montgomery's tactics, Eisenhower      preferred that the First Army attack immediately to prevent      the Germans from withdrawing their panzers and shifting them      southward.       Patton's renewed attacks in late December caused the Third      Army to learn firsthand how difficult the First Army battles      had been. In the Third Army sector the relief of Bastogne had      not changed the intensity of combat. As Manteuffel received      panzer reinforcements, he threw them into the Bastogne      salient before it could be widened and extended northward      toward the First Army. Patton's Third Army now encountered      panzers and divisions in numbers comparable to those that had      been pressing against the northern shoulder for the previous      10 days. In the week after Bastogne's relief the number of      German divisions facing the Third Army jumped from three to      nine around Bastogne and from four to five in the III and XII      Corps sector of the front.       The fighting during the 9-mile American drive from Bastogne      to Houffalize became a series of bitter attacks and      counterattacks in worsening weather. Patton quickly added the      17th Airborne, the 87th and 35th Infantry, and the 11th and      6th Armored Divisions to his attacking line, which stretched      25 miles from the Ourthe River to the Clerf. While the III      Corps continued its grim attacks northeastward against the      forested ridges of the Wiltz valley leading toward      German escape routes eastward out of the salient, VIII      Corps forces added some width to the Bastogne salient but      gained no ground northward before New Year's Day. Both      sides reinforced the sector with every available gun. In a      nearly week-long artillery duel Patton's renewed attacks      collided with Manteuffel's final efforts to eradicate the      Bastogne bridgehead.       During the same week German attacks continued along the      First Army line near the Elsenborn ridge and in the center of      the     XVIII Airborne Corps line before a general quiet descended      upon the northern front. In many areas the fields, forests,      and roads were now covered with waist-high snowdrifts,      further impeding the movement of both fighting men and their      resupply vehicles.       Climaxing Wacht am Rhein's efforts, the Luftwaffe launched      its one great appearance of the campaign during the early      morning hours of New Year's Day. Over 1,000 aircraft took off      before dawn to attack Allied airfields in Holland and      Belgium, with the objective of eliminating the terrible      scourge that the Allied air forces would again become once      the skies cleared over the entire battle area. The Germans      destroyed roughly 300 Allied machines, but their loss of more      than 230 pilots was a major blow to the Luftwaffe, whose lack      of trained aviators was even more critical than their fuel      shortages.       Casualties mounted, bringing on a manpower shortage in both      camps. Although the Germans continued to commit fresh      divisions until late December, the Americans, with only three      uncommitted divisions in theater, were forced to realign      their entire front. Many units moved from one combat to      another without rest or reinforcement. December's battles had      cost the Americans more than 41,000 casualties, and with      infantry replacements already critically short, antiaircraft      and service units had to be stripped to provide riflemen for      the line. Black soldiers were offered the opportunity to      fight within black platoons assigned to many white      battalions, a major break from previous Army policy.       Despite the shortage of replacements, both Patton's Third      Army and Hodges' First Army attacked on 3 January. Collins'      VII Corps in the north advanced toward the high ground      northwest of Houffalize, with two armored divisions in the      lead. Meeting stiff opposition from the LXVI Corps, VII Corps      infantry soon replaced the tanks as difficult terrain, icy      roads, and a tenacious defense using mines, obstacles,      antitank ambushes, and armored counterattacks took their      toll. The XVIII Airborne Corps moved its right flank south to      cover Collins' advance, and in the far west the British 30      Corps pushed eastward. Under intense pressure Hitler's forces      pulled back to a new line, based on the Ourthe River and      Houffalize, with the bulk of the SS panzer divisions      withdrawing from the battlefield. Poor weather restricted      Allied flyers to intermittent close support for only three      days in the nearly two weeks that VII Corps units fought      their way toward their juncture with the Third Army.       South of the Bulge the Third Army intensified its attacks      northward to meet the First Army. Still counting on      Middleton's VIII Corps to break through, Patton sent      Millikin's III Corps northeastward, hoping to enter the      roadnet and follow the terrain corridors to link up with      Ridgway's XVIII Airborne Corps attacking St. Vith. Despite      having less than fifty-five tanks operational, the I SS      Panzer Corps counterattacked the III Corps' 6th Armored      Division in ferocious tank fights unseen since the fall      campaign in Lorraine. While the III Corps' 90th Division      infantrymen broke through to the heights overlooking the      Wiltz valley, the VIII Corps to the west struggled against a      determined force fighting a textbook withdrawal. By 15      January Noville, the scene of the original northern point of      the Bastogne perimeter, was retaken. Five miles from      Houffalize, resistance disappeared. Ordered to escape, the      remaining Germans withdrew, and on the sixteenth the Third      Army's 11th Armored Division linked up with the First Army's      2d Armored Division at Houffalize.       The next day, 17 January, control of the First Army      reverted to Bradley's 12th Army Group. Almost immediately      Bradley began what he had referred to in planning as a      ``hurry-up'' offensive, another full-blooded drive claiming      the Rhine as its ultimate objective while erasing the Bulge      en route. On the twenty-third Ridgway's XVIII Airborne Corps,      now the First Army's main effort, and the 7th Armored      Division took St. Vith. This action was the last act of the      campaign for the First Army. Hodges' men, looking out across      the Losheim Gap at the Schnee Eifel and hills beyond, now      prepared for new battles.       In the Third Army sector Eddy's XII Corps leapt the Sure      River on 18 January and pushed north, hoping to revive      Patton's plan for a deep envelopment of the German escape      routes back across the Belgian-Luxembourg-German borders.      Intending to pinch the escape routes via the German tactical      bridges on the Our River, the 5th Division crossed the Sauer      at night, its main body pushing northward to clear the long      Skyline Drive ridge, where the 28th Division had faced the      first assaults. By the campaign's official end on the twenty-     fifth the V, XVIII, VIII, III, and XII Corps had a total of      nine divisions holding most of the old front, although the      original line east of the Our River had yet to be restored.                    Nordwind Revisited, 5-25 January       In early 1945, as Operation Wacht am Rhein in the Ardennes      started to collapse, Operation Nordwind in the Alsace was      revived. On 5 January, after Nordwind's main effort had      failed, Himmler's Army Group Oberrheim finally began its      supporting thrusts against the southern flank of Brooks' VI      Corps, with the XIV SS Corps launching a cross-Rhine attack      north of Strasbourg. Two days later, south of the city, the      Nineteenth Army launched Operation Sonnenwende (``Winter      Solstice''), attacking north, astride the Rhone-Rhine Canal      on the northern edge of the German-held Colmar Pocket. These      actions opened a three-week battle, whose ferocity rivaled      the Ardennes fighting in viciousness if not in scope and      threatened the survival of the VI Corps.       Sonnenwende sparked a new crisis for the 6th Army Group,      which had too few divisions to defend every threatened area.      With Brooks' VI Corps now engaged on both flanks, along the      Rhine at Gambsheim and to the northeast along the Low Vosges      mountain exits, Devers transferred responsibility for      Strasbourg to the French First Army, and de Lattre stretched      his forces to cover both the city and the Belfort Gap 75      miles to the south.       But the real danger was just northeast of Strasbourg.      There, the XIV SS Corps had punched out a 10-miles bridgehead      around the town of Gambsheim, brushing off small      counterattacks from Task Force Linden. Patch's Seventh Army,      reinforced with the newly arrived 12th Armored Division,      tried to drive the Germans from the Gambsheim area, a region      laced with canals, streams, and lesser watercourses. To the      south de Lattre's 3d Algerian Division defended Strasbourg,      while the rest of the French First Army kept the Colmar      Pocket tightly ringed. But the fate of Strasbourg and the      northern Alsace hinged on the ability of the American VI      Corps to secure its besieged flanks.       Having driven several wedges into the Seventh Army, the      Germans launched another attack on 7 January. The German      XXXIX Panzer Corps, with the 21st Panzer and the 25th      Panzergrenadier Divisions, attacked the greatly weakened VI      Corps center between the Vosges and Lauterbourg. Quickly      gaining ground to the edge of the Haguenau Forest 20 miles      north of Strasbourg, the German offensive rolled along the      same routes used during the successful attacks of August 1870      under Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke. Moltke's successors,      however, made no breakthrough. In the two Alsatian towns of      Hatten and Rittershoffen, Patch and Brooks threw in the      Seventh Army's last reserve, the 14th Armored Division.      Assisted by a mixture of other combat, combat support, and      service troops, the division halted the Germans.       While the VI Corps fought for its life in the Haguenau      Forest, the enemy renewed attacks on both flanks. During an      intense battle between units of the 45th Division and the 6th      SS Mountain Division in the Low Vosges, the Germans      surrounded an American battalion that had refused to give      ground. After a week's fighting by units attempting its      relief, only two soldiers managed to escape to friendly      lines.       Although gaining ground, the enemy had achieved no clear-     cut success. Hitler nevertheless committed his last reserves      on 16 January, including the 10th SS Panzer and the 7th      Parachute Divisions. These forces finally steamrolled a path      along the Rhine's west bank toward the XIV SS Corps'      Gambsheim bridgehead, over-running one of the green 12th      Armored Division's infantry battalions at Herrlisheim and      destroying one of its tank battalions nearby. This final      foray led Brooks to order a withdrawal on the twenty-first,      one that took the Germans by surprise and was completed      before the enemy could press his advantage.       Forming a new line along the Zorn, Moder, and Rothback      Rivers north of the Marne-Rhine Canal, the VI Corps commander      aligned his units into a cohesive defense with his badly      damaged but still game armored divisions in reserve.      Launching attacks during the night of 24-25 January, the      Germans found their slight penetrations eliminated by      vigorous counterattacks. Ceasing their assaults permanently,      they might have found irony in the Seventh Army's latest      acquisition from SHAEF reserves--the ``Battling Bastards of      Bastogne,'' the 101st Airborne Division, which arrived on the      Alsace front only to find the battle over.       Even before Nordwind had ended, the 6th Army Group      commander was preparing to eliminate the Colmar Pocket in      southern Alsace. Five French divisions and two American, the      3d Infantry and the rebuilt 28th Division, held eight German      infantry divisions and an armored brigade in a rich farming      area laced with rivers, streams, and a major canal but devoid      of significant hills or ridges. Devers wanted to reduce this      frozen, snow-covered pocket before thaws converted the      ploughed ground to a quagmire. General de Lattre's French      First Army would write finis to the Germans in the Colmar      Pocket, but it would be a truly Allied attack.       To draw the German reserves southward, plans called for      four divisions from the French I Corps to start the assault.      This initial foray would set the stage for the French II      Corps to launch the main effort in the north. The defending      Nineteenth Army's eight divisions were low on equipment but      well provided with artillery munitions, small arms, and      mines, and fleshed out with whatever manpower and materiel      that Himmler, the overall commander, could scrounge from the      German interior. Bad weather, compartmentalized terrain, and      fear of Himmler's SS secret police strengthened the German      defense.       On 20 January, in the south, Lt. Gen. Emile Bethouart's      French I Corps began its attack in a driving snowstorm.      Although its gains were limited by armored-infantry      counterattacks, the corps drew the Nineteenth Army's armor      southward, along with the arriving 2d Mountain Division. Two      days later, in the north, Maj. Gen. Amie de     Goislard de Monsabert's French II Corps commenced its attack,      led by the U.S. 3d Division. Reinforced by one of the 63d      Infantry Division's regiments, the 3d advanced over the first      of several watercourses and cleared the Colmar Forest. It met      resistance on the Ill River but continued to fight its way      forward through enemy counterattacks, subsequently crossing      the Colmar Canal and opening an avenue for the French 5th      Armored Division. The Allies pushed further eastward in      deepening snow and worsening weather, with the 28th and 75th      Divisions from the Ardennes following. On the twenty-fifth      Maj. Gen. Frank W. Milburn's XXI Corps joined the line.      Assuming control of the 3d, 28th, and 75th Divisions, the      12th Armored Division, which was shifted from reserves, and      the French 5th Armored Division, the corps launched the final      thrust to the Vauban Canal and Rhone-Rhine Canal bridges at      Neuf-Brisach. Although the campaign was officially over on 25      January, the American and French troops did not completely      clear the Colmar Pocket until 9 February. However, its      successful reduction marked the end of both the German      presence on French territory and the Nineteenth Army. And      with the fighting finally concluded in the Ardennes and      Alsace, the Allies now readied their forces for the final      offensive into Germany.                                analysis       Hitler's last offensives--in December 1944 in the Ardennes      region of Belgium and Luxembourg, and in January 1945 in the      Alsace region of France--marked the beginning of the end for      the Third Reich. With these final attacks, Hitler had hoped      to destroy a large portion of the Allied ground force and to      break up the Allied coalition. Neither objective came close      to being achieved. Although perhaps the Allies' victory in      the spring of 1945 was inevitable, no doubt exists that the      costs incurred by the Germans in manpower, equipment,      supplies, and morale during the Ardennes-Alsace battles were      instrumental in bringing about a more rapid end to the war in      Europe. Eisenhower had always believed that the German Army      on the Western Front had to be destroyed west of the Rhine      River to make a final offensive into Germany possible. When      added to the tremendous contributions of the Soviet Army,      which had been fighting the majority of Germany's armed      forces since 1941, the Ardennes-Alsace victory set the stage      for Germany's rapid collapse.       With little hope of staving off defeat, Germany gambled      everything on achieving a surprise operational decision on      the Western Front. In contrast, the Allied coalition pursued      a more conservative strategy. Since the Normandy invasion      Eisenhower's armies had neither the combat power necessary to      mount decisive operations in more than one sector nor the      reserves; more importantly, their logistical capability was      insufficient to fully exploit any major successes. The      resulting broadfront Allied advance steadily wore away the      German defenses; but, as in the case of the Ardennes and      Alsace fronts, the Allied lines had many weak points that      could be exploited by a desperate opponent. Moreover, once      Hitler's attacking legions had been stopped, the Allies      lacked the combat power to overwhelm the German divisions      defending their recently acquiring gains. In the Ardennes,      terrain and worsening weather aided the Germans in holding      off Allied counterattacks for an entire month, ultimately      allowing them to withdraw a sizable portion of their initial      assault force with perhaps one-third of their committed      armor.       The battle in the Alsace appeared to be less dramatic than      in the Ardennes, but was no less an Allied victory. Hitler      spent his last reserves in Alsace--and with them the ability      to regain the initiative anywhere. Like the Normandy      Campaign, the Ardennes-Alsace struggle provided the necessary      attrition for the mobile operations that would end the war.      The carefully husbanded enemy reserves that the Allies      expected to meet in their final offensive into Germany had      been destroyed in December and January.       Some thirty-two U.S. divisions fought in the Ardennes,      where the daily battle strength of U.S. Army forces averaged      twenty-six divisions and 610,000 men. Alsace added eleven      more divisions to the honors list, with an average battle      strength of 230,000. Additionally, separate divisional      elements as well as divisions arriving in sector at the end      of the campaign granted participation credit to three more      divisions. But the cost of victory was staggering. The final      tally for the Ardennes alone totaled 41.315 casualties in      December to bring the offensive to a halt and an additional      39,672 casualties in January to retake lost ground. The SHAFE      casualty estimate presented to Eisenhower in February 1945      listed casualties for the First Army at 39,957; for the Third      Army at 35,525; and for the British 30 Corps, which helped at      the end, at 1,408. Defeating Hitler's final offensive in the      Alsace was also costly; the Seventh Army recorded its January      battle losses at 11,609. Sickness and cold weather also      ravaged the fighting lines, with the First, Third, and      Seventh Armies having cold injury hospital admissions of more      than 17,000 during the entire campaign. No official German      losses for the Ardennes have been computed, but they have      been estimated at between 81,000 and 103,000. A recently      published German scholarly source gave the following German      casualty totals: Ardennes--67,200; Alsace (not including      Colmar Pocket)--22,932. Most of the figures cited do not      differentiate between permanent losses (killed and missing),      wounded, and non-battle casualties.       Analysts of coalition warfare and Allied generalship may      find much to criticize in the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign. Often      common-place disputes over command and strategy were      encouraged and overblown by newspaper coverage, which      reflected national biases. Predictably, Montgomery inspired      much American ire both in revisiting command and strategy      issues, which had been debated since Normandy, and in      pursuing methodical defensive-offensive tactics. Devers and      de Lattre, too, strained coalition amity during their      successful retention of liberated French terrain. But in both      cases the Allied command structure weathered the storm, and      Eisenhower retained a unified command. Preservation of a unit      Allied command was perhaps his greatest achievement. In the      enemy camp the differences between Hilter and his generals      over the objectives of the Ardennes offensive were marked,      while the uncoordinated efforts of Obstfelder's First Army      and Himmler's Army Group Oberrhein for the Alsace offensive      were appaling.       The Ardennes-Alsace battlefield proved to be no general's      playground, but rather a place where firepower and bravery      meant more than plans or brilliant maneuver. Allied and      German generals both consistently came up short in bringing      their plans to satisfactory fruition. That American soldiers      fought and won some of the most critical battles of World War      II in the Ardennes and the Alsace is now an indisputable      fact.

Ardennes-Alsace 1944-1945                            Further Readings       A number of official histories provide carefully documented      accounts of operations during the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign.      U.S. Army operations are covered in Hugh M. Cole, The      Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge (1965); Charles B. MacDonald,      The Last Offensive (1973); and Jeffrey J. Clarke and Robert      Ross Smith, Riviera to the Rhine (1991), three volumes in the      United States Army in World War II series. Air operations are      detailed in Wesley F. Craven and James L. Cate, eds., Europe:      Argument to V-E Day, January 1944 to May 1945 (1951), the      third volume in the Army Air Forces in World War II series,      and the British perspective and operations are covered in L.      F. Ellis, Victory in the West: the Defeat of Germany (1968).      Among the large number of books that describe the fighting in      the Ardennes are Gerald Astor, A Blood-Dimmed Tide (1992),      John S. D. Eisenhower, The Bitter Woods (1969), Charles B.      MacDonald, A Time for Trumpets (1985), S. L. A. Marshall, The      Eight Days of Bastogne (1946), Jean Paul Pallud, Battle of      the Bulge Then and Now (1984), Danny S. Parker, Battle of the      Bulge (1991), and Robert F. Phillips, To Save Bastogne      (1983). At the small-unit level Charles MacDonald's Company      Commander (1947) is still the standard classic. Fighting in      the Alsace region has been sparsely covered, but Keith E.      Bonn's When the Odds Were Even (1994) is valuable.
