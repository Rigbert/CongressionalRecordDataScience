That is, would the Senator be willing to take up her issue, that which she finds objectionable about the defense authorization bill, and debate that thoroughly on the floor--and if she is more persuasive or has a better case, then, of course, she would prevail on that--instead of blocking the entire authorization bill? This is my concern. The Senate is different than the other body that I served in for 8 years. Over there, you cannot do that. But in the Senate I guess one person can just block a bill from being passed. I hope the Senator from Texas would consider offering her position as an amendment to strike the language that was put in by the committee.  I will not ask for a response now, but I hope she would consider doing that.
