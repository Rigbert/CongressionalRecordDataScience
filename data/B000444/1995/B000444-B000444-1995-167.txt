 I wish to inform my friend from Mississippi that in addition to the Senator from Mississippi and the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, the Senator from Delaware has also been briefed on all of the investigative matters including the one to which the Senator refers.  I will be prepared and am ready to speak to that, but I will yield back. I do not have the floor. I thank my friend for his time, but assure him that I am aware the committee has been briefed. I see absolutely no need to refer this back to the committee, but I will speak to that in response to my friend's arguments.
