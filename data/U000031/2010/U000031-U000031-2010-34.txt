Joseph Police Department who is retiring after 31 years of outstanding service. Sergeant Smiedendorf has had a deep and lasting impact on the St. Joseph community, especially in his work with young people.  A native of Niles, Michigan, Sergeant Smiedendorf is a graduate of Western Michigan University and began his career in St. Joseph in 1979. Rick was a tireless advocate in the area of crime prevention. He started a number of programs in the department, including the Crime Prevention Unit, the Neighborhood Watch program, the Dedicated Officer Program in the elementary schools, and the Community Child Watch. Generations of children knew him as Officer Rick, or Sergeant Rick, or McGruff the Crime Dog.  Throughout his career, Sergeant Rick connected prevention and law enforcement programs to the residents of Southwest Michigan. He helped organize the local National Night Out program, and the Community Emergency Response Team. He was named Officer of Year twice by the Benton Harbor St. Joseph Exchange Club, and was recently named Outstanding Crime Prevention Practioner of the Year by the West Michigan Crime Prevention Association.  Southwest Michigan is very fortunate Rick Smiedendorf stayed close to home. Thousands of people have been impacted by his hard work and commitment to crime prevention and keeping the public safe. I salute his efforts and thank him for his service in my hometown of St. Joseph. I wish Sergeant Rick all the best in the future.                          ____________________
