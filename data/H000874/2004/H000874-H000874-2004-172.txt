Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that response and I thank the gentleman for that procedure.  With respect to the Intelligence Authorization bill, the gentleman has listed that bill for next week. Under what procedures will this be considered and, specifically, can the gentleman comment on whether the Democratic amendments will be allowed, including amendments in the nature of a substitute?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I do not want to speak for the committee, but I believe that on the Intelligence Reauthorization Act, I believe the committee will solicit all types of amendments and will have a very lengthy debate. I would anticipate there will be many amendments allowed on that bill.  On the Budget Enforcement Act, did the gentleman ask about that?
