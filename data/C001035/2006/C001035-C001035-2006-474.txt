President, last night the majority leader filed cloture on the lobbying reform bill. Under the rule, that vote would occur on Friday although it is hoped that the vote could be expedited and occur sometime today.  As a reminder, the majority leader has announced that it is also possible--and indeed we hope--to consider the lobbying reform-related amendments throughout the day today if an agreement can be reached.  Also, Senators should be aware that all first-degree amendments to the lobbying reform bill must be filed at the desk by 1 o'clock today as provided for under rule XXII.                          ____________________[Page S1925]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE                           Order of Procedure
