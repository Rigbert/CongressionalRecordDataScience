Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Howard ``Reed'' Heritage, who passed away on Saturday, July 21, 2018.  Reed was born and raised in the town of Richwood, New Jersey. Reed was part of the first class at nearby Clearview High School and later graduated from Delaware Valley College. In the early part of the 1970s, Reed moved to California, where he would go to work on behalf of the California Farm Bureau. As an advocate for one of California's largest industries, Reed represented farmers and sought solutions to the many challenges that impacted their businesses.  When he was not working on behalf of California farmers, Reed loved to cheer on his favorite sports teams--including the San Francisco 49ers and the San Francisco Giants. Reed was also a big fan of the Olympic Games and traveled to watch the games in person in Athens, Beijing, Atlanta, Montreal, Los Angeles, and Sydney. Traveling to new cities throughout Europe and Asia was one of Reed's favorite past times.  I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to Reed's family and friends, who I know will deeply miss him.                          ____________________
