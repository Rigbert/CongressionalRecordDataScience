Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the latest Serbian onslaught directed against innocent civilians in Sarajevo, an UN-designated safe-haven. The events of the past 24 hours underscore the fact that the besieged city of Sarajevo remains in a virtual stranglehold by well-armed Serb militants. UN sources confirmed that at least 1,000 shells were fired on Sarajevo. The heavy shelling of the Bosnian capital, the worst in over a year, resulted in a score of injuries and deaths. Sporadic shelling continues today.  Some have had the audacity to argue that both sides are equally to blame for the attack, a pretext later used to deny the Bosnian Government's urgent request for protection of Sarajevo. Attempts to equate the forces of the sovereign Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina with the marauding bandits led by Radovan Karadzic, a mastermind of genocidal aggression in Bosnia, are an affront which must be resoundingly rejected. Karadzic, along with Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic and former police chief Mico Stanisic, are under active investigation by the War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, for their respective roles in the war launched by the Serbs in 1992.  For 3 years now, international negotiators have traveled a well-worn path to Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters. Nearly a year has passed since the Contact Group presented its peace plan on a take-it-or-leave-it-basis. The Bosnian Government accepted the proposal within the 2 week deadline. The plan has been repeatedly rejected by the Bosnian Serbs with relative impunity despite threats by the Contract Group that rejection would carry severe consequences. Further negotiations at this time can only be expected to bring further concessions to meet Karadzic's demands. [[Page E1064]]   Yesterday's attack on Sarajevo highlights the pathetic state of affairs and utter impotence of the international community which has effectively abrogated its responsibility for enforcing Security Council resolutions in Bosnia. The shelling occurs at a time when the United Nations is reviewing its mission in Bosnia--a mission which, in my opinion, has been seriously undermine since UN forces began negotiating with the militants shortly after UNPROFOR's deployment. Further delay in deciding what, if any, role the UN can or should play in Bosnia will only make the withdrawal of UNPROFOR that much more difficult and potentially dangerous should such a determination ultimately be reached.  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that measures taken by the Security Council to date have failed to maintain international peace and security as it relates to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This being the case, it is unconscionable that that country continues to be denied its right to self-defense, in clear violation of article 51 of the UN Charter.  Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 1172, legistion which lift the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina. This bill enjoys considerable bipartisan support as evidenced by the growing list of cosponsors. Mr. Speaker, I urge colleagues to support the lifting of the arms embargo, an action fully in keeping with Bosnia's inherent right to self-defense.                          ____________________
