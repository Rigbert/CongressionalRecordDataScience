I apologize. On the war supplemental, very important bill that I know the gentleman and I are very interested in. As you know, the Senate has marked up its supplemental in committee. Chairman Obey I know is working to get a bill ready for committee consideration. It is possible that we would consider that next week if, in fact, Mr. Obey and the committee are ready to report that out.
