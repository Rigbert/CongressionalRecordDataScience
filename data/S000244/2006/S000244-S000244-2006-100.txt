 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1176, the Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2006. This bill is narrowly tailored to correct specific liability exposure problems for nonprofit sports rulemaking bodies, such as the National Federation of State High School Associations. The nonprofit athletic rulemaking bodies covered by this bill play a critical role in facilitating all levels and all types of sports. Nonprofit rulemaking bodies use the expertise of experienced volunteers to set forth rules for athletic competition and practices that preserve sports traditions and minimize risks to participants.  However, this rulemaking function is a predictive endeavor without the benefit of perfect foresight, and sports involve inherent risks that cannot all be minimized with a rule. Thus, when inevitable accidents do occur, nonprofit rulemaking bodies are often sued along with the local school district, coach, and referees because such organizations are presumed to have ``deep pockets.''  In 1997, Congress passed the Volunteer Protection Act to shield volunteers from liability for some forms of negligence in response to concerns that America's lawsuit culture was inhibiting this country's risk tradition of volunteerism. However, because the Volunteer Protection Act does not protect organizations, this growing trend of lawsuits has led to a dramatic increase in the insurance premiums for many rulemaking associations. For example, the National High School Federation, which develops rules for 17 different sports, saw a 300 percent increase for insurance premiums in just over 3 years. This increase means that insurance premiums now make up over 10 percent of the Federation's annual budget. These trends deprive the Federation of funds that should be directed towards vital resources, such as sports equipment upgrades or routine field maintenance. If these insurance premiums continue to skyrocket, the rulemaking authorities may be unable to attract the quality of volunteers necessary to write effective rules, or worse, they may be driven out of existence entirely.  This legislation limits liability exposure for these nonprofit athletic rulemaking organizations in a very targeted manner. Modeled on the Volunteer Protection Act, it does not confer blanket immunity. Rather, liability will still attach for gross negligence or reckless, willful or criminal misconduct.  This bill is targeted at liability stemming only from an organization's promulgation of rules of play. During the committee's consideration of the bill, some raised concerns about the extent of the liability protections of the bill and claimed that it would protect, among others, entities that hire child molesters without conducting a background check. To ensure against such an unintended consequence, the legislation adds sexual assault, sexual molestation, and sexual harassment to the list of claims, including antitrust, labor, and civil rights claims, that are specifically exempted from the liability protections of this bill.  So, to be absolutely clear, this bill as it comes to the floor today has been amended to meet every single objection to date about the scope and extent of the liability protections of the bill. Consequently, this bill should enjoy overwhelming bipartisan support.  Further, this bill does not prevent suits against nonrulemaking entities, such as the owner of a field of play or an equipment manufacturer, who are likely to be implicated in a sports-related injury claim.  By curbing the worst excesses of the lawsuit culture Congress can ensure that those who teach our children sports are more concerned about fair play and good sportsmanship than their insurance rates or a potential lawsuit. This bill is supported by the National Federation of State High School Associations, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Council of Youth Sports, the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States, and Little League Baseball, among others.                              {time}  1130  Madam Speaker, I would like to submit for the Record a letter from Robert Kanaby, executive director of the National Federation of State High School Associations, showing the support of his organization and each of the 50 individual State high school associations for this legislation.  I hope that all my colleagues will join me in passing this bill.                                            National Federation of                               State High School Associations,                                 Indianapolis, IN, March 15, 2006.       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the National      Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), I am      writing to voice our strong support for the ``Nonprofit      Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2005,'' H.R. 1176,      and urge you to vote for this legislation when it reaches the      House floor. On March 2, 2006, the Judiciary Committee voted      to support moving this bill forward, and we are looking for      your support when the bill reaches the House floor.       Amateur and education-based sports are an important part of      our society. These activities provide great benefits for      participants and spectators alike. It is widely acknowledged      that youth and interscholastic sports are a tremendous asset      to young people and an important part of the community. In      addition, they provide experiences for athletes that assist      them in becoming better human beings and citizens in our      society.       The National Federation of State High School Associations,      a non-profit organization that makes rules for high school      sports, has been the target of liability claims alleging      negligence due to the passage or adoption of rules for      sanctioned or approved competitions. These allegations have      resulted in an increase in the number of liability claims      against this organization. The claims are beginning to have a      detrimental financial and operational impact on the NFHS and      could eventually affect our ability to continue to provide      these services to our nation's high schools.       While these claims are believed to be without merit, the      cost of defending claims and the uncertainty of judicial      proceedings have created significant challenges. It is      possible we will need to reconsider providing such rules or      guidelines in the future. This may be true of other amateur      sports rules makers. Without this legislation, we expect this      situation will continue to deteriorate and will further      jeopardize non-profit organizations that make rules for      amateur athletic competition.       For education-based athletics to continue in America,      nonprofit athletic organizations must have the ability to      make rules without the threat of these claims.       A list of state associations supporting this legislation by      their adoption of the enclosed resolution is attached.           Sincerely,                                                 Robert F. Kanaby,                                               Executive Director.                               RESOLUTION       Resolved, by the members of the National Council of the      National Federation of State High School Associations,      representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia, that      in the interest of the millions of young people who benefit      from participation in amateur sports, the United States      Congress be urged to adopt the ``Nonprofit Athletic      Organization Protection Act of 2004.''
