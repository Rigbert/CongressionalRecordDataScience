Average families have to worry about a lot of issues: the health of their children, whether they can make the mortgage payment. If families can face more than one responsibility, our Government certainly can.  It is not enough to say we are just going to focus on the Middle East and what might happen there in the years to come; let's talk about what is happening in the middle west and the East and the South and the North, all across the United States. What are we doing to make sure this economy turns around and gives people a chance?  I spoke to a friend of mine in the plumbers union in Chicago who told me that the cost of prescription drugs for retirees last year went up 300 percent in his one local. He said: I don't know if we can meet our obligation to our seniors that we promised over the years.  As for corporate greed and scandals, the Senator from North Dakota talks about the bankruptcies and the money squandered before bankruptcy. There is a company called Tyco where the CEO, Mr. Kozlowki, has been written up in the Wall Street Journal. Their company didn't go into bankruptcy. It is still in business. But what he did to it was to bleed it of a lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars in the years leading up to his resignation.  All of these things have discredited American business. They have discredited the good, honest businesspeople who lead our Nation effectively. Frankly, they have put a damper on America's feelings about buying stock. The President needs to address this.  We passed the Sarbanes bill. It was a good bill. I was glad to vote for it. There is more to do: the bankruptcy code, that corporate bankruptcy will take into account when people have squandered the money of corporations so that it comes back into the corporation and away from these corporate executives; that they be charged with crimes when they are guilty. All of these issues need to be taken up. It is an agenda which we should face because it is an agenda the American people face every single day. And unless and until we do that, we are not meeting our obligation.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
