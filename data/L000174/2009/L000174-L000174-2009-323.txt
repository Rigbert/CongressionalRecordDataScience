. 1626. This good-government bill creates a more consistent and standard method for lawyers and judges to calculate court deadlines. It is a small but important bipartisan bill that will improve the effectiveness of our judicial system.  Last week, the House of Representatives passed this bill on their suspension calendar. The Senate has given its unanimous support to this legislation, and I look forward to the President signing this bill.  Last month, I introduced an identical measure in the Senate with Senators Specter, Whitehouse, and Sessions. In the last few weeks, I have worked with many others in the House and Senate to ensure that this legislation proceeded quickly through both Chambers of Congress. Representative Hank Johnson has worked especially hard to move this bill through the House. We have a strong bipartisan bill that will result in significant improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of our judicial system.  This legislation incorporates the full recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States to alter deadlines in certain statutes affecting court proceedings to account for recent amendments to the Federal time-computation rules. It provides judges and practitioners with commonsense deadlines that are less confusing and less complex than current deadlines and also ensures that existing time periods are not shortened.  After much study and significant public comment, the Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and the Advisory Committees on Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil, and Criminal Rules arrived at proposed new rules intended to provide predictability and uniformity to the current process of calculating court deadlines. The proposed rules respond, in part, to findings from the Judicial Conference that the current time-computation process is confusing and can lead to missed deadlines and litigants' loss of important rights. Under the current time-calculation rules, weekends and holidays are not counted when calculating court deadlines of less than 30 days but are counted for calculating court deadlines longer than 30 days. The proposed new rules simplify this process by counting holidays and weekends regardless of a court deadline's time period. According to the Judicial Conference, these proposed changes would respond to practitioners' complaints and concerns from judges.  This legislation amends a number of Federal civil and criminal statutes affecting court proceedings and harmonizes them with the proposed rules. First, this remedial bill alters certain statutory court deadlines to counterbalance any shortening of the time period resulting from the ``days are days'' approach. For example, the bill changes 5 days to 7 days, and 10 days to 14 days, to prevent time periods from becoming shorter when a practitioner counts all days, including weekends. This change would, in effect, maintain the same time periods in the statutes. In addition, if a time period ends on a holiday or a weekend, the time period would be extended to the next business day. The bill also changes some statutory deadlines that would otherwise be inconsistent with the amended rules deadlines and lead to confusion.  Both the Department of Justice and the Judicial Conference urge swift consideration of this proposal on or before December 1 of this year, the date the Judicial Conference's amendments to the rules take effect. I am pleased that we are able to accommodate their request.  Passing this bill is the right thing to do. I know that the legal community will benefit from the uniform court deadlines that this legislation provides. American citizens will have their rights more fully protected by court deadlines that are clear and unambiguous. Even more, public confidence in our justice system can only be strengthened when court procedures operate in a manner that is free of any unnecessary confusion.  I thank the Department of Justice and the wide array of legal and bar organizations that have supported the Judicial Conference's recommendations incorporated in this bill, including of the American College of Trial Lawyers, the Council of Appellate Lawyers, and the American Bar Association's Section of Litigation and Criminal Justice Section. I am especially grateful to the Administrative Office of the Courts which, on behalf of the Judicial Conference, sent us those policy recommendations from the Federal judiciary. Those recommendations are included in this bill, and I commend them for their hard work and attention to this issue.  Only a few months into a new administration and a new Congress, it is incumbent upon us to continue to focus on the requirements of the Federal judiciary that our citizens and our Republic need and deserve. The measure we passed yesterday is a positive step in the right direction.  I look forward to President Obama promptly signing it into law.                          ____________________
