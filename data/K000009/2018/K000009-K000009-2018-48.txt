Speaker, the 2016 election and its fallout highlighted what many Americans already knew, that special interests bankroll candidates in exchange for expected favors down the road and loopholes allow foreign governments to influence our elections. Look no further than the pervasive impact of Russian-sponsored political ads on Facebook in 2016.  My bill, the REFUSE Act, Repelling Encroachment by Foreigners into U.S. Elections, tightens campaign finance laws and lobbyist disclosure rules to protect our democracy from foreign influence.  First, to stem the bleed of special interest money into our elections, our bill sets a reasonable limit on foreign ownership within corporate PACs and 501(c)(4) nonprofits that spend on our elections. Second, the bill tightens reporting requirements for foreign agents and gives the Justice Department real enforcement authority to go after the bad guys.  Until we repeal Citizens United, which threw open the floodgates for billionaires and special interests to spend unlimited secret money on our elections, we need commonsense legislation like the REFUSE Act.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in fortifying our democratic Republic against foreign influence.                          ____________________
