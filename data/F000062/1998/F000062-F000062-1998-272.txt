There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         The National Coalition for Osteoporosis and Related Bone            Diseases,                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 1998.     The Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Feinstein: As representatives of the      Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases National Coalition,      which consists of scientists and patients, we are writing to      urge you to vote against human cloning legislation which      would ban some types of promising stem cell research.       We support a ban on cloning a human being. We see no      ethical or medical justification for anyone in the public or      private sector, whether in a research or clinical setting, to      create a human child using somatic cell nuclear transfer      technology. However, we are concerned that legislation which      would expedite a ban on cloning would also effectively      eliminate research on ``customized'' stem cell research which      one day could lead to cures for many diseases.       Congress needs to be extremely cautious in drafting      legislation too quickly on this very complex issue. We are      concerned that Congress will not take the time to analyze the      effects on stem cell research already underway or consider      the future benefits of such research. It is our hope that      with input from the scientific community Congress will come      to a consensus which will address the public's concern about      human cloning and yet allow the scientific community to do      their work.       Again, we urge you to protect stem cell research which can      generate cells for the treatment of numerous diseases      including osteoporosis and related bone diseases. If you need      further information about the proposed legislation, please      contact Bente E. Cooney, Director of Public Policy at the      National Osteoporosis Foundation (202) 223-2226.           Sincerely,     Bente E. Cooney, MSW,       Director of Public Policy, National Osteoporosis      Foundation.     Fred Singer, MD,       Chairman, The Paget Foundation.
