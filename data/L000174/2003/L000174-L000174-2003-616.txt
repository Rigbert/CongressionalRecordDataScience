President, today I pay tribute to a young Vermonter whose priorities are in the right place. Matt Sheftic is the center for the University of Vermont basketball team, the first Catamounts team to reach the NCAA tournament.  Before choosing to play basketball for Coach Tom Brennan, Matt was a standout for the Essex Junction Hornets, leading them to the 1998 Vermont State Championship. He was a first team all-state selection twice, and in 1999 was named Vermont's Mr. Basketball by the Burlington Free Press, and was Vermont's Gatorade Player of the Year. At UVM, he also serves his country as a member of the U.S. Army ROTC program.  Aside from his successes on the basketball court, in the classroom, and in the ROTC program, Matt is first and foremost dedicated to his family. When his sister Lauren battled an unexpected serious illness, Matt left the basketball team to help care for her. His priorities speak volumes about him as an outstanding young man, about the closeness of the Sheftic family, and about the wonderful job his parents have done raising him.  Matt Sheftic's story is told in an article by Joe Burris in the March 20 edition of the Boston Globe. Today, in honor of Matt Sheftic and his family, and in memory of Lauren Sheftic, I ask that the article ``For Vermont's Sheftic, family came first'' be printed into the Record.  The article follows:  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 20, 2003]       Comeback player; for Vermont's Sheftic, Family Came First                            (By Joe Burris)       Burlington, VT.--Big men get nervous, too. Vermont center      Matt Sheftic--a 22-year-old junior with Jack Sikma's shooting      touch and Paul Bunyan's body--stood on the sideline moments      before the Catamounts' America East final against Boston      University, pondering how he would play in the biggest game      of his career. Worry set in; Sheftic's melon-sized calves      trembled.       But he knew it wasn't too late to dial heaven. As he often      does during the national anthem, Sheftic called upon his      sister Lauren--who died in 2001 at age 18 from a brain      aneurysm after a courageous struggle that lasted nearly a      year--and asked if she would loan him ``the strength she      showed'' for the next two hours.       Sheftic missed his first shot, with 18:04 left. With 17:25      left, he turned the ball over. In fact, he didn't score until      the 11:01 mark of the first half, on his second shot of the      game. By then Vermont had raced out to a double-digit lead      and Sheftic began to settle; legs that once trembled became      sturdy enough to help carry his team.       With 8:33 left, he scored on an up-and-under post move. BU      left him open at the top of the key with 5:43 left and he      capitalized with a basket. He scored two more soft-stroke      baskets to finish the first half with 10 points on 5-for-10      shooting.       Over the last 9:41, when BU rallied and subsequently forged      ahead, Sheftic was the Catamounts' go-to guy, scoring 8      points. His poise helped keep Vermont close in a contest at a      time when the partisan BU crowd was loudest.       ``After I hit a couple shots, I really settled down and I      started to get my confidence, and all of my nervousness in my      legs just left,'' said Sheftic.       Vermont's David Hehn won it for the Catamounts with a      fadeaway baseline basket with 5.6 seconds left, but Sheftic      was named most outstanding player, scoring 23 points on 10-     for-17 shooting and adding 6 boards to lead UVM to its first      NCAA Tournament bid. The Catamounts are the 16th seed in the      West and will meet top-seeded Arizona in Salt Lake City      today.       ``I was just thinking that she was with me at the [high      school] state championship game, and just how awesome it      would have been for her to be there for [last Saturday's]      game,'' said Sheftic about Lauren, who was three years      younger. ``But I knew she was watching anyway, and I really      felt like she was there with me.''       For Sheftic, his involvement with Vermont basketball this      season is a far cry from last season. He enters today's      Arizona game as the team's second-leading scorer (10.8 points      per game) and rebounder (6.4 rebounds) and is third with 54      assists. The Essex Junction, Vt., resident who chose to stay      home rather than accept lures from big-name programs such as      Providence and Southern California has led UVM in scoring in      five games and in rebounding in six. Moreover, the 6-foot-8-     inch, 260-pound widebody has been a team leader. He has      helped to alleviate pressure from other players--including      sophomore Taylor Coppenrath, the America East Player of the      Year.       ``We had a situation where when somebody said something      about Taylor, that he wasn't that good, Sheftic became his      big brother and his protector,'' said coach Tom Brennan. ``It      was really a neat thing to watch.''       ``I don't know if I've consciously taken it upon myself to      be a leader,'' said Sheftic. ``I try to help out the team      wherever I can.''       Last season, Sheftic didn't play at all.       Lauren took ill during winter 2000. Sheftic, the oldest of      five children and the only male, endured the 2000-01 season,      but during the fall of last year, weeks before the start of      the season, he decided to take a redshirt to spend more time      with his ailing sister.       ``It was really an unbelievable time for me,'' said      Sheftic. ``Thinking back on it now, it was like a dream, a      nightmare. My sister ended up with a brain aneurysm and was      really sick, and we had a really tough season the previous      year, when we finished 12-17. I'm a business major, and my      classes are really tough.       ``Making a decision to leave the team, it just became too      much for me. I just felt totally overloaded. I felt like I      was drowning, like I couldn't get up to the surface to      breathe with my school work, going back and forth to the      hospital, trying to help my family out, trying to be there      for my parents.       ``You just didn't know what was going to happen. Phone      calls from my mother would range from, `Lauren's making great      progress today,' to `We took 10 steps back today, she's sick      again.' It was an emotional roller coaster I was on, as well      as the season, just trying to get up for games, when I felt      like all my emotions were with my sister.''       Sheftic went to Brennan's office and relayed his desire to      sit out the season. ``He was looking across at me and saying,      `T.B., I just can't do it,' '' said Brennan. ``They were      very, very close, and it really ripped his heart out. He told      me, `I really need to spend time with her. Basketball doesn't      mean as much to me.' ''       During his sister's battle, he battled his own sense of      grief while helping his three youngest sisters cope. Then, he      said, his sister suffered her biggest setback.       ``She went in to get a routine shunt in her head, which is      a procedure where they drain pressure in her head,'' Sheftic      said. ``And when they went to drill into her head, they hit      her brain with the drill, and it caused another brain      aneurysm. So almost a year later, we were in the exact same      spot.       ``We had to make a decision. My mom had spent every single      day of her recovery with Lauren. And one day [before the      surgery], Lauren told her that if anything like this happened      again she didn't want to do it again, because it was so      painful for her and such a long road.'' Sheftic was at his      sister's bedside when she died shortly after the surgery.       ``I think my family has become so much more important to      me,'' said Sheftic. ``Family is always important, but I don't      know: You sometimes start to take your family for granted.      They'd be at my basketball games and I loved the support, but      I guess you don't realize how good it is to go home until      you've gone through some kind of adversity with your      family.''       Sheftic returned this season and picked up where he left      off as a sophomore, when he averaged 10 points per game. In      his first game back, he recorded a double-double: 20 points      and 10 boards against Eastern Michigan. That was followed by      a 22-point, six-assist contest against Albany, where he went      10 for 10 from the floor.       ``Sheftic as a recruit was a star. When we got Sheftic, it      was like, `Wow, this is a tremendous recruit,' '' said      Brennan. ``And yet he has never said, `I need the ball more.      You're not running plays for me.' He has fit in really well      since he's been back.''       Said Sheftic: ``Feeling as much pain as I did that year,      I'm so much more thankful and appreciative of having good      times and friends and family, and these games mean everything      to me.''                          ____________________
