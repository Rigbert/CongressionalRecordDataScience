 Moynihan, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr.         Leahy):  S. 1511. A bill to impose sanctions on Burma; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.              The Burma Freedom and Democracy Act of 1995  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Moynihan, D'Amato, and Leahy to introduce the Burma Freedom And Democracy Act of 1995.  Early in December, prospects for democracy in Burma took a turn for the worse. In a remarkable act of courage, Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues in the National League for Democracy decided not to participate in the National Convention orchestrated by the State Law and Order Restoration Council. In announcing her decision she said, ``A country which is drawing up a constitution that will decide the future of the state should have the confidence of the people.'' This is a standard that SLORC cannot meet.  Burma is not one step closer to democracy today than it was in the immediate aftermath of the crackdown in 1988. Indeed, in Aung San Suu Kyi's own words, ``I have been released, that is all.''  In fact, the situation continues to deteriorate. A recent report filed by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Burma, Dr. Yokota, is a fresh, sharp reminder of the level of despair and the brutality suffered by the people of Burma at the hands of SLORC.  In lengthy remarks on December 8, I reviewed for my colleagues in detail the Yokota report. Let me take a moment to briefly review its most recent conclusions.  Virtually no improvements have occurred since the spring report of the Special Rapporteur. Dr. Yokota reported that the National Convention ``is not heading towards restoration of democracy'' and criticized SLORC for not affording him the opportunity to meet with convention participants free from SLORC supervision.  But, those criticisms were mild compared to his determinations with regard to human rights and the quality of life for the average Burmese citizen.  A complex array of security laws are used to harass, intimidate, and afford SLORC soldiers sweeping powers of arrest and detention. He charged the military with carrying out arbitrary killings, rape, torture, forced porterage, forced labor, forced relocations, and confiscation of private property. He substantiated many refugee claims that this pattern of abuse continues most frequently ``in border areas where the Army is engaged military operations or where regional development projects are taking place.'' He added, ``many of the victims of such atrocious acts belong to ethnic national populations, especially women, peasants, daily wage earners and other peaceful civilians who do not have enough money to avoid mistreatment by bribing.''  If anyone had any doubts about the ruthless nature of the SLORC regime, I encourage them to take a few minutes to read this report.  SLORC has now turned its attention to the rising influence of Suu Kyi and her supporters. SLORC has cynically used the fact of her release to attempt to demonstrate they are relaxing their grip on power. Unfortunately, it is a sadistic charade.  Although Suu Kyi has repeatedly called for a dialog to reconcile the nation, SLORC has rejected every attempt to include her or the NLD in a credible political process. Last week Suu Kyi was personally attacked in the official newspapers as a ``traitor'' who should be ``annihilated.'' When the NLD announced they would not participate in the National Convention, senior officials woke up to find their homes surrounded by soldiers and their movements shadowed by military thugs.  In response to this assault on democracy and democratic activities, members of the business community have made two arguments. First, the allegations are exaggerations of the conditions. And, second, trade, investment, and economic improvements will yield political progress just as it has in China and Vietnam.  Mr. President, I urge the business community to read Dr. Yokota's recent report and then consider an important difference in Burma. In 1990 elections were held and the nation spoke with a strong voice. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy swept the elections only to find the results brutally rejected by SLORC. We cannot pretend those elections did not occur. We cannot turn our back on the legitimate Government of Burma. We should not trade democracy for dollars in the pockets of a few companies interested in investing in Burma.  Suu Kyi has been absolutely clear. She will welcome foreign investment in her country just as soon as it makes real progress toward democracy.  The United States must take the lead in supporting not only her courage but her objective which is nothing short of Burma's liberty. It is clear U.N. Ambassador Albright understands the importance of our role and the responsibilities of United States leadership in securing democracy for Burma. In responding to the U.N. Rapporteur's report and the subsequent General Assembly resolution she spelled out the alternatives for SLORC: They must--there must be prompt and meaningful progress in political reforms including a transition to an elected Government or Burma will face further international isolation.  Mr. President, I agree with the Ambassador's conclusions. However, it is a position that the administration has expressed for more than a year. My definition of prompt differs from the administration's timetable. SLORC has had ample time and opportunity to demonstrate their intent to in effect return to the barracks and leave the governing of the country to democratically elected civilians. Burma waited for decades to vote for the National League for Democracy. They have waited for the past five years to benefit from the results of that election. Burma has waited for its freedom long enough.  In past statements of Burma I have devoted a good deal of my remarks to why a country so far away should matter to anyone here in the United States. It is not just a matter of upholding the principles of democracy and free markets--principles that define our history and national conscience. But, for many, those are ideals that are difficult to transplant--it is difficult to see why we should apply sanctions to further that cause.  The reason it is in our direct interest to secure democracy in Burma relates to the surge in narcotics trafficking afflicting every community in this Nation. Burma is the source of more than 60 percent of the heroin coming into the United States. As the Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs has testified, until there is a democratically elected government in Rangoon, committed to a similar set of values, we will not see the active cooperation necessary to bring a real halt to this problem. We may see episodic efforts designed--like Suu Kyi's release--to influence our perceptions of SLORC's intentions. But, we will not see a serious effort to eradicate opium production unless we can work with a government dedicated to our common agenda.  The credibility of a counternarcotics program directly relates to the credibility of the government.  Let me conclude by thanking Senators Moynihan, Leahy, and D'Amato for joining me in this legislation. I appreciate my colleague on the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations joining me in this important effort. I understand the Parliamentarian has decided that this will be referred to the Banking Committee, so I am grateful for the cosponsorship of the chairman, Senator D'Amato.  But, I want to take a moment to single out Senator Moynihan and his long standing commitment to Suu Kyi's safe return to public life. When we were members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1992 Senator Moynihan and I worked together to establish conditions which must be met prior to our dispatching a U.S. Ambassador to Burma. Then as now, he has been articulate champion for a noble cause.
