President, my colleagues Senator Boozman and Senator Coons and I are on the floor to speak to an issue relative to Africa. It is my understanding the majority leader is coming to the floor to make a unanimous consent request. With the understanding of my colleagues that we will interrupt our presentation for his request, I think we can proceed, if it meets with the approval of my colleagues. Since I was the last to arrive, I want to defer to Senator Coons and Senator Boozman to start the conversation.
