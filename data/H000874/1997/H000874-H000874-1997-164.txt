Chairman, the gentleman is correct, the amendment is generic in a sense. But because you have really two components, the compliance component and the inspection component, yes, they can take from other parts of their budget.  There are some of us who have read statistics in terms I am sure the gentleman is familiar with where in some cases to get to some businesses in some States, it would take 90 to 100 years to inspect just once with the number of inspectors that you have to get to the requisite number of businesses.  In other words, what I am saying is that currently in inspections now they do not have sufficient resources to do the job that we have mandated by law be done.
