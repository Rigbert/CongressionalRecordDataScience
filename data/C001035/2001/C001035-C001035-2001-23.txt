President, I echo the words of the Senator from Nevada. We have all been impressed with the tremendous grace and strength that our Senate majority leader has shown under unbelievable pressure. Our thoughts are with him and with his staff as they continue to go through this ordeal. He has, indeed, made every Member proud by his actions during this difficult time.                          ____________________
