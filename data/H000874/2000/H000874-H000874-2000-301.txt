I thank my colleague. We are all honored to be his friend. I now want to yield to another extraordinary American. In the context of cochair of the Faith & Politics Institute, an American who comes from an extraordinarily different background from the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), who superficially people would say is much different than the gentleman from Georgia but they look on the outward manifestation of the color of skin which is just a superficial difference because he is, as the gentleman from Georgia referred to him, very much a brother, very much someone whose heart and head tells him that we are all in this together and we need to respect one another and lift one another up. We are all honored to serve with him in the Congress of the United States, my friend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton).
