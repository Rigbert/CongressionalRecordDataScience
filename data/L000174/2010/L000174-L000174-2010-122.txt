President, today, I am pleased to introduce an important bipartisan bill to ensure that the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, remains an effective tool to provide public access to critical information about the stability of our financial markets. My bill would amend the Securities and Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act to eliminate several broad FOIA exemptions for Security and Exchange Commission records that were recently enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. I thank Senators Cornyn, Kaufman and Grassley for cosponsoring this important open government bill.  I am a proud supporter of the historic Wall Street reform bill that has now become law, because this legislation makes significant strides toward enhancing transparency and accountability in our financial system. But, I am concerned that the FOIA exemptions in Section 929I of that bill, which was originally drafted in the House of Representatives and included in the final law, could be interpreted and implemented by the SEC in a way that undermines this very important goal.  The Freedom of Information Act has long been the people's window into their Government, showing where the Government is doing things right, but also where Government can do better. The FOIA has also long recognized the need to balance the Government's legitimate interest in protecting confidential business records, trade secrets and other sensitive information from public disclosure and the public's right to know. To accomplish this, care must always be taken to ensure that exemptions to FOIA's disclosure requirements are narrowly and properly applied.  When Congress enacted these exemptions, we were seeking to ensure that the SEC had access to the information that the Commission needs to carry-out its new enforcement powers and to protect American investors--not shielding information from the public.  I have been troubled by the Commission's attempts in recent weeks to retroactively apply these exemptions to pending FOIA matters. I am also troubled by the sweeping interpretation that the Commission has expressed, to date, that these exemptions would shield all information provided to the Commission in connection with its broad examination and surveillance activities.  This week, I called on the Commission to promptly issue guidelines that interpret the FOIA exemptions in Section 929I in a manner that is both consistent with congressional intent and with the President's January 21, 2009, Executive Memorandum on the Freedom of Information Act. I look forward to the public release of those guidelines. Given the overwhelming public interest in restoring stability and accountability to our financial system, Congress must also take steps to address concerns about the exemptions in Section 929I.  I thank the many open government organizations, including OpenThe Government.org, the Project on Government Oversight, the American Library Association and the Sunlight Foundation for their support of this bill.  I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic issue, nor a Republican issue--it is truly an American value and virtue that we all must uphold. It is in this bipartisan spirit that Senators from both sides of the aisle have joined me in supporting this bill. I look forward to working with them and others in Congress to ensure that the American public has access to important information about the SEC's oversight of our financial markets.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3717       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Senator Christopher Dodd,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban          Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Representative Barney Frank,     Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, Rayburn          House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairmen Dodd and Frank: We, the undersigned      organizations concerned with government accountability and      transparency, are writing to express our concerns about      Section 929I of the recently passed Dodd-Frank Wall Street      Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). If      interpreted broadly, this provision has the potential to      severely hinder the public's ability to access critical      information related to the oversight activities of the      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), thereby undermining      the bill's overarching goals of more transparency and      accountability.       As you know, Section 929I states that the SEC cannot be      compelled to disclose records or other information obtained      from its registered entities--including entities such as      hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds      that will now be regulated by the SEC--if this information is      used for ``surveillance, risk assessments, or other      regulatory and oversight activities'' outlined in the      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act      of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.       SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro wrote to you last week defending      this provision. She argued that registered entities need to      be able to provide the SEC with access to sensitive or      proprietary information ``without concern that the      information will later be made public.'' She further      explained that, prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act,      ``regulated entities not infrequently refused to provide      Commission examiners with sensitive information due to their      fears that it ultimately would be disclosed publicly.'' She      also claimed that investment advisers routinely refuse to      turn over personal trading records of investment management      personnel, ``instead requiring staff to review hard copies of      the records on the adviser's premises,'' which ``materially      impacts the staff's ability to detect insider trading      activity.''       These arguments do not adequately describe the SEC's      existing regulatory authority, and they fail to acknowledge      that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) already provides      sufficient exemptions to protect against the release of      sensitive and proprietary information. Furthermore, the SEC      has a troubling history of being overly aggressive in      withholding records from the public. For these reasons, we      strongly urge you to repeal Section 929I, or to at least      curtail the SEC's broad authority to withhold critical      information from the public.       First, we are not convinced by Chairman Schapiro's claim      that ``existing FOIA exemptions were insufficient to allay      concerns [about public disclosure] due in part to limitations      in FOIA.'' For instance, Exemption 8 protects matters that      are ``contained in or related to examination, operating, or      condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use      of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of      financial institutions.'' Chairman Schapiro argues that this     exemption may not apply to all registrants, but it's worth      noting that the courts have broadly construed the term      ``financial institutions,'' holding that it is not limited to      depository institutions and can also include investment      advisers. In addition, Exemption 4 protects ``trade secrets      and commercial or financial information obtained from a      person [that is] privileged or confidential.'' The Department      of Justice's (DOJ) FOIA guide states that this exemption      ``encourages submitters to voluntarily furnish useful      commercial or financial information to the government and it      correspondingly provides the government with an assurance      that such information will be reliable,'' calling into      question Chairman Schapiro's claim that additional exemptions      are needed in order for the SEC to collect information from      its registered entities.       Second, the SEC's track record with FOIA raises additional      concerns about giving the agency even more authority to      withhold information from the public. Last year, an audit      conducted by the SEC Office of Inspector General (OIG)      uncovered a wide range of problems related to the SEC's FOIA      operations. We were particularly troubled by the OIG's      finding that the SEC Chief FOIA Officer was not operating in      compliance with Executive Order 13392 or the OPEN Government      Act; that few FOIA liaisons have written policies and      procedures for processing FOIA requests, increasing the risk      that the agency is unnecessarily withholding information from      the public; and that there is an insufficient separation      between the initial FOIA determination and the appeal      process.       The OIG concluded that the SEC's FOIA release rate was      ``significantly lower when compared to all other federal      agencies.''       The OIG put forth a number of recommendations for      correcting the glaring deficiencies in the SEC's FOIA      operations, such as ensuring that accurate searches are made      for responsive information, providing guidelines or written      policies for all FOIA-related staff that address the concerns      raised by the OIG, and ensuring that all FOIA-related staff      has access to sufficient legal expertise to process requests      in compliance with FOIA. But according to the OIG's most      recent semiannual report to Congress, the SEC has not      completed final action on any of these recommendations.      Rather than giving the SEC any more leeway to improperly      withhold information from the public, we urge you to hold      Chairman Schapiro accountable for the excessive delays in      implementing the OIG's recommendations.       Third, we notice that Chairman Schapiro is ``asking the      Commission to issue and publish on our website guidance to      our staff that ensures [Section 929I] is used only as it was      intended.'' The solution for addressing the uncertainty      surrounding this provision is not additional guidance. The      solution is clarification in the law that public access is      vital to accountability and that the existing FOIA exemptions      can adequately protect confidential business information      provided by regulated entities.       Fourth, Chairman Schapiro neglected to mention that the SEC      already has the authority to compel registered entities to      provide information and records. Under the Securities      Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC has the authority to subpoena      witnesses and require the production of any records from its      registered entities. If these entities fail to comply, the      SEC has the authority to suspend these entities, impose      significant monetary penalties, and refer cases to DOJ for      possible criminal proceedings. But instead of using these      existing authorities, Chairman Schapiro seems to think that      Congress needs to provide blanket FOIA exemptions in order to      convince the SEC's registered entities to cooperate. We think      such a blanket exemption fosters an environment that defers      to the entities it regulates and is unadvisable.       Finally, it is unclear what Chairman Schapiro's plans are      for implementing other blanket FOIA exemptions in the Dodd-     Frank Act, such as Section 404, which exempts the SEC from      FOIA with respect to any ``report, document, record, or      information'' received from investment advisers to private      funds.       In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the need      for greater transparency in our financial system is all too      apparent. The SEC's ongoing effort to withhold vital records      from the public undermines the spirit of the transparency      reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act, and flies in the face of      President Obama's guidance instructing agencies to adopt a      ``presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their      commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher      in a new era of open Government.''       We call on you to repeal the unnecessary FOIA exemption in      Section 929I, examine the SEC's current record on withholding      information, and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure      that the SEC isn't given any additional authority to keep its      records under a veil of secrecy. We welcome an opportunity to      discuss this issue with you further. To reach our groups, you      or your staff may contact Angela Canterbury at the Project On      Government Oversight.
