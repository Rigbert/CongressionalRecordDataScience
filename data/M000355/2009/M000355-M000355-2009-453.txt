 President, the President has announced today he is directing the members of his Cabinet to cut wasteful Government spending. Obviously, I applaud such an effort, but it is important that we not lose sight of the enormity of our current spending and debt levels, which will only really be addressed through major, bipartisan, politically difficult reforms. The Cabinet has been asked to find $100 million savings in a $4 trillion budget. Any amount of savings, obviously, is welcome, but according to the Congressional Budget Office numbers, that is about the average amount we will spend every single day--that $100 million is about the average amount we will spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package we passed earlier this year.  We need to cut waste, but we will need to do much more to restore fiscal balance. Senators Gregg and Conrad have proposed a plan that would force us to get debt and spending under control. It deserves our serious attention.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
