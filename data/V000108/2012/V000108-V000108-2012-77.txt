 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the gentlewoman's amendment and commend her for crafting it.  As I pointed out in earlier remarks, I do appreciate the chairman's efforts, as well as the members of the subcommittee and full committee, to increase money set aside for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. In fact, the chairman was responsible for adding $17 million above the administration's current request.  However, I do believe that more can be done and that the Sanchez amendment, by adding $16 million to the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, would get us very close to our current year appropriated level.  I believe, as a Nation, our greatest security threat is not a launched attack by another nation-state, but the use of nuclear weapons or materials in an act of terror. And given that particular threat, I do believe every dollar counts and every dollar of these $16 million count. I would ask my colleagues to support the gentlewoman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Loretta Sanchez).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
