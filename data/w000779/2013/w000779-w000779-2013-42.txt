President, we have a minute and a half. I will be very brief. I thank the Senator from Texas for his courtesy.  The bottom line is that the House bill, which the Senator is calling for, does not get the government out of the helium business. That is the single most important distinction. We are reaching out to all those hard-hit middle-class workers in aerospace and tech and a whole host of industries. We are doing it in a way that protects taxpayers. It gets the government out of the helium business.  This legislation passed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee unanimously. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back and the Senate now proceed to vote on the passage of the bill, as amended.
