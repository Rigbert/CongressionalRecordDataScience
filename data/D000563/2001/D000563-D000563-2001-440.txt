President, I understand Senator McConnell's position. Ithas been long debated. I had hoped we would reach agreement that by unanimous consent we could offer an amendment after 11 o'clock because we are still working on some of the technical aspects of this amendment. But if the Senator from Kentucky believes he has to object to that unanimous consent request, then I will offer this amendment at this time. I ask the Senator if that is his position.  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the Senator should offer the amendment because this, at the risk of repeating myself, is the first amendment we dealt with 2 weeks ago, and here we are 1 minute to 11 trying to modify it. My colleague had plenty of time to do that. The Senator can go ahead and do that if he wants.
