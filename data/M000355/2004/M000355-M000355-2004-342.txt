 President, I pay tribute to an outstanding Kentuckian, fellow Louisvillian and friend, Mr. Owsley Brown Frazier. Owsley recently fulfilled one of his life-long dreams by opening a museum to showcase his collection of historic weaponry--the Frazier Historical Arm Museum. I was honored to join him at the grand opening to get a sneak peak at his impressive collection.  The Frazier Historical Arms Museum is more than guns in cases and maps on walls. Inside this $32 million, 100,000-square-foot museum weapons are displayed based on the stories they tell. The museum is home to Teddy Roosevelt's ``Big Stick,'' a rifle owned by George Washington, a bow and arrow used by Geronimo, and General George Armstrong Custer's Colt Navy revolvers. Not only does the museum house Owsley's collection of American artifacts but also holds collections on loan from the British Royal Armories in the Tower of London. These artifacts are combined with guides dressed in period attire, short films, and interactive computer stations. It is definitely a ``must see'' while in Louisville.  Owsley wanted to give back to his hometown and the museum was his gift. The museum is a testament to his work ethic and his values. It reflects his philanthropic nature that he has contributed $500 million to charities during his lifetime, including tens of millions for his biggest passion--education. He has used his own money, but also millions of dollars of contributions from his family's company to preserve historic buildings, build housing for low-income families and of course, support our local colleges and schools.  His friends describe him as a simple man who loves fishing at his Shelby County farm, breakfast at the Waddy Truck Stop, and would rather watch sports on television than attend cocktail parties. Owsley and I also share a special passion: University of Louisville Athletics. In fact, he once even skipped a family member's wedding because the Cardinals had a game that day.  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this incredible man. Owsley has a genuine and sincere love for the city of Louisville, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and most importantly his fellow man. I can only hope he will inspire us all to share that same benevolent passion and commitment in our lives.                          ____________________
