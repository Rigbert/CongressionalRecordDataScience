Chairman, the current welfare system is at odds with the core values Americans share: work, opportunity, family, and responsibility.  Instead of strengthening families and instilling personal responsibility, the system penalizes two-parent families, and lets too many absent parents who owe child support off the hook.  It is long past time to ``end welfare as we know it.'' We need to move beyond political rhetoric, and offer a simple compact that provides people more opportunity in return for more responsibility.  I have a few common-sense criteria which any welfare plan must meet to get my vote.  It must require all able-bodied recipients to work for their benefits.  It must require teenage mothers to live at home or other supervised setting.  It must create a child support enforcement system with teeth so that deadbeat parents support their children.  It must establish a time limit so that welfare benefits are only a temporary means of support.  It must be tough on those who have defrauded the system.  And it must give states maximum flexibility to shape their welfare system to their needs, while upholding the important national objectives I have just listed.  Tuesday, in debate on the House floor, Mr. Castle said the Republican bill is a ``big bang'' approach to changing welfare. He was right--and it's the kids who are getting banged up.  As Governor Mike Lowry of Washington State says regarding the Republican bill, ``I recognize the serious need to reshape and revitalize our public welfare system, but I oppose prescriptive Federal mandates that would harm children.''  I rise today to support the Deal substitute. This is the only bill before this House which meets my criteria. It is the only bill before us which makes fundamental changes to the current system without hurting children.  The Deal substitute reinforces the values which Americans share: Hard work, self discipline and personal responsibility. It is tough on work, fair to kids, holds recipients accountable to the government, and makes both parents responsible for taking care of their children.  The Deal bill is tougher on work than any proposal before the House. As Governor Tom Carper of Delaware wrote, the Republican bill ``will not do what the public is demanding--that is, ensure that welfare recipients work.''  Under the Deal bill, each individual coming onto AFDC will be required to sign a comprehensive individualized responsibility plan. This contract outlines what welfare recipients must do in order to receive Government assistance. The plan requires that each recipient begin to look for a job immediately, and work to gain the tools which will move them from welfare to work. Nobody who refuses to work will get benefits.  In addition, the Deal bill requires States to meet higher participation rates than the Republican bill does. The Republican bill would count any kind of caseload reduction towards States' work participation rates, whether people are working or not. Under the Deal bill, people will be given the opportunity to gain the skills they need to get a job--with time limits that create the right incentives to do so.  The Deal bill is also better than the Republican bill for what it does not do--it does not make children pay for the behavior of their parents. As Governor Benjamin Cayetano of Hawaii says, ``The Republican proposal will bite into the already overburdened safety nets of State and local government and numerous nonprofit organizations. It will bite into the tight budget of families working hard to get off welfare. And, most unfortunately, it will be the children in these families who will suffer the most.''  Unlike the Republican bill, the Deal bill maintains the guarantee that no kid will go to school hungry. The Deal bill budgets enough funding for child care to make sure no kid will be left at home alone when mom and dad go to work. As Governor Dean points out, the Republican bill ``not only appears to reduce child care assistance by roughly 20 percent over 4 years, it would not account for projected increases in child care needs for welfare recipients who are required to work under the bill.'' The Deal bill makes sure welfare recipients can go to work without fearing for their children's safety--a critical element of workable welfare reform.  As Governor Roy Roemer of Colorado points out, ``it is unacceptable to expect a parent to enter employment if it means their children's safety and well-being is jeopardized by lack of child care or medical assistance.'' Governor Gaston Caperton of West Virginia tells us that ``we need to eliminate the disincentives to work running through our welfare system, by providing transitional health and child care benefits.'' Unlike the Republican bill, the Deal bill provides adequate funding for child care, and extends Medicaid eligibility for an additional year to help people move from welfare to work.  The Deal bill also cracks down on deadbeat parents to make sure  they live up to their responsibility to support their kids. It sends a crystal clear message to all Americans: You should not become a parent until you are able to provide and care for your child.  The Deal bill puts the teeth into our child support enforcement system that the Republicans took out of their bill. It includes the provisions Mrs. Kennelly and I fought for in the Rules Committee last week which withholds or suspends the professional and driver's licenses of people who have not made their child support payments.  The Deal bill will send a strong message that parents--even teenagers--must be responsible for their children. Under this bill, teen mothers will be required to live at home and stay in school. We will send the message that we will support children of teenagers only while their parents are preparing to support them independently.  The Deal bill is also better than the Republican bill for what it does not do. The Republican bill wages an attack on the basic food programs that make sure every child in this country has at least one good meal a day. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the Republican bill cuts spending for child nutrition programs almost $7 billion below the funding that would be provided by current law.  Do not just rely on me to tell you. Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont says, the Republican bill ``would decrease funding, repeal nutritional standards and permit States to siphon off school lunch funds to pay for other programs. This is wrong and it should be stopped in its tracks.''  In the Republican bill, funding for the Women, Infants and Children Program is reduced compared to current law--and provisions requiring competitive bidding on baby formula have been removed. That decision alone will take $1 billion of food out of the  [[Page H3691]] mouths of children each year, and put the money in the pockets of big business. This simply defies common sense. No one in America could possibly argue that this is ``reform.''  The Deal bill maintains the current-law competitive requirements in WIC that save money for the taxpayers--and increase the number of women and children we can help in this program.  The Deal bill also maintains current funding levels for foster care. Adoption and foster care services are already overloaded, and are failing our children. At a time when the need for foster care, group homes, and adoption is likely to rise dramatically, the Republican welfare plan would cut Federal support for foster care and adoption by $4 billion over 5 years.  As Governor Lowry says, ``The overall effect of the welfare reform proposal may force more children into foster care; yet the State will have fewer funds to meet this increased need. Moreover, if the funds provided are diverted primarily into foster care, then there will be even less money available for family support and preservation, adoption, finding permanent homes for children, or prevention.''  The Republican bill restricts State flexibility. Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri says that H.R. 1214 ``would undermine the reform that has already begun in States like Missouri'' because it would ``provide (block grants) with very little flexibility. The legislation is full of micromanagement prescriptions. Furthermore, the funding to achieve true reform and provide for recipients in harsh economic periods would be, at best, uncertain.'' Governor Dean says that H.R. 1214 ``is overly prescriptive by telling States how to design their reforms and who they can serve. It fails to meet the commitment of the leadership to grant States the flexibility we view as critical to successful State-based welfare reform.''  As Governor Carnahan says, the Deal bill ``acknowledges what is needed to help people move from welfare to work. This measure would emphasize work requirements, bind recipients to an individual responsibility contract in order to receive benefits, and encourage responsible parenting.''  Both Democrats and Republicans agree the current welfare system needs to be overhauled. The Deal bill is tough on work without being tough on kids. It represents true welfare reform--not the wealth-fare reform the Republicans propose.  The Deal bill is the change we need to end welfare as we know it. I urge your support for this bill.  I would like to submit the text of these letters from Governors across the country for the Record.                                       Office of The Governor,                                   Montpelier, VT, March 22, 1995.     Hon. Richard Gephardt,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Gephardt: As the House of      Representatives debates welfare reform, I wanted to share      with you my concerns about the Republican proposal, H.R.      1214, The Personal Responsibility Act.       Vermont was the first state in the nation to implement a      statewide welfare reform initiative that includes both work      requirements and time limits. Our goals are to strengthen      incentives to work, make dependence on cash assistance      transitional, and promote good parenting and individual      responsibility. Although our reforms took effect in July we      are already seeing encouraging results. In the first six      months of operation, the number of employed parents in our      program increased by 19 percent and their average monthly      earnings grew by 23 percent.       We were hopeful that federal reforms promised by the 104th      Congress would complement and propel Vermont's reform      initiative. However, after closely following the progress of      welfare reform in the House and examining the details of H.R.      1214, I can only conclude that this proposal will deal a      severe blow to our efforts in Vermont by shifting      responsibility and costs to the states.       First, I believe there is a national interest in protecting      children and that a child in Mississippi is no less important      than a child in Minnesota. Any welfare reform should embrace      this national priority and ensure that children are protected      and not penalized for the mistakes of others. The Personal      Responsibility Act fails to meet this minimum test of decency      and represents a declaration of war on America's children.       The failure of the leadership to meet this test is best      illustrated by their proposal to block grant the school lunch      program, a program that works and puts food directly into the      mouths of hungry children. The bill would decrease funding,      repeal national nutrition standards and permit states to      siphon off school lunch funds to pay for other programs. This      is wrong and it should be stopped dead in its tracks.       Second, states have asked for flexibility to tailor welfare      reforms to meet the special circumstances present in every      state. H.R. 1214 is overly prescriptive by telling states how      to design their reforms and who they can serve. It fails to      meet the commitment of the leadership to grant states the      flexibility we view as critical to successful state-based      welfare reform.       Finally, I am convinced, based on our experience in      Vermont, that real welfare reform will not save the states or      the federal government money in the short run. If the      leadership is serious about moving people from welfare to      real and meaningful work, it has missed the mark. Slashing      $69 billion dollars over five years from the very programs      that would help people transition from welfare to work is a      demonstration of the leadership's seriousness of purpose in      welfare reform. Without sufficient federal support for true      welfare reform, H.R. 1214 is simply another unfunded mandate      imposed on the states.       Dick, I stand ready to work with you in any way to improve      this bill and I appreciate your leadership on this critical      issue. Please feel free to call on me if I can be of any      assistance.           Sincerely,                                                 Howard Dean, M.D.     Governor.                                                                    ____                                           Executive Chambers,                                     Honolulu, HI, March 21, 1995.     Hon. Richard Gephardt,     House Democratic Leader, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Gephardt: On behalf of the State of      Hawaii, I want to express my strong support for the efforts      of the House Democrats to craft a bill that would produce      meaningful and effective welfare reform.       The State of Hawaii believes that real welfare reform      invests in people. This means welfare programs that train      people for the kinds of jobs that will allow them to earn a      decent living, to live a life off welfare, to be self      sufficient. Our state Department of Human Services is taking      action to make this kind of program a reality. We have in      place programs which require recipients to work part-time      while receiving job skills training. This type of program      empowers the recipients by providing them with meaningful      work experience concurrent to learning more effective job      skills. It also will save the state millions of dollars.       Under the House Republican bill, welfare stands a good      change of becoming well-unfair. Unfair to welfare recipients      who will see basic benefits cut and eligibility standards      devised which do not work in the real world. And, unfair to      the states who will find themselves paying out of their own      pocket for programs mandated, but not funded, by Congress.       On the surface, the House Republican bill's goals of      turning 336 welfare programs into 8 block grants sounds      appealing. It sounds like common sense. It sounds like      government being wise. In reality, the sound bites of the      House Republicans are just that--sound bites. The Republican      proposal will bite into the already overburdened safety nets      of state and local government and numerous non-profit      organizations. It will bite into the tight budget of families      working hard to get off welfare. And, most unfortunately, it      will be the children in these families who will suffer most.       We in Hawaii cannot let this happen. Our community will not      stand idly by while others attempt to hobble our ability to      care for our vulnerable populations.       I and other Democratic Governors believe that the health      and safety of children should be protected. That means      welfare reform with compassion. The House Republicans      proposal overlooks this key guiding principle of welfare.       This proposal also restricts a state's ability to gain      meaningful welfare reform tailored to the specific needs of      an individual state. I stand with my fellow Democratic      Governors in asking for significant state flexibility which      is free of the bureaucratic prescriptive language and hazy      funding mechanisms.       Congressman Gephardt, your leadership in crafting a reality      based welfare reform bill is heartily appreciated in the      Aloha State. The Democratic Governors have been national      leaders in the welfare reform movement, and we stand ready to      help you in any way possible to fashion a welfare bill that      will emphasize personal responsibility, promote self-     sufficiency, provide economic opportunity and encourage      families to stay together.       With warmest personal regards.           Very truly yours,                                             Benjamin J. Cayetano,     Governor.                                                                    ____                                       Office of the Governor,                               Jefferson City, MO, March 22, 1995.     Hon. Richard Gephardt,     House Democratic Leader, Washington, DC.       Dear Dick: I am writing to express my concerns about the      welfare reform proposal, H.R. 1214, scheduled this week for      debate on the House floor. Unfortunately, this legislation is      not a serious attempt to reform welfare. If passed, it would      cause more damage than good to Missourians who are trying to      improve their lives.       Democratic governors want to accomplish real welfare reform      and understand how to achieve it. It has been Democratic      governors who have instituted statewide programs to help      recipients break the cycle of dependency and go to work.      Democratic governors know that to achieve true change, people      must become self-sufficient, find and maintain a job, and be      responsible for their families.       The welfare reform legislation that was passed in Missouri      last year accomplishes all of these goals and more.      Missouri's program emphasizes jobs and self-sufficiency. AFDC      recipients, for example must enroll in self-       [[Page H3692]] sufficiency pacts that are time-limit      contracts with a 24-month time limit and possible 24-month      extension. Minor parents must live in their parent's home to      receive AFDC.       Missouri's reform does not stop there. Work is rewarded by      allowing families to keep a greater share of the money they      earn without experiencing a sudden loss of resources. Wage      supplements go to employers who create jobs in low-income      neighborhoods. Child care is made accessible for those who go      to work. Paternity acknowledgment at birth is increased.      Perhaps most importantly, Missouri does not tear away the      ``safety net'' for children. These are the responsible ways      to help people to help themselves.       Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for H.R. 1214. Self-     sufficiency and work are not emphasized. Support for children      is not ensured. In fact, this legislation would undermine the      reform that has already begun in states like Missouri. For      example:       Block grants (which are by their nature intended to provide      flexibility to states) would be provided along with very      little flexibility. The legislation is full of micro-     management prescriptions that are required of States.      Furthermore, the funding to achieve true reform and provide      for recipients in harsh economic periods would be, at best,      uncertain.       Welfare recipients are denied the training, child care, and      health care that are needed to help recipients to qualify      for, obtain, and keep jobs. In fact, child care assistance      would be reduced approximately 20% over the next five years.       Innocent children would be punished because federal funds      could not be used to support children born to a young mother,      born to current AFDC recipients, or born into a family that      has received AFDC for more than five years. Foster care      protections currently in place would be eliminated by this      bill and the guarantee of child nutrition programs for low-     income children would be eliminated.       These are only a few examples of the problems that are      evident with the Republican approach to welfare reform. As      for alternative approaches, the proposal put forth by      Congressman Nathan Deal (the Individual Responsibility Act of      1995) seems to be a much more legitimate approach to      improving the current welfare system. This measure      acknowledges what is needed to help people move from welfare      to work. This measure would emphasize work requirements, bind      recipients to an individual responsibility contract in order      to receive benefits, and encourage responsible parenting.       Dick, I appreciate your leadership in trying to achieve      true welfare reform. There are ways to reform welfare without      punishing those who are less fortunate. I am proud of what we      are doing in Missouri and pleased to see many other      Democratic governors striving to better serve the people of      their states.       Please let me know if there are more ways we can work      together with Congress to reward self-sufficieny, hard work,      and personal responsibility.           Very truly yours,                                                     Mel Carnahan,     Governor.                                                                    ____                                                State of Delaware,                                       Office of the Governor,                                                   March 21, 1995.     Hon. Richard Gephardt,     Washington, DC.       Dear Dick: As one of the NGA's two lead governors on      welfare reform, let me take this opportunity to bring to your      attention my serious concerns about the House Republican      welfare plan, H.R. 1214, which I understand will be      considered by the House this week.       You may be aware that earlier this year, I announced my      statewide welfare reform initiative, ``A Better Chance.'' My      plan seeks to ensure that 1) work pays more than welfare; 2)      welfare recipients exercise personal responsibility; 3)      welfare is transitional; 4) both parents help support a      child; and, 5) two-parent families are encouraged, and      teenage pregnancy is discouraged.       Under this plan, welfare recipients who go to work will      receive an additional year of child care assistance and      Medicaid, as well as part of their welfare grants for their      families and an individual development account for continuing      education, job training, and economic stability. Welfare      recipients will be required to sign contracts of mutual      responsibility, and a two-year time limit on cash assistance      for recipients over 19 will be imposed, after which      recipients will be required to work for their AFDC checks.      Teenagers will be required to stay in school, immunize their      children and participate in parenting education. To      discourage teenage pregnancy, I've begun a grassroots and      media outreach campaign to convince teens to postpone sexual      activity or avoid becoming or making someone else pregnant.       In essence, Delaware's plan contains strong work      requirements, addresses the critical need for child care and      health care for poor working families, helps recipients find      private-sector jobs, outlines a contract of mutual      responsibility between welfare recipients and the state,      imposes real time limits on benefits, and lifts barriers to      the creation of two-parent families.       As I've reviewed the House Republican plan, H.R. 1214, I      believe that it will undercut our efforts in Delaware to      enact real welfare reform. As written, H.R. 1214 will not      ensure that welfare recipients make the transition to work,      will not give states the flexibility needed to enact real      welfare reform, and will not assure adequate protection for      children.                                  work       The House Republican plan, H.R. 1214, will not ensure that      welfare recipients make the transition to work. The litmus      test for any real welfare reform is whether or not it      adequately answers the following three questions 1) Does it      prepare welfare recipients for work? 2) Does it help welfare      recipients find a job? 3) Does it enable welfare recipients      to maintain a job? The Republican proposal, H.R. 1214, fails      to meet this litmus test. This proposal will not do what the      public is demanding, that is, ensure that welfare recipients      work.       Real, meaningful welfare reform requires recipients to work      and my welfare reform plan for Delaware contains stiff work      requirements. However, this proposal not only does not      include any resources for the creation of private sector      jobs, but it would repeal the JOBS program, a program focused      on assisting welfare recipients in preparing for and      obtaining private sector jobs, and reduce funding for      combined AFDC and work requirements. The JOBS program, a      central component of the 1988 Family Support Act, received      strong bipartisan support from Members of Congress, the      Reagan Administration, and the National Governors'      Association. The JOBS program in Delaware, ``First Step'',      has been nationally recognized for its success in training      and placing thousands of welfare recipients in jobs. While I      certainly support greater state flexibility in the use of      JOBS funding, I am concerned that the elimination of this      program without replacing it with a means for ensuring the      transition from welfare to work would reduce the focus of      welfare reform on work. I believe that additional resources,      not less, should be targeted to ensuring that welfare      recipients can successfully make the transition to work.       The Republican proposal, H.R. 1214, will not assure that      families who work will be better off than those who don't      because it would deny welfare recipients who go to work the      child care, health care, and nutrition assistance they need      to improve their lives and to keep their children healthy and      safe. That is simply impractical and wrong.       For example, H.R. 1214 will not assure child care      assistance to welfare recipients who go to work, or      participate in job training or job search activities. In my      state, I will be requiring welfare recipients to go to work,      and to ensure that they can prepare for, find and maintain a      job, I will be providing significant new state dollars for      child care assistance. However, this legislation not only      appears to reduce the child care assistance by roughly 20      percent over five years, but it would not account for      projected increases in child care needs for welfare      recipients who are required to work under the bill. I believe      that it is unrealistic to expect many welfare recipients to      keep      working or participate in job training if they are not      provided some assistance with child care.       Additionally, H.R. 1214 allows the one-year extension of      Medicaid benefits for welfare recipients who go to work to      expire at the end of fiscal year 1998. The expiration of this      provision will remove both the work incentive that this      provision provides, as well as the assurance that welfare      recipients who go to work and their children can continue to      receive health care coverage. I authored the one-year      extension of Medicaid benefits which was adopted by the House      in the 1988 Family Support Act, and I am disappointed that      this legislation would not extend such a work incentive. I      would urge consideration of an additional year extension of      Medicaid for welfare recipients who go to work, as I am      seeking in my federal waiver application.                           state flexibility       The House Republican plan, H.R. 1214, will not give states      the flexibility needed to enact real welfare reform. In      addition to the roughly $69 billion projected loss in funding      for these programs, H.R. 1214 significantly alters the      federal-state partnership which has assured both federal and      state support for children and families in need. Under H.R.      1214, states would not be able to count on increased federal      support during times of recession, to help the thousands,      perhaps millions of children and families who will need      government assistance.       When I came to the Congress in 1982, I recall the state of      our nation's economy. Working families who never thought      they'd need the government's support, applied for government      assistance. Both the federal and state governments reached      out to these families and their children by providing      critical support through this difficult time. I am deeply      concerned about the next recession, or the next disaster, or      the next unforeseen circumstance that will occur in my state,      in any of our states or in our country, in which the people      in our states will call for our assistance. This proposal      makes no attempt to address these unforeseen calamities--it      does not include adequate adjustments for recessions,      population growth, disasters, and other events that could      result in an increased need for services. As you may recall,      the welfare reform resolution which was unanimously approved      by the governors at the National Governors Association      meeting in January called for any block grant proposal to      address such factors. I've attached a February 23 letter to      Chairman Archer, signed by Governors Thompson, Engler,       [[Page H3693]] Carlson, Dean, Camahan, and me, outlining      these and other concerns.       While I recognize that the bill includes a Rainy Day Fund,      the meager size of the fund and the fact that it is a loan      fund which states are required to repay within three years,      rather than a grant to states, makes it a wholly inadequate      anti-recessionary tool.       In addition, H.R. 1214 expressly prohibits states from      using the funding under the cash assistance block grant to      serve children born to unmarried mothers under 18, additional      children born to mothers who currently receive AFDC, and      children and families who have received AFDC for five years      or more. Decisions on which populations to serve should be      determined at the state level, not mandated by Congress.      These provisions should be modified as state options.       Furthermore, states are required, under H.R. 1214, to      reduce AFDC benefits for children for whom paternity is not      yet established. I favor requiring full cooperation in      paternity establishment as a condition of AFDC receipt, but I      believe that this particular provision in H.R. 1214      discriminates against women who have fully cooperated.       I believe that this proposal's significant reduction in      funding, lack of a safety net and recessionary tools, as well      as its numerous prescriptive mandates, threatens to limit the      very flexibility I am seeking to ensure successful reform of      the welfare system in my own state, and very likely in other      states.                                children       The House Republican proposal, H.R. 1214, will not assure      adequate protection for children because it reduces the      federal commitment to some of the country's most vulnerable      children in a number of significant ways.       For example, H.R. 1214 eliminates the safety net for      children by removing the entitlement status of AFDC. Under      H.R. 1214, states are expressly prohibited from using these      federal funds to serve millions of children, and the bill      does not assure children, whose parents go to work, child      care, adequate nutritional assistance, or health care      coverage. By requiring states to reduce benefits to children      for whom paternity has not yet been established, H.R. 1214      will negatively impact millions of children. The most      egregious examples are the bill's dramatically reduced      federal commitment to assist disabled children, children in      foster care and adoptive placements, and children who are      abused and neglected. Historically, Congress determined a      federal responsibility to support children placed in foster      care who came from AFDC-related households in the same way      parents continue to pay child support while their children      are in foster care. To end this relationship is a fundamental      change in the federal government's national commitment to      children.       In addition, H.R. 1214 reduces the federal commitment to a      number of crucial child nutrition programs, namely school      lunch and school breakfast, as well as WIC. During my tenure      in Congress, I, along with most of my colleagues in the      House, strongly supported the school lunch and breakfast      programs because these programs have been critical in      ensuring childrens' health and nutrition, and also strongly      supported fully funding the WIC program. Over the past      twenty years, WIC has been a critical program in      dramatically improving the nutritional status of mothers      and their infants. Proper nutrition during pregnancy and      in the early years of life is the most critical element in      the development of a child. WIC is cost-effective, as a      noted Harvard study demonstrated--every dollar invested in      WIC saves three Medicaid dollars. I am disappointed that      this legislation reduces WIC funding, and eliminates      federal cost containment requirements to competitively bid      formula rebate contracts, a provision which reduced WIC      costs by a billion dollars in FY94.       I am concerned about the serious negative impact of all of      the above provisions on children. None of these provisions      are essential to transforming the welfare system and in some      instances, e.g. child care reductions and removal of a      federal guarantee of child care for welfare recipients who go      to work, they will have the direct opposite effect on reform      efforts.       It is disturbing to me that children who are most at risk      are targeted under this bill--this will only serve to put      more children at risk and further exacerbate an already      overburdened child welfare system. Early proposals in the      Contract with America, spoke to the potential increased need      for a safety net of foster care when hard time limits for      welfare reform are put in place. To reduce funding for foster      care while acknowledging increased demand from the very      population federal foster care was designed to protect is      illogical at best. Essentially, these provisions are outright      discriminatory and unconscionable, and should either be      modified or entirely removed from the bill.       In sum, this legislation will not transform the welfare      system. Rather, it would severely undercut our efforts to      reform the welfare system in my state. As I am seeking to      ensure that welfare recipients prepare for, find, and      maintain jobs, I am deeply troubled by this legislation's      negative effect on reforming the welfare system here and      elsewhere.       I am strongly opposed to H.R. 1214 and I would urge Members      of Congress to vote against this legislation, and instead,      support the Deal substitute, which in my view, represents      real welfare reform. Representative Deal's legislation      focuses on providing assistance to prepare welfare recipients      for work, and to help welfare recipients find and maintain      jobs, as well as ensure that work pays more than welfare,      which H.R. 1214 fails to do.       Representative Deal's legislation, in contrast to H.R.      1214, appropriately establishes the framework of a federal-     state partnership to transform the welfare system by giving      the states the flexibility to pursue innovative approaches      and the resources to successfully implement work-focused      welfare reform.       I appreciate the opportunity to share my concerns with you,      and I look forward to continuing to work with you in the      effort to transform our nation's welfare system.           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Carper,                                                         Governor.                                              State of Washington,                                       Office of the Governor,                              Olympia, Washington, March 22, 1995.     The Hon. Richard Gephardt,     House Democratic Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Gephardt: I am writing to express my      concerns about the proposed Personal Responsibility Act      (PRA). I believe this bill, which would essentially dismantle      this country's social safety net and replace it with a series      of block grants, will be detrimental to Washington State and      the nation as a whole. This bill contains a number of      provisions that will harm children and likely result in      higher, hidden costs to states and local governments.       The welfare reform provisions of this bill would disallow      cash assistance to both mother and child when a mother under      age 18 bears a child out of wedlock. The bill will also deny      additional cash assistance for a child born while a parent is      on welfare, bar most legal immigrants from receiving public      assistance, and stop aid to families with an adult not      cooperating with the child support enforcement system.       While I support the broad program goals of the PRA and      recognize the serious need to reshape and revitalize our      public welfare system, I oppose prescriptive federal mandates      that would harm vulnerable children. I would like to see      specific policies in place that protect the well-being and      safety of children. This is not a state-by-state interest,      but a national one. I favor retaining Aid to Families with      Dependent Children (AFDC) as an entitlement program open to      any needy family and child who qualifies for benefits.       I am also concerned that block granting will not provide      our state with the funding needed to make the radical changes      to our welfare system mandated by this legislation. Block      granting cash welfare as proposed represents the worst of      both worlds--not only reduced funding, but also higher      program costs for states to meet expensive conditions and      restrictions. If block grants are going to be created then      the entitlement nature of the programs must be retained and      the prescriptive mandates eliminated. Each state should have      the flexibility to determine what reform will work best in      that state.       Further, the PRA food and nutrition proposals will be      determined to the children of Washington State. Due to      effective targeting and outreach, there has been a 43 percent      increase in the number of children receiving low and no cost      school lunches in Washington State over the past four years.      We have enjoyed a 23 percent increase in the number of      children eating school breakfasts. The need for these      programs by the children of our state is growing at a rate      much faster than the graduated increases allowed in the      proposed federal legislation. The dollars invested in the      entire continuum of food programs, beginning with WIC and      continuing through the Child and Adult Care Food, school      lunches, breakfasts and summer meals are wisely invested in      our children. The quantity and quality of these meals must be      protected.       The proposed changes to the child welfare programs will      eliminate the entitlement to foster care and adoption      support. Again, the block grant funding would be capped by a      formula that is calculated to be particularly harmful to      Washington State. Under my administration, we have moved      dramatically toward local control of many prevention and      early intervention programs to address the problems faced by      our communities and our youth. The overall effect of the      welfare reform proposal may force more children into foster      care; yet the state will have fewer funds to meet this      increased need. Moreover, if the funds provided are diverted      primarily into foster care then there will be even less money      available for family support and preservation, adoption,      finding permanent homes for children or prevention.       The PRA also proposes denying Supplemental Security Income      (SSI) for drug addicts and alcoholics. We believe that any      progress states have made in helping and treating this      population will unravel with this change. There is a clear      need to provide these individuals--many of whom have serious      medical problems and who are marginally attached to the      workforce--with a basic safety net. Because that need will      not disappear, state, city and county resources will be      taxed. To support this provision, state and local governments      need assurance there will be federal funding available to      enhance their capacity to provide these individuals with      support services and treatment they need for rehabilitation.        [[Page H3694]] In shaping national policies, flexibility      in the design and implementation of reform programs is      critical if states are to make optimum use of agency      resources and develop strategies and approaches that can      achieve maximum results. As Congress considers these issues,      I urge you to consider the likely outcomes of these reform      measures and to give states the latitude to vary from the      current proposal in areas we feel will work for us.       I believe there are several key elements that warrant      special attention by decision makers. First, these measures      would have a devastating effect on the safety net now in      place for many low-income families and children. Because the      needs of these individuals will continue and likely grow, it      could result in more poverty and more spending by states and      local      communities when we desperately need less. Passage of the      bill could well increase the number of children in foster      care and other expensive alternative living situations. I      understand the need to challenge parents to take      responsibility for their own lives and for the children      they bring into this world, but I disagree with the      approach taken in the PRA, which would punish children for      the shortcomings of their parents.       Second, I welcome the opportunity to tailor programs and      services in ways that meet the unique needs of our individual      states, but the current proposal to cap block grant funding      does not take into account uncertain variables like      recessions, higher unemployment and other changes that result      in higher costs to states. I would like to see fiscal      protections in place beyond the ``rainy day'' fund to ensure      states have adequate resources to meet the needs of low-     income families and children.       Third, information technology is fundamental for states to      effectively deliver services to clients and meet federal      reporting requirements. Federal resources must be brought to      bear so that states can make necessary changes to their      current information systems as well as keep up with advances      in management information technology.       Finally, as Governor of a state with a large, growing and      vibrant immigrant population, I am concerned that we not tip      the balance against these families. While the intent of the      legislation is not cost-shifting to states, that would be its      effect. In addition, the well-being of many immigrant      families and children could be jeopardized.       I urge you to consider amendments which would protect      children and give states the funding and support needed to      turn the corner on poverty and dependency. Effective welfare      reform must include a license suspension program for child      support enforcement, continuation of the child care      guarantee, and safety net provisions to protect children if      jobs are not available to their parents.       I appreciate this opportunity to raise these concerns on      the proposed legislation. I want to work with you to create      and shape a public welfare system that can make a positive      difference in the lives of those in need.           Sincerely,                                                       Mike Lowry,                                                         Governor.                                            State of Colorado,                                 Denver, Colorado, March 22, 1995.     Hon. Richard Gephardt,     House Democratic Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Gephardt: As the House of Representatives      initiates its floor debate on welfare reform, I am writing to      express my encouragement for the development of a bill that      will respond to the needs of the nation's children and at the      same time effectively reform the welfare system. The current      Republican proposal falls short of these goals in my opinion.       I believe true welfare reform should be based on the      following principles:       1 States need maximum flexibility in managing the programs      to address their unique circumstances and needs.       2. Moving welfare recipients into employment and keeping      them there ought to be the primary goal of any legislation.      However, in order to accomplish this goal, there must be      upfront investments in education, skill development, and job      training.       3. Support services such as child care, medical care,      transportation and housing are also critical to successful      welfare reform. It is unacceptable to expect a parent to      enter employment if it means their children's safety and well      being is jeopardized by a lack of child care or medical      assistance. These services are costly. For example, in      Colorado, a parent with two children, making around $9.50/     hour would spend from 25 to 40 percent of their income to      purchase child care alone. Even though costly, these services      are necessary for parents to obtain and maintain a job.       4. Any legislation must establish a requirement for state      fiscal participation in its welfare reform effort. Without      this commitment, there will be a tendency for programs to be      reduced to the level of available federal funding which will      be inadequate. Those states choosing to spend state funds to      augment their programs may become magnet states for the      population seeking employment opportunities. This ``race to      the bottom'' is a short-sighted approach to public policy.       5. Funding must be adequate to support the total cost of      work initiatives and support services cited above. Efforts to      balance the budget by reducing the federal participation for      these programs either shifts costs to the states or results      in inadequate work programs to meet the objective of welfare      reform. For example, under the current proposal, Colorado      would have to increase state spending by over $200 million      over the next five years to maintain its existing programs.      Increasing participation in employment programs as required      in proposed legislation will expand this cost beyond the      savings generated by increased flexibility.       Thank you Congressman Gephardt, for your leadership in      trying to craft a bill that will lead to real welfare reform.           Sincerely,                                                        Roy Romer,                                                         Governor.                                           State of West Virginia,                                       Office of the Governor,                                   Charleston, WV, March 21, 1995.     Hon. Richard Gephardt,     House of Representatives,     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Gephardt: I am writing in support of your      efforts to craft a sensible welfare reform strategy that      encourages and supports personal initiative of people      involved in our welfare system.       West Virginia has made great strides in recent years      bringing its economy back from an enduring recession in the      1980s. We are adding jobs, our population is up and our      unemployment is the lowest in 15 years.       Yet, even in the best of times there are hard-working,      honorable West Virginians that are unable to find work.      Contrary to most stereotypes, in West Virginia the majority      of people on welfare live in families headed by two parents.      In spite of a lifetime of various manual jobs, these parents      may now lack the skills to work in our changing economy. Or      they may be unable to afford the child care or health care      insurance needed for their children while working a minimum      wage job.       We have both a moral and an economic obligation to help      these families help themselves. Arbitrary ``cut-off'      deadlines will not return these people to work nearly as      effectively as creating meaningful economic opportunities for      them through education and real work experience. Rather, we      need to eliminate the disincentives to work running through      our welfare system, such as providing transitional health and      child care benefits.       Our state's economy used to rely on natural resources      extraction. As in other states, jobs in these sectors are      declining while technical and service jobs are increasing.      This trend has caused and will continue to cause significant      disruption and dislocation to families in our state. As      public officials, we need to support, not punish, these      families in this increasingly complex and competitive world      by creating opportunities and expectations to return to the      world of work. I am concerned that current proposals under      discussions are long on expectations, but short on      opportunity. They must go together.       I look forward to working with you and the members of      Congress as you address meaningful and effective welfare      reform.           Sincerely,                                                  Gaston Caperton,                                                         Governor.
