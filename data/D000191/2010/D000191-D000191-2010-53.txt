We operate in 27 States after all, and you are part of our system.  So if you like the status quo, if you like the double-digit rate increases, if you like the limits on market competition, if you like the concentration that has been going on in the industry, then you would support the status quo, which is essentially what Mr. Lungren has offered. And I don't. And I don't think the American people do either. I think we have tremendous consensus around the country that it is time for this abusive industry to play by the same rules as every other. And the small companies will still be able to obtain the data as long as they don't use it in a collusive manner. But it is always just about the small companies, except that the exceptions they want to provide are for the big companies also.  We have expert testimony from the director of the Center for Health Law Studies, St. Louis University, saying that is not the case, it will not disadvantage small companies. We have Mr. David Balto, an antitrust expert, saying it will not disadvantage the small companies. But the Republicans are purporting that it would.  Finally, on the CBO report that it won't lower premiums, that was based on the Lungren language. Without the Lungren language, it will save money, $10 billion for consumers.
