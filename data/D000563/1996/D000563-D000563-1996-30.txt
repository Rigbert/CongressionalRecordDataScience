Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to say to my friend from California, I did not suggest that your record on the environment is at issue here. I do suggest that this provision of the bill of which you are the chairman is at issue here, and I think it is a very important one. And though the gentleman may have an exemplary record, I do not question that you do, I do believe that this amendment is shortsighted, and I believe what it attempts to do really is not in the best interests of protecting our environment.  I hope the gentleman does not take that personally. It is a political difference between us, and the gentleman from California suggested at the outset that he may support my amendment, and I thank him for that. I welcome him aboard.
