Mr. Speaker, today I am re-introducing the Long-Term Care Advancement Act to provide real assistance to families and jump-start debate over how to best prepare Americans for their long-term care needs.  Although the worsening long-term care situation in this country does not get a lot of media attention, it is very real and millions of families will find themselves under tremendous emotional and financial pressures unless measures are adopted now to address it. The rapid expansion of the group of Americans defined by the Bureau of the Census as ``the oldest old''--those senior citizens aged 85 and above--is slated to double by the year 2030. In fact, the fastest growing demographic age group in the United States are the ``oldest old,'' and about half of such individuals will eventually require assistance with various activities of daily living (ADLs).  The Long-Term Care Advancement Act of 1999 will assist Americans as they prepare for their future long-term care needs. To help families keep more of what they have earned over the years, my bill allows penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs and 401(k) plans when the funds are used to pay for `qualified' long-term care (LTC) insurance premiums (as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996).  In addition, my legislation will enable a family to make an IRA/401(k) withdrawal to pay for an LTC insurance policy premium and a portion of the withdrawal will be excluded from their taxable income. Depending on one's tax bracket, age, and type of policy purchased, the savings on an LTC insurance policy under my bill are considerable.  Lastly, the Long-Term Care Advancement Act will provide a refundable $500 tax credit for families caring for a dependent elderly spouse or parent in the home. This tax credit is important because most of the long-term care provided in America is provided by families in the home, and these families desperately need and deserve tax relief. In my view, families trying to take care of their loved ones should be rewarded by the tax code, not punished as they are now.  The tax breaks contained in this legislation will help families provide the peace and security they want and need against the massive costs of professionally provided long-term care, including nursing home care, home health care, respite care, and adult day care services.  Last year, this legislation secured the support of the 60 Plus Association, the American Health Care Association, and the Home Health Assembly of New Jersey. The Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) has also supported the concept behind the bill.  This year, I was very pleased to see the President Clinton has decided to join my colleagues and I in the long-term care debate by proposing a tax credit for elderly disabled persons as part of his fiscal year 2000 budget. Many will recall that the Republican ``Contract with America'' called for providing ``tax incentives for private long-term care insurance to let older Americans keep more of what they have earned over the years.'' They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so Republicans should be flattered that Mr. Clinton has decided to make a plank in of the ``Contract with America'' the centerpiece of his new domestic initiatives contained in his budget.  However, in addition to providing a tax credit, I believe a vital part of any comprehensive proposal on long-term care must also be the promotion of private long-term care insurance. Although the number of persons insured under LTC policies has nearly doubled between 1992 and 1996, this growth is from a very low base. The fact of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of Americans still do not have any private LTC insurance coverage at all. This needs to change, and soon.  Unless it does, changing demographics will put an enormous strain on our nation's fragmented system of long-term care. Already, our Medicare and Medicaid programs have demonstrated their financial shortcomings when providing long-term care services to increasing numbers of the frail elderly. The Medicaid program already spends over $41 billion on nursing home care services for senior citizens. Medicaid expenditures are projected to double over the next 10 years, with nursing home care driving much of the growth.  By encouraging more Americans to plan for their future care needs, I believe we can improve the medical, social, and financial well being of families, as well as provide substantial future savings to the Medicaid and Medicare programs. According to the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, there is a 48% chance of any given individual needing long term care in one's lifetime. And the costs of nursing home care for one year is approximately $40,000. If we can successfully encourage families to purchase LTC insurance, the potential for savings to American families, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, is simply enormous.  I look forward to working on and discussing long-term care issues with my colleagues throughout the 106th Congress, and urge all of my colleagues to support this important initiative. Section by Section Analysis of the Long-Term Care Advancement Act of                                   1999                         Section 1: Short Title Section 2: Exclusion from income for retirement plan withdrawals used                   to purchase long-term care insurance       Penalty taxes are waived on IRA/retirement plan withdrawals      used to pay for LTC insurance policy premiums.       IRA/retirement plan withdrawals will not be included as      taxable income if the withdrawal is used to pay for      ``qualified'' LTC insurance policy premiums. The amounts      excludable from taxation are as follows (the amounts are      identical to the LTC tax breaks contained in P.L. 104-193):------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  Exclusion from income                                                  allowed on IRA/401(k)            Age of LTC policyholder                  withdrawals for                                                  ``qualified'' policies                                                        under HR--------------------------------------------------------------------------40 or less.....................................                  $200.0041 to 50.......................................                   375.0051 to 60.......................................                   750.0061 to 70.......................................                 2,000.0071 and up......................................                 2,500.00------------------------------------------------------------------------       ``Qualified'' LTC plans eligible for the incentives      contained in this bill are defined by the Health Insurance      Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, or P.L.      104-193).       Double tax benefits are prohibited. For example, a taxpayer      otherwise eligible to take a deduction for LTC premiums could      either take the tax deduction allowed by P.L. 104-193, or      make a tax-excludable withdrawal from their IRA or other      retirement plan. They cannot do both.       Only the amounts withdrawn to pay for actual LTC premiums      are eligible to receive tax benefits under LTCAA. Amounts      withdrawn in excess of those needed to pay LTC premiums would      be subject to normal tax rules (including applicable      penalties, if any).       Provisions effective for taxable years beginning after      December 31, 1998. Section 3: Tax Credit for taxpayers caring for a dependent parent or                            spouse in the home       A $500 tax credit (refundable) can be claimed for each      chronically ill spouse/parent who cannot perform two or more      activities of daily living (ADLs) due to a physical or mental      impairment.       Dependent spouse/parent must reside in the taxpayer's      principal place of residence for more than half of the      taxable year.       `Elder-care' tax credit phased in over the next five years      as follows:------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Applicable `elder-care'                 Calendar year                      tax credit amount------------------------------------------------------------------------1999...........................................                     $2502000...........................................                      3502001...........................................                      4002002...........................................                      4502003...........................................                      500------------------------------------------------------------------------       The tax credit is indexed for inflation after 2003. It will      be indexed to the medical cost component of the Consumer      Price Index (CPI).       Income limits for `elder care' credit are identical to      $500-per-child tax credit included in Taxpayer Relief Act of      1997 (P.L. 104-34).       Provisions effective for taxable years beginning after      December 31, 1998.                               ____________________
