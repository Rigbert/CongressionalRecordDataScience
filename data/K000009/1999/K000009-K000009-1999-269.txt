Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work and achievements of a shepherd to our entire community, Reverend Dr. H.M. Crenshaw, a spiritual leader of enormous dimension. Reverend Crenshaw's 30 years of personal ministry to the Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church congregation is to be recognized in a special celebration in Toledo, OH on March 13, 1999.  After his ordination as a minister in 1952, Reverend Crenshaw pastored in the First Baptist Church of Rossford, Ohio from 1953 until 1958. He then went on to First Baptist Church in Fostoria, OH, and during his decade-long tenure there he led the congregation in the building of a new church as well as the purchase of additional land. In December of 1968, Reverend Crenshaw was called to minister to the congregation of Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church, where he remains today.  A true community leader, Reverend Crenshaw has guided his congregation through growth, property acquisition, and building expansion and enhancement. Through it all, he has been a revitalizing force both in the community and the church. Recognizing the deeper needs of the youth in the church's neighborhood, Reverend Crenshaw founded the Jerusalem Outreach Center in 1982. With a goal to motivate and direct young people not targeted by other programs to fully realize their greatest potential, Reverend Crenshaw and the Jerusalem Outreach Center staff have helped over 1,675 at-risk youth and their families. Working through referrals from the juvenile court and juvenile justice systems, the local school system and an area mentoring program, the Jerusalem Outreach Center has redirected the path for these young people and their families. Further, the center serves as a beacon in the neighborhood: a welcoming place for the youth.  Ever mindful of the need to provide stewardship to promising young people, Reverend and Mrs. Crenshaw established the Crenshaw Scholarship Fund in memory of their deceased daughter Marilyn. This fund has contributed over $12,500.00 toward the college education of students in the church.  The holder of a Bachelor of Theology from the International Bible Institute and Seminary,a Master of Arts in Psychology and Counseling from Ashland Theological Seminary, a Doctorate of Divinity from Calvary Bible College, and an Honorary Doctorate from Selma University, Reverend Crenshaw is the author of a book, ``A Reality Roadmap for Delinquent Youth'' and a teaching video, ``The Reality of Therapeutic Techniques in Working with Delinquent Youth.''  In addition to pastoring to his congregation, engaging in outreach to troubled youth, and raising a family, Reverend Crenshaw has also found time to serve on several key area boards including the Lucas County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, Lucas County Mental Health Advisory Council, Baptist Pastors' Conference, Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, Interracial Religious Coalition, Board of Community Relations, the Board of Education's Alternative School Programming Committee, Baptist Ministers Conference, and Chairman of the Advisory Board of the American Baptist Theological Seminary Extension of Toledo.  His unwavering commitment to the causes of social justice, his dedication to God and living His Word, and his deep involvement in the fabric of our community have earned Reverend Crenshaw the admiration of many in our area who hold him in high esteem. He has been showered with honors too numerous to mention, has received commendations from federal, state, and city officials, and has received accolades from his peers in the psychology, counseling, and ministerial fields.  Reverend Crenshaw is married to Frances, and together they have raised five children: Marvin, Shirley, the late Marilyn, Vanessa and Kay. They are also proud and loving grandparents to O'Shai and O'Lajidai, and great grandson O'Mauryai.  The constant thread through Reverend Crenshaw's life of service is his devotion to ``his ministry in saving souls.'' I am greatly honored and deeply humbled to join his congregation and community in offering thanks for his 30 years as pastor of Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church. May God continue to bless him, his wife, their family and the Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church congregation.                          ____________________
