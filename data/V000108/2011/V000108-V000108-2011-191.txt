Speaker, I am honored to stand before you and my colleagues today to recognize Tom Anderson. Governor Mitch Daniels recently named Tom a Distinguished Hoosier, an annual award given to Indiana residents who have excelled in their chosen fields. Tom was selected to receive this high honor due to his many years of exceptional work with Save the Dunes Council. For his outstanding efforts, Tom will be presented with this award on Saturday, April 9, 2011, at Barker House in Michigan City, Indiana.  Save the Dunes Council was founded in 1952 with the mission to preserve, protect, and restore the Indiana Dunes and all natural resources in Northwest Indiana's Lake Michigan Watershed for an enhanced quality of life. It is one of the most knowledgeable, involved, and valued organizations in Northwest Indiana and beyond. The members of this respected organization continue to devote their time and unrelenting efforts to serve their community through the preservation of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Tom Anderson has demonstrated an enduring dedication to this organization and its ideals and for his lifelong commitment he is worthy of the highest praise.  From 1992 through 2010, Tom acted as the Executive Director of Save the Dunes Council. A major focus of Save the Dunes Council is to protect the Indiana Dunes through advocacy, education, and lobbying. During his career with Save the Dunes Council, Tom lobbied tirelessly for land protection and resources to fulfill the organization's mission of protecting and restoring natural resources within the Lake Michigan Basin. From 1994 through 2010, Tom acted as the Executive Director of the Save the Dunes Conservation Fund. The Fund protects natural resources through land protection, restoration, watershed implementations, and education. Impressively, Tom helped to increase the Fund's budget from less than $80,000 in 2005 to over $1 million by 2009. Presently, Tom continues his efforts with Save the Dunes Council as a member of the Save the Dunes Conservation Fund Land Committee. Tom's undying dedication to conservation has led to him to found Conservation Connections, LLC, a company that strives to implement community-based conservation solutions.  Tom's dedication to the environment, conservation, and his career is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. He is happily married to attorney Joan Wiseman Anderson, and is the proud stepfather of four children who, following his inspirational example, all have become involved with conservation, public service, and resource protection. Tom and Joan have five grandchildren and reside in Michigan City.  Mr. Speaker, Tom Anderson has selflessly dedicated his time and effort to serve his community though his work with Save the Dunes Council. His passionate commitment to improving the quality of life for countless individuals is truly inspirational, and he is deserving of the high honor which has been bestowed upon him. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Tom Anderson on being recognized as a Distinguished Hoosier.                          ____________________
