Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank my good friend and colleague from Florida for his eloquent statement. I thank the Speaker and the majority leader for bringing this resolution to the floor, and of course to Howard Berman the chairman and IIeana Ros-Lehtinen for their strong support for it as well.  Madam Speaker, for far too long the Chinese Government has evaded virtually all serious scrutiny of its horrific human rights record--usually by employing bullying tactics, including threats to nations, multilateral organizations like the U.N., and to individuals. Today the Chinese Government brutalizes women and children through forced abortion and coerced sterilization as part of its barbaric one-child-per-couple policy, which makes brothers and sisters illegal. Today China crushes all political opposition. It tortures and incarcerates Falun Gong practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetan Buddhists and Christians. Today China violently crushes independent labor unions and has transformed the Internet into a tool for surveillance and censorship.  I note parenthetically, Madam Speaker, that immediately prior to the Olympics, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and I visited Beijing, one of many human rights trips to China. While we were there, we sought to meet with some of the house church leaders who wanted to meet with us and pray with us. All but one were arrested and detained, and after we left that particular pastor was arrested and detained and interrogated as well.  Madam Speaker, the naming of Liu Xiaobo as the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the Chinese Government's outrageous response to that naming, including the way they have mistreated his wife but now it's even worse, and friends can't even travel to Oslo to be a part of the ceremony, that reaction, of course is the underlying problem. The actual abuses that are committed, oblige us to sustained scrutiny and meaningful action. News reports suggest that over one-and-a-half dozen countries have been so intimidated by Beijing that they won't even send a delegation to Oslo. I think that's outrageous.  So today I urge my colleagues to adopt H. Res. 1717, expressing Congress'profound respect for and solidarity with Liu Xiaobo and all those who peacefully advocate for human rights and democracy in the PRC.  Madam Speaker, the resolution honors Liu Xiaobo, who in the 1980s had a brilliant academic career in front of him in China. When the Tiananmen Square demonstrations began in 1989, he was actually a visiting professor in New York City. He effectively gave all of that up when he flew back to China to join the students demonstrating for democracy on the square, and even there he insisted that the students themselves adhere to a democratic process. Liu has been working and sacrificing for democratic reform ever since--through hundreds of remarkable essays that he has written and the courage with which he has borne imprisonment, no less than four times.  My resolution highlights Charter 08, the democracy proclamation that Liu played a leading role in organizing, drafting, and of which he was one of the first signers. It is an astonishing document, a worthy heir of the great models that it is based upon, the U.S. Bill of Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Charter 77, the Czech human rights declaration that in the late 1970s contributed so much to the rebirth of conscience and respect for the rule of just law in eastern European captive nations, and ultimately to their peaceful democratization.  But the Chinese Government saw in this magnificent document only a crime, as my friend and colleague pointed out earlier, ``inciting subversion of state power''--whatever that is. The government arrested Mr. Liu in December of 2008 and in December 2009 sentenced him to 11 years in prison.  Madam Speaker, in February of this year, I led a group of some six Members in petitioning the peace prize committee to name Mr. Liu and two other Chinese dissidents for the Nobel Peace Prize. Our nomination described him as ``a visionary leader,'' remarkable for his patriotism and civic courage and the generous tone of his work. This man is absolutely nonviolent.  Though we didn't know it at the time, many other people had the exact same idea. Mr. Liu was nominated by two Nobel Peace Prize laureates--the 14th Dalai Lama and Bishop Desmond Tutu--as well as by former Czech President Vaclav Havel and many members of the Czech and Slovak parliaments, the Norwegian parliamentarian, and a number of human rights defenders from around the world and leaders in the fields of philosophy, literature, philanthropy and finance.  Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1717 underscores and points up the words of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that said, and I quote: ``The campaign to establish human rights in China is being waged by many Chinese. Through the severe punishment meted out to him, Liu has become the foremost symbol of this wide-ranging struggle for human rights in China.'' The resolution explicitly states that in honoring Liu Xiaobo, it honors all those who have promoted democratic reform in China, including all those who participated in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstration. After Liu's wife told him of the award, he wept and dedicated the prize to ``the Tiananmen martyrs.''  Madam Speaker, the resolution makes it very clear that Mr. Liu Xiaobo is a political prisoner, emphasizes that ``violations of human rights,'' including his persecution, ``are matters of legitimate concern to other governments,'' because we are hearing the tired old refrain from the government in Beijing that this is purely an internal matter.  Similarly, the resolution calls on the Chinese Government to cease censoring media and Internet reporting of the award and cease defaming Mr. Liu as a ``political tool of the West'' and as a ``traitorous operative.'' These are ridiculous charges, but they go to the heart of the issue that Mr. Liu himself analyzed in his 2005 essay called ``The CPC's Dictatorial Patriotism,'' the dictatorial government's fallacious equation of itself with the Chinese nation, so that whoever opposes the dictatorship is treated as an enemy of the state.  Finally, I will conclude with Liu Xiaobo's closing statement in his 2009 trial, only a small part of it. It is very rich and I hope all will read it. I will put it in the Record. This shows his gentleness of soul. He said:  ``But I still want to say to this regime, which is depriving me of my freedom, that I stand by the convictions I expressed in my June 2 Hunger Strike Declaration 20 years ago--I have no enemies and no hatred. None of the police who monitored, arrested and interrogated me, none of the prosecutors who indicted me, and none of the judges who judged me are my enemies. Hatred can rot away at a person's intelligence and conscience.  Enemy mentality will poison the spirit of a nation, incite cruel mortal struggles, destroy a society's tolerance and humanity, and hinder a nation's progress toward freedom and democracy. That is why I hope to be able to transcend my personal experiences as I look upon our nation's development and social change, to counter the regime's hostility with utmost goodwill, and to dispel hatred with love.''  To his wife, he said:  ``My dear, with your love I can calmly face my impending trial, having no regrets about the choices I've made and am optimistically awaiting tomorrow. I look toward to the day when my country is a land with freedom of expression, where the speech of every citizen will be treated equally well.''                              {time}  1540  This man is a moral giant, absolutely worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize, and he is the future of China.                 I Have No Enemies: My Final Statement                            (By Liu Xiaobo)Closing Statement in Court. Translation by HRIC, based on a translation                   by J. Latourelle, December 23, 2009       In the course of my life, for more than half a century,      June 1989 was the major turning point. Up to that point, I      was a member of the first class to enter university when      college entrance examinations were reinstated following the      Cultural Revolution (Class of '77). From BA to MA and on to      PhD, my academic career was all smooth sailing. Upon      receiving my degrees, I stayed on to teach at Beijing Normal      University. As a teacher, I was well received by the      students. At the same time, I was a public intellectual,      writing articles and books that created quite a stir during      the 1980s, frequently receiving invitations to give talks      around the country, and going abroad as a visiting scholar      upon invitation from Europe and America. What I demanded of      myself was this: whether as a person or as a writer, I would      lead a life of honesty, responsibility, and dignity. After      that, because I had returned from the U.S. to take part in      the 1989 Movement, I was thrown into prison for ``the crime      of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.'' I also      lost my beloved lectern and could no longer publish essays or      give talks in China. Merely for publishing different      political views and taking part in a peaceful democracy      movement, a teacher lost his lectern, a writer lost his right      to publish, and a public intellectual lost the opportunity to      give talks publicly. This is a tragedy, both for me      personally and for a China that has already seen thirty years      of Reform and Opening Up.       When I think about it, my most dramatic experiences after      June Fourth have been, surprisingly, associated with courts:      My two opportunities to address the public have both been      provided by trial sessions at the Beijing Municipal      Intermediate People's Court, once in January 1991, and again      today. Although the crimes I have been charged with on the      two occasions are different in name, their real substance is      basically the same--both are speech crimes.       Twenty years have passed, but the ghosts of June Fourth      have not yet been laid to rest. Upon release from Qincheng      Prison in 1991, I, who had been led onto the path of      political dissent by the psychological chains of June Fourth,      lost the right to speak publicly in my own country and could      only speak through the foreign media. Because of this, I was      subjected to year-round monitoring, kept under residential      surveillance (May 1995 to January 1996) and sent to      Reeducation-Through-Labor (October 1996 to October 1999). And      now I have been once again shoved into the dock by the enemy      mentality of the regime. But I still want to say to this      regime, which is depriving me of my freedom, that I stand by      the convictions I expressed in my ``June Second Hunger Strike      Declaration'' twenty years ago--I have no enemies and no      hatred. None of the police who monitored, arrested, and      interrogated me, none of the prosecutors who indicted me, and      none of the judges who judged me are my enemies. Although      there is no way I can accept your monitoring, arrests,      indictments, and verdicts, I respect your professions and      your integrity, including those of the two prosecutors, Zhang      Rongge and Pan Xueqing, who are now bringing charges against      me on behalf of the prosecution. During interrogation on      December 3, I could sense your respect and your good faith.       Hatred can rot away at a person's intelligence and      conscience. Enemy mentality will poison the spirit of a      nation, incite cruel mortal struggles, destroy a society's      tolerance and humanity, and hinder a nation's     progress toward freedom and democracy. That is why I hope to      be able to transcend my personal experiences as I look upon      our nation's development and social change, to counter the      regime's hostility with utmost good will, and to dispel      hatred with love.       Everyone knows that it was Reform and Opening Up that      brought about our country's development and social change. In      my view, Reform and Opening Up began with the abandonment of      the ``using class struggle as guiding principle'' government      policy of the Mao era and, in its place, a commitment to      economic development and social harmony. The process of      abandoning the ``philosophy of struggle'' was also a process      of gradual weakening of the enemy mentality and elimination      of the psychology of hatred, and a process of squeezing out      the ``wolf's milk'' that had seeped into human nature.\1\ It      was this process that provided a relaxed climate, at home and      abroad, for Reform and Opening Up, gentle and humane grounds      for restoring mutual affection among people and peaceful      coexistence among those with different interests and values,      thereby providing encouragement in keeping with humanity for      the bursting forth of creativity and the restoration of      compassion among our countrymen. One could say that      relinquishing the ``anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist''      stance in foreign relations and ``class struggle'' at home      has been the basic premise that has enabled Reform and      Opening Up to continue to this very day. The market trend in      the economy, the diversification of culture, and the gradual      shift in social order toward the rule of law have all      benefitted from the weakening of the ``enemy mentality.''      Even in the political arena, where progress is slowest, the      weakening of the enemy mentality has led to an ever-growing      tolerance for social pluralism on the part of the regime and      substantial decrease in the force of persecution of political      dissidents, and the official designation of the 1989 Movement      has also been changed from ``turmoil and riot'' to      ``political disturbance.'' The weakening of the enemy      mentality has paved the way for the regime to gradually      accept the universality of human rights. In [1997 and] 1998      the Chinese government made a commitment to sign two major      United Nations international human rights covenants,\2\      signaling China's acceptance of universal human rights      standards. In 2004, the National People's Congress (NPC)      amended the Constitution, writing into the Constitution for      the first time that ``the state respects and guarantees human      rights,'' signaling that human rights have already become one      of the fundamental principles of China's rule of law. At the      same time, the current regime puts forth the ideas of      ``putting people first'' and ``creating a harmonious      society,'' signaling progress in the CPC's concept of rule.       I have also been able to feel this progress on the macro      level through my own personal experience since my arrest.       Although I continue to maintain that I am innocent and that      the charges against me are unconstitutional, during the one      plus year since I have lost my freedom, I have been locked up      at two different locations and gone through four pretrial      police interrogators, three prosecutors, and two judges,      but in handling my case, they have not been disrespectful,      overstepped time limitations, or tried to force a      confession. Their manner has been moderate and reasonable;      moreover, they have often shown goodwill. On June 23, I      was moved from a location where I was kept under      residential surveillance to the Beijing Municipal Public      Security Bureau's No. 1 Detention Center, known as      ``Beikan.'' During my six months at Beikan, I saw      improvements in prison management.       In 1996, I spent time at the old Beikan (located at      Banbuqiao). Compared to the old Beikan of more than a decade      ago, the present Beikan is a huge improvement, both in terms      of the ``hardware''--the facilities--and the ``software''--     the management. In particular, the humane management      pioneered by the new Beikan, based on respect for the rights      and integrity of detainees, has brought flexible management      to bear on every aspect of the behavior of the correctional      staff, and has found expression in the ``comforting      broadcasts,'' Repentance magazine, and music before meals, on      waking and at bedtime. This style of management allows      detainees to experience a sense of dignity and warmth, and      stirs their consciousness in maintaining prison order and      opposing the bullies among inmates. Not only has it provided      a humane living environment for detainees, it has also      greatly improved the environment for their litigation to take      place and their state of mind. I've had close contact with      correctional officer Liu Zheng, who has been in charge of me      in my cell, and his respect and care for detainees could be      seen in every detail of his work, permeating his every word      and deed, and giving one a warm feeling. It was perhaps my      good fortune to have gotten to know this sincere, honest,      conscientious, and kind correctional officer during my time      at Beikan.       It is precisely because of such convictions and personal      experience that I firmly believe that China's political      progress will not stop, and I, filled with optimism, look      forward to the advent of a future free China. For there is no      force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom, and      China will in the end become a nation ruled by law, where      human rights reign supreme. I also hope that this sort of      progress can be reflected in this trial as I await the      impartial ruling of the collegial bench--a ruling that will      withstand the test of history.       If I may be permitted to say so, the most fortunate      experience of these past twenty years has been the selfless      love I have received from my wife, Liu Xia. She could not be      present as an observer in court today, but I still want to      say to you, my dear, that I firmly believe your love for me      will remain the same as it has always been. Throughout all      these years that I have lived without freedom, our love was      full of bitterness imposed by outside circumstances, but as I      savor its aftertaste, it remains boundless. I am serving my      sentence in a tangible prison, while you wait in the      intangible prison of the heart. Your love is the sunlight      that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my      prison window, stroking every inch of my skin, warming every      cell of my body, allowing me to always keep peace, openness,      and brightness in my heart, and filling every minute of my      time in prison with meaning. My love for you, on the other      hand, is so full of remorse and regret that it at times makes      me stagger under its weight. I am an insensate stone in the      wilderness, whipped by fierce wind and torrential rain, so      cold that no one dares touch me. But my love is solid and      sharp, capable of piercing through any obstacle. Even if I      were crushed into powder, I would still use my ashes to      embrace you.       My dear, with your love I can calmly face my impending      trial, having no regrets about the choices I've made and      optimistically awaiting tomorrow. I look forward to [the day]      when my country is a land with freedom of expression, where      the speech of every citizen will be treated equally well;      where different values, ideas, beliefs, and political views .      . . can both compete with each other and peacefully coexist;      where both majority and minority views will be equally      guaranteed, and where the political views that differ from      those currently in power, in particular, will be fully      respected and protected; where all political views will      spread out under the sun for people to choose from, where      every citizen can state political views without fear, and      where no one can under any circumstances suffer political      persecution for voicing divergent political views. I hope      that I will be the last victim of China's endless literary      inquisitions and that from now on no one will be incriminated      because of speech.       Freedom of expression is the foundation of human rights,      the source of humanity, and the mother of truth. To strangle      freedom of speech is to trample on human rights, stifle      humanity, and suppress truth.       In order to exercise the right to freedom of speech      conferred by the Constitution, one should fulfill the social      responsibility of a Chinese citizen. There is nothing      criminal in anything I have done. [But] if charges are      brought against me because of this, I have no complaints.       Thank you, everyone.                           Translator's Notes       1. Writers in China today often refer to indoctrination      with the ideology of class struggle as ``drinking wolf's      milk,'' and the ideology of the Cultural Revolution era as      the ``wolf's milk culture,'' which had turned humans into      wolf-like predatory beasts.       2. China signed the International Covenant on Economic,      Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in 1997, and ratified it      in 2001. It signed the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights (ICCPR) in 1998, but has not yet ratified      the covenant.  I reserve the balance of my time.
