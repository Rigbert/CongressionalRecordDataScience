Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mrs. Bernice Mounia on her momentous 80th birthday that she will be celebrating on April 19, 2004. Bernice has spent the past 80 years of her long and distinguished life caring for her family and her community in Gary, IN. Her presence in Northwest Indiana has allowed her the opportunity to touch the lives of many people.  Bernice was born on April 19, 1924, and subsequently moved to Gary, IN from Alabama in 1944 with her loving husband, Webster Mounia. After moving to Gary, IN, Bernice and Webster were blessed with the births of their 10 wonderful children. Her children, as well as people whose lives are touched by Bernice, admire her for devoting unselfish love, time, dedication, guidance, and spirit to her family, church, and friends.  As we'll as being dearly loved and respected by her family and community, Bernice was also well known for her ingenuity and prudence. Bernice currently resides in the same house at 2700 Jefferson Street that she and her husband built 48 years ago. She displayed ingenuity in constructing insulation out of dryer lint to plug cracks around windows and doors. Along with her many other accomplishments in her community, Bernice was also a pioneer in the practice of recycling. Due to her resourcefulness, Bernice invented ways in recycling aluminum, bread bags, cloths, jars, food, soap, wax paper, and cans of grease that were left over from her gourmet cooking.  Gourmet cooking on a frugal budget was definitely one of Bernice's fortes. Bernice made sure no one in her family went without a first class meal to eat. As well as providing the best meals available for her children, Bernice also wanted the best upbringing for her children. By providing unwavering guidance to her children, she instilled in them the morals and fortitude that have molded her children into successful adults who are raising families of their own.  Mr. Speaker, Bernice Mounia has given her time and efforts selflessly to the people of Northwest Indiana throughout her long and illustrious life. She has taught every member of her family and extended family the true meaning of service to all people in the community. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mrs. Bernice Mounia for her outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District. I am proud to commend Bernice for her lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
