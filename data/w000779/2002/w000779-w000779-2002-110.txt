President, as I indicated earlier, my colleagues--particularly Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Leahy, and Hatch--have been very gracious in working with me on this position. We are going to continue to work with them as this legislation is considered in the Senate and when this bill gets to conference.  As we go forward with this today, I hope we will ensure that there is a strong Federal presence to advocate for the consumer. I think these advocates at the State level do a good job given their limited resources.  Given the fact that so much of the energy business has moved interstate, and those interstate transactions can result in higher bills to small businesses in Georgia, Oregon, and across this country for senior citizens and others of modest means, I think we need to now have a Federal advocate.  I am pleased we have been able to assemble a bipartisan group that is going to help pass this today and continue to work to refine it as it is considered through the evolution of this legislation in the Senate and in conference.  I ask the Senate to approve the amendment at this time.  I yield the floor.
