President, the front page of The Washington Post Friday delivered the remarkable news that the family of David Rosenbaum has entered into an agreement with Washington's city leaders under which the family will withdraw a $20 million lawsuit--a lawsuit in which they were said to have an excellent chance of prevailing--if the city lives up to a promise to fix the city's troubled emergency response system.  David Rosenbaum, the retired New York Times reporter, was fatally beaten last year near his home in Washington. He was a good husband and father, a kind friend and neighbor, and a talented and respected journalist. He had a passion for making government more effective in doing its job. He was a good and a kind man. Those who knew or knew of the Rosenbaums were further saddened last year when David's widow, Virginia Rosenbaum, succumbed to cancer.  How fitting, how constructive, and how typical of David Rosenbaum and his life and his work that his family has taken this selfless step. Our best wishes--and our admiration and gratitude--go out to them.  The material follows.               [From the Washington Post, March 9, 2007]              Journalist's Family Wants Reform, Not Money                          (By David Nakamura)       The family of a slain New York Times journalist yesterday      agreed to forgo the potential of millions of dollars in      damages in exchange for something that might be harder for      the D.C. government to deliver: an overhaul of the emergency      medical response system that bungled his care at nearly every      step.       David E. Rosenbaum's family said it will give up a $20      million lawsuit against the city--but only if changes are      made within one year.       Under a novel legal settlement, the city agreed to set up a      task force to improve the troubled emergency response system      and look at issues such as training, communication and      supervision. A member of the family will be on the panel.       Although legal experts said the family could have won      millions had it pursued the case, Rosenbaum's brother Marcus      said he and other relatives were more interested in making      sure that the city enacted measurable changes.       ``As details of the case started to come out, we decided      among ourselves to do something for all the citizens so that      things would be improved,'' Marcus Rosenbaum said, standing      next to a dogwood sapling planted near where his brother was      mugged in January 2006. David Rosenbaum was pounded on the      head with a metal pipe by robbers who accosted him during an      evening walk. He then was mistakenly treated as a drunk by      D.C. firefighters and other emergency workers, who failed to      notice his severe head wound.       Rosenbaum, 63, died of a brain injury two days after the      attack on Gramercy Street NW. He had recently retired after      nearly four decades at the New York Times, where he covered      economic policy and other issues, but continued to work in      the Washington bureau on special assignments.       The D.C. inspector general's office issued a blistering      report in June that faulted firefighters, emergency workers,      police and hospital personnel for an ``unacceptable chain of      failure'' and warned of broader problems with emergency care.      The report called for stronger supervision and training,      clearer communication and more internal controls for      emergency workers and hospital personnel.       D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), who joined the Rosenbaum      family at the announcement, said that he was pleased with the      settlement but that it was just the start of a long process      of reform. He did not identify potential changes.       ``This was a failure of the government, the most tragic      kind of failure the government can have,'' said Fenty,      flanked by Acting D.C. Attorney General Linda Singer. ``A      settlement does not let anyone off the hook, especially the      District government.''       Fenty, who took office in January, pledged last year to      oust the chief of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical      Services Department, Adrian H. Thompson, who many officials      felt did not act quickly or aggressively enough to address      the failures. Among other things, Thompson issued a statement      three days after Rosenbaum's death that said ``everything      possible'' had been done to provide care. He later changed      course, saying he had been misled, and dismissed or took      disciplinary action against at least 10 employees.       This week, Fenty nominated Atlanta Fire Chief Dennis L.      Rubin to head the department. Rubin said he is familiar with      the Rosenbaum case and intends to make changes after studying      the D.C. response system more closely. Among issues likely to      be on the table: the creation of a separate city department      for emergency medical response.       Marcus Rosenbaum said he is hoping for the best. ``We are      really happy with the way things have gone with the      District,'' he said. ``It's like we are adversaries on the      same side. We hope this settlement will lead to something      good.''       The lawsuit was filed in November on behalf of Rosenbaum's      adult children, Daniel and Dottie.       Family attorney Patrick Regan praised Fenty for reaching      out to the family even before he was sworn in and then      instructing his staff to work closely with the Rosenbaums to      forge a settlement. But Regan had harsh words for Howard      University Hospital--which remains a defendant in the lawsuit      in D.C. Superior Court.       The city's ambulance bypassed the closest hospital and took      Rosenbaum to Howard because one of the emergency medical      technicians had personal business to attend to near there.      Rosenbaum was not seen by a hospital physician for more than      90 minutes and did not get a neurological evaluation until he      had been there almost four hours, the family's lawsuit      alleges.       ``Howard University's performance was unacceptable,      atrocious. It was Third World service in the nation's      capital,'' Regan said. ``While the District has stepped up      and said, `Work with us,' Howard has refused to step up.      They've covered up what they did. . . . At every turn, Howard      has offered excuse after excuse.''       A spokeswoman for Howard did not respond to a request for      comment.       D.C. police also were faulted in the case for failing to      thoroughly investigate an earlier robbery that could have led      to the suspects. Two men have been convicted in the killing:      Percey Jordan, who was sentenced to a 65-year term, and his      cousin Michael C. Hamlin, who cooperated with prosecutors and      received a 26-year term.       The city's new task force will have six months to develop a      report. Toby Halliday, Rosenbaum's son-in-law, will serve as      the family's representative. The panel will include city      officials and emergency care experts who have yet to be      identified.       ``Our goal is to look beyond the individual errors in this      case to bigger issues of emergency medical services,''      Halliday said, as his wife, brother-in-law and other family      members looked on.       ``The results must be meaningful and measurable,'' Halliday      added, ``with changes and results that can be tracked over      time to see if they are effective.''                          ____________________
