President, we have been yielding to Members on other subjects. I was glad to do so, but we were supposed to be on the highway bill for discussion about an hour ago. It is my wish not to recognize anyone, so long as we have speakers on the highway bill. I understand I get primary recognition, and I can't do this as managed time, but it is my desire to recognize the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee for whatever time he should take, and immediately following that, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.  Before Senator Jeffords talks, let me say, again, as I did several times yesterday, how much I appreciate his cooperation in working together on this very difficult bill and coming to the point where we are today.
