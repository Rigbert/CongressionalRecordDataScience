Chairman, reclaiming my time, and I thank the gentleman for the addition to the remarks that I made and that he is making.  I would reiterate what the gentleman just said. This is an issue about us focusing on what it costs from an emergency standpoint to run the residency of the Vice President and the residency of the White House, the President; it is not to embarrass either one of them. I do not think Vice President Cheney is frankly using more or less energy than Vice President Gore.  What I think we ought to have is a focus of this Congress on those costs so that it shows us very clearly what it costs to heat, to air condition homes. I think in that respect, it is a good educational amendment and gives us a better budget focus, and I urge its adoption.
