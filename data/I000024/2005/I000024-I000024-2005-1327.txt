President, I wish to honor a brave Oklahoma soldier who gave the last full measure to protect our freedom. Staff Sergeant Melvin Blazer of the United States Marine Corps embodied the spirit of service and the values that make this country what it is.  Sergeant Blazer was a great Marine. He joined soon after graduating from Moore High School in 1984. As he rose through the ranks, he developed a reputation of dependability. He was serving as a platoon leader with the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force when his unit was deployed to Iraq.  Sergeant Blazer was no stranger to the hazards of duty. He survived an improvised explosive device attack that struck his convoy last November and was awarded a Purple Heart.  Sergeant Blazer was also a family man. He married his wife, Dana, in 1989 and they had two children, Alyssa and Erik. As his wife recalls, ``To know my husband was to love my husband. Everybody loved him and admired him and respected him and held him in such high regard. He was a hero In his everyday life.''  Sergeant Blazer was also a Christian. He told relatives he was excited to see Iraq because the Bible talks about it and was proud to help and serve an oppressed people.  On December 12, 2004, Sergeant Blazer was killed by enemy small arms fire in the city of Fallujah. He was 38 years old. He loved God, devoted himself to his family and gave the highest sacrifice to his country. He leaves behind many who know what a true hero he is. As a son of Oklahoma and a fine example of what this country stands for, Staff Sergeant Blazer deserves our honor and remembrance.                    Lance Corporal Jordan D. Winkler  Mr. President, I wish to honor one of Oklahoma's fallen sons, Marine LCpl Jordan Winkler. From an early age he felt called to defend our country and the freedom it stands for. For his life of service and his final sacrifice, we are eternally indebted to him.  Corporal Winkler admired the military even before he was old enough to join. His parents still have a letter from the Marine Corps that he received when he was fifteen. While in Union High School in Tulsa, he was active in sports and respected by his peers.Through family friends and recruiters, he gained an accurate picture of what would be required of him if he joined. During his senior year he was able to pursue his dream and joined the Marines through a delayed entry program. Those who knew him say he wore the uniform with pride.  Corporal Winkler is remembered for his determination, honesty and integrity. As his teacher Paul Todd said, ``You knew where he stood. He lived by his principles and he was a good role model for everyone that knew him.''  After training, he was assigned to the Combat Service Support Battalion 1, Combat Service Support Group 11, 1st Force Service Support Group, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, normally stationed at Camp Pendleton, California. This unit was deployed to Iraq to contribute to the ongoing US effort to rid the country of tyranny and the influence of terrorism. On November 26, 2004, in Camp Fallujah, Corporal Winkler died in a non-combat incident. He was buried at Tulsa's Memorial Park Cemetery with military honors.  Corporal Winkler made a deep impact on those who knew him, but those who most deeply loved him look forward with hope. As his family said in a statement, ``Jordan was a dedicated Marine who was proud to be in Iraq serving his country and doing his job as a Marine. We will miss him more than words can say. However, we know we will see him again. Jordan Winkler was a Christian and knew that no matter what happened in his life, God was always in control.''  Lance Corporal Jordan Winkler was worthy of deep respect and embodies all the qualities that make our Armed Forces and our country great. He was a soldier and a man of integrity, and he will be deeply missed.                          sergeant carl w. lee  Mr. President, today I stand in proud memory of an American hero. Army Sgt Carl W. Lee was a native of Oklahoma City, OK. He graduated from Crooked Oak High School in 2000 and enlisted in the Army. Although Sergeant Lee initially expected to stay only for the 3-year commitment, he soon chose to make a career of military service. He was assigned to the United States Army's 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.  Sergeant Lee is remembered as an example of service and motivation. As Rusty McMurtrey, Lee's 21-year-old brother, emotionally recalled, ``He was the reason I graduated school and got as far as I did. Since I can remember, Carl was the only one who'd been there for me.'' Rusty credited his older brother with saving him from a life of gangs and violence. The two planned on starting an automotive business together.  When he had any free time, Sergeant Lee would volunteer with a local Special Olympics. It was his heart that his friends and family remember most.  Sergeant Lee's unit, usually stationed at Camp Howze, South Korea, was deployed to Iraq. He served there as part of the effort to free the Iraqi people from the chains of tyranny and terrorism. On November 28, 2004, his unit was conducting a foot patrol in Ar Ramadi when it came under enemy small arms fire. Sergeant Lee was hit twice and died from those wounds.  Mr. President, it is difficult to express the pain of those he left behind; Sgt Carl Lee meant so much to so many and he will forever be remembered as a hero. By putting himself in harm's way he showed bravery and self-sacrifice that few of us will ever know. He gave the ultimate measure, and we are in his eternal debt. I honor Oklahoma's son and America's warrior, Sgt Carl W. Lee.                    staff sergeant melvin l. blazer  Mr. President, I wish to honor a brave Oklahoma soldier who gave the last full measure to protect our freedom.
