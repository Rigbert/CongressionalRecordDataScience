 I want to thank the chairs and ranking members of the Foreign Relations and Banking Committees--Chairman Corker, Chairman Crapo--for their efforts to craft additional, much-needed sanctions on Russia as well. I would encourage Members of both parties to keep working together so we can pass the critical Iran sanctions legislation very soon.                          ____________________
