President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition to this amendment. I want to say that there is no one of the 100 Members of the Senate who has been historically closer to the CAP, who has participated in CAP activities than I have. There is not a year that goes by that I do not talk to the troops and those who are being promoted, those who have achieved really great things and have made great contributions to society. I also, just 2 weeks ago, could very well have been the product of a search by the CAP, had I not been able to glide my plane into an airport. So I understand that. I have been on various patrols where we go out. I know the valuable contributions that the Civil Air Patrol makes to this Nation every year, search and rescue, youth cadet program.  However, we are concerned with the continuing streams of allegations coming from the Air Force and from members of the Civil Air Patrol that senior members of the CAP have engaged in inappropriate, and in some cases, illegal activities. I will outline a few of the allegations that have been brought to the committee by either the Air Force or former members of the CAP.  I have some documents to include as part of the Record that I will want immediately following my remarks, but these are just some of the accusations that are out there. I know that the Senator from Colorado is just as concerned about these as I am.  One individual was charging the cost of his flying hours to the Civil Air Patrol counterdrug account when he was actually flying to visit his daughter. A second accusation: One CAP wing charged both its home State and the CAP counterdrug budget for the same mission, essentially receiving double reimbursement for the same activity.  Here is a good one: The southeast regional commanders conference was held on a cruise to Nassau paid for by CAP headquarters. After the conference, some individuals requested and received a per diem, even though the cost of the cruise had been paid for by the CAP and, thus, by the taxpayers. I have often thought--I suggested this to the Senator from Colorado--what kind of a position would we be in, would I be in, as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee if I sat back and let these charges go unanswered? I could just imagine ``60 Minutes'' or some news account of this talking about the cruise to Nassau that was paid with taxpayers' money and then double dipping on top of that.  We have numerous other types of reports concerning missing equipment. Seventy percent of one wing's gear, communications gear, computers, et cetera, cannot be accounted for; 77 percent of another wing's gear is missing. The most extraordinary of all, however, is a letter we received from one former member alleging that Federal laws and Federal aviation regulations relating to aircraft maintenance were being violated, and quoting from that letter, ``the lives of our cadet''-- these are juveniles--``members were being jeopardized.''  We are talking about human lives here. Because of these accusations and because the Civil Air Patrol is an auxiliary of the Air Force, receiving virtually all of its funding--some 94 percent of the funding for the CAP comes from the Air Force and the headquarters at the Air Force installation--the leadership of the Air Force requested that the committee pass legislation to grant the Air Force the necessary authority to ensure responsible management of the Civil Air Patrol.  That is exactly what this legislation does. This is in our mark that is before us today.  I do urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. However, should it pass, I hope that the Secretary of the Air Force will refer the allegations to the FBI and seek to sever the Air Force's ties with the CAP. We can't hold the Air Force responsible for an organization that it doesn't have any authority to supervise. I do not know whether there is any other example anywhere, Mr. President, where you have the responsibility statutorily borne by some agency and they have no authority to police or discipline the behavior of that entity.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from General Ryan, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, making this request be printed in the Record. And I ask that the internal memorandum that outlines many other examples, which I would be glad to share with the Senator from Colorado and with the Senate, should this debate pursue, beprinted in the Record immediately after the letter from General Ryan.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Department of the Air Force,                                 Office of the Chief of Staff,                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1999.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support,          Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Air Force has a long-standing and      mutually beneficial relationship with the Civil Air Patrol      (CAP). As a former CAP cadet, I am very familiar with the      important role this organization plays in shaping the lives      of thousands of young Americans.       However, there have been a number of recent incidents which      have caused us some concern about the activities of the CAP      headquarters. As an auxiliary of the Air Force, CAP receives      most of its budget and a great deal of nonappropriated      support, such as free use of on-base facilities, from the Air      Force. Yet, it is not accountable to the Air Force for how it      spends its budget or conducts its business. Consequently, we      have developed a proposal to strengthen and preserve our      relationship with CAP. It requires new legislation, but will      not affect CAP's funding levels. It will be transparent to      the CAP field units and will ultimately improve the level of      support they receive from the headquarters.       We have briefed your personal staff and the Senate Armed      Services Committee staff on our proposed changes to the Air      Force-CAP relationship. We recently met with the CAP      leadership and continue to seek solutions to our concerns.      These efforts are ongoing and should they prove successful,      we will recommend withdrawing this legislation.       I trust this information is helpful and ask for your      support as we work to strengthen the bond between the Air      Force and CAP.                                              Michael E. Ryan,                                                    General, USAF,     Chief of Staff.                                  ____     From: AF/DXON.     Subject: Special Project Team Assessment of Civil Air Patrol. Memorandum for the Special Assistant to the Secretary of The Air Force       As you know, I traveled to Maxwell AFB, AL from 18-23 April      1999 as part of the Special Project Team that the Secretary      and Chief of Staff chartered to assess Civil Air Patrol (CAP)      processes. Our purpose was not to perform a full-blown      inspection of either CAP's administrative headquarters or the      units in the CAP national chain of command. Nevertheless, in      just a couple days time the team discovered a number of      practices that convinced us of the Air Force need for greater      oversight of CAP activities. I will cite a few examples that      are of particular concern:       CAP recently conducted its Southeast Region Commander's      Conference on board a Caribbean cruise ship with the National      Commander and National Director in attendance. Our auditors      discovered that executives claimed per diem for this meeting      even though the cost of the cruise was inclusive of meals.       Senior corporate leaders travel by first class, and receive      what could be regarded as generous salaries. Certain senior      corporate employees are receiving full military retirement      pay in addition to their salaries.       CAP units flew over 41,000 hours on ``counter drug''      missions, which were reimbursed, from appropriated funds. We      are aware of several irregularities where personal travel and      maintenance flights were charged to counter drug, as well as      one wing that charged several counter drug missions to both      the Air Force and the state.       Several CAP wings cannot account for over 70% of the      communications equipment purchased for their units with funds      that were reimbursed with Air Force appropriated funds.       Members and former members complain that they lack faith in      the independence and effectiveness of the CAP Inspector      General program. Members were refused membership renewal      coincidental to raising complaints about equipment control,      aircraft maintenance (safety) practices, and an assault. A      flight check ride pilot was ostracized from her unit for      restricting a CAP pilot from solo flight privileges. In each      case, the affected members went to their IGs who deferred to      command action.       Because this assessment was never intended to be an      inspection, the observations made should be viewed only as      symptoms. The team also observed truly excellent programs at      certain wings and more generally at the administrative      headquarters. Talented and dedicated volunteers and employees      in many cases provide safe and valuable programs to cadets      and the country as a whole. The CAP National Board seemed to      satisfy a major concern by agreeing in principle to comply      with OMB Circular A-110. Nevertheless, the Air Force should      attempt to gain visibility through representation on an      overseeing Board of Directors to assure that CAP's role as a      civilian auxiliary to the Air Force will be a credit to the      Air Force and the nation. The Board of Directors would      operate at the macro level and provide the SECAF authority      commensurate with the responsibility of overseeing CAP      matters. This would clearly establish the auxiliary to      principal structure to foster a healthy relationship for the      future. Unless CAP CORP leadership convinces the National      Board to reverse itself and embrace such a structure, it is      regrettable that the only sure way to obtain this reasonable      level of oversight will likely be through legislation.
