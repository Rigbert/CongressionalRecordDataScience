Chairman, during this general debate we have heard from the opponents of this legislation that scientific research would come to a screeching halt if a ban on cloning of human embryos is enacted. There would be no more stem cell research, there would be no in vitro fertilization, and on and on and on.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The bill itself in section 302(d) says, and I quote, ``Nothing in this section restricts areas of scientific research not specifically prohibited by this section, including research in the use of nuclear transfer or other cloning techniques to produce molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryos, tissues, organs, plants, or animals other than humans.''  What this section says is that all of this type of scientific research that is going on now will be able to continue as long as cloned human embryos are not used. That is a big difference. If a scientist wants to create human embryos and peddle them around the world and around this country to make a profit, that will be prohibited. But if a scientist wants to do scientific research, including stem cell research, on material other than cloned human embryos, which include adult stem cells, then that will be able to continue to proceed.  This bill draws a line, a very reasonable line, between science and ethics. That reasonable line is whether a cloned human embryo is used. Should a cloned human embryo be created and used, yes, this bill criminalizes it, as it should; but if the research uses any other material besides cloned human embryos, the criminal penalties of this bill do not apply, and that research will be able to proceed.  I would hope that the Members of this House will listen to the fine points of this debate and ignore allegations that have been made that are not contained in the bill, and pass it.
