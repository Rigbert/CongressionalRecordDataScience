President, in her marvelous book entitled ``American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country,'' Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison wrote the following: ``No history can be written appropriately without acknowledging the part women have played in building the greatness of our country.''  As my valued colleague and good friend begins a new chapter in her life, I hope she finds the time to add a new chapter to her own book, one that will be fascinating, inspiring--and autobiographical.  Like the women Kay celebrates as an author, from Amelia Earhart to Sally Ride, from Clara Barton to Condoleeza Rice, Kay Bailey Hutchison is a pioneer, a breaker of barriers. In the special election in 1993, the people ofTexas made her the first woman to represent them in the Senate. In the three regular elections since then, they have confirmed their trust in her by ever-increasing margins. As the leader of the Senate Commerce Committee, Kay has been a strong voice for transportation systems that are efficient, safe, and secure. In my own work on the Homeland Security Committee, I am well aware of the major role she played in drafting the airline security bill that Congress passed after the attacks on 9/11/01. She has also worked successfully to include more effective air cargo screening.  From the America COMPETES Act to her steadfast support for NASA, Kay is determined our country will not cede its position as the world's leader in science, technology, and space exploration. When the NASA rover Curiosity thrilled all of us with its perfect landing on Mars this past August, the hands of Kay's legislative leadership were on the controls. Working with Kay as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I know how dedicated she is to ensuring that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely and efficiently. She is a champion for our small business owners and for policies that promote free enterprise and job creation.  Her complete commitment to the men and women of our Armed Forces is reflected in her years of service on the Armed Services Committee as well as the Military Construction Subcommittee on Appropriations, and her unanimous election this year to serve as chairman of the Board of Visitors at West Point.  In the afterword to her book, Kay wrote that as a young girl growing up in Texas she was so inspired by the lives of great Americans that by the sixth grade she had exhausted all of the biographies on the school library shelf and had to turn elsewhere for book report material. I am sure the story of her own contributions and accomplishments will be avidly read by generations of girls and boys to come.  I wish her all the best as she turns a new page in what has truly been a remarkable life of public service.                              Scott Brown  Mr. President, when Scott Brown, a fellow New Englander, came to the Senate 2 years ago, I immediately saw in him those traits shared by the people of our two New England States: a strong work ethic, a determination to always do what he thought was right, and a spirit that was independent and dedicated to doing what was best for his constituents and for his country.  My initial assessment was confirmed by our time working together on so many issues. Scott conducted his inspiring 2010 campaign via his now legendary pickup truck. When he got to Washington, he kept his foot on the gas. His work in government at the State and local level in Massachusetts and his distinguished service in the Army National Guard prepared him with experience that made him a respected and effective legislator from day one. His intellect, energy, and character made him a valued colleague and a dear friend.  Scott is a person one could always count on. I have had the opportunity to work closely with Scott on so many key issues. In each and every case he brought an informed, thoughtful, and open-minded approach to every issue.  As the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I have gotten to know Scott very well and I appreciate his service on our committee. He placed his top priority on helping to keep our Nation safe from the continuing threat of terrorism. He also worked hard to make our Federal Government more efficient and transparent.  With Scott's leadership, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation to help put the Postal Service back on a more sound financial footing and to ensure that this institution could endure. He also authored the STOCK Act, the new law that clearly prohibits insider trading by Members of Congress and their staff.  Scott has long been an effective champion for our small business owners, working to ensure that entrepreneurs and innovators in Massachusetts and across the country have the ability to survive and thrive and, most of all, to create good jobs. He has advocated for our Nation's veterans through the Hiring Our Heroes Act that he coauthored, which provides tax credits to small businesses that hire a returning veteran or member of the National Guard Reserve.  Scott has been a devoted advocate in the Senate for fiscal responsibility and a balanced budget amendment. At the same time, he kept a firm commitment to helping those most in need. He fought hard for such vital programs as the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program, which is so important to getting through those cold New England winters.  Equally important to Scott's hard work in the Senate has been the approach he has always taken in legislating. He studies the issues. He seeks areas where a consensus can be found. From the very first day in the Senate, he demonstrated his belief that compromise is not a dirty word but an absolute necessity if we are to meet the challenges facing America. Scott always looked at the issues before Congress not through the lens of a partisan politician but, rather, through the lens of a pragmatic problem-solver.  Scott's tenure in the Senate has been far too brief but, perhaps more important, it has been characterized by a remarkable degree of success in transforming good ideas into public laws. Given his Maine roots and strong commitment to Massachusetts, I am sure we will remain good friends in the years to come. But, oh, how I will miss serving with my friend Scott Brown.  I yield the floor.
