Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my good friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) in recognizing Mr. Ronald A. Gettelfinger on his well-deserved retirement.  A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to be with Mr. Gettelfinger and the UAW members to celebrate their 75th anniversary. They have been stalwart partners in the movement for civil rights and social change. It was truly a homecoming, and I was proud to be with Ron during one of his last official acts as UAW president.  For nearly half a century, Mr. Gettelfinger has dedicated himself to the rights of American auto workers. Ron began his career as chassis line repairman in 1964. When his colleagues at Ford's Louisville Assembly plant elected him as their committeeperson, bargaining chair, and president, he rose to the challenge and went on to serve in various leadership positions for the United Auto Workers (UAW) membership for the next 26 years.  During his tireless years as a UAW leader, Mr. Gettelfinger constantly recommitted himself to the values that were so important to--as he would say--my ``sisters and brothers''. Through trials and tribulation, the UAW has defended human dignity in the auto industry and been a strong ally in the struggle for social justice both in the United States and around the world. Mr. Gettelfinger embodied these values and was a constant, vocal advocate for health care, workers' rights, and trade policy reforms. I thank him for his service and for his commitment to the forgotten, the underserved, and the backbone of our global economy--America's workers.  Again, let me congratulate Ron, his wife Judy, and their family on this momentous occasion and exciting new chapter in their life. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Dingell, as you know, his leadership will be missed, but never forgotten.
