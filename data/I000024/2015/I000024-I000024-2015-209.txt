President, I say to my friend from Delaware, I appreciate his remarks. It is seldom people will thank people for the time and effort they spend and the successes they have.  Even though he is located so close to Washington that he is not exposed as much as I am--twice a week--I actually learn personally to know these people. I feel the commitment they make. Certainly in Tulsa, Dallas, and here are the ones whom I know well. So I appreciate the fact that the Senator is paying attention to them. That means a lot.                             Climate Change  Mr. President, since 2002, I have come to the floor to talk, after we discovered the truth about the whole global warming thing and who is behind it and all this stuff. I don't want to say anything that would be interpreted as not respectful, but I can remember back in 2002, it was a difficult thing to tell the truth about this to the American people because at that time most of the American people felt that--yes, they bought into this idea that the world is coming to an end, and it is all manmade gases that are causing this. So it was difficult.  The Gallup poll of 2002 said at that time that, of all the environmental concerns, No. 1 was global warming. Now, that is not true today. Today, it is almost dead last. Last March, there was a poll that came out from Gallup, and it was next to the last. It was down from some 20 different environmental concerns.  So the people have realized that this largest tax increase in the history of America, if it were to take place, is not going to solve a problem--a problem that really doesn't exist to the extent it has been represented. Today, they are still debating this.  I want to bring people up to date on where we are now--the fact that climate change is not based on hard evidence and observation, but rather on a set of wishful beliefs, a well-scripted dialogue with which President Obama and the environmental alarmists are intending to scare the American people into accepting this thing that would be so devastating economically to America.  The other day a good friend of mine, Lamar Smith from the House--I like Lamar. He and I were elected actually the same day many years ago. Lamar is the chairman of the committee that has a lot of this jurisdiction, and he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that was entitled, ``The Climate-Change Religion.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I thank Lamar Smith for his continued leadership and support on this issue. As Lamar highlights in the op-ed, the debate about global warming is predicated more on ``scare tactics than on fact based determinations.''  Global warming alarmism has evolved into a religion where one is either an alarmist or a skeptic. Some people are not aware of those two terms. Someone who has bought into this ``the world is coming to an end''--they are the alarmists. People who do not believe that, as myself, are skeptics. And being a skeptic is akin to heresy of the highest order. Good policy has to be based on good science, not on religion, and that requires science free from bias, whatever its conclusions may be.  The modern-day religion of climate change has been very artful in establishing and controlling carefully scripted talking points intended to scare the American people under the guise of environmental protectionism.  There are three main tenets of climate change alarmism that can be found in any related speech, which we heard the President recite during his recent Earth Day speech. Those three tenets are: No. 1, climate change is human caused. No. 2, climate change is already wreaking havoc across the globe. And No. 3, we must act today--now--before terrible things happen--the world coming to an end.  These three main tenets of climate change can be found on just about every administrative agency page, and they are creeping into every Federal policy determination.  As wise as the Presiding Officer is, something that he is not aware of that is happening in America today is that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, adjusted its policy for receipt of disaster preparedness resources to require States that are to be accepting these FEMA funds to first accept the undeniable ``challenges posed by climate change'' and then spend State resources figuring how to plan for them before becoming eligible for disaster preparedness funds.  Look, I come from Oklahoma, a State that has tornadoes, called Tornado Alley. When this happens, as it did very recently in the south-central part of Oklahoma, for us to get the funds that we are entitled to from FEMA, the State of Oklahoma has to accept the policy that we as a State accept the undeniable challenges posed by climate change and then spend our State resources figuring out how to plan for them before becoming eligible for disaster relief. That is impossible.  People can't believe that is true when I tell them this is being done through the administration and this is adopted by these agencies. FEMA is supposed to be there to assist States in areas of the country for disaster relief. But they cannot get it. They are held hostage until they say something that they know is a lie and are held to that and spend State money. Again, that is not really believable, what I just stated, because it is so inconceivable that that could happen.  Now, the reality of this debate, however, is that the climate has been changing since the Earth was formed. I said the other day--a good friend of mine had an amendment on the floor. The amendment made comment to the fact that the climate is changing. Yes, it is changing. I think what the proponents of this idea are trying to do is to try to change it over to say that those people who are not blaming human emissions as the cause of all these problems are denying that climate changes.  I said on floor at that time, all evidence, archeological evidence, scriptural evidence, historical evidence is that climate has always, always changed. We all accept that. The big issue is, is it because of human emissions. That is where the science nowshows clearly that it is not. You are going keep hearing it, though, but it is not.  Further, the scientific debate around the role of climate change, its causes and projected impacts, is ongoing. There is no consensus, and the Wall Street Journal recently produced a great opinion piece that highlights a multitude of discrepancies in the assertion that 90 percent of the scientists believe this to be true. This is kind of interesting because any time you do not have science behind you, what you say is science is settled, science is settled. And sooner or later, people believe it, and they have not offered any evidence that would support that. That is what has happened.  This item really suggests that the Wall Street Journal opinion piece that highlights the discrepancies in the 97 percent, when they say 97 percent of the scientists believe manmade gas is causing global warming--the article points out that the myth of a scientific consensus is predicated on--and I am quoting now--``a handful of surveys and abstract-counting exercises that have been contradicted by more reliable research.''  Over the years, I have quoted a number of scientists. In fact, my Web site way back in the--probably 10 years ago, I started accumulating the number of scientists and their credibility and their qualifications and statements they have made. One I remember, from my head now, is Richard Lindzen. Richard Lindzen is a professor from MIT. He is recognized as one of the top climatologists in the country. When asked the question, he says, of course it is not true. But the reason people, the bureaucracy, are so concerned about it is that regulating carbon is a bureaucracy's dream. If you regulate carbon, you regulate life. That is what the motivation is around this.  I think that is a good article to read so people will realize that there is no consensus, scientific consensus. Some of them believe it, some of them do not.  As climate research continues to develop, limitations in the overall understanding of our climate and the limitations of scientific research have become increasingly evident. This could not be more evident than by the growing discrepancy between climate model predictions and actual observations. For example, alarmists failed to foresee the ongoing warming hiatus.  What is a warming hiatus? There has not been a change in that temperature in the last 15 years. This is something that is incontrovertible. Everybody understands that. They admit they didn't foresee this happening, but that hiatus is actually going on today. It is still continuing. It further explained that the source of such a discrepancy could be caused by the ``combinations of internal climate variability, missing or incorrect radiative forcing, and model response error.''  In other words, climate modeling cannot accurately project, much less predict, the climate of the future as climatologists and the broader scientific community have yet to fully understand how our climate system actually works today.  There is also a growing body of scientific studies suggesting that variations in solar radiation and natural climate variability have a leading role in climate change. Surprise, everybody, the Sun warms us. That is a shocker to a lot of people. It is not manmade gas. It is not CO2 emissions. It is the Sun.  A number of independent studies assessing the impact of clouds have even suggested that water vapor feedback is entirely canceled out by cloud processes. Yet when the facts of reality do not appropriately align with the religion of climate change, the alarmists will simply try to explain these things away or conveniently exclude any science that shows they are wrong.  A favorite talking point of the climate change religion that is often used by senior officials within the Obama administration is that hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods--you name it--are proof of harm being caused by global warming. They all say that. I have yet to hear a speech by any of the alarmists where they do not talk about the fact that all the hurricanes and tornadoes--the nature of them, the severity of them, the occurrences--are proof of harm being caused by global warming. But the global data shows no increase in the number or intensity of such events, and even the IPCC itself acknowledges the lack of any evident relationship between extreme weather and climate.  This is interesting because the IPCC--I know most people are aware of this who are into this issue. But the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change. This is the United Nations. I even wrote a book about it. The longest chapter is talking about the United Nations, how they put this together. But they are the ones who have supposedly the science behind this whole thing, and they are the ones who are now admitting that there is no increase in intensity or occurrences of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods.  In fact, Roger Pielke was before our committee in July of 2013. He said the oft-asserted linkage between global warming and recent hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and drought is ``unsupportable based on evidence and research.''  I am still quoting now.       It is misleading, and just plain incorrect, to claim that      disasters associated with hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or      droughts have increased on climate timescales either in the      United States or globally.  Hurricane landfalls have not increased in the United States ``in frequency, intensity or normalized damage since at least the year 1900.''  That is now an accepted fact. But in spite of that, every speech you hear, they talk about all the hurricanes and all the disasters taking place and the intensity that has come to us because of global warming.  The IPCC--again, this is the U.N. 2013 ``Fifth Assessment Report.'' Now, the assessment report that they come out with is--they will come out with a long, complicated report every so often, but then they will have kind of abbreviated ones for people like us to use to spread their propaganda. Their ``Fifth Assessment Report'' concluded that ``current data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century. . . . No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricane counts have been identified over the last 100 years in the North Atlantic Basin.''  But let's just keep in mind everyone is now in agreement on that. Yet you still hear in the speeches that the world is coming to an end, and all the tornadoes--all this intensity is going to be disastrous to America.  Counter to the doomsday predictions of climate alarmists, increasing observations suggest a much reduced and practically harmless climate response to increased amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Also missing from the climate alarmists' doomsday scenarios and well-scripted talking points are the benefits from increased carbon that has led to a greening of the planet and contributed to increased agricultural productivity.  People do not realize that you cannot grow things without CO2. CO2 is a fertilizer. It is something you cannot do without. No one ever talks about the benefits. The people are inducing that as a fertilizer on a daily basis.  Despite admitted gaps to the scientific understanding of climate change and a track record of climate modeling failures, President Obama and his environmental allies are holding fast to their bedrock beliefs. They are intent on selling the President's so-called Climate Action Plan to the American people that is less about protecting the environment and more about expanding the role of the government while enriching, I should say, some campaigns of some of our friendly Democrats. There is a guy named Tom Styer. Tom Styer lives in California. He is very, very wealthy. He is all wrapped up in this issue. He claims that he spent in the last election to elect people who go along with global warming $75 million of his money. Originally, he was going to spend $100 million, $50 million of his money and $50 million that he was going to raise. He found out he couldn't raise it, so that did not work.  I would say that his effort was not all that successful, judging from the results of the last election. But he is still out there. He still has a lot of money. He will not even miss the $75 million.  For the President's core domestic plan policy, the Clean Power Plan, let's look at what this is. Starting back in 2002, when it was perceived to be a verypopular issue, Members of this Senate started introducing bills that would be cap-and-trade bills that would address this issue. It is very similar to the plan the President is putting out now. At that time, I was the chairman of the committee--I think it was the Subcommittee on Clean Air in the Senate. I was a believer because everybody said that was true, until they came out--and there is a study made by the Charles River Associates and MIT that said if we comply with the cap and trade, the cost to the American people would be in the range of $300 billion to $400 billion every year. That, again, would be the largest tax increase in history. I thought, if the world is coming to an end, maybe we need to do that.  I started questioning the science behind it. I started getting responses from scientists all over America. First of all, 10 of them came in. Then it went up to 400 and then 1,000. I started publishing these on my Web site so people would know that there is another side to what they were calling this determined science by IPCC. They tried from that time--this is 2002--until last year to pass legislation that would legislatively give us a cap-and-trade system, but it got defeated more and more each year because the people have actually caught on. They have caught on that it is not a real thing, the science is not settled. That has led the President to say, all right, if you guys are not going to pass legislation, I am going to do it through regulation.  Where have we heard that before? That is everything the President has been doing that he can't get through in his policy that is through the legislature. Right now, you probably cannot get 20 votes in the whole Senate on this issue. He is trying to do it through regulation. We have a Clean Power Plan.  We had a hearing on this just last week. The President is no longer satisfied with the fact that he can now tell you what doctor you can use under ObamaCare, what type of investments you can use under that regulation or how fast your Internet will be. I understand that is coming up next. He would like to dictate what type and how much energy you can use.  With such high costs on the line, one would think there must be an equal amount if not greater number of benefits. What are the benefits? In reality, according to various impact assessments, the environmental benefits of the Clean Power Plan--again, admittedly, it is going to be $479 billion initially, the cost of this, and the core domestic policy of the President's Climate Action Plan that is supposed to protect this country from the impending impacts we are facing, the climate change--all of these costs will reduce CO2 concentrations by less than 0.5 percent. The global average temperature rise will be reduced by only 0.01 degree Fahrenheit, and sea level rise will be reduced by 0.3 millimeters. That is the thickness of three sheets of paper.  Further, these minuscule benefits would be rendered pointless by the continued emissions growth in India and China. The chart is up now. It is very significant.  Because we look at this and look at what China and India are contributing to the atmosphere by their emissions. Now, there is the United States. In fact, the figure is that China alone produces more CO2 in 1 month--that is 800 million tons--than the Clean Power Plan will reduce in 1 year, and that is 500 million tons.  Perhaps what is most telling is that President Obama's EPA didn't even bother to measure what impacts the proposed Clean Power Plan would have on the environment. This is something which has been very well documented.  I guess what we are saying here is that it doesn't really matter what we are doing here in the United States. This is not where the problem is. But that is to be expected under the religion of climate change. When the science doesn't add up and the projections don't pan out and the weather won't cooperate, alarmists will refer to their commitment to a higher moral authority or obligation. As evidenced by the Clean Power Plan, it doesn't matter if these policies provide any benefit in climate change; crusaders certainly will not be dissuaded by the exorbitant costs.  It is ironic, however, that while touting a commitment to a moral obligation, which we have heard time and again from this administration, the resulting policies will cause real economic hardship to this country and to the most vulnerable populations. This is something people need to pay attention to. The increase in the cost of fuel for Americans would be--and it has already been documented--the electricity cost will go up by double digits in 43 States. And whom does it hurt the most? It hurts the poor people. Those individuals who spend the highest amount of their expendable income on heating their homes will be hit the worst. This hypocrisy is kind of akin to jetting around the country in a 232-foot private plane on Earth Day to warn global citizens of the harm caused by increased CO2 emissions in the atmosphere.  The President's international discussions around climate change stand to be equally harmful to the American people. The President likes to point to his recent agreement with China as evidence of international cooperation on climate change, but this agreement is nothing more than an exercise in theatrics.  China is sitting back right now licking its chops and hoping America will start reducing its emissions and drive its manufacturing base overseas to places where they don't have these emission restrictions. The farce of an agreement lets China continue business as usual, and that is 800 million tons of CO2 a month until 2030. Boy, that is until 2030, while hard-working American taxpayers are going to foot the cost of the President's economically disastrous climate agenda.  Despite what the President might say to the international community, without the backing of the U.S. Congress, which the President does not have, he has no authority to reach binding or legally enforceable agreements with other countries. I will remind the President of this again in December.  Some people don't know that the United Nations has a big party every year in December, and it has been going on now for 15 years. Every year, they invite all the countries--this is all through the United Nations--from all around the world, some 192 countries, to this big party. I am talking about caviar and all you can drink and all that. All they have to do is say they will agree to try to lower their emissions of CO2.  I remember the party in Copenhagen 2 years ago. As I recall, Obama was there, Kerry was there, Pelosi was there, and Boxer was there. All the far-left liberals were there to try to convince the people from these other countries that we were going to pass a cap-and-trade bill, so they better do it too.  Well, I waited until they were all through with their things, and I went over to Copenhagen. I tell the Chair, I was the one-man truth squad. I went over to explain the truth to the other 191 countries. I told them that these people are lying to them by saying we will pass legislation. I said we are not going to pass legislation, and of course we did not pass legislation.  I have to say this. The 191 countries over there all had one thing in common: They all hated me, but they all understood that I was right and that there weren't the votes in this country to pass it.  The American people are starting to catch on, and that is why I am not surprised, as I mentioned, that the Gallup Poll that was released just last March concluded that the current level of worry on environmental issues remains at or near record lows, and among those concerns on the environmental issue, global warming is second to last. What Americans do care about is the economy and Federal spending and the size and power of the Federal Government.  The disintegrating case for climate alarm coupled with an American public that is quickly losing interest does not pan well for the President's climate agenda or his self-acclaimed environmental legacy. Climate alarmists have spent just as much energy, if not more, convincing the world that it is bad to be a skeptic of what was once referred to as global cooling and then became global warming and is now global climate change. The tenet of the modern climate change religion cannot withstand the scrutiny of the merits, primarily because it is a result of political design and not scientific revelation. And that is why anyone who iswilling to point out discrepancies within the climate change debate or raise legitimate concerns will be subjected to a barrage of arrogant sarcasm and personal attacks.  Whether the alarmists call it global warming or climate change, the American people understand that the President's climate agenda is not about protecting the public; it is about a power grab.  I will make three final points.  First of all, I think we all know that the climate is always changing. I remember--and I will go from memory on this. We have cycles, and the cycles have been taking place all throughout history. In 1895, we went into a period of cooling, and that was when they first started saying that another ice age was coming, and that lasted 30 years, until about 1918. In 1918, a change came about. It started getting warmer, and we went into a 30-year warming period. It was the first time the phrase ``global warming'' was used. In 1945, that changed, and we went into a cooling spell, and the same thing has happened since then. Right now, of course, we are in kind of a remission era.  This is what is interesting: No one can deny that 1945 was the year when we had the largest surge in the emissions of CO2 in the history of this country, and that precipitated not a warming period but a cooling period. That is first.  The second thing is, in Australia--I wasn't going to mention this until I talked yesterday to one of the members of Parliament in Australia. Several years ago, Australia bought into this argument and said: We are going to lead the way, and we will start restricting our emissions.  They imposed a carbon tax on their economy a few years ago, and it cost $9 billion in lost economic activity each year and destroyed tens of thousands of jobs. It was so bad that the government recently voted to repeal the carbon tax, and their economy is better for it. In fact, it was announced just following the repeal that Australia experienced a record job growth of 121,000 jobs--far more than the 10,000 to 15,000 jobs economists had expected.  There is a country that tried it, and they found out what it cost, and you would think we could learn from their mistakes.  The third thing is to ask the question. What if I am wrong and they are right? There is an answer to that. I remember when President Obama was first elected. He appointed Lisa Jackson, and she became the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency. During the time she was there, they were building this thing up, and we were holding hearings in the committee I chaired at that time.  I asked her: In the event that one of these bills passes on cap and trade or the President comes up with some kind of proposal or a regulation that does the same thing, will that have the effect of lowering CO2 emissions worldwide?  Her answer: No, it wouldn't.  And the reason it wouldn't is because this is where the problem is. The problem is in China, Mexico, and India. So the mere fact that we do something just in our country has a reverse effect because as we chase away our manufacturing base and it goes to one of those countries--and China is hoping to be one of those countries--where they have no emission requirements, it would have the effect of not decreasing but increasing emissions.  If you bought into this and you agree that I am wrong and they are right, just keep in mind that by their own emission this would not reduce CO2, and that is what we are supposed to be concerned with.  The people of America have awakened. The economy and the Obama foreign policy of appeasement have captured their interest, and these are concerns that are real concerns and things we ought to do today.  With that, I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 23, 2015]                      The Climate-Change Religion                            (By Lamar Smith)       Earth Day provided a fresh opening for Obama to raise      alarms about global warming based on beliefs, not science.       ``Today, our planet faces new challenges, but none pose a      greater threat to future generations than climate change,''      President Obama wrote in his proclamation for Earth Day on      Wednesday. ``As a Nation, we must act before it is too      late.''       Secretary of State John Kerry, in an Earth Day op-ed for      USA Today, declared that climate change has put America ``on      a dangerous path--along with the rest of the world.''       Both the president and Mr. Kerry cited rapidly warming      global temperatures and ever-more-severe storms caused by      climate change as reasons for urgent action.       Given that for the past decade and a half global-     temperature increases have been negligible, and that the      worsening-storms scenario has been widely debunked, the      pronouncements from the Obama administration sound more like      scare tactics than fact-based declarations.       At least the United Nations' then-top climate scientist,      Rajendra Pachauri, acknowledged--however inadvertently--the      faith-based nature of climate-change rhetoric when he      resigned amid scandal in February. In a farewell letter, he      said that ``the protection of Planet Earth, the survival of      all species and sustainability of our ecosystems is more than      a mission. It is my religion and my dharma.''       Instead of letting political ideology or climate      ``religion'' guide government policy, we should focus on good      science. The facts alone should determine what climate policy      options the U.S. considers. That is what the scientific      method calls for: inquiry based on measurable evidence.      Unfortunately this administration's climate plans ignore good      science and seek only to advance a political agenda.       Climate reports from the U.N.--which the Obama      administration consistently embraces--are designed to provide      scientific cover for a preordained policy. This is not good      science. Christiana Figueres, the official leading the U.N.'s      effort to forge a new international climate treaty later this      year in Paris, told reporters in February that the real goal      is ``to change the economic development model that has been      reigning for at least 150 years.'' In other words, a central      objective of these negotiations is the redistribution of      wealth among nations. It is apparent that President Obama      shares this vision.       The Obama administration recently submitted its pledge to      the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.      The commitment would lock the U.S. into reducing greenhouse-     gas emissions more than 25% by 2025 and ``economy-wide      emission reductions of 80% or more by 2050.'' The president's      pledge lacks details about how to achieve such goals without      burdening the economy, and it doesn't quantify the specific      climate benefits tied to his pledge.       America will never meet the president's arbitrary targets      without the country being subjected to costly regulations,      energy rationing and reduced economic growth. These policies      won't make America stronger. And these measures will have no      significant impact on global temperatures. In a hearing last      week before the House Science, Space and Technology      Committee, of which I am chairman, climate scientist Judith      Curry testified that the president's U.N pledge is estimated      to prevent only a 0.03 Celsius temperature rise. That is      three-hundredths of one degree.       In June 2014 testimony before my committee, former      Assistant Secretary for Energy Charles McConnell noted that      the president's Clean Power Plan--requiring every state to      meet federal carbon-emission-reduction targets--would reduce      a sea-level increase by less than half the thickness of a      dime. Policies like these will only make the government      bigger and Americans poorer, with no environmental benefit.       The White House's Climate Assessment implies that extreme      weather is getting worse due to human-caused climate change.      The president regularly makes this unsubstantiated claim--     most recently in his Earth Day proclamation, citing ``more      severe weather disasters.''       Even the U.N. doesn't agree with him on that one: In its      2012 Special Report on Extreme Events, the U.N.'s      Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says there is      ``high agreement'' among leading experts that long-term      trends in weather disasters are not attributable to human-     caused climate change. Why do the president and others in his      administration keep repeating this untrue claim?       Climate alarmists have failed to explain the lack of global      warming over the past 15 years. They simply keep adjusting      their malfunctioning climate models to push the supposedly      looming disaster further into the future. Following the      U.N.'s 2008 report, its claims about the melting of Himalayan      glaciers, the decline of crop yields and the effects of sea-     level rise were found to be invalid. The InterAcademy      Council, a multinational scientific organization, reviewed      the report in 2010 and identified ``significant shortcomings      in each major step of [the U.N.] assessment process.''       The U.N. process is designed to generate alarmist results.      Many people don't realize that the most-publicized documents      of the U.N. reports are not written by scientists. In fact,      the scientists who work on the underlying science are forced      to step aside to allow partisan political representatives to      develop the ``Summary for Policy Makers.'' It is scrubbed to      minimize any suggestion of scientific uncertainty and is      publicized before the actual science is released. The Summary      for Policy Makers is designed to give     newspapers and headline writers around the world only one      side of the debate.       Yet those who raise valid questions about the very real      uncertainties surrounding the understanding of climate change      have their motives attacked, reputations savaged and      livelihoods threatened. This happens even though challenging      prevailing beliefs through open debate and critical thinking      is fundamental to the scientific process.       The intellectual dishonesty of senior administration      officials who are unwilling to admit when they are wrong is      astounding. When assessing climate change, we should focus on      good science, not politically correct science.
