  I remind our colleagues that we will be considering the intelligence reform bill beginning Monday of next week. This will be one of the most important issues before the Senate during this entire Congress. We want all Senators to plan accordingly. We will have more to say about next week's schedule during tomorrow's session.                          ____________________
