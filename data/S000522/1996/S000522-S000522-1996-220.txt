Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, on October 23, 1956, students in Hungary protested against the Russian and Marxist-Leninist classes which had been imposed by the Soviet Union. The Hungarian Revolution had begun. Students and the Writers' Union then publicly supported the Polish anti-Soviet movement, and workers joined them in calling to reinstate as Premier the Communist Party reformer Imre Nagy. Within days, despite hard-liner Premier Hegedus' plea to the Soviet Union for assistance, the Communist Party reinstated Nagy and his reform efforts were allowed to resume. The Hungarian people wanted more, and pushed for an end to the dominance of the Communist system itself. With Soviet troops and tanks entering Budapest, a new government was formed as fighting spread across the country. Revolutionary workers' councils and local national committees demanded attention be given to political and economic demands, including calls for free elections, free speech, press, assembly, and worship.  Imre Nagy, siding with the people, announced the end of the one-party system, and called for free elections. He even criticized the Warsaw Pact and indicated his intention to make Hungary a neutral state. The Soviet Union quickly reacted to this secession with a crushing military advance on strategic locations throughout Hungary in mid-November. Imre Nagy was ousted from office. For his loyalty to his people and to their revolution, he was executed by the Soviets in 1958.  Mr. Speaker, despite courageous efforts, the revolutionaries were ruthlessly and bloodily suppressed while a sympathetic but ineffective international community stood by. In the end thousands were killed in the fighting, and hundreds of thousands fled the country to avoid imprisonment and repression after the revolution. Many settled in the United States.  The 40th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution is an appropriate time to reflect upon the historical contribution made by those who valiantly fought for freedom. Although the revolution did not succeed in freeing the Hungarian people, its influence on Hungarian life has been strong. To Hungarians, East and Central Europeans, and the rest of the world, the Revolution served as a reminder that the Soviet Communist bloc was an artificial edifice which would crumble without the support of Soviet military strength.  Hungary and Poland led the way in 1989 to cast off Communist rule, and Hungary remains in the forefront of those East European nations working to consolidate democracy and build market economies. In 1990, Hungary was the first East European country to become a member of the Council of Europe, reflecting Hungary's advances in human rights. Indicative of the country's progress in establishing a democracy, Hungary is currently among the first-tier countries to be considered for membership in an expanded NATO.  In fact, acknowledging the need for security and cooperation with their European neighbors, the Hungarian Government--led by Gyula Horn--made a significant step toward historic reconciliation with Romania by signing a bilateral treaty just a few weeks ago. Hopefully this treaty will be a useful mechanism for handling future concerns peacefully and in a constructive manner. In its ongoing transition, Hungary continues to face the complex tasks of sustaining newly-developed democratic institutions, furthering the growth of civil society, and managing the hardships associated with privatization and economic reforms following decades of Soviet domination and centralization.  Hungary's commitment to a free and democratic system are deeply rooted in the legacy of those who valiantly fought in 1956. With history as a measure, Hungary has great staying power. This year, Hungary commemorates not only the 40th anniversary of the 1956 Revolution, but also the 1100th anniversary of Hungary as a nation. Mr. Speaker, in this 40th anniversary year we honor Hungary's legacy of a love for freedom.                          ____________________
