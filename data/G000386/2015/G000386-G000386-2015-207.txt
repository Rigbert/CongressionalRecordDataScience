 President, I rise today to introduce an important piece of regulatory reform legislation.  A study released this past fall by the National Association of Manufacturers estimates that U.S. Federal Government regulations imposed over $2 trillion in compliance costs on American businesses in 2012. This is an amount equal to 12 percent of our Nation's GDP.  The study also demonstrated--and this should come as no surprise--that the cost of complying with all those regulations falls disproportionately on small businesses. Small manufacturing firms, in particular, grapple with regulatory compliance costs that are more than three times those felt by the average company in the United States.  It is no wonder why many American businesses are shuttering or moving their entire operation overseas. And how many folks dreamed of starting a small business but ultimately decided against taking the risk because of the overwhelming burden and uncertainty of our regulatory state?  We have to do better.  Small businesses are fed up with excessive Federal regulation, and they are making sure we know about it. A November 2014 survey conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business asked small business owners across the country to rank the ten most pressing problems they face. Overwhelmingly, the top two answers from small business owners were taxes and complying with government red tape. I am happy to say that this Congress intends to confront these issues head-on.  The Federal Government needs to do everything possible to promote an environment that will allow private sector employers to create jobs. To accomplish that, common sense would tell us that the government needs to remove barriers to job creation rather than put up new ones.  Unfortunately, the Obama administration has proven time and again that it would rather push forward with its interest-driven regulatory agenda than ease the heavy burden upon our economy and our entrepreneurs.  To make matters worse, this administration is pursuing new regulations through litigation tactics that take an end-run around the laws enacted by Congress to ensure transparency and accountability in the regulatory process. This strategy has come to be known as sue-and-settle, and regulators have been using it to speed up rulemaking and to keep the public, industries, and even the States away from the table when regulatory decisions are negotiated behind closed doors.  Sue-and-settle cases typically follow a similar pattern. First, an interest group files a lawsuit against a Federal agency, claiming that the agency has failed to take a certain regulatory action by a statutory deadline. Through the complaint, the interest group seeks to compel the agency to take action by a new, often-rushed deadline. The plaintiff-interest group frequently will be one that shares a common regulatory and policy agenda with the agency that it sues, such as when an environmental group sues the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Next, the agency and interest group enter into friendly negotiations to produce either a settlement agreement or consent decree behind closed doors that commits the agency to satisfying the interest group's demands. The agreement is then entered by a court, binding executive discretion to undertake a regulatory action. And noticeably absent from these negotiations are the very parties who will likely be most impacted by the new regulation.  Sue-and-settle tactics by advocacy groups and complicit government agencies have severe consequences on transparency, public accountability, and ultimately on the quality of the resulting public policy.  Such tactics undermine congressional intent by shutting out affected parties, such as industries and even the States that are charged with implementing new regulations.  The Administrative Procedure Act, APA, which has been characterized as the citizens' ``regulatory bill of rights,'' was enacted to ensure transparency and public accountability in our Federal rulemaking process. A central aspect of the APA is the notice-and-comment process, which requires agencies to notify the public of proposed regulations and to respond to comments submitted by interested parties.  Rulemaking driven by sue-and-settle tactics, however, frequently results in reprioritized agency agendas and truncated deadlines for regulatory action. This renders the notice-and-comment requirements of the APA a mere formality, depriving regulated entities, the States and the public of sufficient time to have any meaningful input on the final rules. The resulting regulatory action is driven not by the public interest, but by special interest priorities, and often comes as a complete surprise to those most affected by it.  Sue-and-settle litigation also helps agencies avoid accountability. Instead of having to answer to the public for controversial regulations and policy decisions, agency officials are able to simply point to a court order entering the agreement and maintain that they were required to take action under its terms.  Further, the abuse of consent decrees as a method for taking regulatory action can have lasting negative impact on the ability of future administrations to adapt the Federal regulatory scheme to changing circumstances. Not only does this raise serious concerns about bad public policy; it also puts into question the constitutional impact of one administration's actions binding the hands of its successors.  Sue-and-settle, and the consequences that come with such tactics, is not a new phenomenon. Evidence of sue-and-settle tactics and closed-door rulemaking can be found in nearly every administration over the previous few decades.  But there has been an alarming increase in sue-and-settle tactics under the Obama administration. A study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce shows that just during President Obama's first term, 60 Clean Air Act lawsuits against the EPA were resolved through consent decrees or settlement agreements, an increase from 28 during President George W. Bush's second term.  Since 2009, sue-and-settle cases against the EPA have imposed at least $13 billion in annual regulatory costs.  In November 2010, environmental advocacy groups filed a complaint against the EPA under the Clean Water Act to compel the agency to revise wastewater regulations. Interestingly, the same day that the complaint was filed, the plaintiff-advocacy groups filed a proposed consent decree already signed by the EPA and requiring prompt regulatory action. As is characteristic of sue-and-settle cases, potentially affected parties were kept out of the lawsuit and negotiations. Such a scenario should raise serious concerns over how truly adversarial these lawsuits really are.  In another case, environmental advocacy groups filed suit against the EPA to compel the agency to issue new air quality standards for pollutants from coal and oil-fired power plants. The plaintiff-advocacy groups alleged that the EPA had violated its statutory duty to issue new standards.  An industry group intervened in the case to represent utility companies but was ultimately left out of subsequent negotiations between the plaintiffs and the EPA, which resulted in a consent decree. The industry group challenged the consent decree on numerous grounds, including the rulemaking timeframe established under the decreewhich was arguably too short to allow the public to participate fully in the rulemaking process.  Nevertheless, the court approved and entered the consent decree, with the judge concluding that ``[s]hould haste make waste, the resulting regulations will be subject to successful challenge. . . If EPA needs more time to get it right, it can seek more time.''  The resulting rule, despite its opaque promulgation, was estimated by the EPA to cost $9.6 billion annually by 2015. And according to estimates by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the rule promulgated under the consent decree would contribute to a loss of 1.44 million jobs in the U.S. between 2013 and 2020.  The EPA could have done things right the first time by crafting a sensible, workable rule that protects the environment without causing unnecessary job losses or higher electricity prices for hard-working American families. But as a result of backroom, sue-and-settle tactics, we were left with a controversial regulation that fails to properly take into account the impact on affected parties and that remains the subject of litigation to this day.  The EPA, it seems, has turned a blind eye to the calls for more transparency and public accountability in our Federal rulemaking process. In February 2014, EPA's General Counsel issued a statement declaring:       The sue and settle rhetoric, strategically mislabeled by      its proponents, is an often-repeated but a wholly invented      accusation that gets no more true with frequent retelling.  I think many would take issue with that assessment. In fact, the Environmental Council of the States, or ECOS--a national non-profit, non-partisan association made up of State and territorial environmental agency leaders--adopted a resolution entitled ``The Need for Reform and State Participation in EPA's Consent Decrees which Settle Citizen Suits,'' stating, among other things:       [S]tate environmental agencies are not always notified of      citizen suits that allege U.S. EPA's failure to perform its      nondiscretionary duties, are often not parties to these      citizen suits, and are usually not provided with an      opportunity to participate in the negotiation of agreements      to settle citizen suits[.]  ECOS further resolved that:       [G]reater transparency of citizen suit settlement      agreements is needed for the public to understand the impact      of these agreements on the administration of environmental      programs[.]  I agree.  Clearly, the EPA has no intention of acknowledging the use or consequences of sue-and-settle tactics. And unfortunately, I think this sentiment is shared by other executive branch agencies today.  That is why today I am introducing the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015. Senators Blunt, Hatch, Cruz, Paul, Cornyn, Rubio, Inhofe, Fischer, Flake, Lee, Capito and Gardner are cosponsors of this important bill, and I thank them for their support.  In the House, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia is introducing a companion bill.  By enacting reasonable, pro-accountability measures, the Sunshine bill aims to address many of the problems I have outlined so far.  This bill provides for greater transparency by shedding light on sue-and-settle tactics. It requires agencies to publish sue-and-settle complaints and notices of intent-to-sue in a readily accessible manner.  The bill requires agencies to publish proposed consent decrees and settlement agreements at least 60 days before they can be filed with a court. This provides a valuable opportunity for affected parties to weigh-in, which will increase public accountability in the rulemaking process. It will also prevent those scenarios where lawsuits are filed on the same day as previously negotiated agreements, a practice that effectively blocks any meaningful participation by affected parties.  The bill also makes it easier for affected parties such as States and business owners to take part in both the lawsuit and settlement negotiations to ensure that their interests are properly represented. It requires the Attorney General or, if appropriate, the head of the defendant-agency, to certify to the court that he or she has personally approved certain proposed consent decrees or settlement agreements that, for example, convert a discretionary authority of an agency into a non-discretionary duty to act. It requires that courts consider whether the terms of a proposed agreement are contrary to the public interest.  The bill promotes greater transparency by requiring agencies to publicly post and report to Congress information on sue-and-settle complaints, consent decrees and settlement agreements.  Finally, the bill resolves key constitutional concerns by making it easier for succeeding administrations to modify the effect of a prior administration's consent decrees. It does so by providing for de novo review of motions to modify existing consent decrees due to changed circumstances.  The Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act will shed light on the problem. It will help rein in backroom rulemaking, encourage the appropriate use of consent decrees and settlements, and reinforce the procedures laid out decades ago to ensure a transparent and accountable regulatory process.  I urge my colleagues to work with me and support this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 378       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(f) Review by Court.--       (1) Amicus.--A court considering a proposed covered consent      decree or settlement agreement shall presume, subject to      rebuttal, that it is proper to allow amicus participation      relating to the covered consent decree or settlement      agreement by any person who filed public comments or      participated in a public hearing on the covered consent      decree or settlement agreement under paragraph (2) or (3) of      subsection (d).       (2) Review of deadlines.--       (A) Proposed covered consent decrees.--For a proposed      covered consent decree, a court shall not approve the covered      consent decree unless the proposed covered consent decree      allows sufficient time and incorporates adequate procedures      for the agency to comply with chapter 5 of title 5, United      States Code, and other applicable statutes that govern      rulemaking and, unless contrary to the public interest, the      provisions of any Executive order that governs rulemaking.       (B) Proposed covered settlement agreements.--For a proposed      covered settlement agreement, a court shall ensure that the      covered settlement agreement allows sufficient time and      incorporates adequate procedures for the agency to comply      with chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, and other      applicable statutes that govern rulemaking and, unless      contrary to the public interest, the provisions of any      Executive order that governs rulemaking.

SEC. 4. MOTIONS TO MODIFY CONSENT DECREES.       If an agency moves a court to modify a covered consent      decree or settlement agreement and the basis of the motion is      that the terms of the covered consent decree or settlement      agreement are no longer fully in the public interest due to      the obligations of the agency to fulfill other duties or due      to changed facts and circumstances, the court shall review      the motion and the covered consent decree or settlement      agreement de novo.     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act shall apply to--       (1) any covered civil action filed on or after the date of      enactment of this Act; and       (2) any covered consent decree or settlement agreement      proposed to a court on or after the date of enactment of this      Act.                                 ______                                       By
