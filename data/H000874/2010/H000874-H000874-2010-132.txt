CANTOR. That is correct, I would say to the gentleman. I am referring to that.  And so while we are on that subject, we know very well there has been no indication whatsoever that the ability for entrepreneurs to continue to experience an atmosphere that is conducive to their investment and assumption of risk will continue, because we are facing the largest tax hike in American history at the end of this year and the majority has been unwilling to say that is not coming. That is hanging over this economy as a veil of uncertainty.  And I would say to the gentleman, if he is so excited about the positive results that he indicates, largely due to the fiscal policies in place that will be not in place after the end of this year, I would say that maybe we should consider extending the rate cuts and cap gains and dividends and marginal rate reductions that are in place now.  I would also say to the gentleman, listen, we have been now for weeks and months through this: Your fault, our fault. Your fault, our fault. The public and the American people are upset. They don't want blame games anymore; they want to stop the spending. And just next week, the gentleman is talking again about bringing more spending. He indicates that all economists supported the stimulus bill. He knows that is not true. But, like a good lawyer, he is going to present his case. But what I would say to the gentleman, let's stop the spending now.  That is why we have started and launched the You Cut program. And, if he alleges incremental modest steps, fine. Join us in that. But let's stop the spending, Mr. Speaker.
