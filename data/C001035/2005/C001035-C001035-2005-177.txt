President, last week we saw the terrorist attack on an ally. Our country faces very important homeland security challenges. We have been in the midst of debating important public policy issues--how best to secure mass transit or to prepare our first responders. I cannot believe the Senate has diverted from that important debate--a debate important to Americans all across this country--and instead of finishing up the Homeland Security bill, we have diverted to debate these issues.  We should not be doing this. This is exactly why the American public holds Congress in such low esteem right now.  We should be focusing on the national security and homeland security challenges facing this Nation. We should not be engaging in this debate. I, for one, am going to vote no on both of the amendments.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Minnesota.
