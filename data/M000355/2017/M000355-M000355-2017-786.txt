 President, it is with deep regret that I announce to the Senate the passing of our dear friend and colleague Senator Pete Domenici.  Pete had a long and notable career, one that took him from pitching on the baseball diamond to teaching mathematics at an Albuquerque junior high school, from city politics to the U.S. Senate.  In fact, when he ran for the Senate in 1972, Domenici became the first Republican elected from his home State in nearly four decades. By the time he retired, he did so as the longest serving Senator in New Mexico history. Like others in this Chamber, I served for a number of years with Senator Domenici. I came to know him as smart, hard-working, dedicated and as a very strong advocate for his home State of New Mexico.  We are all saddened by this news today. The Senate offers its condolences to Senator Domenici's family and especially his wife Nancy.
