I hope that is the case. And I would hope that we did not have that. We talked about--I have talked about and you have talked about--just now, bipartisanship. I would hope that we would pass a budget that then the Appropriations Committee and other committees would be able to work on so that we could have a bipartisan product, as opposed to another confrontation that would go way past October 1 of this year, and we would be back in the position of having to have a continuing resolution on which there would be a confrontation and the threat of shutting down government.                              {time}  1230  Obviously, to the extent that we can, as I suggested with respect to the Consumer Financial Protection Board, to the extent that we can have bipartisan agreement--the gentleman that was just with me was Senator McConnell.  Noting the passage of the sustainable growth rate bill which dealt with community health centers and dealt with the children's health insurance program, Senator McConnell said: The American people expect us to do work.  He used the SGR example as a way that we did work in a constructive, bipartisan fashion, making compromises on both sides of the aisle, with Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi representing the two parties, came together and worked, and my staff and I think your staff participated as well, and we came to an agreement.  I would hope that we would be able to do that with respect to the budget and appropriation process. Obviously, the budget was not that way. All Democrats voted against the budget. We don't like the sequester. We think the sequester undermines the national security and undermines the investments that America needs to make in its infrastructure and its education, its health care, its environment, its basic research, and other items that are of critical importance if we are going to grow the economy and create jobs.  I would hope that we could on these issues--while I understand the gentleman is saying that we will be noticed of it, but I would hope we could have some discussions about it so that we could come to, frankly, as we did with SGR, an agreement.  That agreement, as you know, passed with 392 votes. You worked hard on it;I worked hard on it; the Speaker worked hard on it; Leader Pelosi worked hard on it--392 votes in this House. That was one of the best days we had this year. As a matter of fact, it might have been the best day we had this year.  The items that I raised are of, obviously, great concern. Hopefully, we could have discussions about that before being simply informed that those would be in reconciliation instructions.  Let me go, if I can now, the gentleman made a very eloquent statement yesterday. That statement was on the 150th anniversary of the assassination of one of the greatest Americans in history; that, of course, was Abraham Lincoln.  Abraham Lincoln helped cure one of the blackest blots on America's reputation and America's moral commitment by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation. However, Mr. Leader, as you know, subsequent to the adoption of the 13th Amendment, which the gentleman also referenced, we had vicious segregation. We had policies put in place that prevented African Americans from registering, much less voting.  The gentlemen and I have had the opportunity to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge together where Alabama State troopers were sent by Governor Wallace to stop people from simply going to register to vote.  Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Conyers and our friend John Lewis, one of the great heroes of the American civil rights movement, have cosponsored a bill--Jim Sensenbrenner being the former Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, John Conyers being the ranking Democrat--have sponsored a bipartisan bill which would return the protections that were undermined by the Supreme Court decision in the Shelby County v. Holder case.  I believe it is important--and I think the gentlemen share this view--that we absolutely protect the rights of every American to register and to vote and to ensure that the policies adopted by any State or any county or any municipality are not such that it undermines the ability of citizens to register and to vote. This is bipartisan legislation.  I would ask the majority leader respectfully, and one of the great attributes to Abraham Lincoln who talked about a nation divided against itself, talked about a nation who did not give equality to all of its citizens, talked about a nation that needed to respect the inclusion of all people irrespective of their race, I would ask respectfully that the legislation cosponsored by Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Conyers and John Lewis be brought to this floor so that we can, in fact, ensure that every American--every American--has the right to register, to vote, and is protected by their Federal Government from the discrimination and exclusion that we know historically has happened too often.  I urge my friend, the majority leader, to bring that bill, that bipartisan bill, to the floor for debate, open to amendment and discussion and a vote.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I thank him for his comments regarding Abraham Lincoln as well.  Yesterday was the 150th anniversary of his passing. It was also a significant day yesterday, as well, of the Jackie Robinson anniversary of breaking the color barrier in baseball.  As the gentleman knows, as we have walked across that bridge many times with our good friend John Lewis, the difference that it has made in those last years from when he first was beaten across that bridge and how far this country has come, and this country can go much further.  The bill is before the committee. It is not scheduled for the floor next week. We will watch as the committee continues to work. The gentleman and I can continue to work on the issue to make sure we get this done.
