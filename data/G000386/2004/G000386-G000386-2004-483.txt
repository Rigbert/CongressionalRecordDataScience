 The provision has been attacked as a ``gimmick.'' It has been attacked as ``funny money.'' The provision is fairly straight forward. It increases the payment of the third quarter corporate estimated tax deposits by 119% for 2009. This measure has the effect of shifting $11.4 billion from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010. It makes sure the bill will be offset for the five- and six-year periods.  Let the record reflect, Mr. President, that this technique and variations on it have been used frequently over the past decade. Most of the time these things were done without complaints from either side. Sometimes complaints were raised by those opposed to a particular bill on other substantive grounds.  Let's look at the history of enacted tax laws that contained these shifts.  In 1994, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, that is, the landmark general agreement on tariffs and trade legislation contained several changes in payment dates for excise taxes. Check it out in section 712 of Public Law 103-415 of December 8, 1994. That legislation was overwhelmingly supported by both sides of the aisle.  In 1997, the Tax Relief Act of 1997 contained a change in the percentage for the ``safe harbor'' for payment of individual estimated taxes for 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. Check it out in section 1091 of Public Law 105-34 of August 5, 1997.  In 1998, the Trade and Tax Relief Extension Act of 1998 contained a change for the safe harbor for payment of individual estimated taxes. Check it out in section 2003 of Public Law 105-277 of October 21, 1998.  In 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, contained the much-criticized shift in corporate estimated tax payments. Check it out in section 801 of Public Law 107-16 of June 7, 2001.  In 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 also contained the much-criticized shift in corporate estimated tax payments. Check it out in section 501 of Public Law 108-27 of May 28, 2003.  All of the laws mentioned above are major pieces of legislation. They were all bipartisan measures. All of them contained shifts in dates of payment of excise taxes, corporate taxes, or individual income taxes. Members should also be aware that these devices or similar devices were used in partisan bills by each side that did not become law. For example, the patients bill of rights legislation considered in the summer of 2001, contained a one day shift in Medicare provider payments. Some of the harshest critics of the corporate estimated tax shift were lead sponsors of that legislation.  Now, even though the corporate shift in this bill is a conventional practice, Senator Baucus and I agreed to delete it before this bill left the Senate floor. Our agreement is with Senators Nickles and Conrad. We will attempt to carry out our agreement but are subject to the cooperation of our colleagues.  Part of the legislative process is compliance with our budget rules. The Finance Committee offset its title over the five, six, and ten year period of the bill. Contrary to the critics' assertions, the corporate shift moved real money, corporate tax receipts, from one period to the other. I ask unanimous consent that a revenue table, prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation, on the Finance Committee financing title, be inserted in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.001[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.002[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.003[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.004[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.005[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.006[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS12FE04.007
