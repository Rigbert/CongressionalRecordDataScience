 Not only is everything that you are saying true in my opinion, but on top of that, we are spending tens and tens of billions of dollars to defend Asis against whom I am not exactly sure.  Some years ago we were told that it was necessary to spend huge amounts of money defending freedom against the Communist Chinese dictatorship. Well, surprise, surprise. The last I read, the Chinese Communist dictatorship still exists. But now they are OK because they are, for the first time, and have been for a number of years, welcoming tens of billions of dollars of American corporate investment. So we are spending huge amounts of money defending somebody in Asia, I am not exactly sure, against a country which now welcomes American corporate investment, and in fact many of the corporations like China, because it is very difficult for the Chinese workers to stand up and defend their own rights.  So the absurdity piles on top of the absurdity.
