 President, I wish to join with my ranking member, Senator Bond, in a colloquy to correct clerical errors in the attribution table accompanying division A of H.R. 3288. Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden are listed as having requested the Oak Street Extension, Schereville, IN, project under surface transportation priorities. My staff has confirmed that this project was not requested by Senator Merkley or Senator Wyden, and, as such, Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden's names should not be listed as requestors.
