 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res. 700 and do so as a further mark of respect for the late Walter ``Dee'' Huddleston, former Senator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Thereupon, the Senate, at 5:32 p.m., adjourned until Friday, November 16, 2018, at 3 p.m.                          ____________________
