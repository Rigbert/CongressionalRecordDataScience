Leader, can you call me when you do read them.  Mr. Leader, would it be fair, and I see the chairman is on the floor, would it be fair to assume that these bills will not be considered in committee again?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would continue to yield, that is correct. I am under the impression that H.R. 4279, the flexible spending accounts bill, has been considered in committee. But medical liability and the association health plan bills are bills that we have passed in this House before.
