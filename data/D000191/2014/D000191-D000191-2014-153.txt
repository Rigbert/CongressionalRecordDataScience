Speaker, today we gather to honor Congressman Jim Oberstar, a true gentleman of the House who ably represented Minnesota's 8th District for 36 years. He was a fixture of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee starting as staff in the 1960s and 1970s, and then as a member and finally Chairman from 2007 to 2011. I was blessed to work, and sometimes ride, alongside Jim for many years.   As a tireless advocate on transportation issues, Jim earned well-deserved admiration in many circles, including in my home state of Oregon. He accompanied me on tours as an advocate for increased infrastructure investment. Jim truly understood the importance of the investment as a way to create American jobs, improve safety, and build roads and bridges to accommodate a 21st Century economy. His passion and leadership are evident in projects across the country.   Jim was also an avid cyclist, and I am grateful I had the opportunity to show him my state in 2007 during the Cycle Oregon event. He was one tough athlete, easily outpacing cyclists half his age.   Like many people in Washington, DC, Minnesota and beyond, I feel fortunate to consider Jim not only a colleague, but a friend and a mentor. I only wish he had lived long enough to share all of his knowledge with the rest of us.   My sympathy goes out to his loved ones, including his wife, Jean.                          ____________________
