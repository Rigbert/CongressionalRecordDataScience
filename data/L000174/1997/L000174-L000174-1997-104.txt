President, many have asked whether the Department of Defense has so involved itself in the landmine debate that they have even changed definition to win in their opposition to joining the majority of nations seeking a ban.  An article from September 24, 1997, the Washington Post answers the question and I ask that it be printed in the Record.  The article follows:           Clinton Directive on Mines: New Form, Old Function                            (By Dana Priest)       When is an antipersonnel land mine--a fist-sized object      designed to blow up a human being--no longer an antipersonnel      land mine?       When the president of the United States says so.       In announcing last week that the United States would not      sign an international treaty to ban antipersonnel land mines,      President Clinton also said he had ordered the Pentagon to      find technological alternatives to these mines. ``This      program,'' he said, ``will eliminate all antipersonnel land      mines from America's arsenal.''       Technically speaking, the president's statement was not      quite accurate.       His directive left untouched the millions of little devices      the Army and Defense Department for years have been calling      antipersonnel land mines. These mines are used to protect      antitank mines, which are much larger devices meant to      disable enemy tanks and other heavy vehicles.       The smaller ``protectors'' are shot out of tanks or dropped      from jets and helicopters. When they land, they shoot out      threads that attach themselves to the ground with tiny hooks,      creating cobweb-like tripwires. Should an enemy soldier try      to get close to the antitank mine, chances are he would trip      a wire, and either fragments would explode at ground level or      a handball-sized grenade would pop up from the antipersonnel      mine to about belly height. In less than a second, the      grenade would explode, throwing its tiny metal balls into the      soldier's flesh and bones.       In the trade, these ``mixed'' systems have names such as      Gator, Volcano, MOPMS and Area Denial Artillery Munition, or      ADAM.       These mines, Clinton's senior policy director for defense      policy and arms control, Robert Bell, explained later, ``are      not being banned under the president's directive because they      are not antipersonnel land mines.'' They are, he said,      ``antihandling devices,'' ``little kinds of explosive      deices'' or, simply, ``munitions.''       Not according to the Defense Department, which has used      them for years.       When the Pentagon listed the antipersonnel land mines it      was no longer allowed to export under a 1992 congressionally      imposed ban, these types were on the list.       And when Clinton announced in January that he would cap the      U.S. stockpile of antipersonnel land mines in the inventory,      they were on that list too.       At the time, there were a total of 1 million Gators,      Volcanos and MOPMS, as well as 9 million ADAMs. (Only some      ADAMs are used in conjunction with antitank mines, and those      particular devices are no longer considered antipersonnel      land mines.)       The unclassified Joint Chiefs of Staff briefing charts used      to explain the impact of legislation to Congress this year      explicitly state that Gators, Volcanos, MOPMS and ADAMs are      antipersonnel land mines.       So does a June 19 Army information paper titled ``US Self-     Destructing Anti-Personnel Landmine Use.'' So does a fact      sheet issued in 1985 by the Army Armament, Munition and      Chemical Command.       As does a recent Army ``Information Tab,'' which explains      that the Gator is ``packed with a mix of `smart' AP      [antipersonnel] and `smart' AT [antitank] mines.''       And when Air Force Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, vice chairman of      the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed reporters at the White      House on may 16, 1996, he said: ``Our analysis shows that the      greatest benefit of antipersonnel land mines is when they are      used in conjunction with antitank land mines. . . . If you      don't cover the antitank mine field with antipersonnel mines,      it's very easy for the enemy to go through the mine field.''       A diplomatic dispute over the types of antipersonnel land      mines Ralston was describing then and arms control adviser      Bell sought to redefine last week was one of the main reasons      the United States decided last week not to sign the      international treaty being crafted in Oslo, Norway.       U.S. negotiators argued that because these mines are      programmed to eventually self-destruct, they are not      responsible for the humanitarian crisis--long-forgotten mines      injuring and killing civilians--that treaty supporters hoped      to cure with a ban, and therefore should be exempt from the      ban.       Also, because other countries had gotten an exemption for      the type of antihandling devices they use to prevent soldiers      from picking up antitank mines--which are actually attached      to the antitank mines--U.S. negotiators contended that the      United States should get an exemption for the small mines it      uses for the same purpose.       Negotiators in Oslo did not accept Washington's stance.      They worried that other countries might seek to exempt the      types of antipersonnel mines they wanted to use, too, and the      whole treaty would soon become meaningless.       The administration was not trying to deceive the public,      Bell said in an interview yesterday, bristling at the      suggestion. Given the fact that the U.S. devices are used to      protect antitank mines, ``it seems entirely common-sensical      to us'' to call them antihandling devices.       Said Bell: ``this was not a case of us trying to take mines      and then define the problem away.''                  How One `Antihandling Device' Works       When President Clinton spoke of eliminating antipersonnel      land mines, he left out of his directive devices such as the      Gator antipersonnel mine. The Gator mine prevents soldiers      from disarming antitank mines. It works like this:       1. Gator mines grouped in a cluster bomb are dumped from      planes onto the ground surrounding antitank mines.       2. When the mine lands, gas from a small squib forces      spring-loaded tripwires to be released.       3. Tension on the tripwire sets off the fuse, sending low-     flying fragments in all directions.                          ____________________
