Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) for yielding me the time. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the Chairman of the Committee on International Relations, for bringing this resolution to the floor. I am pleased to join my very good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), with whom I have served on the Helsinki Commission since 1985 and who is now the chairman of our commission and does an extraordinarily good job at raising high the banner of human rights, of freedom, and democracy and so many other vital values to a free people. I am honored to be his colleague on the Helsinki Commission.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 100 which commemorates the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act which, was signed on August 1, 1975.  It is my firm belief that the political process set in motion by the signing of the Final Act was the groundwork for the forces which consumed the former Soviet empire. In 1975, many of the Final Act signatory states viewed the language of the act dealing with human rights and the obligation that each state had toward its own citizens, as well as those of other states, as essentially meaningless window dressing.  Their objective, it was felt that of the Soviets, was to secure a framework in which their international political position and the then existing map of Europe would be adjudged a fait accompli.  Let me say as an aside that as we honor the 25th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, we ought to honor the courage and the vision of President Gerald Ford. I am not particularly objective. President Ford is a friend of mine for whom I have great affection and great respect, but those who will recall the signing of the Final Act in August of 1975 will recall that it was very controversial, and that many particularly in President's Ford's party thought that it was a sellout to the Soviets, thought that it was, in fact, a recognition of the de facto borders that then existed with the 6 Warsaw Pact nations, captive nations, if you will.  President Ford, however, had the vision and, as I said, the courage, to sign the Final Act on behalf of the United States along with 34 other heads of state; that act became a living and breathing process, not a treaty, not a part of international law, but whose moral suasion ultimately made a very significant difference.  I want to join my colleagues who I know would want to thank President Ford for his vision and courage in that instance, because those who thought it was a sellout were proven wrong.  The Helsinki process, which provided a forum and international backing for Refuseniks and others fighting behind the Iron Curtain for fundamental freedom and human rights, led inevitably to the collapse of Soviet communism.  Today we celebrate the freedom yielded by our steadfast commitment to the process and by our demand that the former Soviet bloc countries adhere to and implement the human rights standards enshrined by the accords. The fall of the Berlin Wall, Mr. Speaker, transformed the world and demonstrated unreservedly that respect for the dignity of all individuals is fundamental to democracy.  Mr. Speaker, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe took a stand that human dignity, tolerance, and mutual respect would be the standards for all nations of Europe as we entered the 1990s. The Helsinki process served as a source of values and acted as an agent of conflict resolution.  It provided, Mr. Speaker, participating states with a blueprint by which to guide them away from the past, but most importantly, it reminded members, old and new, of their responsibilities to their own citizens and to each other.  Mr. Speaker, this lesson was sorely tested in the years following the Wall's fall with the dismemberment of Yugoslavia, the genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo, the economic collapse of Albania, and the emergence of new threats to the citizens of Russia.  One year after the fall of the Wall, at the OSCE Paris Summit, former political prisoners like Vaclav Havel and Lach Walesa, who had fought for the rights espoused in Helsinki in 1975, led their countries to the table and recommitted themselves and their governments to the principle of human rights, security and economic cooperation that are the foundation of the Helsinki Final Act.  Today, Mr. Speaker, 54 nations of Europe and the Americas, the Caucasus and Central Asia are committed to the Helsinki process as participating states in the OSCE. Now, we must recognize that all 54 of those states do not carry out those principles any more than the Soviet states carried out those principles in the months and long years after the signing of the Final Act, but we found then that inevitably the power of those ideas was like a tide that swept down oppression and resistance.                              {time}  1845  Hopefully, all 54 states will find that tide irresistible and will incorporate in their own lands all of the principles of the Helsinki Final Act.  Mr. Speaker, as we reflect on this anniversary, we understand that the countries and peoples of the region are still in transition and will be for decades to come. Great strides have been made by many former Communist countries in building democratic societies and market economies. Yet, progress has been uneven, and much remains to be done, as I said.  Mr. Speaker, in my view, it is critical that the United States remain engaged with the peoples and governments of Europe and the countries which emerge from the former Soviet Union, especially from Russia, during this difficult period.  I agree with President Clinton when he said that we must, and I quote, ``reaffirm our determination to finish the job, to complete a Europe whole, free, democratic, and at peace for the first time in all of history.'' It is in our strategic and national interest, Mr. Speaker, to do so. By doing so, we honor the memory of all those who sacrificed so much to hold high the banner of freedom.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.J. Res. 100 unanimously.
