Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise as a strong and an unapologetic supporter of the mission of our Department of Defense, and even more, of the United States Navy. I have two of the Navy's most outstanding facilities in my district, the Naval Air Facility and the Naval Ordnance Facility at Indian Head. I support the United States Navy.  But Mr. Chairman, I also support the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of America. I support giving him the ability to resolve crises with the confidence that the Congress of the United States will support that resolution. If we do not do so, Mr. Chairman, he will lose that ability, whoever that President might be, if the other side in a crisis situation, in a conflict situation, in a situation difficult to resolve, believes that the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, cannot be counted on to make a resolution which will stick.  Mr. Chairman, it showed a great deal of courage, I will say, for Governor Rossello to stand and say, this we will agree to, not because it is what we would choose, but because it is a way out of a difficult situation. It was a difficult and courageous task when the gentleman who represents Puerto Rico, the former Governor of Puerto Rico, stood and said, we need to resolve this issue.  Mr. Chairman, my friend, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), who was born in Puerto Rico, who worked in Puerto Rico, who was handcuffed in Puerto Rico, for her to stand up for her principles, it was a courageous thing she did as well, and for the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano).  Mr. Chairman, let us adopt the Skelton amendment and support the Commander in Chief under our Constitution of the Armed Forces of the United States. It is the right thing to do.
