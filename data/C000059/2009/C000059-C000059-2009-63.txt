Today I ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember an incredible man and American patriot, Paul Ballou Hofer, Jr. Paul was a dear friend of mine and I was deeply saddened by his passing on July 8, 2009.  Paul was born to Paul Ballou Hofer and Frances Morgan Hofer on January 23, 1921 at the family ranch in Ontario, California. He attended Mountain View Elementary School, Chaffey High School and the University of Southern California. A natural athlete, at Chaffey he played varsity basketball for four years and was a halfback on the football team, receiving dual scholarships to USC for both sports.  During World War II Paul served in the U.S. Navy, commissioned as a Naval Aviator, with several thousand hours of flight time. In 1944 Paul married his high school sweetheart, Laura Jean Belcher, who preceded him in death. They had three sons, Paul III, John and Brett who grew up in the same house in which their father was born. Along with his brothers Morgan, also deceased, and Phillip, Paul was a fourth generation vineyard farmer at Hofer Ranch which was founded by his family in 1882. Paul always believed that the lessons learned from lifetimes of farming, hard work and determination, coupled with the deeply held and abiding belief that land is what endures, have been the anchor that has guided the family through seven generations on the ranch.  In addition to ranching, Paul was a man of many interests. He had a great love of the outdoors, with a passion for fly fishing and wing shooting. Paul was a member of the Masons, and also of the Republican Party. He collected antique farm and winery equipment, proudly adding to the collection at Hofer Ranch. In addition to his three sons, Paul is survived by his brother, Phillip, and his family; his grandchildren, Jason Hofer (Christina), Jacklyn Hofer Winton (Jeremy), Morgan Hofer and Laura Hofer; his great-granddaughter, Elizabeth; and other family members.  Paul's passion for his ranch, his family, and his community has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Ontario, California. I was proud to call Paul a fellow community member, American and good friend. I hope his family knows that their father, brother, and grandfather, and the goodness he brought to this world, will always be remembered.                          ____________________
