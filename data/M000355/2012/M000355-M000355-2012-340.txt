 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who dedicated many great years of service to the residents of Pike County, KY, Sheriff's Deputy James I. Thacker of Elkhorn City, KY.  Sadly, Deputy Thacker was recently killed in a tragic automobile accident in the line of duty on Monday, January 23, on U.S. Highway 460 near Marrowbone, KY. He was 53 years old. I would like to take a moment to share with my colleagues the legacy that was left behind by this great man and humble public servant.  When asked to comment on the untimely death of Deputy Thacker, Pike County Sheriff Charles ``Fuzzy'' Keesee said, ``He was kind and compassionate; he treated everyone else like he wanted to be treated. He was that kind of person, just an excellent officer.'' Deputy Thacker was genuinely devoted to the people of Pike County, whom he had dedicated his life to serve. James has been described as the type of man you could call on day or night, with anything you may need, no matter how big or how small.  Deputy Thacker held an array of jobs in Pike County throughout his life. He served his country as a Marine early on in his life. Later on he became a Pike County road foreman. Next, he spent 8 years as Pike County's constable before assuming the role of Deputy Sheriff a little over a year ago.  Deputy Thacker most assuredly left an incredible legacy in each of the positions he held in his lifetime. He was cherished and appreciated by the citizens of Pike County, and this was proven when hundreds of friends, colleagues and family members attended his visitation to pay their respects. Amongthose assembled, people felt that anyone who knew James was truly blessed, and could find joy in simply being in his company. ``He was very likeable and he was the type of person that once you knew him, it seemed like you knew him forever,'' said Sheriff Keesee.  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating this fallen law-enforcement officer, and recognizing the legacy that he has left behind by making Elkhorn City, Pike County, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky a great place.  A news story on the tragic death of Sheriff's Deputy James I. Thacker recently aired on WYMT TV News of Hazard, Kentucky, and was published on WKYT.com. I ask unanimous consent that said story be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From WKYT.com, January 24, 2012]                    Sheriff Remembers Fallen Deputy                          (By Angela Sparkman)       Pike County Sheriff's Deputy James I. Thacker died while on      duty after a car crash Monday night near Marrowbone on U.S.      460.       Sheriff Fuzzy Keesee says Thacker was serving papers on his      way home to Elkhorn City when the wreck happened.       State police spent most of Tuesday investigating the three-     vehicle crash and say an SUV crossed the center line and hit      Thacker's cruiser. Another vehicle also hit the cars after      the collision.       The sheriff says Thacker will always be remembered for his      service to Pike County.       ``He was kind and compassionate, he treated everyone else      like he wanted to be treated. He was that kind of person,      just an excellent officer,'' Sheriff Keesee said.       Keesee says Thacker joined the department just last year      but served as a constable for four years before becoming a      sheriff's deputy.       A Pike County Sheriff's cruiser now sits in front of the      courthouse, draped in black and a wreath on top in memory of      53-year-old James I. Thacker.       Sheriff Charles ``Fuzzy'' Keesee says Thacker always      answered the call of duty to help people. Monday night, the      call for help was for Thacker.       The Sheriff says Thacker was serving papers on his way home      to Elkhorn City. He never made it.       The dozens of police who answered the call to help Thacker      could not save him. He died at the scene. It was a scene the      sheriff will never forget.       ``His family was there. I talked to them, had a prayer with      them. We were all saddened,'' said Sheriff Keesee.       State police are still investigating what caused the SUV to      allegedly lose control and cause the crash. Troopers are      reconstructing the wreck on U.S. 460.       Meanwhile, the Sheriff's department is coming together to      remember their friend and fallen officer.       ``It's going to be a great loss to the community around      us,'' said Sheriff Keesee.       The visitation for Thacker starts Wednesday night at the      Community Funeral Home in Coon Creek. His funeral is Friday      at 1 p.m. at East Ridge High School.                          ____________________
