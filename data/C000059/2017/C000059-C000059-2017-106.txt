Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring to the House floor the fiscal year 2018 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.  Before I go into the details of the bill, I would like to commend Chairman Frelinghuysen for his commitment to the appropriations process. Under Chairman Frelinghuysen's leadership, the committee has moved its bills through the full committee and is now bringing all 12 fiscal year 2018 bills to the House floor.  As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the fiscal year 2018 Interior and Environment bill is funded at $31.456 billion, which is $824 million below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $4.3 billion above the budget request.  This legislation makes a concerted effort to prioritize critical needs within our allocation while also addressing specific interests and concerns brought to our attention through more than 5,000 individual Member requests.  In the interest of time, I won't outline all of the programs and activities funded in this bill, but I would like to point out a few highlights.
