I think I have 4 minutes left. I had another amendment, which is amendment No. 198.  We had a rather unpleasant conversation on the floor yesterday with myself and the junior Senator from West Virginia. It is regrettable because he would not yield for me to respond to accusations that were made about me. I even suggested a point of order and was turned down.
