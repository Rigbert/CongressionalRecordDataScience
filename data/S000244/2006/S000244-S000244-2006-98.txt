. 1176) to provide immunity for nonprofit athletic organizations in lawsuits arising from claims of ordinary negligence relating to the passage, adoption, or failure to adopt rules of play for athletic competitions and practices, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows                               H.R. 1176       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Nonprofit Athletic      Organization Protection Act of 2006''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Amateur Sports and education-based athletics are an      important part of our culture. Sports provide a tremendous      opportunity for the youth of America to learn the skills of      leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Studies have shown that      participation in these activities is directly connected to      academic achievement and overall social development.       (2) Amateur athletics are integral to the good health and      overall well-being of American society. Nonprofit      organizations put forward their best efforts to enact rules      that are in the best interests of young people. Injuries will      occur as a result of the inherent risks involved in sports.      These risks, however, should not work to the detriment of the      greater good served by amateur athletics.       (3) Young people who participate in school sports and other      amateur competition have lower levels of obesity.       (4) Young people who participate in sports tend to be      fitter adults, and suffer fewer health problems as they age.       (5) Playing rules in amateur sports are necessary to      provide the opportunity for young people to participate in      age- and skill level-appropriate competition.       (6) Sport involves intense physical activity. It also      involves a certain element of danger. Rule making is      anticipatory, and hence a difficult balancing act. Rules      committee members face a constant struggle to balance the      tradeoffs of limiting risk and preserving the key elements      and sound traditions of the sport. Rules makers must draw      unambiguous lines; they do not have the luxury of self-     protective vagueness. Given the large number of participants      and the risks inherent in sport, injuries cannot be avoided.      By deciding to partake in competition, athletes assume such      risks. Allowing lawsuits based merely on the good faith      development of the rules is wrong and unfair.       (7) Rules makers have been the target of an increasing      number of lawsuits claiming negligence due to the adoption,      or failure to adopt, particular rules for amateur sports.       (8) Repeatedly defending claims will have a detrimental      impact on the ability of rules makers to continue to provide      these services, and will discourage the best and brightest      coaches, officials, and administrators from serving on rules      committees. Additionally, some children may lose the      opportunity to participate in organized sports if higher      insurance premiums compel amateur athletic organizations to      raise fees.     SEC. 3.
