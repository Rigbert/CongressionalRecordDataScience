I noticed an op-ed piece in the Oklahoma Duncan Banner yesterday, written by Steve Fair, wherein he goes through all of his research on the outside, showing virtually all the science since 1999 or since 1998 when Michael Mann came through with his hockey stick, has demonstrated very clearly that the science is not there.  I ask unanimous consent this op-ed piece be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        [From the Duncan Banner]                           Is It Hot in Here?                            (By Steve Fair)       On USA Today's Wednesday June 15th editorial page, Senator      Jim Inhofe presented the opposing view on the issue of global      warming. The paper's position was that there is scientific      consensus that greenhouse gases are causing climate change      and that failure to implement reductions in those gases will      cause major problems for future generations. You've heard the      theories--a cow's flatulence in Oklahoma is melting the      glaciers in Alaska. It takes more faith to believe that than      to believe a sovereign God created the earth in 6 days.       The title of Senator Inhofe's response to the paper was      Evidence is underwhelming. He pointed out that global      alarmists, whose intents are questionable, are promoting      mandatory caps on carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. when      the scientific consensus does not warrant such action. As      chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works      Committee, Inhofe has access to far more detailed scientific      information on the global warming issue than the average      person.       For years, the global warming issue has always been one      that was trumpeted by the environmental wackos--the tree      huggers. Their passion in saving the earth was only exceeded      by their commitment to killing babies in the womb. It was the      liberals that heralded the cause, but that has changed.       On the front page of the same issue of USA Today there was      a story about the so-called Christian right. It seems a      number of conservative groups which have traditionally been      champions of moral issues have now expanded their borders to      include taking positions on issues like the environment and      human rights.       One of these groups is the National Association of      Evangelicals, which represents 52 denominations with 45,000      churches and 30 million members across the country. The      current head of the organization is Reverend Ted Haggard, a      pastor from Colorado. The NAE takes traditionally      conservative stands on abortion, same-sex marriage and prayer      in schools, but recently took a turn to the left on their      position on the environment.       Used to be a time that evangelicals warned about a      different kind of warming. They preached about the fires of      hell for the unrepentant, but under Haggard's leadership,      this group has taken a position on the environment. The group      passed a resolution that states that Christians should labor      to protect God's creation. Not many would disagree with that      statement, however when the group recently met in DC, the      Reverend disinvited Oklahoma US Senator Jim Inhofe because he      disagrees with him on environmental issues. Senator Inhofe      said the NAE should heed the scripture says that we are to      worship the Creator, not the creation.       I read about the snub in Roll Call several weeks back, so I      contacted by phone and email the Reverend Haggard. I wanted      to discuss his reasoning for blackballing a Senator as      socially conservative as Inhofe.       Haggard, who is an Oral Roberts University grad, did not      call me back, but did have an underling call me. The young      man was nice, but I told him I would only discuss my thoughts      with Haggard. I did ask if the reasons cited by Roll Call for      Senator Inhofe not being invited to address the group were      accurate. The young man confirmed they were. The pastor never      called me and I don't expect to hear from him since he knows      he cannot defend his position from scripture.       If Rev. Haggard wants to preach his tree hugging views at      home or in his church, that's his business, but when he moves      it to the public square and wraps it in the guise of the      scripture, it becomes mine. The national media loves to paint      all Christian conservatives with the same brush and when      misinformed zealots like Haggard take their eye off the ball,      it hurts the cause. If Haggard wants to start a political      action committee called Christian Tree Lovers, then do it. He      could invite all the liberal Senators that agree with his      environmental views and perhaps they could discuss theology      as well. But to move the NAE into the environmental debate      when the thrust of that organization     has always been first and foremost moral issues is dishonest.      If Haggard thinks it's getting hot, just wait until he      encounters angry social conservatives.       Steve Fair is Chairman of the Stephens County Republican      Party.
