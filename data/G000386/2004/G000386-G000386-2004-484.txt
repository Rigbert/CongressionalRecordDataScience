 President, I would like to take a moment to commend a remarkable Iowan. COL Robert C. King retired from his duties as Public Affairs Officer for the Iowa National Guard in December 2003 and will retire from the National Guard at the end of the year. Colonel King has been a member of the Iowa National Guard since 1968 and has worked tirelessly to break new ground in the area of communication between the Iowa National Guard and outside media outlets. It goes without saying, his service is appreciated beyond words.  In his job as Public Affairs Officer, Colonel King cultivated a media relationship with the National Guard when none existed before. He served during some of the highest profile activities since World War II including the crash of United Flight 232, Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the floods of 1993, as well as Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Colonel King has represented the Iowa National Guard and its thousands of members at a variety of functions throughout the State. He has held several command-directed assignments and served as the commander of the State Area Readiness Command in addition to his role as Public Affairs Officer. He handled this dual assignment with remarkable ease and showed his dedication through his willingness to take on such a committed role. While under his command, the Iowa National Guard Headquarters received Superior Unit Awards every year. Colonel King served as the 34th Rear Area Operations Center training administrator and executive officer. Colonel King also served as the administrative-supply technician for the 186th Military Police Company. He has been a valuable connection for me personally, providing information for me to stay abreast of what is going on with the Iowa National Guard. I am proud of Colonel King and the contributions he has made to Iowa. He tapped previously underutilized or noticeably absent avenues within the media relations field for the Iowa National Guard. His devotion to the soldier, the National Guard, Iowa and this country is beyond reproach.  Again, I would like to congratulate Colonel King on his retirement as Public Affairs Officer for the Iowa National Guard. He has proven to be a remarkable officer and I thank him for his inexhaustible dedication to Iowa and to America.                          ____________________
