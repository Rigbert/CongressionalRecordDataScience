 Michael J. Morell, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, who will leave his current position on Friday, August 9, 2013, and retire at the end of September. Mr. Morell's career spans over 33 years in the CIA during which he distinguished himself as a patriot, leader, and friend of the Senate.  Michael Morell deserves the gratitude of the entire Nation for his three decades of selfless service at the CIA.  An Ohio native, Mr. Morell received a B.A. degree in economics from the University of Akron in 1980 and an M.A. in economics from Georgetown University in 1984.  Since joining the CIA in 1980, Michael's talents lifted him from being an analyst covering international energy issues to some of the toughest assignments that the CIA has to offer: Presidential Briefer, Associate Deputy Director, Director of Intelligence, Deputy Director, and toughest of all, twice he was called upon to serve as Acting Director. In each assignment, Michael provided exemplary leadership for the men and women of the Agency and demonstrated he was someone who knew how to manage operations, sharpen analysis, invest in new technologies, and assure the smooth functioning of the entire CIA workforce.  As the President's Daily Briefer, Michael was at President Bush's side on that horrific day in September 2001. He was there at President Obama's side as Deputy CIA Director when the United States brought justice to Osama bin Ladin in May 2011. These are only two examples out of many where Michael helped guide the Agency and the Nation through some of the most complex and challenging times in our recent history.  As the Acting Director and Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Michael has had frequent interaction with Senators and staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. His professionalism, mature judgment, frank and sage advice, and interpersonal skills earned him the respect and confidence of the committee. His sound judgment and candor also directly contributed to his successful representation of the CIA's interests before the committee and Congress.  As the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, we have had additional opportunities to see Michael's contributions to this Nation. We cannot speak of them here, but the American people should know that his service goes beyond the public record, and has spanned the globe.  Throughout his career, Michael Morell demonstrated a profound commitment to our Nation, selfless serviceto the CIA, deep concern for Agency officers and their families, and a commitment to excellence. Michael is the consummate intelligence professional whose performance personified those traits of courage, competency, and integrity that our Nation expects from its professional intelligence officers.  Mr. President, we ask our colleagues to join us in thanking Mr. Michael Morell for his honorable service to the Central Intelligence Agency and the people of the United States. We also thank Michael's wife Mary Beth and his children, Sarah, Luke, and Peter, for their support and understanding, as well as their sacrifices in allowing Michael to selflessly commit himself to protecting our Nation against those who would do us harm.  We wish the Morell family all the best in the future.                     TRIBUTE TO TIMOTHY P. IRELAND
