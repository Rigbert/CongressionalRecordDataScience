President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will provide much-needed grants for transitional housing services to victims of domestic violence who are brave enough to leave an abusive situation and seek a new life of safety and freedom. I am pleased that Senators Kennedy and Biden join me as original cosponsors of this important legislation.  I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence early in my career as the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. Today, more than 50 percent of homeless individuals are women and children fleeing domestic violence. More than half the cities surveyed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 2000 cited domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness. The women and children who leave their abusers tend to have few, if any, funds with which they can support themselves. Shelters offer short-term assistance, but are overcrowded and unable to provide the support needed. Transitional housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving a domestic violence situation and becoming fully self-sufficient, but such assistance is limited because there is currently no Federal funding for transitional housing specifically for those victims.  If we truly seek an end to domestic violence, then transitional housing must be available to all those fleeing domestic abuse. The stable, sustainable home base for women and their children found in transitional housing allows women the opportunities to learn new job skills, participate in educational programs, work full-time jobs, and search for adequate child care in order to gain self-sufficiency. Without such resources, many women eventually return to situations where they are abused and even killed. This cycle of domestic abuse must end, and transitional housing assistance is one of the tools we can use to end it.  A transitional housing grant program was last authorized for only one year as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2000. This program would have been administered through the Department of Health and Human Services and provided $25 million in fiscal year 2001. Unfortunately, funds were never appropriated for the program, and the authorization has now expired.  The grant program established in the bill I introduce today with Senators Kennedy and Biden would establish a new Department of Justice grant program that authorizes the Attorney General, acting in consultation with the Director of the Violence Against Women Office of the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program would have the benefit of a wide range of expertise in the three departments, and has enormous potential to improve people's lives. It would authorize $30 million in DOJ transitional housing grants for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008.  This new grant program administered through DOJ will make a big impact in many areas of the country where availability of affordable housing is at an all-time low. There are many dedicated people working to provide victims of domestic violence with resources, such as Rose Pulliam of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, but they can not work alone. We should all be concerned with providing victims of domestic violence a safe place to gain the skills and stability needed to make the transition to independence. This is an important component of reducing and preventing crimes that take place in domestic situations, ranging from assault and child abuse to homicide, and helping the victims of these crimes.  I am please that our bill will be included in the conference report on the PROTECT Act, S. 151. I thank the conferees for including in the conference agreement this language for a grant program that will supply to victims fleeing domestic violence situations tangible means by which they may move on with their lives.  I ask unanimous consent that a section by section analysis of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the additional materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: A Bill To Amend the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 To Provide for  Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for Child Victims of Domestic                  Violence--Section-by-Section Analysissection 1. transitional housing assistance grants for child victims of             domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault.       This section amends Subtitle B of the Violence Against      Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13701 note; 108 Stat. 1925) to      include a new Chapter 11--Transitional Housing Assistance      Grants for Child Victims of Domestic Violence, Stalking, or      Sexual Assault.       Subsection (a) of this section authorizes the Attorney      General, acting in consultation with the Director of Violence      Against Women Office of the Department of Justice, in      consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban      Development and the Secretary of Health and Human Services,      to award grants to organizations, States, units of local      government, and Indian tribes to carry out programs to      provide assistance to minors, adults, and their dependents      who are homeless or in need of transitional housing or      related assistance as a result of fleeing a situation of      domestic violence, and for whom emergency shelter services or      other crisis intervention services are unavailable or      insufficient.       Subsection (b) provides that the grants awarded may be used      for programs that provide short-term housing assistance,      which includes rental or utilities payments assistance and      assistance with related expenses such as payment of security      deposits and other costs incidental to relocation to      transitional housing for minors, adults and their dependents.      Grants will also be available for support services designed      to help those fleeing a situation of domestic violence to      locate and secure permanent housing, as well as integrate      into a community by providing with services, such as      transportation, counseling, child care services, case      management, employment counseling, and other assistance.       Subsection (c) states that a minor, an adult, or a      dependent who receives assistance under this section may      receive that assistance for not more than 18 months. The      recipient of a grant under this section may waive the time      restriction for not more than an additional 6 month period      with respect to any minor, adult, or dependent, so long as he      or she has made a good-faith effort to acquire permanent      housing; and has been unable to acquire permanent housing.       Subsection (d) specifies the application process for      transitional housing grants. Each     eligible entity desiring such grants shall submit an      application to the Attorney General at such time, in such      manner, and accompanied by such information as the Attorney      General may reasonably require. Each application shall      describe the activities for which assistance under this      section is sought; and provide such additional assurances as      the Attorney General determines to be essential to ensure      compliance with the requirements of the grant program.       Subsection (e) states that a recipient of a Justice      Department transitional housing grant must annually prepare      and submit to the Attorney General a report describing the      number of minors, adults, and dependents assisted, and the      types of housing assistance and support services provided.       Subsection (f) provides that the Attorney General, with the      Director of the Violence Against Women Office, must also      annually prepare and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary      of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the      Judiciary of the Senate a report that contains a compilation      of the information contained in the report submitted by grant      recipients. Copies of this report will also be transmitted to      the Office of Community Planning and Development at the      United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and      the Office of Women's Health at the United States Department      of Health and Human Services.       Subsection (g) authorizes that there be appropriated to      carry out the Department of Justice transitional housing      grant program $30,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2004      through 2008. Of the amount made available to carry out this      section in any fiscal year, not more than 3 percent may be      used by the Attorney General for salaries and administrative      expenses. States, together with the grantees within the State      (other than Indian tribes), shall be allocated in each fiscal      year, not less than 0.75 percent of the total amount      appropriated in the fiscal year for grants for transitional      housing. The United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa,      Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be      allocated not less than 0.25 percent of the total amount      appropriated in the fiscal year for grants pursuant to this      section.                                 ______                                       By
