 President.  Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering simply clarifies that they can waive victims of domestic violence from the Welfare Act. This was an amendment that was unanimously accepted in the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution and in the welfare reform bill.  I thank my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for his work on this issue and appreciate the acceptance by the Senate.
