Chairman, since the gentleman from Minnesota offered his amendment under this restricted time, we will not have any time to debate it, but I would like to explain what he has done, or tries to do with his amendment. He wants to say it just is not a question of whether or not you happen to be a person with off-farm income over $100,000, he wants to limit it to only those people who live in incorporated municipalities with a population that exceeds 50,000. I guess that is the city folks he has gone after, but the fact is I live in a part of the world where rich people live out in the country, too. If we are going after folks with off-farm income in excess of $100,000, it really does not make any difference to me where they live.
