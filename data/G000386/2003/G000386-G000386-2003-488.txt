 President, once again, we have a substitute that would basically eliminate all the growth we have in our growth package. We have a well-balanced package before us between short-term investment, long-term investment, between consumer spending and investment.  This amendment is not about investment; it is all about spending.  I hope we will defeat the amendment. This language happens to not be germane to the measure now before us.
