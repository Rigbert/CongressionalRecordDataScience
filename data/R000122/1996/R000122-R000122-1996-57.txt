Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill. I know of no objections to this legislation. House Joint Resolution 78 seeks congressional approval for additional powers conferred on the Bi-State Development Agency of Missouri and Illinois by those two State legislatures. These additional powers involve the jurisdiction of various local police officers to make arrests on the light-rail system and the agency's efforts to prosecute fare evaders.  Mr. Speaker, I urge speedy passage of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
