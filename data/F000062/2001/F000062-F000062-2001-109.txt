 President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass this resolution to honor the 150th anniversary of the University of the Pacific. Today, the University of the Pacific celebrates its founding in 1851.  The University of the Pacific has remained throughout its history, devoted to the teaching and development of students by a faculty of outstanding scholars. It has prepared more than 60,000 students for lasting achievement and responsible leadership in their careers and communities.  The University of the Pacific is also a trailblazer in higher education. Pacific was the first university in the West to enroll women and to introduce coeducation. It also established California's first medical school and music conservatory.  I am pleased to sponsor this resolution to congratulate the University of the Pacific, and its faculty, staff, students, and alumni on the university's 150th anniversary.
