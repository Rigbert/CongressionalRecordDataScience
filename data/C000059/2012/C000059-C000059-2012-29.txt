Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County are exceptional. Southwest Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders whowillingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Ken Rivers is one of these individuals. On September 27, 2012, Ken will be honored as the ``Citizen of the Year'' at the Boy Scouts of America--Tahquitz District Distinguished Citizens Dinner.  Ken's background encompasses over 25 years of executive healthcare administration. While earning his master's degrees at the University of La Verne, he became a chief operating officer of a Southern California hospital at the young age of 23.  Prior to joining Southwest Healthcare hospitals, he served as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director at the Corona Regional Medical Center in my hometown of Corona. He joined Southwest Healthcare System in 2009, where he has served as the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director. Southwest Healthcare System operates Inland Valley Medical Center in Wildomar and Rancho Springs Medical Center in Murrieta and Temecula Valley Day Surgery in Murrieta. Just recently, he joined CHA Health System in Los Angeles which will allow him to further his career at the international level of healthcare.  Ken's accomplishments at Southwest Healthcare System have reflected his attitude of treating patients like family. Along with a dedicated leadership team, physicians and the entire hospital staff, Ken directed the opening of the $91 million expansions to both hospitals which include new emergency departments featuring more than 70 bays, expanded the Intensive Care Unit at Inland Valley by doubling bed capacity, and the largest Women's Center in the entire region located at Rancho Springs. His leadership was instrumental in passing one of the largest state and federal surveys. He is currently developing the region's first Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Rancho Springs and Cardiac Services at Inland Valley.  It is hard to imagine that Ken would have any free time on his hands yet he always found time for his community. A Paul Harris Fellow and Rotarian, Ken serves with many philanthropic and healthcare organizations including Chairman for the Riverside County Chapter of the American Red Cross. He also enjoys spending time with his two children, traveling, and playing golf.  In light of all Ken has done for Southwest Riverside County, the Boy Scouts of America--Tahquitz District named Ken their Citizen of the Year. Ken's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of the Inland Empire. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
