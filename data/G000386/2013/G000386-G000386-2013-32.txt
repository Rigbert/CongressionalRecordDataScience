 Chief Judge Garland told us that their workload is the equivalent of 3\1/4\ judges. So presently there are enough judges to go around and that would equal 11\1/4\ judges. There are 8 judges there now plus the 3\1/4\ that have senior status. There are plenty of reasons not to fill any more seats on this court.
