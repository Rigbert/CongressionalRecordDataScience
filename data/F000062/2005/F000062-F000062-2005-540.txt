 President, I respond to the distinguished Senator that essentially what he said is correct. I have no objection to an amendment in the program. My State is a big user of this program at $111 million last year. He is right, Texas, California, and the big immigrant States are the States that are most affected by this program.  Moneys go to every single State. I have no objection to mandating the money must go directly into the State prison system or the county jail system, whatever that might be.  I point out also to the Senator when I was mayor, we had a revenue-sharing program. We had a community block grant program, all of which looked as though they were going to go by the boards, certainly CDBG with this budget. This is a total Federal responsibility. For our Government not to take that responsibility and recompense those States that provide the incarceration--these people are not in Federal prison, they are in State prisons--is a huge mistake.  I have objection, certainly, to mandating where the funds would go. If the managing Senator wishes to move this by unanimous consent, I certainly have no objections to that, either.                           Amendment No. 240
