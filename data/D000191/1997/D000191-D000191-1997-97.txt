Speaker, if we could just return, again to my surprise, that Oregon, so-called free trade, high-technology, a growing State, is No. 5 on the list for applications for people's jobs having been exported or dislocated.  I would just like people to be aware of the other States. No. 4 is the State of Washington, again, looked at as another vital, growing, exporting, high-technology State, dominated, of course, by Boeing and Microsoft.  Then, you know, we get to States that, well, again, Texas, I do not think too many of us have thought in the past about Texas as being one of the them. Actually they are No. 2. No. 1 is Pennsylvania, and No. 3 is New York, and No. 2 is Texas. So what we have pointed out here is that there has been extraordinary job loss.  There are those, as the gentleman pointed out, who would say that this could not have been anticipated. Well, who could have anticipated the decline of the peso? Mr. Speaker, the bottom-line truth here is that this agreement was never intended to create a market for American products. This agreement was always about protecting the movement of United States capital and manufacturing resources to Mexico to exploit the cheaper labor, the lack of enforcement of safety standards, and the lack of enforcement of environmental laws.  The key part of this agreement was something that protected United States capital and set up an independent court of claims in case any of it was expropriated, because United States industry was looking back to the days when, in Mexico, the oil industry had been expropriated. That was the barrier we are talking about.  What they did is opened up the floodgates for capital that is needed in this country to update equipment and productivity, so we can compete in world markets, to move to Mexico with impunity, to exploit their people and the conditions in that nation.                              {time}  1700  We also opened the floodgates for other foreign nations to move their capital into Mexico in order to obtain access to our markets. It was never about Mexican workers earning a dollar an hour buying the Dodge Ram trucks that they are building. That was an impossible equation. It was never a reality.  In fact, the total purchasing power of all the people of Mexico, if they had spent every peso before devaluation on United States goods, would have been less than the purchasing power of the people of New Jersey. Tell me that in the United States we would enter into an agreement and allow New Jersey to wipe out environmental laws and its labor protections and all that so that we could just gain access to their markets because it was going to boost our economy so much. No offense to the people of New Jersey, the Garden State, a great State.  The point is, this was a blip, even if every peso spent in Mexico could have been spent in this country, that was never the intention. In fact, this agreement has worked out very much the way that its principal proponents intended.  United States capital has fled to Mexico. United States jobs are seeing downward pressure on their wages. United States jobs are fleeing to Mexico. The people of Mexico have seen actually a decline in their standard of living and a decline in their environmental conditions. Now they want to extend this to other countries in Latin America, the great new frontiers where maybe labor is even cheaper than Mexico and maybe they will let us despoil the environment even more than they will in Mexico.
