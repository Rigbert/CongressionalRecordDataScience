 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a veteran from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As a member of the Army National Guard, Gregory Scott Salyer served his country with honor on a tour of duty in Afghanistan.  Service to this country is something that runs deep in Salyer's family. His father, uncle, and grandfather are all military veterans, and Salyer followed suit when he enlisted in 2006.  In Afghanistan, Salyer and his team performed the treacherous, yet indispensable, task of tracking, unearthing, and disposing of improvised explosive devices, IEDs. IEDs were, and still remain, one of the most serious and unnerving threats to our troops abroad. Salyer's work in diffusing that threat undoubtedly increased the safety of our servicemen and women.  Returning to Kentucky following his service in the Guard, Salyer brought with him the National Defense Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and the ARCOM Medal of Valor.  For his honorable service to this country, Salyer is deserving of our praise here in the Senate.  Therefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Gregory Scott Salyer.  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing Salyer's service in Afghanistan. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]               Joins Guard for Work, Sent to Afghanistan                           (By Heather Oney)       Gregory Scott Salyer joined the Army National Guard in      Prestonsburg in 2006, serving until 2011.       The former Magoffin County High School student said he was      having a hard time finding a job, so at the age of 24 he      decided to enlist, following in his dad's, uncles' and      grandfathers' footsteps.       Salyer served one tour in Afghanistan, working in route      clearance. His crew, which included five other men from      Magoffin, tracked, dug up and disposed of improvised      explosive devices (IEDs). While he said he was hit once, he      came home without any injuries.       ``I would rather go back than sit here,'' Salyer said.      ``Everything was simple. You trained for a job, then you went      out and did your job. You would get up the next day and do it      all, again.''       Salyer said growing up around guns helped him get ready for      his time overseas.       ``I had been around guns my whole life and been shot at      while corning,'' Salyer laughed. ``You could tell these boys      from California with stricter gun laws were not used to it,      but us country people were used to doing hard work every now      and then.''       Salyer received the National Defense Medal, Global War on      Terrorism Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, Afghanistan      Campaign Medal, ARCOM Medal of Valor, and Whitelist      recognition.       He has one son, Hunter Salyer.                          ____________________
