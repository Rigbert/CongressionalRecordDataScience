 President, before yielding the floor, I thank my friend from Alabama. I hope this legislation will clear the Senate sometime tomorrow. I know people are working on both sides of the aisle to get it cleared. It should not be controversial. After all, it came out of committee unanimously. It is supported by the National Mining Association and the UMWA. We need to get that bill passed.  I hope, also, we can get a permanent Director of MSHA. It is without a permanent Director at a very important time in the life and safety of our Nation's coal miners.
