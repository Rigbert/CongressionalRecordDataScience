President, the Senator from Utah is my friend. We have worked on many issues together and in this particular moment in time we are in disagreement. What he has presented to you is one side of a story, one side of a debate and said unless you accept the House Republican position, which has not been resolved, we are going to lay off 4,000 people at midnight tonight. Do you think that means anything to them?  What I offered was a clean extension of which I didn't get into the merits, which said let's put this debate aside and that debate aside and keep the agency working, the Federal Aviation Administration. He said, no, either take the Republican approach or else, and, incidentally, he told me at the outset the House Republicans have gone home. They are gone. They sent this over and said take it or leave it or close it down. That is not a very sound choice for our country. I am sorry if the Senator from Utah objected to a clean extension so we can keep up these operations. I object because I don't believe it is a fair approach.
