Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and pay tribute to two celebrated community servants, Mr. Joseph Alvarado and Mr. Lou Martinez. On September 8, 1995, Joe and Lou will be honored for their contributions to northwest Indiana and the Hispanic community by the Northwest Indiana Hispanic Coordinating Council. This testimonial dinner will take place at the Casa Blanca Restaurant in East Chicago, IN.  We are all very fortunate to have dedicated people, like Joe and Lou, who are sincerely proud of their Hispanic heritage and have taken an active role in promoting the progress of the Hispanic community in Indiana's First Congressional District.  Joe Alvarado is a native of East Chicago, IN. He is also a fellow graduate of the University of Notre Dame, where he played varsity football for the Irish. He later received his masters degree in finance from Cornell University. Joe returned to East Chicago and started his career with Inland Steel Co. in 1976. Since that time, he has steadily risen through the ranks from the days when he was a finance trainee to his current position as president of Inland Steel Bar Co.  Lou Martinez, a classmate of mine at Andrean High School in Merrillville IN, has been with the United Way system since he joined the Lake Area United Way in Griffith, IN, in 1979. In my personal experience with Lou, I can say that he is one of the most dedicated and unselfish individuals I know. His desire to serve his community has allowed him to prosper in an organization like the United Way, whose focus is community service. As president of the Lake Area United Way, Lou has realized his leadership potential and he has played a big part in touching the lives of so many who are in need in northwest Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to these two very special men. Joe and Lou's large circle of family and friends, as well as the entire Hispanic community of northwest Indiana, can be proud of the contributions these prominent individuals have made. They have proven themselves to be distinguished advocates for the Hispanic community, and they have truly made northwest Indiana a better place in which to live.                          ____________________
