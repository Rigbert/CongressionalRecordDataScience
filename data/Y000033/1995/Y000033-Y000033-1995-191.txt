Mr. Chairman, I would like to just point out that we are not slashing Medicare. There is nothing about Medicare in this bill. And I can make this commitment to you, that in any legislation that this Congress brings forth to the House there will not be any slash in Medicare.  There is nothing in this bill about Head Start. There are a lot of things that were talked about during the debate that are not in this bill. And the reason I make this point is that there are 13 different appropriations bills, many agencies of Government, each one of them having their own areas of responsibility.  Mr. Chairman, we do not do anybody a service by trying to play one against the other and say we cannot do this because we are going to do that. These are all important, but they are not all done in the same appropriations bill.  A lot of things that have been talked about are things that could be done by the State governments. And as my colleagues know, through our block grant program we plan to do that.
