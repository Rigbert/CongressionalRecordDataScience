 President, I rise today to again join my colleague, Senator Cantwell, in introducing the MediFair Act of 2004. My bill will restore fairness to the Medicare program and provide equity for health care providers participating in Medicare. Most importantly, it will open doors of care to more seniors and the disabled in my State.  Today, unfair Medicare reimbursement rates are causing doctors to limit their care for Medicare beneficiaries. Throughout my State, seniors and the disabled are having a hard time finding a doctor who will accept new Medicare patients.  Unfortunately, the recently-passed Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 further compromises health care in Washington State because it reduces Washington State's per beneficiary payments from 42nd to 45th nationwide. This reduction places health care providers in my State at an economic disadvantage and further limits access to health care in Washington State.  My bill will reduce the regional inequities that have resulted in vastly different levels of care and access to care by ensuring that every State receives at least the national average of per-patient spending. This measure will encourage more doctors to accept Medicare patients and will also guarantee that seniors are not penalized when they choose to retire in the State of Washington.  In addition to ensuring that no State receives less than the national average, my legislation will encourage healthy outcomes and efficient use of Medicare payments. The current Medicare system punishes health care providers who practice efficient healthcare and healthy outcomes. Physicians and hospitals in my State are proud of the pioneering role they have played in providing high quality, cost effective medicine. Unfortunately, they have been rewarded for their exceptional service by being paid a fraction of their actual costs.  On the other hand, States that are inefficient and that over-utilize the system are rewarded with higher states of reimbursement. As we grapple with an ever-increasing budget deficit. We need to make sure that every dollar spent on Medicare is used as effectively as possible. I ask each and every one of my colleagues to join me in restoring fairness to the Medicare program and increasing access to health care for Medicare beneficiaries by supporting the MediFair Act.  I want to acknowledge the lead sponsor of the MediFair bill in the House, Representative Adam Smith, as well as the other cosponsors, Representative Baird, Representative Dicks, Representative Inslee, Representative Larsen, and Representative McDermott.  I have been working on addressing the issue of inequitable Medicare reimbursement policies for a number of years, and I am pleased that we have made inroads in addressing this issue. I especially appreciate the efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reward healthy outcomes, and I look forward to working with HHS in the future to meet these goals.  Medicare should reward States like Washington that have a proven tradition of efficient and effective health care. Passing the MediFair Act will go a long way to improving health care access for seniors in States like Washington and ensuring that Federal health care dollars produce the best results possible for our patients.                                 ______                                       By
