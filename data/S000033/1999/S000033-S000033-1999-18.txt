 Chairman, this amendment expresses the Congress' support of efforts to improve rural health care delivery for our veterans, and I believe it is absolutely noncontroversial.  It is imperative that the special needs of veterans living in rural areas are recognized and that the particular problems associated with delivery of VA health care in rural areas often in face of shrinking resources are addressed.  I would like to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) and thegentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan), the ranking member, for what I understand is their support of this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh).
