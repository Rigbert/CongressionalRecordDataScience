Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise as well to say that no Member of this body has been any more personally affected, and certainly no Member of this body has more consistently raised the consciousness of the American people and, indeed, the international community on the importance of never forgetting.                              {time}  1500  Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman Hyde), who is committed to this issue and has been a leader and has traveled and headed the delegations of the Helsinki Commission to the Parliamentary Assembly and raised our voice in foreign lands.  I also thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), the ranking member, the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to Congress. In particular, I want to say to the gentleman from California, his indefatigable commitment to human freedom and basic human dignity is a source of inspiration to all of us privileged to serve with the gentleman. It should be emulated by us all.  Madam Speaker, 60 years ago at 3 p.m. on January 27, 1945, Soviet Red Army soldiers entered Auschwitz concentration camp. Those of us who visited Auschwitz long after that date but who saw the horrible implements of death constructed there by the Nazi regime can only imagine, knowing the horror that we felt, the horror and revulsion that those Soviet soldiers, human beings, must have felt as they entered that camp in a village in southern Poland 30 miles west of Krakow. What they discovered there haunts us today and should haunt us every day.  A Russian Army officer described the reaction to the sight of the camp's remaining 7,000 prisoners, who had been too ill or weak to move and were left to die in the cold by the fleeing Germans. He said, ``The soldiers from my battalion asked me, `Let us go. We cannot stay. This is unbelievable.' It was so terrible, it was hard for the mind to absorb it.''  But the mind, Madam Speaker, must never forget it. The Nazis had spent weeks moving the most able-bodied prisoners, destroying documents and bulldozing buildings. But the liberation of the largest Nazi concentration camp, where 1.5 million innocent souls were murdered, women and children, young and old, opened the world's eyes to the unspeakable evil of the Holocaust.  While it is appropriate that this somber day be marked in ceremonies all around the globe, it will be a further tragedy if on this occasion we only look back without also looking ahead. The gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) did that.  We cannot remember the liberation of the concentration camps and the defeat of the Nazis in World War II and at the same time cast a blind eye toward the growing problem of anti-Semitism that still infects the world today, and tragically grows today. Nor can we ignore the hatred and prejudice that fuels the genocide in Sudan today. The gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) mentioned Darfur.  Hatred knows no gender, no race, no ethnicity. It lurks in man's heart today as surely as it did during the Holocaust. Even today in this country we talk about some people in our country in a way that demeans them and dehumanizes them and gives to others the misapprehension that they can act against those people, whoever they might be. We see tragic instances of that. And that reality, as painful as it is to accept, compels us to use this solemn occasion to restate our commitment to freedom and basic human rights. And it compels us to fight hatred and prejudice wherever it rears its head.  Our President spoke just a few days ago in his Inaugural Address about the commitment of this country to freedom, to liberty and, yes, to human rights. He was right to do so. We owe those souls who perished at the hands of Nazis at Auschwitz, who perished at the hands of Milosevic, who died at the hands of those in Sudan and in every other place where hate and prejudice was the motivation for murder. We owe those souls our unremitting pledge to never, never, never permit these horrific periods in human history to be repeated. I was one of those who felt that we waited too long as we saw the genocide in Serbia and in Kosovo and in Bosnia. We must not delay our response. If we do so, we remember Auschwitz, but we remember it without learning its lesson.
