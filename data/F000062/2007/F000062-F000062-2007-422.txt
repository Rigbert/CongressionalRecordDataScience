 President, I offer today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jacqueline Coats, a 26-year old widow currently living in San Francisco.  Mrs. Coats came to the U.S. in 2001 from Kenya on a student visa to study Mass Communications at San Jose State University. Her visa status lapsed in 2003, and the Department of Homeland Security began deportation proceedings against her.  Mrs. Coats married Marlin Coats on April 17, 2006, after dating for several years. The couple was happily married and planning to start a family when, on May 13, Mr. Coats tragically died in a heroic attempt to save two young boys from drowning.  The couple had been on a Mother's Day outing at Ocean Beach with some of Mr. Coats' nephews when they heard cries for help. Having worked as a lifeguard in the past, Mr. Coats instinctively dove into the water. The two children were saved with the help of a rescue crew, but Mr. Coats, caught in a riptide, died. Mrs. Coats received a medal honoring her husband.  Four days before Mr. Coats' death, the couple prepared and signed an application for a green card at their attorney's office. Unfortunately the petition was not filed until after his death, rendering it invalid. Mrs. Coats currently has a hearing before an immigration judge in San Francisco on August 24, but her attorney has informed my staff that she has no relief available to her and will be ordered deported.  Mrs. Coats, devastated by the loss of her husband, is now caught in a battle for her right to stay in America. At a recent news conference with her lawyer, Thip Ark, she explained of her situation, ``I feel like I have nothing to live for. I have nothing to go home to . . . I've been here four years . . . It would be like starting a new life.''  Ms. Ark explains that Mrs. Coats is extremely close with her late husband's family, with whom she lives in San Leandro, CA. Mrs. Coats has said that her husband's large family has become her own. Ramona Burton of San Francisco, one of Marlin Coats' seven brothers and sisters explains, ``She spent her first American Christmas with us, her first American Thanksgiving . . . I can't imagine looking around and not seeing her there. She needs to be there.''  The San Francisco and Bay Area community is rallying strong support for Mrs. Coats. The San Francisco chapters of the NAACP, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and the San Francisco Police Department, have allpassed resolutions in support of Mrs. Coats' right to remain in the country.  Unfortunately, if this private relief bill is not approved, this young woman, and the Coats family, will face yet another disorienting and heartbreaking tragedy. Mrs. Coats will be deported to Kenya, a country she has not lived in since she was 21. In her time of grieving, she will be forced to leave her home, her job with AC Transit, her new family, and everything she has known for the past 5 years.  I cannot think of a compelling reason why the United States should not allow this young widow to continue the green card process. Had her husband lived, Mrs. Coats would have filed the papers without difficulty. It was because of her husband's selfless and heroic act that Mrs. Coats must now struggle to remain in the country. As one concerned California constituent wrote to me, ``If ever there was a case where common fairness, morality and decency should reign over legal technicalities, this is it. We, as a country, need to reward heroism and good.''  I believe that we can reward the late Mr. Coats for his noble actions by granting his wife citizenship. It is what he intended for her. It can even be argued that a green card for his wife was one of his dying wishes, as the papers were signed just 4 days prior to his death.  For these reasons, I offer this private relief immigration bill and ask my colleagues to support it on behalf of Mrs. Coats.  I also ask unanimous consent that two letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Dear Judge,       This woman's husband sacrificed his life to save mine! They      didn't get any type of award, or gift instead they got more      of a punishment. Marlon Coates died and the wife is now a      widow, when they just got married, she deserves some mercy,      and a little consideration for her. She should stay in the      country, she just got here she has bonded with Marlon's      family, she gotten to know everyone. Please let her stay she      really deserves it please!!       My Name is Chance Goss I'm 11 Love to design and go on      roller coasters, paint, do art. I think it means compassion I      think its heroic and wonderful. The incident made me think      before doing don't!!!                                  ____       Life is a very precious thing. When lost, it is very      nostalgic to everyone. Not only is it a tragic thing, but it      also affects the people around that are still living. I'm      greatly traumatized by this whole quandary.       There happens to be a fine line between deaths by a bullet      through the head of various thugs than deaths of heroes.       They don't hurt the same. People are saved everyday and you      must wonder why Marlon? He transpired to be loved by      everyone. He was a former lifeguard, and he saw my brother      out in the water.       A real hero will do what Marlon did. He ran to the bone-     chilling river, knowing that he might breathe his last      breath. He knew that he might not be able to save him. He      knew that might be the last time he saw his wife again.       He took this into account and dove into the water.       His wife is now crying, because she may face deportation      after losing the only love in her life other than God. You      must ask yourselves, is this fair? Marlon was her ticket in      this country and he has deceased.       There should be no question of whether she should stay or      not! She will never see him again. But emotionally they are      still together, because in my mind, marriage is not until      death do us part! His soul is still with her, in her heart,      Let me conclude with me saying let her stay!!!       With God and Jesus giving you hope,       Nate Ewing--Adria's son                                 ______                                       By
