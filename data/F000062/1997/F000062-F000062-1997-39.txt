 President, a woman who devoted most of her life to improving the lives of others lost her battle with cancer recently, and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the accomplishments and the contributions of this extraordinary woman.  Angie Martin struggled with the dreaded disease of breast cancer for the past 5 years. She died on August 31 at her home in Sausalito, CA, and a memorial service will be held here in Washington, DC on Monday, September 29. The many people who knew Angie know that this memorial will not be in mourning for her death, but in celebration of a life of service to others.  The world is filled with passionate idealists. Angie was of the rarer breed of people who also had the ability to inspire passion in others. Rarer still was her talent for turning those passionate ideas into action. Her efforts were always aimed at improving the lives of others, the most rare gift of all.  Angie Martin pioneered grassroots organizing techniques, establishing a vital link between citizen action and social change, and created a model for grassroots and political campaigns nationwide. Working with consumer advocate Ralph Nader in Connecticut in the early 1970's, Angie helped to create the first ever citizens lobby devoted to environmental and consumer issues. She worked to improve conditions for migrant workers in New York state, and organized the highly acclaimed 1986 Hands Across America event to build awareness for the cause of hunger and homelessness in the United States.  Together with her friend and partner, Gina Glantz, Angie took on some of our Nation's toughest issues: homelessness, hunger, migrant workers, gun violence, teen pregnancy. Her counsel was valued by many of our Nation's most prominent leaders, including Senator Ted Kennedy and Vice President Walter Mondale.  Angie battled her disease with the same conviction and courage she brought to fighting for causes she believed in. Her legacy will live on in the lives of those she worked with, and in the lives of those she helped through her passionate efforts over the last three decades.  My thoughts and prayers are with her husband, Gene Eidenberg, and daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. I know many of my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to this remarkable woman, by continuing the fight to find a cure for breast cancer and for all cancers, and by continuing to address the important issues for which she dedicated her life's work.                          ____________________
