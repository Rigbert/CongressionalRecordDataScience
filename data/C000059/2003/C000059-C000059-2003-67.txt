Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication arid contributions to the community of Corona, CA are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Maggie Little is one of these individuals. On June 6, 2003 Maggie will be honored as she retires after 36 years of dedicated service to the students, employees, parents, community and business members of the Corona-Norco Unified School District.  Maggie has served in several capacities throughout her 36 year career with the Corona-Norco Unified School District including teacher, principal and administrator. She has always observed an ``open-door'' policy and provided guidance to those who looked for her help. She had extended her hand and expertise to support any child, teacher or employee and served as a role model and mentor to administrators, teachers and students. Throughout her career she has consistently displayed patience, dependability and integrity.  Maggie's position as Corona-Norco Unified School District media spokesperson, the public relations liaison to community service organizations, has contributed immensely to improved communications to the public. Maggie oversaw the production of numerous educational publications informing the public of student and school achievements and contributed her time, energy, and outstanding organizational skills to numerous professional and community organizations in the cities of Corona and Norco and the County of Riverside in order to better inform residents of the high quality of education and academics in the community.  Maggie's tireless passion for education has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. Maggie has demonstrated her willingness to work hard for quality education and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many children, parents, fellow teachers and administrators are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.                          ____________________
