 President, for a child in a developing country, very simple tools, like safe injection technologies for vaccination, can mean the difference between life and death. But the fact is that many countries are simply unable to afford such critical health technologies. Research has given us many promising early-stage technologies that could make a difference, but tragically, in many cases the promise of such technologies goes unrealized.  I know that it is sometimes tempting to think of global health as a distant goal, far removed from the lives of everyday Americans. But, as the emergence of new pandemic threats such as H1N1 flu reminds us, global health is public health--and it affects Americans right here at home. It is impossible to pick up a paper today, watch TV, or use the internet without realizing that we are more connected than ever before to people around the world.  As I speak with scientists and leaders in my State, they are excited about finding new ways to tackle tough global health problems. I hear the same enthusiasm when I speak with young people who are passionate about helping others. Of course, this growing support for global health can be seen not only in my home state, but throughout our country, in our universities and in community organizations. I know that many of my colleagues in the Senate are dedicated, tireless advocates for global health. Last year, the Congress demonstrated its strong commitment by reauthorizing the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, a huge victory for global health and a strong foundation for future efforts.  In May, President Obama announced a new, comprehensive global health strategy, renewing the longstanding U.S. commitment to global health and building on the successes of programs begun during the Bush administration like PEPFAR and the President's Malaria Initiative, programs that have saved countless lives. President Obama has called for us to continue these efforts and to focus on improving the health of mothers and children and strengthening health systems in developing countries.  Developing countries urgently need technologies that will work for their health care systems, technologies that are easy-to-use, culturally appropriate, and above all affordable.  Today I am introducing the 21st Century Global Health Technology Act to support these goals by applying our country's traditional strengths in research, innovation, and entrepreneurship to global health. My bill will encourage the development of appropriate global health technologies by authorizing efforts at the US Agency for International Development, USAID, to make sure that promising health technologies are not left to sit on the shelf, but instead are developed and delivered to those in need.  Developing global health technologies is not easy or glamorous and the financial incentives for businessare few. But for many years, the USAID has supported global health technology development through an innovative model that encourages the public, non-profit, and private sectors to work together.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill because the USAID has a long and inspiring track record of success in technology development. For example, the USAID's HealthTech program meets a wide range of needs from developing tools to rapidly diagnose infectious diseases to designing safe delivery kits that keep mothers and newborns healthy. Working with non-profit and commercial-sector partners, HealthTech has investigated over 100 technologies, licensed or transferred 21 life-saving technologies designed for use in low-resource settings, and moved 10 technologies into global use.  The HealthTech program helps the USAID leverage Federal money to encourage the private sector to become involved in the fight to improve global health. In an average year, HealthTech matches the USAID's funding with cash and in-kind contributions from the private sector. The average ratio of private sector investment to USAID funding in HealthTech-developed technologies that have reached commercialization is about 9 to 1. It's a win-win model that increases the number of affordable global health technologies and provides new opportunities for U.S. companies.  Technology development at the USAID is a smart investment. However, the agency's technology development efforts currently are not authorized, so funding is often uncertain. That uncertainty prevents the USAID from pursuing many promising technologies. My bill will provide $5 million per year over 5 years to support technology development at the USAID--a small, but steady source of funding that will bring greater stability to technology development efforts and encourage more private sector partners to get involved.  Investing in global health technology is the right thing for the U.S., for our companies, for our bright young people who are pursuing careers in global health, and for our security since our well-being is linked to our ability to prevent global pandemics and to reach out to people around the world. But, most importantly, investing in global health and in affordable health technologies will save millions of lives. It is simply the right thing to do.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1591       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Global Health      Technology Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The United States has committed to the United Nations      Millennium Development Goals of--       (A) reducing child mortality;       (B) improving maternal health; and       (C) combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.       (2) The goals described in paragraph (1) cannot be reached      without health technologies and devices to diagnose      infectious diseases and reduce disease transmission.       (3) The development, advancement, and introduction of      affordable and appropriate technologies are essential to      efforts by the United States to reduce deaths among the      world's most vulnerable populations, particularly children      and women in the developing world.       (4) A recent report by the Institute of Medicine on the      commitment of the United States to global health--       (A) recommends that United States institutions share      existing knowledge to address prevalent health problems in      low- and middle-income countries;       (B) recommends continued support for partnerships between      the public and private sectors to develop and deliver health      products in low- and middle-income countries; and       (C) urges the United States Government to continue its      support for innovative research models to address unmet      health needs in poor countries.       (5) Investments by the United States in affordable,      appropriate health technologies, such as medical devices for      maternal and child care, vaccine delivery tools, safe      injection devices, diagnostic tests for infectious diseases,      and innovative disease prevention strategies--       (A) reduce the risk of disease transmission; and       (B) accelerate access to life-saving global health      interventions for the world's poor.       (6) Through a cooperative agreement, known as the      Technologies for Health program (referred to in this section      as ``HealthTech''), USAID supports the development of      technologies that--       (A) maximize the limited resources available for global      health; and       (B) ensure that products and medicines developed for use in      low-resource settings reach the people that need such      products and medicines.       (7) The HealthTech cooperative agreement--       (A) facilitates public-private collaboration in the      development of global health technologies;       (B) leverages public sector support for early stage      research and development of health technologies to encourage      private sector investment in late-stage technology      development and product introduction in developing countries;       (C) benefits the United States economy by investing in the      growing United States global health technology sector,      which--       (i) provides skilled jobs for American workers; and       (ii) enhances United States competitiveness in the      increasingly technological and knowledge-based global      economy; and       (D) enhances United States national security by--       (i) reducing the risk of pandemic disease; and       (ii) contributing to economic development and stability in      developing countries.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to authorize a health technology      development program that supports coordinated, long-term      research and development of appropriate global health      technologies--       (1) to improve global health;       (2) to reduce maternal and child mortality rates; and       (3) to reverse the incidence of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and      other diseases.
