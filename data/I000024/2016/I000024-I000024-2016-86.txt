That response raised an interesting follow up question I would liketo ask. If EPA's final Section 6(a) risk management rule includes a restriction or prohibition on some of the conditions of use identified in EPA's scope of the risk evaluation, but not all of them, is it final agency action as to those other conditions of use?
