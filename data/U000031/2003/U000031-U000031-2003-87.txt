Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated and selfless individual on the eve of his retirement from public service, Kalamazoo's Al Heilman. Since 1968, Al has served with great distinction the citizens of Kalamazoo in a number of capacities--from being first elected to the County Board in 1968 to having served as City Commissioner since 1995.  Many words come to mind as one reflects upon Al Heilman's public service to our community. He is selfless, generous, giving, caring, humble . . . the list goes on. Al is widely known for his extensive charitable gestures, often giving both money and time to local individuals, businesses, universities, and the community as a whole. There is no question that Al's dedication and contributions to the city will be missed.  Now, Al can ``retire'' to pleasing folks with his other trade--as owner and operator of Heilman's Nuts and Confections. As a member of the business community, Al Heilman will continue to be a part of our everyday lives.  Our community is in debt to Al Heilman for his continued public service since 1968. 1 wish him and his family all the best as he departs public service. Al's contributions to our community have been many, and we are all better off from his service. For those that know him, his name alone helps define public service. All those that have met him, like him. All those that know him, love him.                          ____________________
