Speaker, as a Representative from Ohio and as the senior woman in the House, I join my remarks to those of former Congresswoman and now U.S. Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski, in tribute to her incredible service.  When I first arrived, she was a Member of this House, and I remember how gracious she was to me. Her background from working class, blue collar America--from a steel town like Baltimore, which has transformed since then--brought the concerns and the passion of someone from the working class. She continued on that road every single day whether she was here on the House side or went to the other body as the longest-serving woman in U.S. history. Imagine that.  Baltimore is famous for having little steps that people go into their bungalows from, and she took a giant leap. Even though she was probably still one of the shortest Members of Congress physically, she remains one of the tallest women in American history. I think of her when I look at the dome of the Capitol, and I see the woman facing east--the symbol of liberty. She held aloft high not just the flag, but the vision for an America inclusive of all.  We wish her Godspeed in the years ahead. I maintain my fond memories of her and of her incredible leadership on every subcommittee on which she served and of the honorable service that she provided not just to the citizens of Maryland, but to our entire country.  God bless you, Senator Mikulski, your family, your friends, and those who value your service beyond measure.                          ____________________
