 President, let me say to the majority leader, we are anxious to move this bill to completion as well. We understand the desire of the manager of the bill to turn his attention to the farm bill, which has not yet been marked up. I am on that committee, and I understand his interest in being able to do that.  Let me just reiterate, there is going to be plenty of cooperation on this side of the aisle to complete the Labor-HHS bill at the earliest possible time. I encourage our Members who have been offering amendments and are going to be offering some more to come down and let's do it today.
