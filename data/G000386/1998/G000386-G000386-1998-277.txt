 President, on Saturday, April 18, 1998, an article ran in the Rochester Post Bulletin in Rochester, MN that illustrates very well the tremendous child care challenges facing families. This is a story about a child with disabilities and her parents who are having increasing problems finding quality child care. Mr. President, I will ask that this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Mr. President, at the age of six months, this young child--Christina Barth--developed infantile spasms or epilepsy. Christina is not alone. More than two million Americans have some form of epilepsy. More than one fourth of them are children under the age of 18.  Upon her diagnosis, Christina was treated with many different types of medication. Unfortunately, none of the treatments worked successfully. Then, at the age of three, Christina underwent a partial lobotomy on the right side of her brain. The surgery successfully treated her disease for almost two years. But then, the symptoms developed on the left side of her brain. Since that time, Christina has lived with epilepsy.  Now Christina is 11 years old. She attends a special education class at Gage Elementary School. She functions on the cognitive level of an 18-month-old child. Her family hopes and prays that a cure for epilepsy will be found someday.  Like most other families with special needs children, Christina's parents face daily challenges in caring for their child. Identifying high quality child care is among the most difficult challenges her parents face.  Finding a child care provider--whether it be a commercial day care center or an in-home care giver--is becoming more and more difficult. This point was made by a witness who recently testified before the Finance Committee about the challenges of finding child care for a child with disabilities.  Most child care providers tend not to enroll special needs children because often the child needs one-on-one care. And, the fear of the unknown presents an added risk to an already demanding job.  In Christina's case, a state funded agency has helped her family locate an in-home care giver that cares for Christina while her parents are at work.  But, Mr. President, access is only the first hurdle in finding child care. Quality is equally important. Unfortunately, in Christina's case, her child care providers have not been adequately trained to handle or even recognize when Christina has an epileptic attack.  At one time, Mr. President, the agency that placed the providers with Christina called her parent's to warn them of an employee and told them to call the police if she came to their home.  This raises a question Mr. President. Who is watching the watchers?  Mr. President, in the national debate about child care it seems to me that not enough is being said about the challenges facing families with children who have disabilities.  Child care policies must address issues of access and quality as it relates to special needs children. Many of the bills introduced this year do not address special needs issues. In fact, Senate bill 1610 asks for more than 20 billion dollars through fiscal year 2003 to improve the affordability of child care and an additional three billion dollars through fiscal year 2003 for enhancing the quality of child care and early childhood development. However, there are no provisions regarding an increase of availability, affordability, and quality Of child care for children with special needs.  It is our duty, Mr. President, to make sure that these special needs children and their parents have the same opportunities as other children and families. Today I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure that children with special needs are not left out or forgotten in any legislation regarding child care that comes before this Congress.  Mr. President, I ask that the article from the Rochester Post Bulletin be printed in the Record.  The article follows.       Special Needs Child Care Is ``Accident Waiting To Happen''                            (By Mary Divine)       Julie Sauer's daughter was only 6 months old when she began      shaking and quivering uncontrollably. No reason, no      explanation.       For the next two years of her life, little Christina Barth      experienced almost constant seizures, said Sauer, a lab      technician at Mayo Clinic. Finally, when she was 2\1/2\,      Christina underwent a partial lobotomy at UCLA's Medical      Center.       Christina, now 11 and a student at Gage Elementary School,      is mentally disabled and has an intractable seizure disorder.      She functions at the level of an 18-month old child, Sauer      said.       Because of her special needs Christina needs specialized      child care, child care that Julie Sauer said isn't available      in Rochester.       ``Our dilemma is finding child care for her before school,      for non-school days and for the upcoming summer vacation,.''      Julie Sauer said.       Sauer and her husband, Bob Sauer, the owner of Rochester      Drain-Rite, have been in touch with the School-Age Child Care      program. Child Care Resource and Referral, Arc Olmsted      County, Hiawatha Homes and a home day care provider. Child      Care Resource and Referral found that area day care centers      and School-Age Child Care did not have enough staff to      provide the one-to-one care Christina requires, Julie Sauer      said.       ``If only there were a place that was capable of taking      care of her, like a day care center,'' Julie Sauer muses as      she strokes her daughter's hair.                          Unsatisfactory care       Since the beginning of the school year, the Sauers have      relied on before and after school care provided by a personal      care attendant. But the Sauers say the care isn't      satisfactory.       ``We had five new people in one week.'' Bob Sauer said ``We      have people who never even showed up.''       The turnover in staff is confusing to Christina, Julie      Sauer said. ``She doesn't want to     get off the bus because she doesn't know them.''       If a snow day is called, the Sauers panic.       But they panic on other days as well. Once, they came home      to find blood on the carpet and a shower rod in the upstairs      bathroom ripped from the wall. Christina was fine, but the      personal care attendant on duty that day was never allowed      back into their home.       Often, they have Bob Sauer's daughter from a previous      marriage watch the personal care attendant who is supposed to      be caring for Christina.       ``Sometimes I think that it's Christina who should be      watching them,'' he said.       One attendant didn't realize Christina was having a seizure      until Sauer's son told her, Sauer said.       ``We have strangers coming into the house who just don't      have a clue,'' he said. ``There have been people in this      house that we have never met. Once, they called and warned us      about one of the PCAs. They said, `If she comes to the door,      don't let her in. And if she will not leave, call 911.' It's      an accident waiting to happen.''       Julie Sauer has written area legislators about the lack of      child care for special needs children.       Hiawatha Homes provides respite care, but the children must      stay overnight to be reimbursed by the state, she said.       ``I want to take care of my daughter for as long as I      can,'' Julie Sauer said. ``I am not looking for money to pay      for someone to take care of my daughter, only help in finding      a place that will be equipped for special needs children in      our community.''                         Shortage of employees       Tom Davie, director of Community Education, oversees the      School-Age Child Care program, which serve some special-needs      children.       ``Our challenge becomes one of having adequate staffing''      he said. ``We have taken children who have not required one-     to-one care. Many times, because of our numbers, School-Age      Child Care is not the best choice for a child with special      needs.''       Arc Olmsted County used to provide a day care program for      children with special needs, but the organization      discontinued it, said Buff Hennessey, Arc's executive      director.       About 3 percent of the population is identified as having a      developmental disability, she said.       ``There are home health care agencies that provide PCA      services, although a couple are no longer providing services      to families with young people,'' she said. ``There are      reimbursement problems and then with the way the labor market      is. Our industry as a whole has a crisis shortage of      employees. There have been efforts to train additional      providers, but the numbers have been pretty limited.''       Hennessey said some families have given up employment      opportunities to have one parent stay home with the special-     needs child.       That's not an option for the Sauers, both of whom work      full-time, they say.       ``We want to raise her as much as we can,'' Bob Sauer said,      ``but our options are to put up with this or give her up      completely.''                          ____________________
