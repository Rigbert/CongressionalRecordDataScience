Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  It is precisely what the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) has been saying all night. We want the venue to be a Federal district court in Florida to look at this critical matter from beginning to end to determine what has been missed. There is a benefit of the doubt here that goes to Terri. She ought to get it. We do not think she has gotten it. Let the court decide.
