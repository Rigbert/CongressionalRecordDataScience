Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication arid contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Chuck Beaty is one of these individuals.  Chuck Beaty's career has been dedicated to education and community service. In 1961, Chuck received his B.S. in Education from the University of Kansas. While he was working towards his Master's in History and Political Science, at the University of Missouri, he taught American History and Literature at a local junior high school. After receiving his M.A. in 1965, Chuck became a high school social studies department chairman and teacher for 3 years.  In 1984, Chuck became Riverside's Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and was responsible for several department managers. He was promoted to Deputy Superintendent 2 years later and was the District representative to Riverside's Task Force 2000. During this time he also served as the Acting Superintendent and was responsible for the administration of a 31,000 person ADA school district.  After serving in the educational field for 32 years, Chuck was elected to represent Ward I of the City of Riverside. He retires after a decade of leadership and service to the community of Riverside. He is also a member of the American Historical Society, the Association of California School Administrators, the Riverside Association of School Managers, and the Social Studies Supervisors Association. One of his true passions in Riverside has been for the Evergreen Cemetery.  In 1998, a former Riverside City employee broke into the Riverside City Council Chamber during a meeting and seriously injured several people including Chuck. Despite this incident, Chuck persevered and continued public service. His courage and devotion demand our deepest respect and gratitude.  Chuck's tireless passion for education and community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. Chuck has been the heart and soul of many educational institutions and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
