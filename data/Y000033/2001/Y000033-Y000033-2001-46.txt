Mr. Chairman, I would say that the language that the gentleman refers to is included to allow the House of Representatives to continue planning for future contingencies and continuity of operations.  Section 809 of the bill, which the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) is also concerned with, is intended to allow the Architect of the Capitol to acquire facilities such as a new Capitol Police headquarters and command and control center, which they desperately need. The language is intended to relate to events of September 11 and is not intended to usurp your committee's authority, and we will certainly work with the gentleman through this process.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) very much for his observations.  It is my intention in a moment to ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment; but before I do, would the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) like to be yielded to?                              {time}  1715
