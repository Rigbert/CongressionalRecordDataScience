Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7. Quite simply, the aim of this legislation is to encourage more community-based solutions to social problems in America. When implemented, it will provide some truly life-changing opportunities to many individuals struggling in our communities across the country.  It says that faith-based organizations should no longer be discriminated against when competing for Federal social service funds because of a misconstrued interpretation of current law by some, and that we welcome even the smallest faith-based organizations into the war against desperation and hopelessness.  As a result, new doors will be opened to the neediest in our communities to receive help and assistance that they seek. This is a wonderful and compassionate goal that most, if not all, should be able to embrace. In fact, H.R. 7 could very well improve our culture in ways that we have not seen in decades.  The concept of Charitable Choice is not new. Federal welfare reform in 1996 authorized collaboration between government and faith-based organizations to provide services to the poor. Charitable Choice has allowed religious organizations, rather than just secular or secularized groups, to compete for public funding. Many faith-based organizations have been providing services to their community, but with government funding they are able to create new programs and expand existing ones.  For example, the Cookman United Methodist Church in Philadelphia has created a program of ``education, life-skills, job placement, job development and computer literacy, and children and youth services'' with their Federal funding. By testing new solutions to the problem of poverty, the Cookman Church has used Charitable Choice funds to expand their program of needed services into a much larger and more meaningful one for their community. They have done this under existing Charitable Choice law in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, which allows them to help those in need without having to hire lawyers to create a separate secularized organization and without having to rent expensive office space outside their neighborhood church.  There are literally hundreds of other programs like that of the Cookman United Methodist Church that have benefited thousands of persons in need without raising constitutional concerns in their implementation. These organizations are striving to make a difference in communities all across America.  It is a tragedy that those who move to help others by the strength of faith face added barriers to Federal social service funds based upon misguided understandings of the Constitution's religion clauses. Often it is those whose earthly compassion has the deep root of faith who stand strongest against the whims of despair. Different rules should not apply to them when they seek to cooperate with the Federal Government in helping meet basic human needs.  Some of our colleagues have raised constitutional objections to this legislation. I believe that those objections, while sincere, are misguided. Charitable Choice neither inhibits free exercise of religion, nor does it involve the government establishment of religion. It simply allows all organizations, religious or non-religious, to be considered equally by the Government for what they can do to help alleviate our Nation's social ills.  Unfortunately, it has become all too common for faith-based organizations to be subject to blanket exclusionary rules applied by the government grant and contract distributors based upon the notion that no Federal funds can go to pervasively sectarian institutions. However, the Congressional Research Service concluded in its December 27, 2000, report to Congress on Charitable Choice: ``In its most recent decisions, the Supreme Court appears to have abandoned the presumption that some religious institutions are so pervasive sectarian that they are constitutionally ineligible to participate in direct public aid programs. The question of whether a recipient institution is pervasively sectarian is no longer a constitutionally determinative factor.''  The pervasively sectarian test under which the patronizing assumption was made that religious people could be too religious to be trusted to follow rules against the use of Federal funds for proselytizing activity is, thankfully, dead. However, its ghost continues to linger in many of the implementing regulations of the programs covered by H.R. 7, and, unfortunately, in the rhetoric of many of H.R. 7's opponents.  For those with constitutional concerns, I also ask them to consider the changes to H.R. 7 that were adopted by the Committee on the Judiciary and just amended in this bill with the self-executing rule. These changes firm up the constitutionality of the bill and expand the options of individuals to receive government services from the type of organization they are most comfortable with.  To begin with, the bill now makes clear that when a beneficiary has objection to the religious nature of a provider, an alternative provider is required that is objectionable to the beneficiary on religious grounds, but that the alternative provider need not be non-religious. This same requirement appears in the Charitable Choice provisions of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. If, of course, a beneficiary objects to being served by any faith-based organization, such a beneficiary is granted a secular alternative.  Existing Charitable Choice law contains an explicit protection of a beneficiary's right to refuse to actively participate in a religious practice, thereby ensuring a beneficiary's right to avoid any unwanted sectarian practices. Such a provision makes clear that participation, if any, in a sectarian practice, is voluntary and non-compulsory.  Further, Justices O'Connor and Breyer require that no government funds be diverted to religious indoctrination. Therefore, religious organizations receiving direct funding will have to separate their social service program from their sectarian practices. If any part of the faith-based organization's activities involve religious indoctrination, such activities must be set apart from the government-funded program, and, hence, privately funded.  The bill as reported out of the Committee on the Judiciary now contains a clear statement that if any sectarian worship instruction or proselytization occurs, that shall be voluntary for individuals receiving services and offered separate from the program funded.  Also the bill now includes a requirement that a certificate shall be separately signed by the religious organization and filed with the government agency that disperses the funds certifying that the organization is aware ofand will take care to comply with this provision.                              {time}  1230  The amendment also makes clear that volunteers cannot come into a federally funded program and proselytize or otherwise engage in sectarian activity.  The Committee on the Judiciary also changed the bill to include a subsection to permit review of the performance of the program itself, not just its fiscal aspects. This amendment is needed to prevent an unconstitutional preference for faith-based organizations, as secular programs are subject to both types of review.  One of the most important guarantees of institutional autonomy is a faith-based organization's ability to select its own staff in the manner that takes into account its faith. It was for that reason that Congress wrote an exemption from the religious discrimination provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for religious employers. All other current charitable choice laws specifically provide that faith-based organizations retain this limited exemption from Federal employment nondiscrimination laws.  An amendment adopted by the Committee on the Judiciary replaced existing language in H.R. 7 with the same language used in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton, with an additional clause making clear that contrary provisions in the Federal programs covered by H.R. 7 have no force and effect. This additional clause was not necessary in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act because it codified charitable choice rules for a new program, whereas H.R. 7 covers already existing programs that may have conflicting provisions.  This amendment is offered to avoid any confusion. The language of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act did nothing to ``roll back'' existing civil rights laws, and that same language is used in this amendment.  It is important for all to understand that this bill does not change the antidiscrimination laws one bit, either with respect to employees or beneficiaries. Faith-based organizations must comply with civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, age and disability.  Since 1964, faith-based organizations have been entitled to the Title VII exemption to hire staff that share religious beliefs; and courts, including the Supreme Court, have upheld this exemption. Do the critics of those laws really want to revoke current public funding from the thousands of child care centers, colleges and universities that receive Federal funds in the form of Pell grants, veterans benefits, vocational training, et cetera, because these institutions hire faculty and staff that share religious beliefs?  Remember, one of the primary goals of this legislation is to try to open opportunities for small entities that take part in Federal social service programs. It is particularly important to maintain this exemption for small faith-based entities, because they are the types of community organizations we hope will be encouraged by this bill to seek involvement in delivering social services. These small entities are not going to go out and create new organizations and staff that provide these services. So we do not want to force them to advertise, hire new people and possibly be sued in Federal court for a job they would like to be filled by people already on staff, namely, people who share their religious beliefs.  One of the most revered liberal justices in the history of the Supreme Court, William Brennan, recognized that preserving the Title VII exemption where religious organizations engage in social services is a necessary element of religious freedom.  In his opinion in the Amos case upholding the current Title VII exemption, Justice Brennan recognized that many religious organizations and associations engage in extensive social welfare and charitable activities such as operating soup kitchens and day care centers or providing aid to the poor and the homeless. Even where such activity does not contain any sectarian instruction, worship or proselytizing, he recognized that the religious organization's performance of such functions was likely to be ``infused with a religious purpose.'' He also recognized that churches and other entities ``often regard the provision of social services as a means of fulfilling religious duty and providing an example of the way of life a church seeks to foster.''  Charitable choice principles recognize that people in need should have the benefit of the best social services available, whether the providers of those services are faith-based or otherwise. That is the goal: helping tens of thousands of Americans in need.  We are considering today whether the legions of faith-based organizations in the inner cities, small towns and other communities of America can compete for Federal funds to help pay the heating bills in shelters for victims of domestic violence, to help them pay for training materials teaching basic work skills, to help them feed the hungry, and to provide other social services to help the most desperate among us.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, even those initially opposed to H.R. 7, to join me today in voting for this bill and the expansion of charitable choice.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
