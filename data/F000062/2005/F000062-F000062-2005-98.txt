 President, I rise today to voice my concern over apparent discrepancies between the administration's rhetoric with respect to our treatment of detainees, and the clear reality of the situation.  We all agree, I hope, that individuals in the custody of the United States must be treated humanely. We certainly agree that under no circumstances must American military and government personnel engage in torture. That is why we ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture in 1994.  And that is why Senator McCain's provision prohibiting the use of ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment'', and adopting the Army Field Manual as the standard for interrogation procedures passed the Senate as part of the Defense appropriations bill by a 90 to 9 vote on October 5. It was also unanimously adopted to be included in this Defense authorization bill.  Senator McCain's amendment simply makes it clear that the Convention Against Torture applies without geographical limitation.  It states that conduct that is unacceptable on U.S. soil is also unacceptable in Guantanamo Bay, in Abu Ghraib, or anywhere else the United States government may be holding detainees.  President Bush has repeatedly stated that captives are to be treated humanely, and just this week he reiterated his policy that:       In this effort, any activity we conduct, is within the law.      We don't torture.  And yet, the administration, led by Vice President Cheney, has been making a great effort to lobby Members of Congress to alter the McCain provision by exempting the CIA and members of the intelligence community from its prohibition on torture.  According to Human Rights Watch, the language he circulated on October 20th proposes that:  ``Subsection (a)''--that is, the prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment --``shall not apply with respect to clandestine counterterrorism operations conducted abroad, with respect to terrorists who are not citizens of the United States, that are carried out by and element of the United States Government other than the Department of Defense and are consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and treaties to which the United States is a party, if the President determines that such operations are vital to the protection of the United States or its citizens from terrorist attack.''  Why? The President has stated that it is not his policy to torture. We all know the catastrophic effects that even the appearance of impropriety in this area has on the image of the United States abroad. We know the irreparable harm that reports of abuse and secret detention centers do to our war effort. And, we know that torture does not produce good and effective intelligence. So why fuel that fire by enacting a specific exemption to our long-standing policy of humane treatment?  Earlier this month, the Washington Post reported that the CIA has been ``hiding and interrogating'' its most valuable prisoners at so-called ``black sites'' at several locations in Eastern Europe and Asia.  If this is true, it would allow the intelligence community to engage in ``unconventional'' interrogation procedures at secret locations outside of Congressional oversight or military directives on the treatment of prisoners.  Earlier this week, I wrote a letter to the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee requesting that the committee conduct hearings into these allegations that the CIA is holding prisoners in ``black sites'' around the world.  The Senate Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over the entire intelligence community. And therefore, it is critical that it have access to all information and material related to these disturbing allegations.  Moreover, I believe that the committee must do a better job with its oversight responsibilities, particularly as they relate to detention, interrogation, and rendition activities by our intelligence agencies.  The fact is that our policy to date with respect to detainees has been confused, and that that confusion has led to disturbing allegations of abuse and even torture.  The Senate has already acted to clarify the rules by passing the McCain amendment. I have heard it argued that this will somehow ``tie the hands'' of the President in his prosecution of the war, but I strongly disagree.  In the first place, the President himself insists that detainees should be treated humanely. We are simply acting to codify his policy.  Secondly, the Constitution is perfectly clear with regard to the authority for regulating the United States military: that authority lies with the Congress.  Some claim that the Founding Fathers intended the executive branch to have a free hand in prosecuting this Nation's wars.  But their consideration and deliberation on this issue resulted in Article VII, Section 8 of the Constitution, which states that Congress shall have the power to ``make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water,'' and also ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.''  It is clear that this administration has been inconsistent and mistake-prone in regulating the Armed Forces with respect to the treatment of detainees.  There is the case of Captain Ian Fishback of the 82nd Airborne Division, who attempted for 17 months to determine what regulations were in force.  He determined that, years after President Bush had declared that all prisoners, regardless of their Geneva status, were to be treated ``humanely,'' the definition of what constituted humane treatment was still being left to individual commanders.  He reports:       We've got people with different views of what ``humane''      means and there's no Army statement that says ``this is the      standard for humane treatment for prisoners to Army      officers.'' Army officers are left to come up with their own      definition of humane treatment.  The results of this lapse are well documented. Even the Pentagon's own reports are highly critical:  The Taguba Report found ``numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses,'' which the report described as ``systemic.''  Along the same lines, the Mikolashek Report examined 94 cases of confirmed abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, and found that ``ambiguous guidance from command on the treatment of detainees'' was a contributing factor.  Further, the Fay-Jones Report implicated 35 soldiers, including the top two military intelligence officers at Abu Ghraib prison, in 44 cases of abuse.  So the problem goes far beyond a ``few, isolated bad apples.'' Decent, hardworking American soldiers simply do not know how they may or may not treat their captives.  I note that on Tuesday, the Department of Defense released a new directive banning the use of unmuzzled dogs in interrogations, or to harass or intimidate prisoners. I welcome this directive, but it is too little, too late. The ban comes after dozens of confirmed reports of soldiers using dogs to intimidate inmates of Abu Ghraib, and it is limited in scope and details.  The McCain amendment would give a clear baseline standard of human rights, which all Americans will always recognize--the rights which our Founders believed were inalienable rights; the rights they chose to enshrine in our Constitution.  It is not for the Vice President, or anyone else for that matter, to circumvent those rights in the name of fighting terrorism.  This week the White House Press Secretary, Scott McClellan, tried to justify the exemption, saying, ``You're talking about people like Khalid Shaykh Muhammad; people like Abu Zubaydah.''  I agree that these are terrible men, but we must also consider men like Mr.Dilawar, an innocent taxi driver who was beaten to death in Afghanistan.  We are talking about thousands of innocent Iraqis rounded up in sweeping neighborhood raids and systematically abused.  And we are talking about their friends and families, and an entire generation of young people around the world who are watching and judging the actions of the United States.  If we fail, in their eyes, to live up to our ideals, if the promise of America is reduced to self-serving hypocrisy, then I fear we will breed more terrorists than we can ever stop.  In fact, the scale of the problem is such that the narrowly-focused Pentagon reports do not provide us an adequate picture.  In conclusion, let me state this--it is essential that we answer these three fundamental questions:  Is our current policy legal?  Is it moral?  And does it work?  From my work on this issue in the Judiciary Committee and Intelligence Committee, I fear the answer to all three is ``No.''  I believe that Congress did not intend to permit torture abroad when it ratified the Convention Against Torture. The overwhelming support enjoyed by Mr. McCain's amendment is evidence of that.  Furthermore, I do not believe that violating fundamental human rights is ever justified.  There are some absolutes in this world, and some activities that the United States simply cannot condone.  I am convinced that our detainee policy has been a costly failure. Far from making us safer, the aggressive interrogation of terror suspects has served to breed more terrorists, and to make us more vulnerable to attack.  Should Congress refuse to statutorily codify the legal and humane treatment of prisoners, we risk endangering those Americans who become prisoners themselves.  We must set an honorable example for the entire international community; to do otherwise would be a betrayal of the values we hold dear.  American values, such as the humane treatment of detainees, are truly at the very core of this debate.  We must not fail--America's future will rest on it.                           Amendment No. 2519  Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment introduced by Senator Levin and several colleagues that formulates our military strategy and foreign policy in Iraq.  We need clear, defined benchmarks that lay out how and when we can begin a structured downsizing of the 160,000 Americans currently serving in Iraq.  Increasingly, Americans are demanding answers about how we intend to transition sovereign control of Iraq to the newly elected government.  If we do not heed the call of the American people, popular support for this war will continue to wane.  We must have a well-reasoned approach that will allow our Armed Forces to remove themselves from the constant crossfire between Sunnis and Shia.  As we look forward, I believe the parliamentary election on Dec. 15 represents one such opportunity.  For the first time in history, the Iraqi people will have democratically elected their permanent leaders to serve full 4-year terms. Their constitution, problematic as it may be, has been adopted, and it is time for Iraqis to take greater control.  A growing perception is that U.S. military forces buttress the Shiites. As a result, we pay a high cost, in lives lost and casualties.  We need to change course to remove ourselves from being the literal and figurative target of Sunni enmity.  Frankly, this battle cannot be won militarily by American forces.  A structured downsizing of our presence in Iraq will not only take our service men and women out of harm's way, but it will also force Iraq's religious and political leaders to confront the insurgency and find a balance of power acceptable to Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds.  The first and primary impetus for transitioning our forces will be a better trained Iraqi Security Force.  Ultimately, the Iraqis will have to defend themselves and confront the insurgency, both militarily and politically. The question is when.  Training of the Iraqi Security Forces has been too slow, and the administration has been less than forthright about the capabilities of the Iraqi troops on the ground.  In the interim period ahead, U.S. forces may continue to have a significant role to play, especially in the areas of training and rebuilding infrastructure. But this requires a change of focus for American troops from leading combat missions to buttressing and backing Iraqis as they seek to quell the insurgency and growing violence.  For starters, we need to increase the number of U.S. military personnel providing initial training to the Iraqi forces from the current 1,200. This number is frankly inadequate, and raises questions about our military's priorities in Iraq.  This does not necessarily mean that all Iraqi forces will be trained to the level of U.S. forces--that is unlikely--but the real benchmark is for Iraqi units to have a basic level of training and equipment to safeguard their towns, cities and communities.  The Pentagon recently estimated that an additional 125,000 Iraqi security personnel will be needed to bring total endstrength to 325,000.  If it is going to take a force of 325,000 Iraqis, then it is incumbent upon the U.S. military to prioritize this training and put enhanced efforts into recruiting qualified individuals to serve.  It is only fair to our service men and women, and to their families, if we put every effort into properly training Iraqis so that American troops can come home as soon as possible.  America needs to change course, reassess its mission in light of this escalating insurgency, place more responsibility on Iraq for a negotiated settlement, and begin a structured drawdown of American forces.  This structured drawdown must come in the form of a consistent, planned strategy. This amendment uses the word ``redeployment,'' which I frankly believe is confusing.  Our military leaders must establish a framework for a careful, cautious removal of our troops from Iraq, in conjunction with the rising number of trained Iraqis.  This might mean the removal of 10,000 American troops for every 20,000 trained Iraqis, or a similar but concrete formula.  Certainly, we should prioritize what troops are most needed in the training process and begin to drawdown our endstrength in other areas.  This amendment rightly requires the President to report regularly on American policy in regards to Iraq and our military operations there.  The administration needs to define and lay out an endgame.  The Levin provision ensures that Congress will be receiving regular updates on the administration's strategy in Iraq, and as it must be unclassified, will provide the American people the opportunity to see whether there truly is a plan for success.  Again, I believe it is time to reevaluate our policy and strategies in Iraq.  We have lost over 2,000 American troops, and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died.  Americans are tired of hearing daily about the chaos and violence that has beset Iraq. With American soldiers and scores of Iraqi civilians dying every day, there has to be a better course.  In my view, it is clear that now is the time to consider a comprehensive plan for the structured downsizing of our mission, while we greatly increase the emphasis on training Iraqis to protect themselves.
