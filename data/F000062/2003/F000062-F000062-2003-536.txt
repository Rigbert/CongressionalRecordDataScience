 President, I rise today to introduce this bill with Senator Harry Reid to increase the maximum loan cancellation amount available to credentialed teachers from $5,000 to $10,000.  Educational research is clear: the single most important contributor to raising student achievement is having well-trained, high-caliber teachers in the classroom. And yet, far too many of our Nations' students are being taught by teachers who are not fully credentialed.  This is especially true in low-income communities, where 22 percent of the teachers do not have credentials, more than 10 times the rate in wealthy communities.  Because good teachers can make such a positive difference in the classroom, the ``No Child Left Behind Act,'' signed by President Bush last year, requires States to ensure that all teachers in our public schools are ``highly qualified'' by the 2005-2006 school year. This benchmark, which I believe was long overdue, is one that I applaud and was pleased to support last Congress.  And while we have taken a bold first step by committing that our children will receive quality education from a licensed teacher, our work is far from over.  We must now strengthen our commitment by helping States look for new ways to reach prospective teachers and build quality into their teacher preparation and development programs.  Nationwide, it is estimated that approximately 2 million new teachers will need to be hired by 2009.  This statistic, combined with the reality that roughly 200,000 veteran teachers will need to get their teaching certificate by the 2005 school year or lose their ability to teach, makes it clear that States have an ambitious requirement to fulfill in a short amount of time.  But many States and school districts argue that they lack the resources necessary to fulfill these mandates on their own.  The gravity of this problem is vividly depicted in California, where at least 300,000 new teachers will need to be hired and credentialed by 2008 to replace retirees and to accommodate the projected population growth at a time when the State is experiencing a drastic budget shortfall. All of this must happen during a time when the State is experiencing drastic budget shortfalls. The California State Board of Education projects that all of these changes will cost $6 billion.  The $6 billion price tag does not include the costs associated with credentialing 32,000 emergency credentialed teachers, which is 11 percent of California's entire workforce, by the 2005 school year. This task alone would cost California $365 million.  And none of these cost-estimates take into account the cost of credentialing teachers in other States with high percentages of the teaching work force not fully credentialed.  While I strongly believe that States need to be held accountable for ensuring that all teachers are fully credentialed. But I also recognize that in order for States to meet this Federal mandate on time, many may need guidance and support from the Federal Government.  This is not just a matter of holding those in the local school district or the local schoolhouse accountable; it is also a question of holding those in positions of public trust from the schoolhouse up to the statehouse, and to the U.S. Capitol, too, accountable for making sure that the job gets done.  I believe that this bill takes a good first step in doing just that by creating a balance between State and Federal accountability and addressing two obstacles confronting school districts as they prepare for the 2005 academic year: lack of incentives to lure teachers into teacher credentialing programs early and lack of resources available to teaching institutions to improve and build upon their credentialing curriculum.  I believe that the Federal Government should recognize the value of having a qualified teacher in a low income classroom by enhancing the loan cancellation benefits of credentialed teachers.  Current law allows teachers to receive up to $5,000 of their student loans to be forgiven in exchange for 5 years of teaching in a low-income school. Unfortunately, few teachers have taken advantage of this program because of the low loan cancellation amount available to them in comparison to the length of service required for eligibility.  To encourage recent graduates of teacher licensure programs to enter and remain in the teaching field, this bill doubles the maximum loan cancellation amount to $10,000 for credentialed teachers teaching for five years in a low income school.  And while uncredentialed teachers would continue to be eligible for loan forgiveness available to all teachers under the current law, the enhanced benefits for uncredentialed teachers will expire on December 31, 2005, just in time for the mandated deadline set for all teachers to be fully licensed.  The second element of my bill authorizes grants to institutions of higher education to create and expand credentialing programs. Funds would be made available to colleges and universities to develop and implement teacher preparation programs including curriculum development that focuses on credentialing teachers.  I strongly believe that teachers desiring to become credentialed should have every resource available to them to do so. These components are meant to complement State programs already available to credentialed teachers, which aim to improve teacher quality and tenure.  To California's credit, since the 1999-2000 school year, 5,000 emergency credentialed teachers have been successfully placed in State-backed teacher preparation programs. And the State is working to create and improve teacher preparation programs that include relevant course work, classroom training, and mentoring by a veteran teacher, with a goal of full credentialing.  But this is not happening in every school district nationwide and it must, States and local school districts should work together to prioritize available funds to set up programs to ensure that every teacher within their district is adequately trained.  States must continue to look for innovative ways to keep qualified teachers in the classroom, especially in low performing school districts, and funnel available Federal funds to local initiatives to get emergency certified teachers into credentialing programs.  We as a Nation must continue to make providing quality education to our children a top priority. Passing legislation is just the first step. With the expected population growth and the need to replace teachers approaching retirement, States must act swiftly and aggressively to ensure that neither children nor teachers are left behind.  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important piece of legislation that would give States and teachers the necessary resources to ensure that every teacher is a ``highly qualified'' teacher. Our Nation's students deserve nothing less.                                 ______                                       By
