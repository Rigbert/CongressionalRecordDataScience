 President, that statistic makes the point. Two of the three people who know most about the transportation problems in this country are right here in the Chamber now, and the Senator from New Jersey is one of them. Ten thousand additional flights. We are having trouble keeping airports open during certain hours so people cannot have them interfere with their living standard and the quality of life. Where are they going to go, and why are we doing this? Why are we failing to make this small change in flexibility?  I never impugn the motive of anybody on this floor. But I must tell you in my 23 years here I have not run across many lobbies that are more powerful than the highway lobby, than the cement folks and the asphalt folks. There is nothing bad about them. But I think they are being incredibly shortsighted here in terms of not allowing this flexibility. I think in the long run, in 2 years, or 10 years, the public is going to say, ``Enough, I do not want a 17-lane highway running by my house.''  To combat this growing concern, Mr. President, these CMAQ funds, that the States receive as part of their highway funds, could be used for Amtrak, at the discretion of the Governors, if they chose to mitigate congestion and to carry the same number of people with less pollution and cars on the highways. Surely, this would be an appropriate use of those funds, a use currently denied the States.  In addition to those provisions, Mr. President, this amendment would permit States to enter into interstate compacts to support the Amtrak services. For example, the Presiding Officer is from the great State of Washington. You cannot very well get a train to go to Washington coming from Chicago unless you get the folks in the Dakotas, Montana, and Idaho to let it get there. There is no other way to get it there. If they do not have the ability to come up with the funds to provide for that train coming through, then it is a problem.  So it allows, if they so choose, the States in the Northwest to enter into a compact if they want those trains to move from Chicago to the State of Washington with more frequency. States come up with their own money, come up with the money they want out of their highway funds, if they decide to do so.  In the long run the answer to Amtrak's financial problems are not solved by this amendment. It will come from clearly defined, dedicated sources of funds supporting capital means. That is the only way out for Amtrak.  I must say that I am pleased to note that Senator Roth has taken an amendment that he and I supported, and has drafted just such a bill which has come out of the Finance Committee which he chairs. I look forward to working with him, and dealing with that bill on another occasion in the near future. It has to do with setting up a trust fund, a very small one, so that Amtrak will have the funds it needs for necessary capital improvements. The Senator from Montana supports that as well.  But, Mr. President, this flexibility proposal was taken out I think for very shortsighted reasons--not for lack of support of Senator Chafee, who stood his ground as long as he could in this conference. It was dropped because the House was adamant in refusing to give the States the needed flexibility to manage their transportation needs the way they should do best. As a matter of fact, the chairman in the House on this committee, a gentleman from Pennsylvania, a very, very tenacious, very good Congressman, works very hard, even resisted to consent to the entreaties of his Governor telling them he needed this. And so I in no way am suggesting that the Senate did not try its best to hold this provision.  The House just adamantly refused to give the States flexibility. So much for the revolution. So much for the devolution of power away from Washington to the States. Here we have an example on the limits of revolutionary fervor; it ends when the committee is threatened with a tiny, marginal loss of authority or it ends where important interests to the highway community decide they want it to end.  The Senate language that was dropped would not spend one dime of additional State or Federal money--not one dime of additional money. It would not require the States to spend any funds on Amtrak, not a single penny, if they did not want to. It would not change any formula for distributing or allocating transportation funds among the States. It would not affect the amount of annual Federal transportation funds States now receive individually or in total.  The bottom line is the Senate amendment simply permitted States to use funds they already qualify for in a way that is not currently permitted. Current restrictions on the use of Federal transportation funds would be removed and Governors around the country would be able to use those funds as they see fit, including in support of intercity rail services provided by Amtrak, if this amendment were to prevail. In very congested areas, particularly in urban corridors along the east and west coasts, but in other areas as well, adding more highways in certain areas is simply not an economic or environmental option. Keeping an Amtrak route open on existing rail right-of-way, which is much more cost effective and safer and cleaner than buying land to construct even one more lane on a major interstate highway, is the way to go. The increasing flexibility provided by the Senate amendment is fully consistent with the major goals of the national highway safety bill before us today and with ISTEA, the landmark legislation that calls for a National Highway System designation.  The need for enhanced State flexibility is clear. I find it fascinating that my colleagues, some of whom spoke today, colleagues who I have great respect for from wide open spaces of the West, from Montana and Wyoming, talk about the need for us to consider their specific needs and afford them flexibility, allowing them to have a highway speed limit higher than might be appropriate in the middle of Philadelphia County in Philadelphia, PA, or in the middle of Newark, NJ.  I understand that and appreciate that, but I have always found it difficult to understand how they cannot appreciate the problems of urban States where it makes much less sense for us to go out and build additional highways than it does for us to allow the States to have flexibility to use some of those moneys, designated portions of them, for the purpose of making sure we meet air quality standards, safety standards, and the transportation needs of the people of our State.  Let States decide. Let States decide. This is the mandate set out in both the House and Senate budget resolutions which we are going to hear a lot about today. Let the devolution of power occur; send it back to the States.  This whole thing is also a mandate that sets out for Amtrak authorizing legislation that we are going to take up very soon.  The first stage of this new authorizing legislation for Amtrak was announced last December with major routes elimination taking place effective in April, frequency reductions in the selection of routes throughout the country that will be completed this coming October.  The bottom line is more States will have less service in areas that they need and that they could very well be willing to use highway funds to keep. As a result, many communities across the country find themselves with little or no interstate rail service, and the Governors of those States know that intercity rail is an important option for small towns without air service as well as for congested commuter corridors. They know that intercity rail supports commerce and is an important component of the modern national transportation system.  Last June, I entered into the Record a letter from Governor Dean of Vermont, Governor Thompson of Wisconsin, Governor Engler of Michigan, Governor Carper of Delaware, and subsequently Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania, Democrats and Republicans alike, asking for this flexibility.  Among the authors of that letter were Governors who had already committed their own State general revenues to support intercity rail routes and at the same time they had surpluses in their Federal transportation program that they are prohibited from using, that is, money that went back to the States they could not use because they did not want to build more highways. I said, ``Can't we use that for this?'' They said, ``No, you can't.'' So they are required to go into the general funds of their States. That seems to me to be counterproductive. Many States have confirmed the importance of Amtrak.  Today, Mr. President, I have a letter from those same Governors, joined by Governor Allen of Virginia, another Republican, along with additional letters from Governor Whitman of New Jersey, reinforcing their support for the Roth-Biden amendment in the Senate version of the National Highway System bill. These letters were sent in October, unfortunately to no avail. They were sent to Congressman Shuster, chair of the House Transportation Committee and leader of the House conferees. I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 October 20, 1995.     Hon. Bud Shuster,     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and          Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Shuster: As you continue to work with the      Senate towards completion of the National Highway System      bill, we want you to be aware our strong support for the      right of states to use their federal transportation funds for      rail passenger service. The so called ``Roth-Biden''      provision which was included in S. 440 by a vote of 64-36 has      our full and enthusiastic support, and we urge you to support      its inclusion in the final NHS bill.       As you are aware, under present law, we are not able to      make use of our federal highway or transit funds for rail      passenger service. Enactment of this provision will provide      states with the ability to decide what transportation system      best meets their needs and to allocate their federal funds      accordingly. In this time of severe budget constraints at all      levels of government, it is essential that we empower state      and local officials to make the best use of scarce federal      resources.       We view this inclusion of the Both/Biden provision in the      final version of the NHS bill as an extremely positive step      in the direction of achieving a higher level of state choice      and a more balanced transportation system. We look forward to      working with you to ensure this result.           Sincerely,     Gov. Howard Dean.     Gov. George Allen.     Gov. Gaston Caperton.     Gov. John Engler.     Gov. Tom Carper.                                                                    ____                                          State of New Jersey,                                    Trenton, NJ, October 20, 1995.     Hon. Bud Shuster,     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and          Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
