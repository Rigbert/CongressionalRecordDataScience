 President, if I may just add, my friend from Illinois is absolutely correct. This is a regime which I have been following for a long time, having introduced the first Burma sanctions bill some 4 to 5 years ago.  He is absolutely right. They engaged in this kind of activity back in 1988, killed a significant number of Burmese citizens simply seeking to have an opportunity to express themselves, which they subsequently did in the 1990 election, which Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy won overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, after which she was placed under house arrest and has been there virtually the entire time since then, since 1990. She was under house arrest while her husband passed away in London.  This is a pariah regime. Had they had nuclear weapons, I think the rest of the world would have been a lot more interested in this regime, as we have been, for example, in North Korea and in Iran. But they are now revealing their true colors once again. Technology is much better today than it was back in 1988. They will not be able to engage in these kinds of abuses with no one noticing.  I commend my friend from Illinois for making clear that all of us here in the Senate, regardless of party affiliation, condemn this behavior and look forward to the day when the election of 1990 is finally honored.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
