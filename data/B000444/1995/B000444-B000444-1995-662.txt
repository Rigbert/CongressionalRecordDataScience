 President, I thank the Chair.  Mr. President, yesterday, or maybe even the day before yesterday, I responded to an assertion that I thought was overbroad--not made by the Senator from Idaho but by another Senator--as to what was within the constitutional authority of the Congress to delegate or not delegate in terms of legislative power. Mr. President, I got into this discussion about the constitutional issue and separation of powers issue, of how much we could and could not delegate and whether or not particular sections of this legislation, in fact, exceeded the constitutional authority we had to delegate power.  Before I begin this colloquy, I want to thank the Senator from Idaho and his staff for spending the time with me and going through it. Mr. President, this bill adds a new section to the Budget Act, section 408(C). That section, as I understand it, provides that a simple majority point of order shall lie against any authorization bill that imposes a mandate unless the authorization bill provides for the possibility that the Appropriations Committee may not appropriate the estimated cost set forth in the authorization bill to pay for the mandate.  Section 408(C) provides that the authorization bill must deal with that eventuality by designating a responsible Federal agency and by establishing criteria and procedures for that agency to scale back the mandate to match the funds that the Appropriations Committee has provided, or to declare the mandate to be in effect.  Now, let me ask my friend from Idaho, what would happen under this provision, and the provision I am referring to is section 408(C), if an authorization bill imposed a mandate, named a responsible Federal agency to implement the mandate, but did not provide any criteria at all for the agency to use in scaling back the mandate or declaring it ineffective? Would a point of order in section 408(C) lie in that case?
