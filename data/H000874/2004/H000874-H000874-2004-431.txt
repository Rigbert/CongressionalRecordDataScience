Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), my friend, the distinguished majority leader, for the purpose of informing us of the schedule.  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the distinguished minority whip for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules, and a final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. At 11 a.m. a joint meeting of Congress will convene to receive Spanish President Jose Maria Aznar. Following President Aznar's speech, we plan to consider H.R. 3030, the Improving the Community Services Block Grant Act.  Finally, to accommodate scheduling demands next week, similar to those that we have this week, the House will not have votes next Thursday or Friday.  I thank the gentleman for yielding and would be happy to answer any questions he may have.
