 President, I have been informed by my staff that the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, headed by Christopher Cox, a former Congressman, has reiterated a few minutes ago to our Banking Committee staff that they will be done with this work in a few weeks. This is premature, the amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina. As I said earlier, I believe we need to let the SEC and PCAOB do their work. I agree with Chairman Dodd.
