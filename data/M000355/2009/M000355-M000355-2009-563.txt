 President, yesterday the Nation and the world witnessed the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the next.  While this now seems normal and fair, the idea that a head of state would relinquish his power willingly amazed many when George Washington willingly stepped down as commander-in-chief.  Two centuries later, that idea serves as one of the strongest principles of our democracy.  I congratulate President Obama, Vice President Biden, and their families.   I am proud to say that the Commonwealth of Kentucky was well represented during this week's historic celebration.  My office received thousands of requests from Kentuckians for inauguration tickets. While we only had about 400 tickets to give out, many more came for the event and for the celebrations.  The inauguration of the country's first African-American President is truly a reason for the whole country to celebrate.   It is no secret I wish he were a conservative Republican, but regardless of party, this is a proud moment for our country, and I congratulate him and his family. And I hope his beautiful daughters come to like their new home.  America certainly will face many challenges ahead, and the Congress will work with our new President to find solutions.  Where the President seeks to cut wasteful spending, reduce the national debt, provide tax relief for working Americans, or work towards energy independence, he will have Republican support.  When he works to tackle big issues, and does so by listening to and taking into account all sides he will find enormous support here in the Capitol.  And to help get his administration off to a smooth beginning, the Senate yesterday confirmed seven Cabinet-level positions.  Today we will consider the nomination of a fellow Senator, Mrs. Clinton, as Secretary of State; more nominations will be considered in the days ahead.  It is my intent that Congress and the new administration can work together to find solutions that are equal to the moment. Confirming these administration nominees is a good step in that direction.  Now that the balls and parades are behind us, the hard work of governing lies ahead. I am eager to get started doing the business of the American people.                       Nomination of William Lynn  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, on Tuesday our Nation witnessed the historic swearing in of President Barack Obama. President Obama has nominated Mr. William Lynn to the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense. In this time of war and economic crisis, the U.S. Senate has endeavored to rapidly take up the nomination of Mr. Lynn, as well as many other senior nominees to the Obama administration, to provide our new President the ability to begin his work with key members of his team from the outset.  Last week, Mr. Lynn faced the members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services in a hearing conducted to vet Mr. Lynn. I attended that hearing and posed questions to Mr. Lynn. The day prior I also visited privately with him to discuss his nomination.  I have significant concerns about the message the nomination and confirmation of Mr. Lynn will send within the Department of Defense and across the Federal Government. While I will not object to Mr. Lynn's confirmation by the U.S. Senate today, I feel it important for me to express my concerns as a matter of record.  Following service in various defense ``think tanks'' and as a Senate aide, in 1993 Mr. Lynn joined the Department of Defense as an executive, first as Director of Program Analysis and Evaluation. In 1997 he was promoted to be the Department's Comptroller, where he served until 2001 when the Clinton presidency concluded.  After a short stint as a consultant, Mr. Lynn made a decision that many DOD executives before him have made. He decided to accept a senior position in defense industry, where his expertise, experience and contacts within DOD were greatly sought after and valued. Specifically, Mr. Lynn joined the defense giant Raytheon as a senior executive handling management and government relations.  Mr. Lynn has served with Raytheon since that time and continues there pending his confirmation today. Importantly, it appears that Raytheon substantially improved the integrity of its government contracting operations during Mr. Lynn's tenure, a time when Raytheon also built itself into the fourth largest defense contractor in the U.S. and the fifth largest in the world.  On repeated occasions in this body, I have expressed my deep concerns with the revolving door between industry and government. Those concerns are amplified when I speak of DOD, which is well known for its wealth of ``insiders'' and its closeness to the military-industrial complex. It is not uncommon to hear people speak of the fact that DOD is an insider's game. Some try to explain away this insider's notion by claiming that the complexity of DOD and its weapons and services buying operations require these types of relationships. Even as I acknowledge the complexity of the DOD operation, I tend to believe this ``special knowledge'' concept is a double-edged sword which at a minimum can lead to an appearance of impropriety.  Returning to Mr. Lynn, it is clear that his case presents a strong example of this industry-government executive revolving door phenomenon. Frankly, we live in a time when many Americans, not just those who watch DOD closely, know of concerns about the relationship of DOD with contractors. More specifically, many believe that defense contractors have the ability to influence DOD decisions for the profit of the contractor but not necessarily for the best interest of DOD or, for that fact, the taxpayer. With this backdrop, setting aside Mr. Lynn's merits, the narrative of his story alone is problematic. Further, it comes at a time when we are vigorously endeavoring to restore public confidence in government.  My concern perhaps might be mitigated were it not for the fact that Mr. Lynn is nominated to what is fairly characterized as the most critical management position within DOD and perhaps the most important position in the making of significant decisions on major defense acquisition programs. In other words, Mr. Lynn will have possibly the most powerful position in the Department to influence how the Department does business with private industry and, in some cases, to influence with whom the Department does business.  To be frank, the way DOD does business with defense contractors must change because the status quo is unacceptable. In part because of Mr. Lynn's recent past, I am concerned that he will not bring the sense of urgency to or, worse yet, see the need for substantial reform in DOD's weapons and services procurement practices. Further, in my limited interaction with Mr. Lynn to date, I have not sensed a strong commitment to this type of change, although I understand he has communicated such a commitment to others with greater vigor.  To be clear, I am not questioning Mr. Lynn's integrity. His integrity has been testified to by many of his present and former colleagues. He is clearly highly regarded by our incoming President and his administration. And I am encouraged by the historic ethics guidelines that President Obama has put in place just today for officials in his administration. I am confident that Mr. Lynn will fully meet the letter of these new rules and act much more broadly in living up to their spirit both in his individual actions and in his oversight of other DOD officials.  Let me close by making mention of the exchange I had with Mr. Lynn at the Committee on Armed Services. I put much of what I have discussed here in regards to my concerns with the revolving door at DOD before Mr. Lynn. I further discussed concerns that he may face a conflict of interest because his former employer Raytheon is a major defense contractor. Mr. Lynn offered a limited response to my question, committing to meet every ethical requirement of the Department of Defense. I have no doubt that he will meet these requirements and frankly exceed them. But Mr. Lynn did not discuss his views on the revolving door at DOD, of the adequacy of the ethical controls at DOD or of any willingness to further study these issues if confirmed. I hope nonetheless that he will take these issues up during his tenure at DOD. I firmly believe that business as usual must come to an end at DOD, both as to these matters and in regards to many more. The chief management Officer at DOD, of which Mr. Lynn will serve, must be a reformer, a disciplinarian, a person committed to change and a person willing to challenge the system in order to drive change.  As stated earlier, I will not oppose the nomination of Mr. Lynn. Even as I have expressed my concerns today, I respect Mr. Lynn and the views of somany of my colleagues and of his former colleagues about his abilities and his commitment to improving the state of affairs in business operations at DOD. I am excited by the opportunity he has before him. And I am optimistic about what he will accomplish alongside many others on the team that will form at DOD. But I will be watching closely because this is my duty to the people of Missouri, to the people of America and to the command of our constitution.                          ____________________
