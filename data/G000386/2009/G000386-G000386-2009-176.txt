 President. I, Senator Chuck Grassley, intend to object to the proceeding to the nomination of Alan D. Solomont to be Ambassador to Spain and Andorra at the Department of State for the following reasons.  I object to the proceeding to the nomination as I have yet to receive a full response to my letter(s) and document request(s). On June 12, 2009, I sent a letter requesting specific documents from the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). Mr. Solomont is the chairman of CNCS's board of directors. My request called for documents relating to the firing of Gerald Walpin, the former inspector general at CNCS. Despite promises to be responsive under Mr. Solomont's leadership, CNCS has complied with my requests selectively, withholding entire categories of responsive documents and refusing to even provide a log to identify the particular documents being withheld and the specific reasons for withholding them.                          ____________________
