President, I rise today to congratulate Robert Stiller, Founder and Chief of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, who has been awarded the ``Entrepreneur of the Year Award'' by Forbes Magazine.  Before establishing success on the national level, Bob owned several retail coffee stores in Vermont and Maine. Unable to afford advertising, he gave away free samples at wine and food festivals and to organizations like the Cub Scouts and Ronald McDonald House. Always in search of new customers, Bob began selling his coffee to high-end restaurants and to gas stations with a goal of serving the same high-quality of coffee at both. That strategy and innovation contributed to his company's growing success.  Stiller's success stems from his willingness to take risks within the business world and his knowledge of modern technological advantages. By investing in innovative packaging tools that extended the shelf-life of their coffee, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters has made significant breakthroughs in modern brewing. They pioneered efforts to do what few coffee vendors have been able to master: keeping convenience store coffee fresh.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters ranks 16th on the ``Forbes 200 Best Small Companies'' list, and sales have continued to grow an average of 24 percent over the last five years. New roasters they recently purchased will allow them to package and sell over 40 million pounds of coffee a year, available at convenience stores, gas stations, supermarkets, offices, and restaurants nationwide. And their stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months, outperforming competitors like Starbucks, and Peet's Coffee & Tea.  Again, I congratulate Bob Stiller and all his employees at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for receipt of the Forbes award. I ask that the Forbes Magazine article, ``Entrepreneur Of The Year: Java Man,'' and a Rutland Daily Herald article, ``Coffee Company, Founder Grab The Spotlight,'' be made a part of the Record.  The material follows:                 [From Forbes Magazine, Oct. 29, 2001]                   Entrepreneur of the Year: Java Man                            (By Luisa Kroll)       Bob Stiller's long-shot bets have turned Green Mountain      Coffee Roasters into one of the smartest small companies in      America.       Don't let his look of blissful relaxation fool you. Robert      Stiller's head is constantly boiling with new ideas, many of      them at odds with those of almost everyone around him. Some      of the ideas lose money. Every now and then one makes a      bundle.       Stiller's first big hit was selling rolling paper on the      drug-sodden campus of Columbia University in the early 1970s.      His brand, E-Z Wider (a little jab at the cult film), had      double the width of competing brands. The paper wouldn't feed      into the machine properly, causing tearing. It was      scientifically processed; Stiller discovered that storing a      bobbin of paper for three weeks in a humidified room      prevented the raw material from ripping. ``People expected to      see potheads, but we were more efficient at paper conversion      than any manufacturer at the time,'' he recalls. E-Z stoked      its sales to $11 million before Stiller and a partner sold      out in 1980, each pocketing $3.1 million.       Twenty years later he still has a knack for      experimentation--in the humble business of selling coffee      beans. Founder and chief executive of Green Mountain Coffee      Roasters (nasdaq: GMCR--news--people), 58-year-old Stiller is      constantly trying out new technologies, backing other      entrepreneurs with untested ideas and taking risks with      suppliers that, on the face of it, appear slightly crazy.      ``Bob has that sense of not what is, but what could be,''      says Nick G. Lazaris, chief executive of Keurig, which makes      coffee-brewing machines and is a partner of Green Mountain.       The road less traveled is strewn with riches. Green      Mountain ranks 16th on the Forbes 200 Best Small Companies      ranking, its second year on the list. Sales have grown an      average 24% over the last five years to $84 million for the      year ended Sept. 30, 2000; earnings per share have been      growing at 43%. In the quarter ended July 7, net income rose      67%. Its stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months,      outperforming those of both Starbucks and a closer rival,      Peet's Coffee & Tea. Stiller's 48.5% stake is worth $89      million.       Green Mountain has put down deep roots near its      headquarters in bucolic Waterbury, Vt. Three of every 10      pounds of roasted beans are sold in Maine, New Hampshire and      Vermont. But this is a national company, deriving 95% of its      revenue from 6,700 wholesale customers that include      convenience stores, gas stations, supermarkets, offices and      restaurants.       Lesson: Don't forsake marketing. if you cant afford it, try      giving away your product.       A born tinkerer, Stiller spent weekends and holidays during      his youth toiling at Stillman Manufacturing, his dad's Bronx,      N.Y. company that made one of the first tubular heating coils      for electric stoves. While still in high school, Stiller      designed one machine that handled milling, cleaning and      threading of a heating element. College was a chore; he      couldn't maintain a C average--or what the college called a      proper attitude--to remain at Syracuse University and ended      up with a degree in business from Parsons College in      Fairfield, Iowa in 1967. He landed at Columbia as a data-     processing manager.       After cashing out of the rolling paper business, Stiller      found himself at his ski condo in Sugarbush, Vt. wondering      what to do next. One night, as he enjoyed a rare cup of      coffee at a restaurant, he woke up and smelled the      opportunity. A couple of days later he visited the small      roaster in Waitsfield, Vt., where the restaurant bought its      beans. For the next few months he roasted his own beans,      using a hot-air popcorn popper at one point, a cookie sheet      at another, brewing batches of coffee for friends. Stiller      ended up buying the Waitsfield store with a partner and      giving the store owner an equal one-third stake in Green      Mountain. Within two years he became the sole proprietor,      buying out both partners for $100,000.       The business seemed doomed from the start. Holed up in an      office over a movie theater, Stiller lent the company $1      million, but still had to pay salaries with credit cards. His      $30,000 line of credit was snatched from him after he went to      the main branch of the bank in search of more money. What      loan officer dared believe in this venture? This was     a decade before Starbucks reached the East Coast, and a      cup of joe was just something to wash down the morning      eggs and toast. Stiller added retail stores in Vermont and      Maine, and insisted on roasting only arabica beans, grown      at higher altitudes and pricier than the robusta variety.      Unable to afford advertising, he gave away samples at wine      and food festivals and to organizations like the Cub      Scouts and Ronald McDonald House. The red ink flowed, $1.4      million cumulatively from 1981 to 1985.       Always on the prowl for new customers, Stiller began      selling to high-end restaurants and specialty stores. He      bought a personal computer and hired a programmer to write      software that traced customers' orders, deliveries and      payments. Ever since, he has invested heavily in technology,      becoming one of the first customers of Praxis, which      developed a program to monitor and adjust heat levels in the      roasters appropriate to each bag of beans. ``Some say there      is an art to great coffee,'' says Stiller. ``I don't care how      artistic you are, there are too many factors in play. You      need the technology.''       Which is why the fellow with the tube-bending machine and      the rolling-paper process has installed $2.5 million worth of      software from PeopleSoft to track distribution,      manufacturing, sales and personnel. At the time this software      project got under way Green Mountain had only $33 million in      sales and was PeopleSoft's smallest customer for the product.      ``Green Mountain,'' says Michael Frandsen, PeopleSoft's      general manager of supply chain management, ``is one of the      most aggressive small companies I've come across.''       As when Stiller ignored the grumbling of some board members      over selling his premium coffee to grungy gas stations. He      thought it was a good way to spread the brand; the trick was      to make sure the coffee at ExxonMobil was brewed as carefully      as it was at New York's Harvard Club. So along with its      beans, Green Mountain bundled services and tools, including      coffee machines, cups, banners and training. Stiller created      one- and two-day courses for customers with instruction about      coffee farming, grinding and filtering. Now ExxonMobil is its      biggest customer, representing 17% of sales last year. Last      November Green Mountain signed a five-year agreement, beating      out 11 rivals, to supply all 1,100 ExxonMobil company-owned      stores and 500 franchise locations.       Another long-shot bet: backing three unknown entrepreneurs      peddling a single-serve coffee system. At the time, they held      the patent on filter-wrapped individual portions of ground      coffee, but had no product ready for market. Stiller invested      $150,000 for a 1% stake in Keurig. Green Mountain patiently      worked with them on product quality and flavor. Finally, in      1998, the Keurig machine rolled into offices like      PricewaterhouseCoopers. Green Mountain, which produces K-Cup      individual packages of coffee at its factory, pays Keurig an      undisclosed royalty based on the number of packages it sells.      Last year K-Cups contributed 15.7% of Green Mountain's      revenues.                              DAILY GRIND       A grower of fancy coffee gets maybe a dollar a pound. How      come you pay $9?

Anxious to expand, he took the company public      in 1993, but couldn't meet Nasdaq listing guidelines and      traded for four years on Nasdaq's minor league system (called      the Nasdaq SmallCap Market). With the $11.5 million raised,      he invested in mail-order catalogs, opened five retail stores      and hired a bunch of seasoned outsiders. He also spent      $500,000 on packaging equipment that flushes out the oxygen      with puffs of nitrogen to improve shelf life.       Stiller wanted to invest now in anticipation of future      growth. Such improvements had a cost. The company lost a      combined $4.7 million in fiscal 1993 and 1994. For ten months      Stiller stopped matching contributions to the 401(k) program,      and imposed a hiring freeze. The bigger growth lay with the      wholesale business. Green Mountain shuttered its 12 stores in      1998, at a cost of $1.3 million.       Lesson: Don't be afraid to increase capacity for a level of      business that doesn't yet exist.       Vermont being Vermont, it goes without saying that Green      Mountain strives for a do-gooder image, giving away 5% of      pretax profits to ``socially responsible'' causes. ``I'm not      doing it because I want to give money away to charities,'' he      confesses. ``What we're doing makes the most business      sense.''       Example: providing startup funding for 100 small-scale      farmers who formed a cooperative in Sumatra, Indonesia. Since      then, production has increased almost sixfold--18% of its      arabica going to Green Mountain. Stiller was one of the early      backers of ``fair trade'' coffee, which pays farmers what      they need to break even and clear a small profit. All this      draws customers like Columbia University and natural food      stores.       Stiller has gradually backed away from the day-to-day      business, acting more as teacher than taskmaster. He      meditates 45 minutes every day and, despite enduring the      occasional pair of rolling eyes, nudges his staff to study      ``appreciative inquiry,'' a management technique developed at      Case Western Reserve University that encourages people to      learn from their successes--what produced a great batch of      roasted beans, for instance, or the last deal that closed--     instead of their mistakes.       Is this still a growth company? Probably not the one it      used to be. The Delta Shuttle will be buying less, and      Starbucks, with help from Kraft, is muscling into the      grocery-store channel. Stiller predicts sales growth will be      15% to 20% next year, below its five-year average. But he's      still a risk-taker. He is spending $2 million for a couple of      roasters, which will boost capacity from 15 million pounds to      40 million pounds a year. It will be a long time before      demand catches up. But Stiller is sure that day will come.                                  ____                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 5, 2001]               Coffee Company, Founder Grab the Spotlight                           [By Bruce Edwards]       An interview with Robert Stiller, the founder and president      of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in Waterbury. Stiller was      recently named Forbes' magazine first ``Entrepreneur of the      Year.'' The magazine also ranked the company as one of the      ``200 Best Small Companies in America.''       Question: When you started Green Mountain Coffee Roasters      in 1981, did you have a vision for the company. And are you      surprised at the success you've achieved?       Robert Stiller: I didn't envision the success the way it      has come about. I felt we may have been further along in      getting the coffee out there because I always felt there      isn't great coffee out there. When people get used to      drinking great coffee, they just don't go back to the      commercial grades. So, I knew that was going to work. I      really didn't envision the awards. I really didn't feel we      would be as strong as we were with the social type of issues      like the organic and the fair trade coffees.       Q: When you think of Vermont you think of maple syrup.      Coffee, on the other hand, is hardly indigenous to the state.      Where did you come up with the idea for a coffee company?       Stiller: Actually, a friend had started a small shop at the      end of 1979 with a couple that had come up from Connecticut.      Their brother had been in the coffee business and they opened      a small shop here in Vermont. I got to know them and I wanted      to expand that concept. I really wasn't much of a coffee      drinker at the time. When I had great coffee, it was like      this is terrific and we wanted to carry that concept further.       Q: What kind of competition do you face? There are      obviously a lot of coffees out there and your coffee is a      premium brand.       Stiller: We provide a better product that people are      willing to pay more for. Sometimes they'll use less of our      coffee than the commercial coffees and get a more satisfying      cup of coffee. There are ways to get around the economics of      it. People will also find it a little bit finer than some of      the commercial grades and get better extraction in the      brewing process. We compete by offering better solutions to      customers, like a supermarket, to sell the product. We      merchandise the coffee better. We work with the staff to      educate them and support the product. A lot of the commercial      companies don't want to get into (that). They just want to      put it on the shelf and have it sell. We differentiate      ourselves by offering the higher levels of service that in      turn provide a value to the consumer.       Q: Where do you buy most of your coffee beans?       Stiller: Central and South America. Also Mexico. We have      other coffees that come from Africa and Indonesia.       Q: What makes the quality of your coffee beans different?       Stiller: It would be the taste profile of that particular      coffee being representative of the area that it comes from.      You want the taste to sort of epitomize where that coffee      comes from. And we are very selective in getting the taste of      that coffee as good as it can be. You also look at the      highest-grade coffees. Each of the countries has a grading      system. And we would also select the highest grades      available. A lot of companies are just interested in the cost      aspect and don't look for the taste profile.       Q: How much coffee do you import each year and is it all      processed in Waterbury?       Stiller: We're about 12 to 13 million pounds of green      coffee a year. We roast all the coffee here and package it      and ship from here.       Q: What's the size of the Vermont operation?       Stiller: In the Waterbury area, we employ about 300 people.      There's a little over 500 in the organization. We have a      90,000-square-foot production, roasting, warehousing      facility. We just purchased a couple of roasters that will      substantially increase our roasting capacity. With the new      roasters we'll be able to roast over 40 million pounds a      year.       Q: Much of your business is wholesale as opposed to retail?       Stiller: We don't have any retail shops. The supermarkets      in some industries define that as retail. The bulk of our      coffee is sold 25 percent through the supermarkets, about 25      percent through the office distributors and then another 25      percent through convenience stores.       Q: How were you able to land these large contracts like the      Exxon Mobil convenience stores, Amtrak and Delta airlines?       Stiller: Mobil came to us over 10 years ago and we got one      convenience store that was right across from a Dunkin'      Donuts. The owner said if you can do anything with this      location I'll talk to you about the rest of the stores. And      we increased the coffee sales of the store about five times.      So we got the rest of that chain, which led to recognition in      the area and we just kept getting more convenience stores.      They tested us against all the other coffee companies and      found that our products did indeed sell better. We offered      better support. And then we signed a contract with Mobil for      five years.       Q: Your company has also come up with some technological      innovations.       Stiller: I think the whole convenience store area was      initiated with our use of air pots or the vacuum pump,      thermal server. Because historically the coffee wasn't able      to be kept fresh at the convenience store level. And with      those servers we were able to offer a variety of coffees with      a much longer shelf life than coffee sitting on a burner.       We were one of the first to recognize the sustainable issue      with coffee. We tried to work with the farms to improve the      farms, the product and the workers. It makes sense from a      business point of view that if the people are taken care of      you're going to have a better product. Nobody that is treated      poorly is going to put their heart and soul into developing a      good coffee.       Q: It appears you followed Ben & Jerry's philosophy of      social responsibility.       Stiller: It's been very important to us. I think it's been      very motivational to people in the company knowing that they      are achieving a greater good in the world through what we do.      We've had sustainable coffees for quite a while. And that led      the industry in organic and fair trade (coffees). We've also      encouraged our customers like Exxon Mobil. It was the first      convenience store on a national level to have an organic      coffee as their coffee of the month. This year they've done a      fair trade coffee.       Q: What do you mean by a fair trade coffee?       Stiller: A fair trade coffee is certified that the farm      that it comes from is a co-op. It's owned by the farmers.      They get a minimum wage. So that they can live off of that.      It's a major factor right now in that coffee is the second      largest commodity behind oil. But unlike oil, coffee is a      product of the people. There are 25 million farmers involved      in farming and developing coffee. And about 75 percent of      them are small farms. So if a farmer can't earn a living and      support a family with coffee, what do they do? They turn to      the government for support or they can turn to other illegal      crops. We're talking about a life and death situation for      these people. The break-even point for coffee is about 85 or      90 cents (a pound). It doesn't pay for them to produce good      coffee. Coffee prices are below 50 cents right now. So a lot      of the work that goes into good coffee is not happening.      Sometimes they will pick coffee four or five times during the      harvest season. Now, they're picking it once because they      can't afford the pickers. This whole fair trade initiative      was really developed to guarantee economic stability for the      farmers and with that almost guarantees more of a democracy      in a lot of these Third World countries because it provides      that economic stability.       Q: Has NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, had      any effect on your business?       Stiller: It doesn't really come into play. I think it's      more for manufactured goods as opposed to agriculture.       Q: You have a director of social responsibility to oversee      that area of the company?       Stiller: I think consumers are looking for more of that      from companies. A lot of the people here are really motivated      to make a difference in the world. They feel it's the right      thing to do.       Q: The economy is either in a recession or close to a      recession. Have you seen any indication of that in your      business? Or is coffee one of those products that consumers      regard as a necessity?       Stiller: It is a necessity. People enjoy it. It's part of      their life. It's an energizing experience. It's reflective in      a sense. You sort of take a break for coffee. And lots of      times ideas come to you with that reflection. In troubled      times, people might drink more coffee. In the overall scheme      of things, there might be a little bit of a downturn but it      wouldn't be very significant.       Q: You've been doing business in Vermont since 1981. Has      the state been a difficult place for your company to do      business?       Stiller: I think it's been a great experience. The Vermont      name has added a lot (of value). I think the people we have      hired are wonderful. There is a real sense of integrity and a      hard work ethic. We haven't had too many problems with the      permitting process. We've always felt supported by state      government and other agencies within the government. The only      issue has been in the banking area where we have had trouble      getting the credit lines from local banks. We went down to      Boston years ago and have been banking out of the      state.                          ____________________
