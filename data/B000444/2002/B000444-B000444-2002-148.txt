 I imagine there are enough people--I don't think that is possible.  The bottom line is I understand the Senator. I do not have the same concerns with any of the rhetoric. The rhetoric of George Bush:       [a]ll of Europe's new democracies, from the Baltic to the      Black Sea and all that lie between, should have the same      chance for security and freedom--and the same chance to join      the institutions of Europe--as Europe's old democracies have      . . . I believe in NATO membership for all of Europe's      democracies that seek it and are ready to share the      responsibilities that NATO brings . . . [a]s we plan to      enlarge NATO, no nation should be used as a pawn in the      agenda of others . . . [w]e will not trade away the fate of      free European peoples . . . [n]o more Munichs . . . [n]o more      Yaltas . . . [a]s we plan the Prague Summit, we should not      calculate how little we can get away with, but how much we      can do to advance the cause of freedom.  That is the most shining rhetoric in here. I am not prepared to support the withdrawal of the President's rhetoric from this legislation.
