 President, today I honor one of our most dedicated leaders, effective advocates and passionate activists for America's children: Ms. Yasmina Vinci. Ms. Vinci is retiring after 11 years as the executive director of the Nation's Network of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, NACCRRA. Ms. Vinci started the Washington, DC office of NACCRRA from her kitchen table with just a telephone and fax machine and built it into a highly respected organization representing more than 860 local and State child care resource and referral agencies.  Ms. Vinci is one of our Nation's most tireless advocates for a high-quality early care and education system designed to serve all children. As executive director of NACCRRA, Ms. Vinci has provided vision, leadership and support to community child care resource and referral agencies and has promoted national policies and partnerships committed to the development and learning of all children. Ms. Vinci has worked diligently to promote quality in child care resource and referral services.  Prior to joining NACCRRA in 1992, Ms. Vinci was the manager of special projects in the New Jersey Department of Human Services where she managed the Dependent Care Grant, coordinated the development of the New Jersey plan for the implementation of the Child Care and Development Block Grant and supervised a number of research, immunization and Head Start-related projects. For nearly 10 years, Ms. Vinci was the executive director of an inner-city child care center, serving 200 low-income families through a continuum of high quality, comprehensive, and family supportive programs.  Ms. Vinci has served on the Boards of the National School Age Care Alliance, the Interfaith Council for the Homeless, United Way and YWCA. She is a current member of the Board of the Alliance for Work Life Progress, the Center for Evidence Based Practices, the Center for Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning and the NOW Legal Defense and EducationFund National Advisory Commission on Child Care and Early Education. In addition, Ms. Vinci has served as a commissioner on the National Head Start Fellowship Commission since its inception.  Ms. Vinci's commitment to children and those who care for them is an inspiration to all who have known and worked with her. Her contributions have made a difference in the lives of many and have built a pathway for generations to come. On behalf of America's children and advocates for children, I thank her for her great work and wish her a rewarding retirement.                          ____________________
