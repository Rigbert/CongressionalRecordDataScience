 Lugar, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 224       Whereas ending the violence and terror that have devastated      the State of Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza since September      2000 is in the vital interests of the United States, Israel,      and the Palestinian people;       Whereas the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict      strengthens extremists and opponents of peace throughout the      region;       Whereas more than 7 years of violence, terror, and military      engagement have demonstrated that armed force alone will not      solve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute;       Whereas the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians want      to put an end to decades of confrontation and conflict and      live in peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity, and security,      based on a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace;       Whereas on May 24, 2006, addressing a Joint Session of the      United States Congress, Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert      reiterated the Government of Israel's position that ``In a      few years, [the Palestinians] could be living in a      Palestinian state, side by side in peace and security with      Israel, a Palestinian state which Israel and the      international community would help thrive'';       Whereas, in his speech before the Palestinian Legislative      Council on February 18, 2006, Palestinian Authority President      Mahmoud Abbas said, ``We are confident that there is no      military solution to the conflict. Negotiations between us as      equal partners should put a long-due end to the cycle of      violence . . . Let us live in two neighboring states'';       Whereas, in June 2002, the President of the United States      presented his vision of ``two states, living side by side in      peace and security'', and has since repeatedly reaffirmed      this position;       Whereas a robust and high-level American diplomatic      presence on the ground is critical to bringing Israelis and      Palestinians together to make the tough decisions necessary      to achieving a permanent resolution to the conflict;       Whereas June 2007 marks the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day      War between Israel and a coalition of Arab states;       Whereas all parties should use the occasion of this      anniversary to redouble their efforts to achieve peace; and       Whereas achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace could have      significant positive impacts on security and stability in the      region: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) reaffirms its commitment to a true and lasting solution      to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the      establishment of 2 states, the State of Israel and Palestine,      living side by side in peace and security, and with      recognized borders;       (2) denounces the use of violence and terror and reaffirms      its unwavering commitment to Israel's security;       (3) calls on President Bush to pursue a robust diplomatic      effort to engage the State of Israel and the Palestinian      Authority, begin negotiations, and make a 2-state settlement      a top priority;       (4) urges President Bush to consider appointing as Special      Envoy for Middle East Peace an individual who has held      cabinet rank or someone equally qualified, with an extensive      knowledge of foreign affairs generally and the Middle East      region in particular;       (5) calls on the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority to      recognize the State of Israel's right to exist, to renounce      and end all terror and incitement, and to accept past      agreements and obligations with the State of Israel;       (6) calls on moderate Arab states in the region to      intensify their diplomatic efforts toward a 2-state solution      and welcomes the Arab League Peace Initiative; and       (7) calls on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to embrace      efforts to achieve peace and refrain from taking any actions      that would prejudice the outcome of final status      negotiations.
