 President, it has become increasingly apparent in today's society that a college education is no longer a luxury. In order for one to succeed in an ever-changing, high-tech world, a college education has become a near necessity.  However, just as a college degree becomes increasingly vital in today's global economy, the costs associated with obtaining this degree continue to soar out of control. At the same time, the annual income of the average American family is not keeping pace with these soaring costs. Since 1980, college costs have been rising at an average of 2 to 3 times the Consumer Price Index. Now, in the most prosperous time in our history, it is simply unacceptable that the key to our children's future success has become a crippling burden for middle-class families.  According to the United States Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, the average annual costs associated with attending a public 4-year college during the 1998-1999 school year, including tuition, fees, room, and board, were $8,018. For a private 4-year school these costs rose to an astonishing $19,970. and these are only the average costs, Mr. President. The price tag for just one year at some of the nations most prestigious universities is fast approaching the $35,000 range.  In 1996, and again in 1997, I introduced the ``GET AHEAD'' Act (Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable). My main goal in introducing this legislation was to help the average American family afford to send their children to college. Although this legislation never came before the full Senate for a vote, I was extremely pleased that a number of the provisions of the GET AHEAD Act--including the student loan interest deduction and the establishment of education savings accounts--were included as part of the 1997 tax bill. Additionally, two other provisions of that bill--the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Credit--were based upon the core proposal of my GET AHEAD ACT--a $10,000 tuition deduction.  The $10,000 tuition deduction is a proposal I have been advocating since I first announced my candidacy for the Senate 28 years ago. Today, I am building upon a proposal the President made in his State of the Union address earlier this year and am introducing legislation which would finally fully enact this proposal.  The legislation I am introducing today will provide America's middle class families with up to $2,800 in annual tax relief for the costs associated with a higher education. This plan will give families the option of taking either an expanded Lifetime Learning Credit or a tax education of up to $10,000.  Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, current law allows many American families to claim the Lifetime Learning Credit, currently a tax credit of up to 20 percent on the first $5,000 of higher education expenses--meaning a tax credit of up to $1,000 per family per year. For 2003 and after, this will increase to a credit of up to 20 percent of the first $10,000 of higher education expenses--meaning a credit of up to $2,000 per family per year.  The bill I am introducing today will expand this important tax credit to 28 percent on the first $5,000 of higher education expenses through 2002--amounting to a credit of up to $1,400. For the year 2003 and after, this will increase to a credit of up to 28 percent on the first $10,000 of higher education expenses--amounting to a credit of up to $2,000 per family per year. To give families the flexibility to choose the best approach for their own circumstances, my plan will give families the option of deducting these higher education expenses instead of taking the tax credit.  My legislation will continue to ensure that these important educational tax breaks help support middle class families while increasing the income thresholds to $60,000 per year for individuals and $120,000 for couples.  Mr. President, the dream of every American is to provide for their child a better life than they themselves had. A key component in attaining that dream is ensuring that their children have the education necessary to successfully complete in the expanding global economy. It is my hope that this legislation will help many American families move a step closer in achieving this dream and being able to better afford to send their children to college.                                 ______
