Speaker, well, with little notice or fanfare, a modest tax benefit for families who are struggling to help their kids get a higher education expired this year. It was what is called an above-the-line deduction, up to $4,000 towards tuition could become an above-the-line deduction.  Now for a family with $40,000, $50,000 income, that would be worth about 1,000 bucks off their taxes, not insignificant when they are straining on that income to try and help their child get an education, get ahead, realize the American dream.  But the Republican majority, being the fiscal conservatives they are, said it was too expensive. We could not afford to renew this modest tax benefit for middle income families to give them a little help with tuition for their kids. Now, well and good.  When you see their budget that they have pulled from the floor for the third time in 3 weeks, they are going to pass a budget, probably next week, that will have America borrowing $1.4 billion a day, a lot of it from foreign sources.  It will have a lot of us borrowing from this year's Social Security surplus, $193 billion, and spending it onother things other than Social Security, in part to give tax cuts to wealthy Americans. Also buried in their budget is the fifth increase in the debt limit in 5 years. Fiscal conservatives that they are, they are hiding it in the middle of their budget because they don't want people to see it, another $600 billion increase in the debt limit to nearly $10 trillion.  That is quite an achievement. Nearly doubling the national debt in 5 years is something that they could write home about, but they don't want the people at home to know. So I can understand their concerns.  But, wait a minute, oh, no. We just passed a bill to give $70 billion in tax breaks to wealthy investors. Now, where is that money going to come from? Oh, well, they say tax breaks pay for themselves, especially when you give the money to rich people.  This particular piece of work extends a tax break that wasn't going to expire until 2008. The college tuition deduction has already expired. Middle income families can't get it next year, but wealthy investors were worried that starting in 2009 or 2010 they might have to pay the same percentage of their investment earnings, their unearned income, as people who work for a living.  The Republicans said that would just destroy the economy of America. Those investors are the heart blood of our country, not the people who work and build the country; no, they have got to pay higher rates of taxes, but the people who can invest for a living.  What does their $70 billion tax break do? Well, someone who earns $5.3 million, $82,000 tax relief. They really need it too at $5.3 million, hard making ends meet. You know, their Hummer, 3 bucks a gallon of gas for their Hummer too. Well, maybe it is a limousine driven by a chauffeur, but who knows.  How about the retired CEO of ExxonMobil, $400 million, that is what he got, just retired. Well, this bill gives him an extra $2 million off his tax bill. It was going to be hard for him to maintain his lifestyle in retirement with only $400 million in retirement. So the Republicans feel that working people should borrow $2 million to give to him an additional little tax benefit.  But for a family earning a good income, 75,000 bucks, it is worth $110 a year. So the family that earns $75,000 is going to get up to $110 tax benefit under this. But the retired CEO of ExxonMobil is going to get $2 million, and the family who earns wages and salary at $75,000 is going to pay to retire the debt, because we are borrowing the money to give to the wealthy investors.  How stupid do they think the American people are? How profligate and shameless the Republicans are to do this sort of thing. Help the families who are trying to have their kids get it. That is the next generation of earners. You cannot even extend them a modest tax benefit, but you can shower money on the wealthiest among us, those who need it least.  It is time for new priorities in this Congress. It is time for fiscal responsibility. It is time to give a little bit of a helping hand to middle income and working America and let the rich help carry their fair share of the load.                          ____________________
