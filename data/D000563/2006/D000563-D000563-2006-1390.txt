President, only a little over an hour ago, Lane Evans announced he would not seek reelection in November to the U.S. House of Representatives. I understand his decision. It is a loss for his district, for our State, and for America. From the Quad Cities to Quincy, Springfield, Decatur, Carlinville, and towns in between, Lane Evans is deeply respected and his service will be deeply missed.  For over 20 years, Lane Evans has stood as a beacon of hope and has been a strong voice in his Illinois congressional district.  There are two kinds of courage in this world. There is physical courage, which is rare. Then there is even a rarer commodity, moral courage. Once in a great while you find someone who has both. Lane Evans is that person.  He grew up in Rock Island, IL, the son of a union firefighter. He joined the Marine Corps right out of high school, served during the Vietnam era from 1969 to 1971. After the Marines, Lane went to college, then to Georgetown Law School. He was elected to Congress in a famous upset election in 1982.  For nearly a quarter of a century, the U.S. House of Representatives had Lane Evans, former marine, as a Member of its body. He closed his announcement today the way he closed many letters, with the vow: Semper Fi. Semper Fi, those Latin words that mean ``always faithful.'' Lane Evans was always faithful--first to his fellow veterans. I can't think of another colleague in the House or Senate who worked harder for veterans, whether it was the Vietnam era Veterans Congressional Caucus which he chaired, his work with Senator Tom Daschle on Agent Orange, his dogged efforts to find out what was behind Gulf War Syndrome, helping homeless veterans, helping veterans find jobs, expanding VA home loans, trying to find health benefits for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, and, of course, working with the vets at the Rock Island Arsenal.  Like others who served his country in uniform, Lane Evans was a man of peace. He worked to ban landmines which maim and kill thousands. He hung a portrait of John Lennon in his office, he said, because he thought John Lennon was often a better reminder than many people he met in Congress of the hopes of working-class young people for peace and freedom.  What a champion for America's workers. After the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War ended, Lane Evans said we could not abandon workers at places such as the Rock Island Arsenal, men and women who helped to win the Cold War. He fought for fair trade. He saw what happened in Galesburg when Maytag closed, costing 1,600 jobs. He fought to make sure America's workers were never left behind. And what a fighter for family farmers and for the environment, for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He was cochairman of the Alcohol Fuels Caucus. He has been a leader in proethanol battles.  But, you know, he was a battler starting early in his career. As a lawyer he didn't take the easy way out to make a lot of money. He was a legal aid lawyer. He fought for people who had no voice in the courtroom, and he came to Congress to make sure everyone had a voice in his congressional district. I have no doubt Lane would have been reelected again if he had chosen to run in November. Now he is fighting a different kind of battle.  Nearly 8 years ago, Lane came out publicly and announced that he had Parkinson's disease. It was a cruel blow. It turns out that I was with him when he discovered it. We were in a Labor Day parade in Galesburg. He was waving and he said he couldn't feel some of the fingers in his hand. He sensed something was wrong. It took a while for the diagnosis to come out. For a man that young to be diagnosed with Parkinson's is unusual. Publicly he announced his disease and started fighting--for stem cell research and for medical help for those who suffer from diseases just like his.  During his last race, in 2004, he told audiences: I may be slow, but I still know which way to go. Living with Parkinson's made him a better Congressman because, ``I can understand what families are going through.'' Time and again, Lane Evans showed extraordinary courage, not just as a politician but as a human being.  His determination to serve his district pushed him to work harder, even as the burden of Parkinson's became heavier. His dignity and perseverance in the face of this relentless and cruel disease is an inspiration to every one of us who counts Lane Evans as a friend. In his statement today, Lane Evans said:       I appreciate the support of people I never met before who      would ask how I was doing and tell me to keep up the good      fight.  The truth is, Lane Evans, his whole adult life, has been involved in a series of good fights. Politicians come and go in the Halls of Congress, but this soft-spoken son of Illinois will leave his mark as a man truly committed to securing the American dream for everyone in our Nation.  Thank heavens for Lane Evans.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Maine.                          ____________________
