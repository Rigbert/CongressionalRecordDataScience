  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, trickle down economics is back. It worked so well before.  We just heard the minority leader: Tax cuts will solve everything. Tax cuts targeted toward the wealthiest among us, the super rich, will have a trickle down effect that will put people back to work and lower the deficit.  That's kind of magic, isn't it?  The Republicans forget that one-half of the so-called stimulus, nearly one-half, was tax cuts. Didn't put anybody back to work. Most people don't know they got them. Eight bucks a week out of your lower withholding.  And guess what?  We borrowed all that money. It will be paid back for 30 years. Now they want to borrow more.  There's two sides to solving the deficit problem in this country. Cut unnecessary spending and, yes, the wealthiest among us are going to have to pay a little bit of their fair share by repealing the Bush tax cuts on those folks.  They want to deny that. They want to say, oh, we can have the cake and eat it too. We'll lower revenues and we'll balance the budget.  Now, if you eliminated the entire Federal Government, except for about 60 percent of the Pentagon, no justice, no prisons, no border patrol, nothing, you still wouldn't get to balance. You have to deal with revenue.                          ____________________
