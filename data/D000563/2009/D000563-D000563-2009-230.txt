It turns out, the vast majority of lawsuits involve a very small percentage of doctors, many of whom are making errors repeatedly. I would recommend to my friend from Ohio a book to read, and I know he reads them. It is called ``Complications.'' It is by Dr. Atul Gawande, who is a Boston surgeon with whom we are familiar. I read it, and it was an eye opener about what a surgeon learns and goes through. But he spends a whole chapter in there about doctors and nurses of practicing doctors who are not up to skill anymore because of age, alcoholism, and drug addiction, and they are afraid to speak out.  That is not common. It is rare. But it should not happen at all. Those doctors who consistently make mistakes, consistently get sued, or have these problems should be identified and removed from the practice until they can be rehabilitated or go off to another job.
