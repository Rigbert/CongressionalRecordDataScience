President, I rise today in support of S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.  S. 3711 takes a much needed and long overdue step forward in our Nation's energy policy. For too long we have looked to others to supply our growing demand for energy. Too many of our energy resources are imported from unfriendly and unstable places in the world like Nigeria and Venezuela. We can no longer afford to rely upon the Hugo Chavezes of the world to fill up our gas tanks, heat our homes, or provide fertilizer to grow our crops.  Today we have the opportunity to look in our own back yard for the resources necessary to sustain our economy's growth.  S. 3711 opens roughly 8.3 million acres to oil and gas exploration. An area with roughly 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.26 billion barrels of oil. One sector of our economy in desperate need of increased oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is agriculture.  Mr. President, farm country is struggling to find our next generation of farmers. Agriculture's future depends on motivating young people to enter into a business with increasing input costs and stagnant product prices. Without a revitalized wave of young producers, our Nation's food suppliers will continue to face an uphill battle. Alleviating high natural gas prices is one way to help current producers and entice young farmers to return to the fields.  Agriculture depends on significant amounts of natural gas for irrigation, food processing, crop drying, heating homes and farm buildings, and producing fertilizers which are necessary for plant growth.  For agriculture, natural gas is not just an energy source, but it is also a feedstock in the production of nitrogen fertilizer. Natural gas accounts for roughly 90 percent of the cost to produce one ton of nitrogen fertilizer.  In 2005, natural gas prices rose to $15.00 per million BTU's. In the past 6 years, the U.S. has gone from spending $50 billion per year on natural gas to $200 billion per year.
