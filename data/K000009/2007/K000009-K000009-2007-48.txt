 I wanted to point out that in every year when patents are granted the very small number of lawsuits that are generated as a result of that. For example, in the year 2006, there were 183,000 patents granted; 1.47 percent actually ended up in some type of lawsuit, and most of those lawsuits were settled before trial.  The current system is working very well for the majority of inventors as lawsuits have represented that smaller percentage going back as far as the eye can see.  I would like to place on the Record those facts that, in fact, lawsuits are a minuscule percent of all patents reviewed and granted. And I would also like to place on the Record from the United States Court of Appeals the following letter from the chief judge who states that the present bill creates a new type of macroeconomic analysis that would be extremely costly and time consuming, far more so than current application of the well-settled apportionment law.

Shana A. Winters,     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Ms. Winters: Thank you for your telephone call      yesterday afternoon concerning determining damages in patent      infringement cases under the reasonable royalty language of      the Patent Act. As promised, I have since reviewed some of      the Federal Circuit decisions that address aspects of this      subject, and I have also identified and attached an article      that should help you more than reading individual opinions.      Significantly, it was written by a seasoned patent litigator      with direct experience in how such damage theories are      actually litigated in court. Lawyers employed by particular      companies, like most law professors, have little or no      experience from that perspective. Mr. Rooklidge, by contrast,      has several decades of litigation experience in precisely      these types of cases.       His article was written since late April and may be the      most current available on the subject. It is certainly clear      and comprehensive. In addition, it references some of the      testimony before your subcommittee in April, as well as the      specific language of the pending bills.       The footnotes cite other useful sources you may wish to      consult, including authoritative treatises by practitioner      Robert Harmon and Professor Donald Chisum, and several recent      articles on the point. They provide further background, which      you may find helpful.       If the House Judiciary Committee intends to continue the      damages law as currently practiced, after decades of      refinement in individual court decisions, it need do nothing.      This body of law is highly stable and well understood by      litigators as well as judges. If, on the other hand, the      Congress wishes to radically change the law, I suggest that a      far more carefully-crafted and lengthy provision would be      required. Like the body of caselaw, such a provision would      need to account for many different types of circumstances,      which the present provision does not.       In my opinion, plucking limited language out of the long      list of factors summarized in the Georgia Pacific case that      may be relevant in various cases is unsatisfactory,      particularly when cast as a rigid requirement imposed on the      court, and required in every case, rather than an assignment      of a burden of proof under a clear standard of proof imposed      on the party that should bear that particular burden, and      that would only arise in a rare case. As I said, under      current caselaw, the burden of apportioning the base for      reasonable royalties falls on the infringer, while the burden      for application of the Entire Market Value Rule falls on the      patentee. In most cases, apportionment is not an issue      requiring analysis.       Further, as I also attempted to explain, the present bills      require a new, kind of macroeconomic analysis that would be      extremely costly and time consuming, far more so than current      application of the well-settled apportionment law. Resulting      additional court delays would be severe, as would additional      attorneys' fees and costs. Many view current delays and costs      as intolerable.       In short, the current provision has the following      shortcomings. First, it requires a massive damages trial in      every case and does so without an assignment of burden of      proof on the proper party and articulation of a clear      standard of proof associated with that burden. Second, the      analysis required is vastly more complicated than that done      under current law. Third, the meaning of various phrases in      the bills would be litigated for many years creating an      intervening period of great uncertainty that would discourage      settlements of disputes without litigation or at least prior      to lengthy and expensive trials.       I appreciate your call and your effort to better understand      the gap between current law and practice, and what the bills      would require. I am of course available if you need further      assistance in understanding the reality behind my May letter      to the Chairman.           Sincerely,                                                   Paul R. Michel,     Chief Judge.                                  ____  This gentleman's amendment, as well as the underlying bill, would result in additional court delays that could be severe and would probably result in additional attorney fees and costs, and those additional costs are intolerable. We are actually charging more for inventors to maintain their inventions. We tried to stop that several years ago and were unsuccessful in doing that.                              {time}  1445  And now we are, in this bill, creating a more complicated legal system that is going to cost them more money. We have a system that works. We have the best patent system in the world. We have the most innovation in the world.  I hope this bill goes down to defeat so we can make it much, much better. We had a system where we protect the inventor if they wish to opt out of having their intellectual property put up on the Internet, they have the right to do that. This bill takes that away. It is one of the most egregious parts of this bill that should be fixed.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
