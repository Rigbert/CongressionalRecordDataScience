Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work of the Trust for Public Land (TPL) and commend their staff for their tremendous efforts to protect the pristine land and promote the historic heritage of southern Maryland. As a result of their work with real estate, law and finance experts, business interests, and citizens' groups, we have been able, over the past several years, to conserve natural, historic, and environmental landmarks at Piscataway Park and Myrtle Point.  The motto of the Trust for Public Land is the inspiration which guides the organization. ``Conserving land for people'', is often a very complex, costly, and timely task. However, the TPL has shown that with the right combination of leadership, energy, and commitment, permanent conservation and preservation can be a reality.  Mr. Speaker, in 1793, George Washington wrote of his boyhood home Mount Vernon that ``no estate in the United America is more pleasantly situated than this.'' Dating back to 1955, there have been significant threats to the 18th century scenery which serves as a viewshed across the river in Maryland. For the past several years, I have enjoyed working with the Trust for Public Land to ensure that today a functioning colonial farm, which serves as the perfect backdrop for Mount Vernon, runs along the Potomac River on the Maryland side.  Recently, the Trust for Public Land played an integral role in the effort to save the last undeveloped waterfront property in St. Marys County: Myrtle Point. Due to the services provided by the Trust for Public Land, this 192-acre Patuxent River parcel will be managed as a natural area and public recreational park with waterfront access. They negotiated the agreement between St. Marys County, the State of Maryland, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for more than 1\1/2\ years. In fact, without the leadership and vision of the staff of the Trust for Public Land, this deal might never have come together.  Mr. Speaker, these are just a few examples of the productive role the Trust for Public Land has played in ensuring the protection of our Nation's pristine environment and open space. Since its founding in 1972, the Trust for Public Land has protected close to 1 million acres of land valued at over $1 billion in 44 States and Canada, including 2,000 acres in Maryland.  They have successfully brought together government and private interests in the name of conservation and are to be commended for their efforts and success. I know that my colleagues join me in recognizing their dedication and congratulate them on their many accomplishments.                          ____________________
