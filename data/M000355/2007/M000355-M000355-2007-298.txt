 President, reserving the right to object--and I will not object--there have been a number of people on both sides of the aisle who have been deeply invested in this America COMPETES Act. Several of them will be shortly announced by the Chair as conferees.  Particularly, I want to single out Senator Stevens, Senator Enzi, Senator Ensign, and Senator Coleman, all of whom will be named conferees, and, of course, Senator Alexander and Senator Domenici, who were really the leaders on our side, in conjunction with Senator Bingaman, in developing this important bipartisan legislation.  Senator Alexander kept pushing others forward. But, in fact, we all knew who the real leader on our side was on this issue. He, in a very selfless way, helped move a bipartisan group together to form this important legislation. I commend Senator Alexander in particular for the role he played in all of this.
