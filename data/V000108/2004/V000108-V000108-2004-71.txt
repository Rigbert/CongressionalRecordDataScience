Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana throughout its 50 years of service to the Northwest Indiana community. As the citizens of Lake County, Indiana celebrate the 50th Year Jubilee of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana, we are reminded of the dedication and valiant efforts that have been made to incorporate education and community leadership in the region.  Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana began in the early 1950's when Mr. Paul Guist, Mr. Sid Holub, Mr. Robert Salvaggi and several other Gary businessmen decided that the children of Gary needed a place to go, complete with worthwhile activities, to help keep kids from spending time on street corners. Their efforts led to the incorporation of the Steel City Boys Club of Gary, Indiana on August 17, 1954.  The Boys Club was incorporated in 1954 when it operated in the hallways, auditorium, gymnasium and one room in the old Beveridge School in Tolleston. Its official name became Steel City Boys Club. In 1956, another club opened in the Webster School Gym located in Glen Park. This was the year that the organization also became a United Way Agency. An additional club eventually moved into the basement of the Assyrian Church where it remained until a permanent location at 7th and Adams was established through the efforts of Mr. John Will Anderson of the Anderson Company. Through Mr. Anderson's gift, the Old Moose Lodge building at 7th and Adams was purchased in 1965. Mr. Anderson and the Anderson Company donated the money and manpower to see that the building was completely renovated and ready for operation in October, 1967. The New Boys Club facility officially opened on October 23, 1967, appropriately dedicated as the John Will Anderson Boys Club.  Another Boys Club was opened in 1969 in the Salesian Prep School in Cedar Lake, and in November, 1976 that club moved to West 133rd Avenue. In 1982, the new Cedar Lake Club was built on Fairbanks Street where it remains today. In 1973, Katherine House and the East Chicago Boys Club merged to form the East Chicago-Katherine House Boys Club and became a unit of the Steel City Boys Club organization. In 1976, the John Will Anderson Club moved to the former Young Men's Christian Association building on 5th Avenue in Gary where it remains today. In 1977, the Steel City Boys Club corporate name was changed to the Boys Clubs of Northwest Indiana. In March of 1979, the Hammond Boys Club was established in the Miller School of Hessville, and today a new building built in 1994 proudly stands on Calumet Avenue. The Lake Station Club was opened in July of 2001.  In 1988, Boys Clubs of Northwest Indiana officially changed its name to Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana--as girls were recognized as official club members. In spite of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana's growth and changes, their philosophy has never changed--to inspire and enable all young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana, as well as its staff and community leaders on their 50th anniversary. Their many great accomplishments and service to Lake County, Indiana will forever be cherished and commended.                          ____________________
