President, I rise today to introduce the Healthy Children Learn Act with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. I am also pleased to have Senator Clinton as an original cosponsor of this measure. This legislation focuses on eliminating some bureaucratic barriers that make it more difficult for schools to provide their students with health care services, if they so choose.  Many schools have found that the health of a child can significantly affect his or her ability to learn. To enhance children's learning ability and to increase the well-being of their students, these schools sometimes choose to provide health care services including health care screenings.  One example of a disease that significantly affects children's education is asthma. Asthma is the single greatest reason for school absenteeism today. Over five million children in America suffer from asthma. Forty-nine percent of children with asthma missed school in the last year, and 48 percent of children with asthma are limited in sports and recreation. Lack of physical activity, in turn, can lead to childhood obesity with its concomitant health care problems.  ``America is in the middle of an asthma epidemic--an epidemic that is getting worse, not better.'' So says the PEW Environmental Health Commission in its most recent report on asthma. The prevalence of asthma continues to rise at astounding rates, in every region of the country and across all demographic groups, whether measured by age, race or sex.  My home State of Illinois has some of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. Unfortunately, Chicago has the highest childhood asthma-related death rate in the Nation. Over 60 percent of childhood admissions to the emergency room in Chicago are for asthma. This disease exacts a very significant toll on children in my State.  For the next 15 minutes, imagine breathing through a tiny straw the size of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough air. Now imagine suffering through the process three to six times a day. This is asthma. Can a child really concentrate on learning when he or she is gasping for air?  Due to the very high rates of asthma in Chicago and its effects on absenteeism and children's ability to learnwhen at school, the Chicago Public Schools, CPS, instituted an asthma screening program. The school system developed an asthma manual to provide a standard plan of care for all students with asthma. They provided citywide nurse training to develop a uniform, high standard for approaching students with asthma and their parents and high-quality education about the environmental triggers for asthma and how to lessen them, together with education on how to use asthma inhalers. In 1999, they identified 12,374 cases of asthma. CPS continues to monitor and evaluate this program, and they have also partnered with other organizations such as the American Red Cross Asthma Program, the University of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health Asthma Programs. CPS has also developed parent tutoring programs and has linked asthmatic children with primary health care providers for appropriate follow-up.  All of these efforts are extremely important, but they are resource intensive. This legislation addresses a barrier to children receiving vital health screenings in schools. It provides for a $10 million grant program for school districts such as CPS to apply for funds for asthma screening for those children who are not eligible for either S-CHIP or Medicaid. The grants would be targeted to those districts that have the highest prevalence or deaths associated with asthma.  CPS has also found that a child's ability to learn is affected by impaired vision and hearing, and as a result, children with vision deficits are far more likely to fail academically. In 1998, CPS found that children who were retained failed their school-based vision screening at a rate 50 percent higher than children who were not failing. Likewise, children who have difficulty hearing often struggle with language development, social processes and communication. This can seriously impair all aspects of the educational process. Through these programs, CPS has provided more than 5,000 free eye exams, and 4,000 free pairs of glasses have been dispensed. They currently are reimbursed less than 40 percent of the cost of the vision and hearing screenings. To address some of these funding shortfalls, this legislation creates a $10 million grant program for vision and hearing screening.  This legislation would also remove barriers that prevent school systems from receiving reimbursement for health screenings are services. Schools that make the extra effort to provide their students health care services should be adequately reimbursed. For an example, when they provide Medicaid-eligible children with Medicaid-covered services, they should receive appropriate reimbursement for those services. Likewise, reimbursement for the S-CHIP program should be available for covered services for children enrolled or eligible for the program. and clarifies Medicaid payment rules so that schools can be reimbursed when they provide a Medicaid covered service to a Medicaid child.  No child should have his or her education threatened by the lack of effective screening to diagnose these health problems. The treatments or corrective devices are available and we should see to it that the children receive them when necessary. The Healthy Children Learn Act will help children receive the health care services they need so that they can seize the educational opportunities available to them.                                 ______                                       By
