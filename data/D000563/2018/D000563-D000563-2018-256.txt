President, the Senate today passed the VA MISSION Act, a long overdue piece legislation of that would finally provide an overhaul of the healthcare system at the Department of Veterans Affairs that is desperately needed. The bill wouldstreamline and consolidate community care into a single comprehensive program, standardizing eligibility for this program and repealing the Choice program after 1 year.  The MISSION Act also includes a phasing in of an expanded Caregiver program, so that veterans of all eras can access this important benefit. This is an issue I have long worked on, having helped create the original Caregivers program at the VA. This expansion will likely help thousands of family caregivers.  In addition, the MISSION Act will help the VA better recruit quality healthcare professionals with academic and financial incentives, as well as help ensure access to care in rural and underserved areas.  I understand that there are some concerns about this legislation.  The asset and infrastructure review provision, which has been compared to the BRAC review of DOD facilities, is contentious. I joined Senator Manchin in efforts to pass a version of this without the AIR provision. I am disappointed that effort was blocked by our Republican colleagues, but I also appreciate the efforts of my Democratic colleagues in helping ensure safeguards in the bill around the AIR provision, so that any process includes coordination with and review by Congress, veterans service organizations, the public, and other stakeholders every step of the way.  I also recognize that there is a serious concern about privatization at the VA, a concern that is especially acute under this administration and given the fact that the VA lacks senior leadership.  Congress will need to ensure continued strong funding for the VA so that we are not sacrificing investments in VA infrastructure, direct patient care, medical research, and more in exchange for community care--which will be costly--under the MISSION Act.  We will need to continue to provide oversight during the process of selecting a VA Secretary, one who will balance the need of some veterans to access authorized private care with protecting the VA system. I look forward to meeting with the VA Secretary nominee to assess his qualifications on this and other matters soon.  It is easy for us Members of Congress to speak about this bill on the floor--to thank our veterans and their families for their service--but it is more meaningful, more important to do what we can through action.  Some of my proudest moments in Congress have included efforts to recognize, honor, and thank our veterans, but the very least we can do for our veterans is to ensure they get the care they need.  I have been working with my colleague, Senator Duckworth, to help ensure that veterans and their spouses at the Illinois Veterans Home at Quincy receive high quality care, because, for the past 3 years, IVH Quincy has been dealing with several Legionnaires' outbreaks, outbreaks that have sickened more than 65 and, sadly, killed 13.  It is unacceptable that 13 veterans died from contracting the Legionella bacteria before this Governor finally produced a comprehensive plan of action.  I have worked with and will continue to work with State and Federal officials to ensure that IVH Quincy has the technical and financial support it needs.  Let me close with this: The VA MISSION Act reflects this sentiment as well--too often, our servicemembers return home only to find themselves facing challenge after challenge, suffering from the physical and mental wounds of war. This bill will help ensure that we uphold the promise we have made, to provide the care, support, and respect our veterans have earned and deserve.  I want to thank my colleagues Senators Isakson and Tester for their good-faith efforts on this bill. I am pleased to join them and others in the Senate in supporting this legislation.
