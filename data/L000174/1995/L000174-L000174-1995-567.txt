President, I thank the Chair. I will be very brief.  I would like to respond to some comments made by the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, a few minutes ago on his conversation with the Vice President of the United States earlier today. I checked with Vice President Gore, and I am told that he did not tell Senator Pressler that the President would veto the telecommunications bill.  The Vice President told the distinguished Senator from South Dakota that he would like to see changes in certain provisions of the bill before he could recommend it to the President for his signature. I mention this because only the President issues veto threats, as the Vice President pointed out.  But the Vice President is not the only person who is concerned about certain provisions of this telecommunications bill.  The telecommunications bill that the Commerce Committee has reported will have an enormous impact on multi-billion-dollar cable, phone, and broadcast industries, and the economy of this Nation.  It was introduced just 3 days ago, and the report explaining what the Commerce Committee had in mind with this complex bill was filed late Thursday night.  This bill is a far different bill from S. 1822, which was reported last year.  First, this bill allows RBOC entry into long-distance phone service without a formal Department of Justice role in analyzing the competitive impact.  Second, I have questions about taking the lid off cable rates, and whether sufficient attention has been paid to the special problems of small, rural cable companies.  In fact, I suspect virtually every person that is on cable in this country would have some concern about just taking the lid off the cable rate, because I have not met many cable users who feel they are not paying too much.  Further, I have questions about some provisions in the bill that preempt State laws on judicial review of State [[Page S5119]] regulatory commission decisions, and on dialing parity for intra-LATA calls.  Finally, I am concerned that some provisions in this bill undercut privacy protections for online communications and law enforcement's ability to conduct necessary court-authorized wiretapping to fight crime.  As ranking member on the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, these are questions on which we should have a hearing. There has been no hearings on the final version of S. 652 that was just introduced. These are issues that the people of Vermont deserve time to look at and consider, before the Senate rushes into consideration.  I have no interest in delaying telecommunications reform, and hope that we pass much-needed legislation in this session of Congress. But I do want time to make sure that any legislation we pass is the best we can make it. We owe this to the American people and the industries involved.  I think there are issues that should be answered.                         the daschle amendment
