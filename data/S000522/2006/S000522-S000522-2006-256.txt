Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two very special people while offering my prayers and warmest wishes for their quick return to full health.  Stephen and Mary Petrilla are 50 year residents of Hamilton Township--the largest municipality in my congressional district in central New Jersey. As teachers, parents and local residents, they live quiet but influential lives, earning the respect and devotion of their students, neighbors, and fellow parishioners at Saints Peter and Paul Parish in Trenton, New Jersey. Their family and friends are inspired by their faith, kindness and commitment to helping others.  Mr. Stephen Petrilla is a veteran of the United States Army and was injured while serving his country in the line of duty. He is a member of the American Legion, the DAV and the Elks.  For nearly 75 years, Mr. Petrilla dedicated his life to the field of education, helping children in either a teaching or administrative capacity. A former administrator for two training schools in New Jersey, his expertise and passion focused on special education, helping children with mental retardation and working to ensure that State and local governments did more to meet the needs of our precious children who face special challenges.  Mr. Petrilla organized and directed shelter workshops for challenged children across the State and later worked as a special education teacher in Lawrence Township and at Sister Georgine's Learning Center in Trenton. His inspiring commitment to helping children has been recognized through various honors including being named a Fellow in the American Association of Mental Deficiency and being featured in various Who's Who publications including Who's Who in the East, 1979, and Who's Who in Child Development Professionals, 1976.  Mrs. Mary Petrilla has been a constant source of love and support for her husband and her children, while also distinguishing herself in the teaching profession. After receiving her bachelor of arts degree at St. Joseph's, Mrs. Petrilla began working as a teacher eventually advancing her way to become one of the first female elementary school principals in the Pennsbury School District. She also taught adult education classes in Trenton while serving as a private tutor. For 20 years, Mrs. Petrilla served as a home instructor for Ewing Township Schools, helping children with illnesses who were physically or medically unable to go to school. She also served as a supplemental teacher for ``English as a Second Language'' and Basic Skills Instructor until her retirement in 1994.  Lots of children have benefited from the hard work, commitment, love and compassion the Petrillas each exuded on the job, in their careers in education. And it is important to note, that that same love, generosity, empathy, nurturing and mentoring was and remains a hallmark of the Petrilla home. They are the proud parents of five children and eight grandchildren and their family feels abundantly blessed. They have shared with me inspiring stories that truly capture their parent's extraordinary example of reaching out and helping others throughout their lives.  We join with their family and friends in thanking the Petrillas for dedicating themselves to successfully helping our community, and we offer our continued prayers for their comfort and full recovery.                          ____________________
