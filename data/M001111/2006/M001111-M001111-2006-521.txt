 President, the Senate is about to vote on the Murray amendment which is the only amendment before this Senate that will restore actual dollars to the $1 billion cut to the Community Development Block Grant Program. We will see another amendment that is paid for by a 920 account that is now $10.5 billion in the hole--not real money.  When our Committee on Appropriations gets that next fall, all of the Senators will be asking: Why are we cutting CDBG? We did not put real money in to restore that cut, unless we pass the Murray amendment that is paid for by closing tax loopholes.  Real dollars are the difference between this and next fall when our Senators are asking us about CDBG money and why it is being cut. We will relate it directly back to this vote on this amendment.  Let everyone know where the real vote is. If no one believes me, read the Wall Street Journal article, ``Republican Budget Plan Advances as Challenges By Democrats Fail,'' outlining that Republicans in tighter reelection races are offering amendments that are not paid for.  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.
