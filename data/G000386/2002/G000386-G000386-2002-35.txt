 President, we are here today to consider the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act which was voted out of the Finance Committee on September 12. A similar tax relief package was passed unanimously by the House in July. No one would dispute that many national defense challenges lie ahead for our country. We have spent and will continue to spend a good deal of time discussing homeland security and the war on terrorism as we continue our efforts to secure our borders. Now, we must consider seriously the possibility of military operations in Iraq.  For those reasons, it is a particularly appropriate time to focus our attention on the important contributions of the men and women of our Armed Forces and national guard. These folks are the lifeblood of any initiative against terrorism or movement in Iraq and the first lien of defense in homeland security efforts. We need to make sure that these men and women are treated fairly in all respects and that the Tax Code does not provide any disincentives to continued service.  Our military tax bill would remedy several tax problems and inequities faced by members of our uniformed services, National Guard, and foreign service. As a starting point, the legislation would make sure that military personnel subject to relocation are not disadvantaged in the Tax Code on the sales of their homes. In 1997, we enacted a capital gains tax exclusion on the sale of personal residences for individuals who live in the home for at least 2 of the 5 years before the sale. This works well for most people, but the provision offers little help for military personnel who are frequently transferred. We should not punish members of our Armed Forces and foreign service who are asked to relocate in the name of service to their country. Like many of the provisions in this bill, the issue is one of fairness, and we should provide our military with home ownership tax incentives at least as favorable as those available to most Americans.  Our military tax relief package also makes some important additions to the military tax package sent over by the House. One of those, Senator DeWine's proposal for the benefit of Reservists and National Guard, is both timely and important. Timely because Reservists continue to play an increasingly prominent role in our country's military operations. Historically, Reservists were used as manpower replacements only in national emergencies and wars. In fact, between 1945 and 1990, 85 percent of involuntarily activated Reservists assisted in the Korean war. In the last decade, however, we have involuntarily activated Reservists six times for a broad array of operations, including (i) nation-building operations in Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, (ii) armed conflicts such as those in Iraq, and (iii) current military operations fighting terrorism. Iowa alone currently has about 800 Guard and Reservists on active duty.  Important because many Guard and Reservists who travel for weekend drills are required to spend their own money for travel expenses. If our military is unable to reimburse these folks for travel expenses related to training assignments, we should at a minimum allow these men and women to fully deduct those expenses on their Federal tax returns. Although we currently allow miscellaneous itemized deductions for such expenses, a limited number of Reservists itemize on their tax returns. Our bill includes a provision offered by Senator DeWine that such expenses be deductible by all reservists in above-the-line form. This would ensure (i) that Reservists are at least partly compensated for training-related travel expenses paid out of their own pockets, (ii) that all Reservists are treated equally, and (iii) would eliminate a potential disincentive to service. Many Iowans have contacted mewith respect to this issue, and I ask unanimous consent to print their comments in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             Snapshot Report: Incoming Constituent Messages       Senator Grassley: Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of      the Senate Finance Committee, has introduced the ``The      Foreign and Armed Services Tax Fairness Act of 2002'' (S      2616). The bill is intended to remedy a number of tax      inequities that have long plagued military service members.      Among the several provisions of the bill is one that is close      to the hearts of members of the Guard and Reserve--     restoration of the tax deductibility of Reserve component      members' non-reimbursable training expenses. The      deductibility issue stems from a change to the Internal      Revenue Code made in 1986 that required that such      unreimbursed business expenses must be treated as itemized      deductions and must exceed two percent of adjusted gross      income. Since only about 25 percent of all taxpayers itemize      their deductions, this change has been the bane of many      citizens' existence. This includes citizen-soldiers, sailors,      airmen, and Marines who must now, in effect, subsidize their      own military training. If S 2816 becomes law, it's bill would      provide an above-the-line deduction for overnight travel      costs for Guardsmen and Reservists. Please sign on as a      cosponsor for ``The Foreign and Armed Services Tax Fairness      Act of 2002'' (S 2816). Sincerely, Thomas J. Hicks.                                  ____       Senator Grassley: Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of      the Senate Finance Committee, has introduced the ``The      Foreign Armed Service Tax Fairness Act of 2002'' (S 2616).

I regard the bill as a significant      first step in the process of redefining the government's      longstanding contract with its Reserve forces. The world and      Reservists' terms of service have changed markedly in the      half-century since Reserve retirement was passed into law. I      believe that it is indeed time to reevaluate the whole      question of Reserve compensation. Please contact the chairmen      of the House and Senate military personnel subcommittees.      Urge them to hold hearings on lowering the Reserve retirement      eligibility age. This is a pivotal issue, one that has the      potential to change the shape of both the Reserve and the      Total Force. It is critical that the issue receive the full      consideration that it merits. Sincerely, James A. Brooks.                                  ____       Senatpr Grassley: The House recently unanimously passed the      Armed Services Tax Fairness Act of 2002 (HR 5063). This bill      eliminates two inequities in the tax code for active-duty      members of the Armed Services. The bill will now be sent to      the Senate and referred to the Senate Finance Committee for      consideration. Although it does not directly benefit most      Reserve component members, because it is almost certain to      win Senate approval, HR 5063 can serve as an ideal vehicle to      carry S 540, a bill we've been working on for some time now,      into law. (S 540, which currently has 62 cosponsors, would      provide tax credits for employers of mobilized Reservists and      restore the tax deductibility of Reservists' unreimbursed      training expenses.) To achieve this end, the Senate Finance      Committee will have to amend HR 5063 to add the provisions of      S 540 to the House bill. We need the strong support of      Senator Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance      Committee to make this happen. Please call Senator Baucus and      ask him to add the provisions of S 540 to HR 5063. It's the      right thing to do, and it will be deeply appreciated by the      men and women of our Reserve forces and their employers.      Sincerely, Jay R. Hildebrand.                                  ____       Senator Grassley: The House recently unanimously passed the      Armed Services Tax Fairness Act of 2002 (H.R. 5063).
