 President, yesterday, all time was yielded back on the Hurwitz nomination, post-cloture, and the nominee was then confirmed by voice vote. I was not aware we were going to vote on the nomination by voice. Had I known, I would have requested the yeas and nays. The following Members have informed my staff that if there had been a rollcall vote, they would have voted `nay' on final confirmation on the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:       1.
