President, all of Vermont is saddened today by the loss of a great leader in agriculture, George Dunsmore.  George was a strong advocate for Vermont agriculture. He worked tirelessly promoting it here and abroad, and fighting for it in the legislatures of Montpelier, VT and Washington, DC.  In addition to serving in the State legislature, he had two tenures as Commissioner of Agriculture. Under his leadership the high quality image of Vermont food and agricultural products has flourished. George always looked for ways to find new markets for Vermont products. He knew that it was important for Vermont and New England to look beyond our Nation's borders to the export market.  George understood Vermont agriculture so well because he was a part of it. A dairy farmer in Franklin County, he worked both on the farm and in Montpelier for many years.  He also understood how Washington worked. He was a leader in the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. He also served as the agricultural specialist for my good friend Jim Jeffords when he was a Member of the House of Representatives.  George was a strong supporter of the State's dairy industry and the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. I think it is fitting that Senator Jeffords and I introduce this measure, Senate Joint Resolution 28, today and do so in memory of him.  Whether he was defending the purity of Vermont's maple products, looking for new markets for our apple growers or fighting for higher prices for dairy farmers, George was always a true advocate for agriculture.  My deepest sympathies go to his wife Bette Ann, and their three children.                          ____________________
