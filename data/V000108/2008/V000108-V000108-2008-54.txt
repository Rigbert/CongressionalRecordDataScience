On Saturday, May 31, 2008, the Merrillville Alliance of Transylvanian Saxons will host a celebration honoring its 100th Anniversary, while also celebrating the ATS National Constitutional Convention at the Radisson Hotel in Merrillville, Indiana.  The Saxons originated in Germany and traveled eastward to settle in eastern Hungary during the 12th and 13th century. Following the conclusion of World War I, the Hungarian boundaries were altered and the Saxons' home became Transylvania, one of the three major provinces of Rumania. In Rumania, the Transylvanian Saxons were oppressed as minorities by the totalitarian Rumanian government, causing many to migrate to the United States.  The ATS was founded as a fraternal organization in 1902, with a mission of providing a safe community for immigrant families of Transylvanian Saxons to share and enjoy their language and traditions. The Merrillville Alliance of Transylvanian Saxons was established in 1908 under its parent organization to offer the same community to the 3,000 plus Transylvanian Saxons who had immigrated to Northwest Indiana. The fraternal fellowship provides cultural activities such as singing, dancing, and family and youth exchange programs. The officers of the Merrillville ATS, who so selflessly give to their organization, share the goals of the national organization and allow for their longstanding traditions to remain a part of their lives.  This year's celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Merrillville Alliance of Transylvanian Saxons will recognize the continuous efforts of the Merrillville Lodge's officers: President Jeffery Szostek, Vice President Daniel Schuffert, Recording Secretary Raymond S. Palyok, Treasurer Donald Bowman, Secretary Randall B. Floyd, and Trustees Walter Szostek, John Sumichrast and Jim Smith.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the officers and members of the Merrillville Alliance of Transylvanian Saxons for the efforts, activities, and leadership they have provided in maintaining their Transylvanian Saxon history and culture as part of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
