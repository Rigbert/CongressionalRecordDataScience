They will be commemorating the event with the religious and historic tradition of Maha Kumbhabhishekam. This event will take place over three days, from Friday, June 18, 2010 to Sunday, June 20, 2010, at the Bharatiya Temple of Northwest Indiana in Merrillville.  The Indian American Cultural Center of Northwest Indiana opened on March 9, 2002, and operates as ``a place to preserve, nourish, and advance the Indian culture, heritage, religious values, and social values.'' In order to continue to advance the teachings and culture of the Indian American people and the Hindu religion, the members of the Indian American Cultural Center decided to expand the existing building and to give the community a legacy in the form of the truly glorious Bharatiya Temple of worship. The Indian American community will be celebrating Maha Kumbhabhishekam, which is a Hindu tradition performed when a new Temple is built and installed with new deities (Gods or Goddesses). Many religious rituals of the Hindu religion will be performed during the celebration which will sanctify the beloved Bharatiya Temple of Northwest Indiana. It is a Hindu belief that taking part and witnessing a Maha Kumbhabhishekam is a lifetime blessing.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the Indian American Cultural Society of Northwest Indiana and its congregation as they celebrate the opening of the Bharatiya Temple of Northwest Indiana and observe the religious and historic tradition of Maha Kumbhabhishekam. Through their words and teachings, this honorable organization shares with us the rich culture and tradition of the Indian American people as well as the traditions of the Hindu religion.                          ____________________
