Speaker, on April 30, 2015, I was unavoidably detained and missed Roll Call vote number 193, On Passage of Making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  Should I have been present I would have voted No.                          ____________________
