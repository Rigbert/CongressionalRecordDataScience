Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3095) to amend title 4, United States Code, to make sure the rules of etiquette for flying the flag of the United States do not preclude the flying of flags at half mast when ordered by city and local officials, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                                H.R. 3095       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Recognition Act of      2004''.     SEC. 2. FLAG CODE AMENDMENT.       Section 7(m) of title 4, United States Code, is amended by      inserting after the sentence beginning ``In the event of the      death of a present or former official of the government of      any State'' the following: ``In the event of the death of a      present or former official of any city or other locality, the      chief elected official of that locality may proclaim that the      National flag shall be flown at half staff.''.
