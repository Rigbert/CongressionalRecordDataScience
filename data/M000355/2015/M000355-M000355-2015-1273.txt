 President, here is where we are. We are unable to clear any short-term extension, and the current law expires at midnight on Sunday. So the Senate will be back in session Sunday afternoon--a week from Sunday--on May 31, with one more opportunity to act responsibly and not allow this program to expire.  This is a high-threat period. We know what is going on overseas. We know what has been tried here at home. Do we really want this law to expire?  We have 1 week to discuss it. We will have 1 day to do it. So we better be ready next Sunday afternoon to prevent the country from being in danger by the total expiration of the program we are all familiar with.  Unless there is objection, and I understand there is not an objection, we will pass the highway extension on a voice vote tonight and we will be back in session Sunday a week.
