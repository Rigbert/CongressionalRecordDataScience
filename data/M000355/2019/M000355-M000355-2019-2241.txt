  Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, both 15, began that morning just like any other. Their parents and friends described Bailey and Preston as bright kids with promising futures ahead, but this peaceful community was shattered when a fellow student opened fire, taking Bailey and Preston's lives, and leaving nearly 20 additional students wounded.  Their families were left to grieve, and for the past year, the community has done its best to provide comfort and put the pieces back together.  This evening, the Marshall County community will join together once again to remember the victims and to continue the healing. As they do, my prayers and those of all their fellow Kentuckians will be with them.                          ____________________
