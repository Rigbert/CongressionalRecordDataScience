Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Visclosky], the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Bilirakis], the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Smith], and myself. This amendment is about a matter of fundamental principle that any nation that asks for aid from the American people must not, in turn, deny aid to its neighbors.  This fundamental principle was enacted into law last year when Congress included the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act in the fiscal year 1996 appropriation bill. This amendment would simply narrow the waiver authority of the President in last year's bill.                              {time}  1615  It would prohibit economic support funds to any nation that violates the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act, even if the President grants a waiver. The amendment is carefully crafted, only applying to the economic support funds. It does not apply to other forms of assistance, such as humanitarian assistance.  The people of Armenia have suffered for decades, some say for centuries. They are suffering now from a brutal blockade. This blockade has prevented the delivery of assistance to 300,000 Armenian refugees and obstructed the rebuilding of earthquake damage which left 5000,000 people in Armenia homeless. The blockade has cut off the transport of food, fuel, medicine, and other humanitarian assistance to the people of Armenia.  In this time of crisis, the people of Armenia need our strong support. As long as Armenia is blockaded by its neighbors, the United States should stand resolute and firm in the position that we will not provide assistance to the governments that are imposing this blockade and I rise in strong support of this amendment which I am cosponsoring.
