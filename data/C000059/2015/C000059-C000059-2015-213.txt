Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the gentleman's amendment. I want the gentleman to know that I understand that the territories would benefit greatly from additional funding. We funded the assistance to territories at the FY15-enacted levels. We level-funded that because we know that the money is needed, and we know that we have responsibilities in the territories. However, the offset right now, we have cut back that particular operation considerably, so I would oppose that offset. But I would be more than happy to work with the gentleman as we move this process along, along with the ranking member, to see if we can't get additional funds as we move this process along.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's intent, but we would have to reluctantly oppose this amendment at this time, and I reserve the balance of my time.
