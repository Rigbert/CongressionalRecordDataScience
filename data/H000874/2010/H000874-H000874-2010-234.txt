 Well, the gentleman and I had the opportunity, a historic opportunity, I might say, to participate in an extraordinary event in the history, perhaps, of our country. I'm not sure that I can cite another instance certainly in my career when a President has spent a whole day sitting with the legislative branch, the leadership both of the Republican and Democratic Parties in the Senate and the House and also of the committee Chairs. I think that was an unprecedented meeting. I thought it was an extraordinarily good meeting for the American public as I thought it was a good meeting for all of us who participated.  I think what the public saw was each side thoughtfully and clearly, from an informed basis, expressing their view as to what was needed and how to get to where we wanted to go. It also indicated, I think, to the American public legitimate differences of opinion on the ways and means, if you will, of effecting health care reform, which obviously the overwhelming numbers of the American public believe is necessary. As I quoted, as you recall, both President Obama and Presidential candidate McCain in the debate in October of 2008 both said that health care reform was necessary, and Presidential candidate McCain indicated that he thought we needed a program that covered all Americans with affordable health care.  Now, that's the context in which we're going to move forward. I thought it was a productive, positive opportunity for us and, as I said, the American public. We are moving forward. The President indicated we'd be moving forward. The President, as you point out, I don't think he has a bill yet, but he's put language of the 11-page document you've seen and that was referenced at the meeting--he's put that on the table. It is obviously an attempt to reach agreement between the Senate-passed bill and the House-passed bill, which, although this was not a conference in the classic sense of a conference, in many ways it was, I suppose, a superconference in that rarely is the President in the room, but obviously Republicans and Democrats were in the room and had their time to discuss the President's proposals, trying to resolve differences between the two Houses. Certainly it's going to be taken into consideration over the next few days, I would think, to see whether or not there can be a resolution.  In addition to that, I tell my friend honestly that we went through a number of aspects of the health care bill in which I think we found common ground, and many of us said that. I think some of us were surprised that some Members were as focused as we think we are on certain items.  First of all, I think there was agreement on principle, if not on application of that principle, and that was that the solution is to be found in the delivery of health care through the private sector. And, in fact, both bills in the Senate and the House provide for private sector insurance companies to be involved and to be the insurers and to be the agents for financing health care insurance for Americans.  In addition, Dr. Coburn was very clear that he thought we needed to focus on wellness, on prevention. There are, in both bills, substantial provisions which deal with that, with wellness and prevention, best practices, with innovation, with efficiencies in the delivery of health care, health information technology, other issues.  In addition, he spoke of eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse. As you recall,and both of us listened to him, he made the point that he thought 1 in 3 health care dollars were not spent on the delivery of health care. Now, they weren't all waste, fraud, and abuse. We know that there are very substantial administrative costs in health care. And as I responded to Senator Coburn, there are very substantial provisions related to waste, fraud, and abuse in both bills and in the President's suggestion.  In addition, the purchasing of policies of insurance across State lines was discussed by both sides. I think the President indicated, I think, we can reach agreement on that. I hope we do. And insurance pooling to acquire health insurance at lower prices was also discussed, not only with respect to small business, but, obviously, we discussed it with individuals who do not have availability to group policies.  The answer, therefore, to your question is we certainly hope we can move forward. We hope we can reach some areas of agreement.  I want to tell you very frankly, I don't think we have any intention of starting over with a clean slate, as you requested. I want to be honest with the gentleman. Literally thousands and thousands of hours have gone into countless hearings participated in by both of our parties, countless markups, public markups with amendments offered both in the House and the Senate. But that does not mean that these are set in stone. Therefore, the answer to your question is I continue to be interested in your thoughts, but if the thoughts are simply to, as Mr. Boehner indicated, scrap it, and Mr. Alexander said that as well, I frankly don't think that's a very productive direction to go in given the complexity and challenge that confronts us.  There was a lot of discussion about polling data in yesterday's meeting. In point of fact, we believe that the polling data does indicate that Americans are not happy with this bill. In my view, in part they're not happy because they've seen it be the center point of confrontation, controversy, and, from my perspective, a lot of misinformation.  But having said that, I think every poll seems to reflect that when you ask them about component parts, do they believe that preexisting conditions ought not to be a disabling factor in the receipt of insurance, a very high percentage of the American public says, yes, they think that ought to be not a factor. Do they think that there ought to be lifetime caps? They think no. If they have insurance, they want to keep it, and if they get really sick, they want to make sure their insurance compensates them for that. They also want to make sure that they are not bankrupted in a year that they have a very serious illness because the insurance company has capped what they can get in any one year.  So there seems to be, on the individual items, pretty high support--and when I say ``pretty high,'' high 50s, 60s, and sometimes in the low 70s--of various component parts of the bill. I think if we can respond to that which the public is for and listen to the public, I think we can have some success. And we look forward to working with you over the next few weeks to see if we can come to agreement. The President made it very clear that he wants to do that. I reiterate we want to do it.  But the President also made it clear, if we can't do it, then we're going to proceed, and that's what he told the American people he was going to do. And, very frankly, he was elected handily just a little over a year ago, and he said what he wanted to do was a health care plan which would provide access for Americans to affordable quality health care. And, in fact, that's what John McCain said in that debate in October of 2008 when they were both debating each other. That was not a contentious issue. They had differences of how to get there, but covering all Americans with affordable, quality health care was not one of the contentious issues.  I know that was a long answer, but I wanted to place it in context for my friend so that productively we can work on what has passed the House, passed the Senate, and if we can make changes that would lead you or members of your party to support legislation, then I think we can have a productive discussion about that. On the other hand, frankly, if it's simply scrap all the work you've done or we're not going to play, then I think we won't have much progress.                              {time}  1215
