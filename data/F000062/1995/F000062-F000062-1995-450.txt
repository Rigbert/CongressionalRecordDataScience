 President, I earnestly implore my committee chairman, the key is simply to exclude the revenues from balancing the budget in an amendment to this amendment, and that would be presented next week. I believe it is the only way to have an honest amendment. I also believe that it makes sense.  There are 40 million people today on Social Security. By the time this amendment is ratified and the first balanced budget is prepared, there will be 80 million Americans on Social Security. Young people working today can expect that the money will not be there to pay for their retirement, and yet they are paying FICA taxes. That is not right. They should not have to pay if the money is not going to be there. If the money is used to balance the budget, it just brings the crunch to Social Security that much sooner. I do not think that that should be a by-product of a balanced budget amendment. More fundamentally, I believe it is a flaw that will cause its nonratification by enough States to make it the law of the land.  What I want to say, the bottom line is if we can adopt the amendment--and I just read the amendments to the Constitution again this morning--I think if we are going to have monetary policy in the Constitution, it is fitting, just as there are technicalities in other amendments on double jeopardy and that kind of thing, that there be an amendment which simply exempts the revenues from the trust funds that hold the FICA taxes.  As I said yesterday, absent those, absent that amendment, I cannot vote for a balanced budget amendment. With that amendment, I can vote for a balanced budget amendment. So I say these things today, for whatever help it might be to my chairman in considering where this matter rests.  Mr. President, in the year that I was born, the Federal debt amounted to less than $25 billion. In the year my daughter was born, the Federal debt was about $225 billion--10 times greater. My granddaughter Eileen was born 2 years ago. At the time of her birth, the Federal debt was more than 150 times greater than it was when I was born--nearly $4 trillion.  That, in a nutshell, is why I am a strong supporter of a constitutional balanced budget amendment. The path we are on is unsustainable. We do not have another generation to allow this problem to fester. The time for action is now.  In my first 2 years as a U.S. Senator, I have had the opportunity to observe the standard operating procedure of the Senate--the budget, authorization, and appropriations processes. I am convinced that without a constitutional amendment, this body will simply be unable to balance the budget.  Let me share what I see the problem to be.  The American people are sitting on a debt time-bomb jeopardizing the economic security of generations of Americans to come and I believe that without the imposition of an amendment such as this, it will continue to be business as usual. In my opinion, business as usual just isn't acceptable.  Although amending the Constitution is strong medicine, I am convinced that without this strong medicine, America's fiscal health will not improve.  I have listened to the various arguments about why we should not require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In theory, certain of these arguments have merit. But, I am afraid that historical and present day practices often demonstrate the wide variation between theory and practice with regard to the Federal budget.  In theory, the Federal Government might run deficits in times of recession to stimulate the economy or in war simply to pay its bills, and surpluses in times of prosperity because revenue increases and unemployment decreases. In fact, that has not happened.  In the last 35 years, the Federal Government has balanced its budget exactly twice. Once in 1960, a surplus of $300 million and again in 1969, a surplus of $3.2 billion.  In the last quarter of a century, the Federal Government has run up more than $4 trillion in debt without once balancing the budget. During this time, this Nation has experienced war and peace and economic booms and recessions. Yet, never did this Government balance the Federal budget, let alone run a surplus.  As mayor of San Francisco, I balanced nine budgets in a row. I know how difficult it is to do. But that is why we are elected--to make those tough choices. I support this amendment and the line-item veto because I know that failing to balance the budget is a choice that this Nation cannot afford.                          interest on the debt  The Federal Government now spends over $226 billion annually just to pay the interest on its nearly $5 trillion debt. Our interest payments alone are $59 billion greater than the projected deficit of $176 billion for fiscal year 1995. This means that if the United States did not have to service this enormous debt, there would be no deficit this year. In fact, we would have a small budget surplus.  If current policies continue, the Congressional Budget   Office estimates that net interest payments will reach $387 billion by the year 2004 or roughly 58 percent of the amount that is expected to be spent on all discretionary programs--$669 billion will go just to pay for interest on the debt.  Today every dollar in personal income taxes collected west of the Mississippi is used to pay for nothing more than interest on America's staggering Federal debt, or put another way, that's 40 percent of each taxpayers' tax dollar. This money is not used to build new highways, planes, or ships, provide medical care to a child or grandparent, or education to our Nation's students. Americans receive no services, no public infrastructure, no investment for these interest payments. They get [[Page S1903]] nothing for 40 percent of their taxes. Left alone, that will become 50 percent, then 60 percent, and on and on till bankruptcy.  What has 35 years of accumulated deficits meant to our economy? According to a study by the New York Federal Reserve Board, the low national savings rate, now under 3 percent--the lowest of any major industrialized country--mostly attributable to large Federal deficits, and it has resulted in a loss of 5 percent growth in our national income during the 1980's. Now that's a big deal. Let me tell you what it means.                           issues of concern  For all those reasons, I believe the time has come to pass a constitutional balance budget amendment. I recognize, however, that amending the Constitution of the United States is very serious business. It has been amended just 17 times since 1791.  Congress should not push through just any amendment that says just balance the budget no matter what. We must pass an amendment which will let us balance the budget honestly and wisely.                       social security amendment  I must be frank. I don't believe that legislation before us is the best constitutional amendment. Its greatest flaw is that it continues the process of misusing Social Security funds. Let me explain how:  First, this amendment would put Social Security on-budget, thereby reversing congressional action and undermining the integrity of the system.  Between its creation in 1935 and 1969, Social Security has always been off-budget. In an attempt to cover the costs of the Vietnam war and later to mask growing deficits, Social Security was put on-budget.  This was a misuse of the Social Security trust fund. In the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act, Congress put an end to this by declaring Social Security funds off-budget. The act states:       * * * the receipts and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age      and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability      Insurance Trust Fund--which together make up the Social      Security Program--shall not be counted as new budget      authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for      purposes of--       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted      by the President;       (2) the congressional budget, or       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act      of 1985.  An amendment in the Senate to exclude Social Security from budget calculations was passed in the 101st Congress by a vote of 98 to 2. Every Member there that served in the 101st Congress voted for that amendment.  The joint resolution before us now requires total outlays not to exceed total receipts for any fiscal year. This would clearly include Social Security and thereby overturn both the historical treatment of Social Security and Congress' recent decision to affirm the off-budget status of Social Security. Worse, it would allow the misuse of Social Security funds to continue.  The important point is, Congress has already debated this matter and decided to take Social Security off-budget. This is not a loophole. It was an informed decision to budget honestly. Now this constitutional amendment will reverse that. This amendment would enshrine this abuse of Social Security in the U.S. Constitution.  This debate is not about who wants to protect Social Security and who does not. It is about who wants to be honest with the American people in our budgeting and fiscal policy and who does not. To be honest, Social Security must remain off-budget. Including Social Security in the budget calculations would be the enormous loophole. It is not the Federal Government's money and should not be used as if it is.  Second, Social Security is not like other Government programs and should not be treated like other Government programs.  Social Security is a publicly administered, compulsory, contributory retirement program. Through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act [FICA], workers are required to contribute 6.2 percent of their salaries to Social Security. Employers are required to match that amount. This 12.4 percent contribution funds the Social Security system. By law, these funds are required to be held by the Federal Government in trust. They are not the Federal Government's funds, but contributions that workers pay in and expect to get back.  Third, Social Security does not contribute to the Federal deficit.  In fact, the Social Security trust fund surpluses are masking the true size of the deficit. In 1995 Social Security will take in $69 billion more than it will pay out in benefits. By 2001, Social Security will be running surpluses of more than $100 billion a year. By including Social Security in the constitutional balanced budget amendment, Congress would obfuscate the true deficit problem.  Fourth, the failure to save Social Security's surpluses could undermine the system's viability.  In the late 1970's and early 1980's, Congress changed the way the Social Security system was financed. Recognizing the large demand on the system that would be created by the retirement of the baby boomer generation early next century, the Social Security system was changed from as pay-as-you-go system to a system that would accumulate large surpluses now to prepare for the vast increase in the number of retirees later.  Rather than saving these large surpluses, however, Congress has used them to finance the deficit. That means beginning in 2019, when Social Security is supposed to begin drawing down its accumulated surpluses to pay for the benefits of the vast numbers of retiring baby boomers, there will be no money saved to draw on.  Congress will be forced to either raise taxes, cut benefits, or cut other spending programs to meet the obligations workers are paying for now. In short, the American workers will have to pay twice for the retirement of the baby boomers because we are not saving what they contribute now.  As the chart next to me illustrates, the Social Security surpluses will decline and then plunge dramatically into deficit. The deficit will reach $700 billion a year by 2029.  Between 1995 and 2002, Congress will essentially steal $705 billion from the Social Security trust fund. That is the amount of surplus that is supposed to be saved over that period, but instead will be used to balance the budget. If we are to save that money, the budget would have to run a surplus of $705 billion and we know that will not happen.  By the year 2018, the Federal Government will owe the Social Security system $3 trillion. Those who say that Social Security is not on the table with this amendment are incorrect. It is--bigtime; to the tune of $3 trillion of reserves for retirement that will be involved unless our amendment is passed.  Clearly, unless we begin saving the Social Security surpluses and addressing the long-term needs of the system, we will be spearheading a financial Armageddon for Social Security.  The only way to save the Social Security surpluses to pay for future retirements is to balance the budget exclusive of Social Security.  The impact of this, of course, would be that the Federal Government would run a unified budget surplus--a balanced Federal budget and a surplus in the Social Security trust fund. In this way, we would cut the Federal debt and save Social Security funds, not just watch the debt keep growing. That is what the amendment Senator Reid and I are offering would do--it would require a balanced Federal budget exclusive of Social Security.  Social Security system does have a long-term financing problem. In my opinion, an expert advisory board should be formed to advise Congress on how to adjust the system to restore balance and make the system live within its means.  The point, however, is that Social Security changes should be made to shore-up the long-term solvency of the Social Security system, not for any other reason. By keeping Social Security in this amendment, Congress would continue the shell game.  My support for maintaining the integrity of the Social Security system reinforces my support for the balanced budget amendment. But, a balanced budget amendment that uses Social Security funds is not truly balanced.  I support a constitutional balanced budget amendment that is honest, but I cannot support a balanced budget amendment which would enshrine the [[Page S1904]] theft of Social Security trust funds in the U.S. Constitution.  If my vote is needed to pass this amendment, then Social Security will have to be exempted.
