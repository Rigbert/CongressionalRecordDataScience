 President, I stand today to congratulate an extraordinary Kentucky woman and a dear friend of mine, Ms. Ruth Smith. Ruth was recently one of nine to receive this year's distinguished UK Sanders-Brown Center on Aging Foundation's Senior Star Award, an award given each year to those who exemplify graceful aging by remaining engaged in an active lifestyle. Ruth, now 86, was recognized for her great character and outstanding service to her community during this year's Senior Star Award luncheon, which took place on October 13, 2011, in Lexington, KY.  Ruth, a longtime resident of Wayne County, KY, is an active member of the Lake Cumberland Area Development District, a quasi-governmental agency comprised of local city and county governments, and special districts in south-central Kentucky to improve life for the region's citizens. Ruth has served as a member of the LCADD's board of directors since 1993 and has served as a member of the executive committee since 2003. In 2008, Ruth was named LCADD Citizen Board Member of the Year for her exceptional work.  Currently, the LCADD serves the counties of Adair, Casey, Clinton, Cumberland, Green, McCreary, Pulaski, Russell, Taylor and Wayne by providing a regional forum to local governments to help identify issues and opportunities and then provide leadership in planning and implementing programs that will help improve the quality of life of the region's citizens.  Over the years, Ruth's strength of character, adventurous spirit, and care for her fellow man have been a constant echo throughout the many successes she has enjoyed in her life. During World War II, Ruth traveled from her home in Pennsylvania to California to work in a factory--her personal contribution to the war effort. Some yearslater, after marrying her husband Randolph and relocating to Kentucky, Ruth immediately immersed herself in the local community. She spent her time working side by side with her husband helping to run both a dry goods store and a small-town retail store to support their young family while simultaneously volunteering and supporting many community organizations. She has been chosen for many leadership roles, including president of the local chamber of commerce and delegate to the Republican National Convention.  About 15 years ago, Ruth was widowed when Randolph passed unexpectedly. Ruth was burdened with the task of liquidating the family business and finding a job. Not long after, Ruth began a new career which lasted for over 17 years when the Lake Cumberland District Health Department hired Ruth to work with teen mothers through the Clinton, McCreary and Cumberland County Health Departments in the HANDS Program. Ruth mentored countless young women into becoming responsible mothers, employees and citizens while loving and nurturing their children into feeling special at the same time.  Throughout this unintended second career, Ruth continuously found herself in situations where the needs were clear but the means to achieve them were not always so. Yet, with her determination as her guide, she always found a way to meet these daily demands, oftentimes reaching into her own pockets when resources were not available, and never complaining.  Last summer, Ruth took a road trip to Pennsylvania with her daughter-in-law to visit her family and friends. A day or so later, news spread back in Kentucky that she had fallen ill, and at her age some feared the worst. But it turned out it was not Ruth that had fallen ill but her daughter-in-law--and the ever-resourceful Ruth Smith quite possibly saved the younger woman's life by calling an ambulance and administering CPR until help arrived.  Ruth truly loves people, especially those of her community, and they respond in kind. For example, when she decided to retire in July of last year at the age of 85, people from all over came to her retirement celebration to honor her--the impact that she had on those who were fortunate enough to know and work with her over the years was evident and immeasurable.  My dear friend, Ms. Ruth Smith, is an honorable Kentuckian whose selflessness and service to her fellow citizens deserves the utmost respect. She dedicated her life to helping her community and improving the lives of her fellow Kentuckians. She leaves behind her a legacy of inspiration and hope to all those she touched, and her achievements will not soon be forgotten.  I would ask that my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Ms. Ruth Smith in receiving the UK Sanders-Brown Center on Aging Foundation's Senior Star Award. She is most deserving of this honor, and I commend her for all that she has done for our great Commonwealth.                          ____________________
