 President, I rise today to introduce the Angel Island Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act, with Senator Boxer as an original cosponsor.  This legislation authorizes the use of up to $15 million in Federal funds for ongoing efforts to restore and preserve the Angel Island Immigration Station located on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay.  I understand that Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey is introducing similar legislation in the House. In the 108th Congress, Congresswoman Woolsey's Angel Island bill passed the House.  The Angel Island Immigration Station is an important piece of American history, especially to our Nation's Asian American and immigrant communities.  From the mid 19th to early 20th century, millions of people came to America in pursuit of the American dream. Most people are familiar with Ellis Island and the stories of immigrants coming to America and seeing the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, but often forgotten are the experiences of those who made it to America through the West Coast by way of Angel Island. Just like those who came through Ellis Island, there are many stories of triumph and tribulation associated with Angel Island.  However, for the Chinese and those from other Asian countries who came through Angel Island Immigration Station the story goes a bit further.  The economic downturn in the 1870s brought political pressures to deal with the increasing population of Chinese who risked everything to travel to ``Gold Mountain'' in search of a better life. Amongst the harshest of measures taken was the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the only legislation enacted by Congress to ban a specific ethnic population from entry into the United States.  To enforce this new law and subsequent legislation which excluded most Asian immigrants to this country, the Angel Island Immigration Station was established in 1910.  After a difficult journey across the Pacific Ocean, many new arrivals were brought to the Station where they faced separation from their family, embarrassing medical examinations, grueling interrogations and long detainments that lasted months, even years, in living deplorable conditions.  Testaments to these experiences can be found today on the wooden walls of the barracks. Many of the detainees told their stories through poems that they carved on the barrack walls. Using allegories and historical references, they described their aspirations for coming to America as well as expressed their anger and sadness at the treatment they received. However, this experience did not break the spirit of these new courageous immigrants. They endured and established new roots and made immeasurable contributions to this nation.  The Station was closed in 1940 and three years later Congress repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. For the next 20 years the Station remained mostly unused except for a short term during World War II, when it was used as a prisoner of war camp.  In 1963, Angel Island became a State park and the California Department of Parks and Recreation assumed stewardship of the Immigration Station.  In the late 1990's, the Station was a declared a National Historic Landmark and named on ``America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.'' In 1998, Congress approved $300,000 to conduct a study to determine the feasibility and desirability of preserving sites within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) which includes the Immigration Station. As a result, a historic three-party agreement was created between the National Park Service, California Department of Parks and the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation to conduct this study. In 2000, Save America's Treasures named the Angel Island Immigration Station one of its Official Projects and provided $500,000 for the preservation of poems carved into the walls.  The Station is supported by the people of California as well as numerous private interests. The voters of California voted in 2000 to set aside $15 million for restoration of the Station through Proposition 12 and in addition approximately $1.1 million in private funds has been raised so far. Most recently, in December 2004, the California Cultural and Historical Endowment Board voted to reserve $3 million pending further staff findings for the Immigration Station.  The legislation limits Federal funding to 50 percent the total funds from all sources spent to restore the Angel Island Immigration Station. The remaining money will be provided through State bond funding and raised through private means, making this a true public private partnership.  Today, approximately 200,000 visits are made each year to Angel Island by ferry from San Francisco, Tiburon and Alameda. In addition, 60,000 visits are made to the Immigration Station, about half of which are students on guided tours.  The resources secured so far have set in motion designing, planning and initial restoration efforts of the Immigration Station but much more is needed, particularly to save the Immigration Station Hospital building, which is deteriorating.  The bill I am introducing today will authorize $15 million in Federal funding to complete the restoration of the Angel Island Immigration Station so the stories of these early Americans who courageously endured the experience at the Angel Island Immigration Station will be preserved for future generations.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 262       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Angel Island Immigration      Station Restoration and Preservation Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Angel Island Immigration Station, also known as the      Ellis Island of the West, is a National Historic Landmark.       (2) Between 1910 and 1940, the Angel Island Immigration      Station processed more than     1,000,000 immigrants and emigrants from around the world.       (3) The Angel Island Immigration Station contributes      greatly to our understanding of our Nation's rich and complex      immigration history.       (4) The Angel Island Immigration Station was built to      enforce the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and subsequent      immigration laws, which unfairly and severely restricted      Asian immigration.       (5) During their detention at the Angel Island Immigration      Station, Chinese detainees carved poems into the walls of the      detention barracks. More than 140 poems remain today,      representing the unique voices of immigrants awaiting entry      to this country.       (6) More than 50,000 people, including 30,000      schoolchildren, visit the Angel Island Immigration Station      annually to learn more about the experience of immigrants who      have traveled to our shores.       (7) The restoration of the Angel Island Immigration Station      and the preservation of the writings and drawings at the      Angel Island Immigration Station will ensure that future      generations also have the benefit of experiencing and      appreciating this great symbol of the perseverance of the      immigrant spirit, and of the diversity of this great Nation.     SEC. 3. RESTORATION.       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized      to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior      $15,000,000 for restoring the Angel Island Immigration      Station in the San Francisco Bay, in coordination with the      Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation and the      California Department of Parks and Recreation.
