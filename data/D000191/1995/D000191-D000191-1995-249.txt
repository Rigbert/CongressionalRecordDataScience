Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, as I heard the former Member speaking, I could hear a distant sound and I think it was champagne corks popping on Wall Street. This is extraordinary. I am not an attorney, so I will not cite chapter and verse of precedents. I will go straight to the heart of the matter.                              {time}  1145  If a person who has worked hard their whole life to put together a little bit of savings for retirement, or maybe they want to annuitize their pension, they have to depend upon someone for advice. And they go and they depend upon the advice of a stockbroker or a prospectus written by some $500-an-hour lawyer on Wall Street. And there is a little omission in that prospectus. It forgets to tell you that you are not investing in Treasury bills, you are investing in derivatives. You lose your money, your life savings, your annuitized pension. It is gone. You are broke.  Do my colleagues know what? You now have a little problem. Two things. One is if you want to sue, this has loser pay in it. So if you are the individual who lost your life savings, you have to find the wherewithal to come with the money to pay for the costs.  Second, it has a new and novel defense from a lay person's perspective. I do not know of any other law in America where you can say, ``I forgot. I forgot.''  What this means is the next time that someone tries to go to court to recover against the next Charles Keating--there will not be another Charles Keating--that would be great if there were no more frauds that cost the American people millions of dollars like the savings and loan scandals. No, that is not what it means. What it means is you will not have recourse to sue them because they forgot or they just overlooked the disclosure that the bank was on the brink of insolvency when you put your money in there, or when you invested it in that bank.  At a time of turmoil in international markets, just after the bank's scandal, not very long after the Orange County scandal, how is it that we can come credibly before the American people and say Wall Street needs protection from those little stockholders, Wall Street needs protection from people who are putting their life savings in their hands. Why? Well, because Wall Street might forget to tell them something crucial.  This is absolutely outrageous beyond the pale. It is a step through a looking glass into some bizarre new world.
