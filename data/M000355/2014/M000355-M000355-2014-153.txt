 Hatfield received the 2014 Business Woman of the Year award from the Somerset Business and Professional Women's Club. I wish to honor this exemplary citizen and to recognize her tremendous career as an educator.  Lois took her first job in 1951, teaching grades one through eight at a one-room school house called Union Ridge School in the Jabez portion of Wayne County. She continued to devote herself to education in Kentucky for the remainder of her career, which lasted over 60 years.  Her accomplishments over the years are many. In 1978, she became the principal of her alma mater, Nancy Elementary, making her the first female principal in the history of the Pulaski County School System. She has also served as president of the Alpha Delta Kappa Educational Sorority, precinct chair for the Pulaski County Republican Party, and president of the Pulaski County Republican Women's Club.  Officially in retirement since 1997, Lois has a hard time staying away from the classroom and still serves when needed as a substitute principal or teacher. The fire that burns within her, propelling her to educate the children of our Commonwealth, has not waned in the slightest degree since she began her career in education.  Lois's dedicated commitment to her community and its children deserves the praise of this body. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in recognizing Lois R. Hatfield and her many accomplishments in the field of education.  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article detailing Lois Hatfield's career and her receipt of the 2014 Business Woman of the Year award. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Commonwealth Journal, May 11, 2014] 2014 Business Woman of the Year: Lois R. Hatfield is the Recipient of                                the Award       A Pulaski County woman with a passion for education is the      recipient of the 2014 Business Woman of the Year award from      the Somerset Business and Professional Women's Club.       Lois R. Hatfield was presented the award Tuesday at the May      membership meeting of the Somerset-Pulaski Chamber of      Commerce.       Hatfield was born in Faubush and graduated from Nancy High      School in 1947.       Her teaching career spans more than 60 years and with all      her educational achievements she has never grasped the      meaning of retirement.       Working her way through college, Hatfield received her      Bachelor of Arts degree in education from Eastern Kentucky      University in 1961 and later received her master's degree in      elementary education with an emphasis in early childhood      education from EKU in 1972.       She began her distinguished professional career in      education in 1951 when she taught grades one-eight at Union      Ridge School, a one-room school house in the Jabez portion of      Wayne County.       In 1958 she began working with the Pulaski County School      System teaching first-eighth grades at Anderson School, which      was eventually consolidated into Nancy Elementary.       In 1978, she was promoted to principal of Nancy Elementary,      making her the first female principal in the history of the      Pulaski County School System.       Hatfield officially ``retired'' in 1997 while serving as K-     6 supervisor in the Pulaski County School District, a      position she had held since 1988.       She didn't stop. Since retiring, Hatfield has served as a      reading consultant and homebound instructor for the Pulaski      County     school system; a long-term substitute principal at numerous      elementary schools in Pulaski County; substitute teacher in      Pulaski County and Science Hill school systems; and for the      past 14 years she has served and continues to serve as a      teacher-educator for Pulaski County, Somerset, Science Hill      and Somerset Christian school.       Very active in community affairs, Hatfield is a board      member of Somerset-Pulaski Convention and Visitors Bureau,      member of Somerset Business and Professional Women's Club,      member and past president of Alpha Delta Kappa Educational      Sorority, director of Lake Cumberland Foundation, precinct      chair for the Pulaski County Republican Party, member of      Fidelis Chapter of Eastern Star, member and past president of      Pulaski County Republican Women's Club, member of Pulaski      County Lincoln Club and Mt. Pisgah Baptist Church.       The third of 10 children in a family of limited means,      Hatfield had to work while she attended Nancy High School.       For a time she worked and lived in Somerset, riding a bus      to attend high school at Nancy. She got a college education      by working and taking classes at Eastern Kentucky University.      She attended Butler University while she and husband Avery      worked in Indianapolis. She also was a student at Lindsey      Wilson College in Columbia.       The former Lois Roberts was married to Avery Hatfield more      than 60 years. The late Mr. Hatfield was a well-known coach      at the former Nancy High School, winning several county      championships. As an assistant to David Fraley at Pulaski      County High School, they guided the Maroons to the state      championship in 1986.       Avery Hatfield died on the first Sunday in November 2010,      two days before their son, Martin, was elected as Pulaski      County attorney.       Lois Hatfield is most sympathetic to today's lack of      sufficient funding for education.       Anderson School, her first teaching position with the      Pulaski County School System, had no electricity and no      lights. She held a pie supper and made money to install      electricity, paint the building and buy curtains for the      windows.                          ____________________
