President, we have spent quite a bit of time talking about this amendment. This does amend sections 1201 and 1204 of title XII, to provide our Government with new authorities to fight the global war on terror. We have initially had some concerns, both from the other side and from a couple of the other committees. We have worked out the compromise, and that is what this modification is.  In an effort to accommodate my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee and my colleagues across the aisle, we have made some modifications to our original amendment. These modifications provide a sunset for this authority on September 30, 2007. They provide for some limitation of DOD authority in section 1201, subject to existing law in the foreign relations and foreign appropriations act.  With these modifications, I think that it is going to be a great help to the administration.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lugar be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.
