Speaker, I want to welcome my colleague, Congressman Joe Crowley, the chair of the Democratic Caucus who is joining us this evening as well. I know how very busy he is, and I appreciate it.  As author of the legislation that created our Nation's World War II Memorial here in Washington, I felt obligated and actually compelled to come to this well tonight.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Trump administration's hollow January 27 statement commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day.  Statement by President Trump on International Holocaust Remembrance                          Day--January 27, 2017       ``It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember      and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It      is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror      inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.       ``Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light      shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are      deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the      innocent.       ``In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in      my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure      that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of      good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent      throughout the world.''
