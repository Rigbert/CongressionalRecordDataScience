Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to suggest that we go to conference. We should be talking about this motion. It is a good motion. It will expedite the process.  I would also like to suggest that the product we put together covers more than just airport security. The other body's bill is just airport security. We have ports, we have railroads, we have bridges, and we have pipelines. We have all forms of transportation that we have to make sure are secure.  I believe very strongly that the product that we voted on last week, 269 votes in favor of, does that job. Our job is to go to conference and see whether we can meld with what the other body wishes to do together into a comprehensive bill. I urge my colleagues to consider that. This is about working together and being able to compromise and understanding that we are all seeking the same thing, and that is a secure way of all forms of travel in the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
