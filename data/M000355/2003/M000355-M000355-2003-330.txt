 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m., Tuesday, October 28. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then proceed to executive session to consider the Leavitt nomination as provided under the previous order; provided that following the disposition of the nomination, the Senate return to legislative session and resume consideration of H.R. 2800, the foreign operations appropriations bill.  I further ask consent that the Senate recess tomorrow from 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly party lunches.
