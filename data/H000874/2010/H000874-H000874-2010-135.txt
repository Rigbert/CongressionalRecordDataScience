I am pretty sure I did not, not today or, frankly, any other day, because it hasn't been finally completed by the Ways and Means Committee. As you know, they are working with the Senate Finance Committee as well, and working with Republicans. As you know, this was a bipartisan bill when it came from the Senate, Republicans supported it, and we hope it is a bipartisan bill as it leaves here.  But let me say the fact is what the Senate sent us, we are working on. The process that we will consider it has not yet been finally determined, so I can't tell the gentleman exactly what that will be. But some of the things I have already mentioned will be in it, UI and COBRA, FMAP, Build America Bonds for local infrastructure programs, summer jobs programs so we can get young people to work this summer so that they will have some livelihood and can help their families who are in distress.                              {time}  1345  We also, as I said, are going to deal with the SGR to ensure seniors can keep their doctors. We'll conclude provisions to close tax loopholes, crack down on outsourcing of jobs overseas and protect American jobs here at home. Those are all the things that I think will be in it. That's not necessarily an exclusive list, but that is certainly a bill that we think will be pro-business, and confirming many of the tax benefits that are given to businesses, as you well know, that we regulate, continue, including the investment tax credit so that we can encourage businesses to grow and invest and to create jobs.  So that is an outline of it. This process has not yet been decided. I'm sure there will be discussions about that tomorrow with our Rules Committee chair and with the committee. Perhaps we can know at a later date.
