Chairman, I just wanted to say one of the arguments that the Secretary of Treasury uses in the materials he sent to us today say, ``The administration and any President needs these dollars because of today's large, fast-moving financial markets.''  I want to say that that is exactly the reason that this Congress should have oversight; that because in fact so many powerful global financial interests have an impact on this marketplace, we in Congress have got to be in tandem with those movements. We cannot absent ourself from that process, and, in fact, we have to gain some leverage over these major financial decisions that end up being political decisions in the end, when we end up supporting certain financial interests in other places.  The Secretary says, ``Treasury fully accepts its responsibility to account to Congress.'' I would say Congress ought to accept its responsibility to account to the American people. I urge the Members to support the Sanders-Bachus amendment.
