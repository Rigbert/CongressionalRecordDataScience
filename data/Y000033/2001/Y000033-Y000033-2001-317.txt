Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring to the House the 2001 Supplemental Appropriations bill. While this is the first appropriations activity on the floor of this Congress, it is actually the last appropriations action for the last Congress because this is a supplemental dealing with fiscal year 2001 funding.
