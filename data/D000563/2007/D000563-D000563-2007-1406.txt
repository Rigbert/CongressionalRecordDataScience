President, let me say, for those who have not followed this debate closely, I think we have made amazing progress until today--until today--because what happened before today was that we were moving on a bipartisan track, a track of cooperation, so that the Senate would exercise its responsibility and deliberate a topic that is being debated today in Springfield, IL, and Little Rock, AR. That is the war.  In an effort to reach this point, we have made accommodations. Senators Biden, Levin, and Hagel worked long and hard on a resolution of disapproval of the President's policy.
