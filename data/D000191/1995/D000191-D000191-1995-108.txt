It is obviously an absurd formula. You cannot spend another $92 billion over the next 7 years on the military to build weapons that even now the Pentagon said it does not want, it does not need, and have no practical purpose.  The House voted this week, with very little exposure to the public. This bill was brought forward under a very restrictive rule and we were allowed one amendment on the B-2 bomber. At $1.5 billion each for bombers which the Pentagon says have no purpose in the post-cold-war world, and yet the House of Representatives voted by a substantial margin, lockstep on the Republican side, followed by a number of Democrats, to build another 10 B-2 bombers at the cost of $1.5 billion each, something the Pentagon said it does not want, does not need, and cannot use, in addition to putting more money into the star wars fantasy.  We have spent $36 billion on star wars since Ronald Reagan first unveiled this vision in the early eighties and you know what the net result is of the money on star wars? One faked test over the Pacific Ocean, and the Pentagon admits they faked it. They could not hit the incoming missile. One missile, not a fleet. They put explosives in it, they hit a button, it blew up, and they said look, star wars works. It does not work, and it is a very expensive fantasy.
