 Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today Congress will begin the debate on borrowing $87 billion to continue the conflict in Iraq and build that country. Not rebuild it, build it. It is not for war damage; it is a vision of people in the Bush administration of the needs of the Iraqis, which apparently exceed the needs of Americans when it comes to clean water. They are appalled that they have open water systems; we have open water systems in the U.S. They are appalled that the port does not have state-of-the-art cranes. Well, we have got a lot of cranes missing from ports in the United States.  Then the most outrageous thing is somehow we have troops over there without ceramic body armor. Despite the fact, we appropriated $79 billion earlier this year, $300 million to buy $27 million worth of vests. There was a nearly $400 billion Pentagon budget; could not find the $23 million there. Now, we are told they need another $300 million to buy $23 million worth of vests. How many times are we going to buy these things? What is going on?  When are the troops going to get the equipment they need? Billions and billions for contractors, for Pentagon procurement, but the troops do not have the basics. There is something very wrong with this picture.                          ____________________
