Madam Speaker, let me just say at the outset to my friend, the former Speaker for whom I have the highest regard, it is always appropriate to defend to the best extent possible the fragile lives of unborn children from the violence of abortion, and it is always appropriate to defend to the greatest degree possible conscience rights when they are under assault. That is why I, along with many of my colleagues, rise today in support of H.J. Res. 43, to disapprove of D.C. legislation that infringes on the First Amendment freedoms of religious charities and pro-life advocacy groups in the District of Columbia.  I especially want to thank Congresswoman Diane Black for her consistent and highly effective leadership over many years for fundamental conscience rights and for attempting to respect human life to the greatest extent possible.                              {time}  2200  I agree with six distinguished law professors--and I will include their letters fully in the Record--who wrote the D.C. Council last November and who said:  ``RHNDA's attempt to prevent employers from making decisions based on their 'personal beliefs' implies that the State has the power to judge what are and are not legitimate 'personal beliefs' and to conclude that religiously motivated opposition to State policies is unacceptable. The Supreme Court has unanimously affirmed that employers, not the State, may determine which religious practices they use as the basis for their organization's policies.''  The Secretary of Education for the Archdiocese of Washington wrote every Member of Congress, and he said:  ``RHNDA would force religious institutions, including the 20 Catholic schools in the District of Columbia that I oversee, to hire or retain employees who publicly act in defiance of the mission of their employer. It would subjugate the church's moral teaching to the moral views of the government.''  The National Right to Life Committee, which has its national headquarters right here in the District, said:  ``It would be intolerable for an advocacy organization such as ours to be required to hire or prohibit from firing a person who makes a 'decision' to engage in advocacy or any other activity that is directly antithetical to our core mission to lawfully advocate for the civil rights of the unborn.''  Christian and Muslim leaders also wrote a letter in which they pointed out:  ``We come together to oppose RHNDA. We believe it would infringe on religious employers' freedom to make employment decisions when necessary to preserve their religious mission and identity.''  Catholic University president John Garvey, a very, very distinguished president of Catholic U. and whom I literally had up in hearings to speak out against anti-Semitism, said:  ``This bill would require all employers, including religious schools such as ours, to hire or retain employees who publicly act in defiance of our mission. It would take away our right to carryout our mission through personnel policies and practices that are rooted in our faith. The D.C. bill carries no exemption or language of tolerance.''  Again, I would agree with former Mayor Vincent Gray in that it raises serious First Amendment concerns in the Constitution.                                                   April 29, 2015.     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative, I am writing to urge your support of      the House Joint Resolution 43, disapproving the Reproductive      Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act in the United States      House of Representatives.       The Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act      would force religious institutions, including the 20 Catholic      schools in the District of Columbia that I oversee, to hire      or retain employees who publicly act in defiance of the      mission of their employer. It would subjugate the Church's      moral teaching to the moral views of the government,      violating the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and      the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and result in      discrimination against religious believers. Practically      speaking, Catholic schools would be obliged to keep teachers      that sow confusion among schoolchildren by engaging in      conduct that is contrary to Catholic teaching on the      fundamental dignity of human life from the moment of      conception. The Archdiocese of Washington has long respected      home rule for the District of Columbia and, therefore,      advocated for our constitutional rights with the D.C. Council      and Mayor. However, they moved forward despite our objections      forcing us to appeal to the United States Congress to restore      our freedoms.       Accordingly the Archdiocese of Washington joins other      religious institutions, faith-based organizations and pro-     life advocacy groups urging you and your colleagues to defend      our freedom of religion, freedom of speech and freedom of      association in the Nation's Capital.       Please vote for House Joint Resolution 43 disapproving the      Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act. Thank      You.           Sincerely,                                        Thomas W. Burnford, D.Min.     Secretary for Education.                                  ____         The Catholic University of America, Office of the            President,                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2015.     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative, I urge you to vote for House Joint      Resolution 43 when it reaches the floor today. The bill would      express the House's disapproval of the Reproductive Health      Non-Discrimination Act passed by the D.C. Council.       That bill would require all employers, including religious      schools such as ours, to hire or retain employees who      publicly act in defiance of our mission. It would take away      our right to carry out our mission through personnel policies      and practices that are rooted in our faith.       The D.C. bill carries no exemption or language of tolerance      that would acknowledge or accommodate the religious and      associational freedoms protected by the First Amendment. It      places the preferences of the government above the Church's      teaching on important matters.       I recognize the significance of Congress's acting to      disapprove a bill passed by the D.C. Council and urge you to      take this unusual step only because of the great impact the      bill would have on our ability freely to operate this      University. I am grateful for your support           Sincerely,                                                      John Garvey,     President.                                  ____                                                 November 5, 2014.     Hon. Phil Mendelson,     Council of the District of Columbia,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Mendelson: We are college and university      professors opposed to the Reproductive Health Non-     Discrimination Act of 2014 (RHNDA). It seeks to amend Sec. 2.      Section 211 (D.C. Official Code Sec. 2-1402.11) of the Human      Rights Act of 1977, effective December 13, 1977 (D.C. Law 2-     38; D.C. Official Code Sec. 201401.01 et seq) (the Act) to      read: ``An employer or employment agency shall not      discriminate against an individual with respect to      compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment      because of or on the basis of the individual's or a      dependent's reproductive health decision making, including a      decision to use or access a particular drug, device or      medical service, because of or on the basis of an employer's      personal beliefs about such services.''       We are convinced that RHNDA violates the federal Religious      Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which governs the District's      policies on the restriction of religious freedoms. RFRA is      not limited to institutions owned by religious organizations,      but extends to closely-held corporations whose owners' free      exercise of religion is burdened by state regulation. Burwell      v. Hobby Lobby Stores, No. 13-354 (U.S. June 30, 2014).       The Act currently contains an exemption for religious      organizations and organizations ``operated, supervised or      controlled by or in connection with a religious . . .      organization'' (Sec. 2-1401.3). RHNDA appears aimed at owners      of entities like Hobby Lobby, whose owners would seek the      same exemption offered religious organizations and their      subsidiaries. The standard that RFRA stipulates, that the      government may burden religious practice of owners of      closely-held corporations only when it is advancing a      compelling state interest by means that are the least      restrictive to the affected religious practice, is ignored by      the proposed legislation.       RHNDA proposes to overturn the long-standing recognition of      the right of religious employers to run their enterprises      according to their religious beliefs. RHNDA's attempt to      prevent employers from making decisions based on their      ``personal beliefs'' implies that the state has the power to      judge what are, and are not, legitimate ``personal beliefs''      and to conclude that religiously-motivated opposition to      state policies is unacceptable. The Supreme Court has      unanimously affirmed that employers, not the state, may      determine which religious practices they use as the basis for      their organizations' policies. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical      Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 132 S. Ct. 6.       We oppose passage of the RHNDRA and urge you and your      colleagues to reject this bill.

Re nullify the D.C. ``Reproductive Health Non-         Discrimination'' law.       Dear Member of Congress: The National Right to Life      Committee, the nationwide federation of state right-to-life      organizations, urges you to vote in favor of H. J. Res. 43, a      resolution introduced by Congresswoman Black to nullify the      so-called ``Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment      Act'' (RHNDA) in the District of Columbia. NRLC intends to      include the roll call on H. J. Res. 43 in our scorecard of      key pro-life votes of the 114th Congress.       The RHNDA prohibits employers within the District from      engaging in ``discrimination'' on the basis of ``decisions''      reached by employees, or potential employees, regarding      ``reproductive health'' matters. It is not disputed that      abortion is among the matters encompassed by the term      ``reproductive health'' as used in the new law. The scope of      the RHNDA is very broad, covering any ``decisions'' that are      ``related to the use . . . of a particular . . . medical      service . . .'' [emphasis added].       The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) advocates for      recognition that each unborn child is a member of the human      family, and that each abortion stops a beating heart and ends      the life of a developing human being. That viewpoint is      shared by many women who once believed otherwise and      submitted to abortions, and by many men who once believed      otherwise and were complicit in abortion; such persons number      among the most committed activists within our organization      and other pro-life organizations. Yet it would be intolerable      for an advocacy organization such as ours to be required to      hire, or prohibited from firing, a person who makes a      ``decision'' to engage in advocacy or any other activity that      is directly antithetical to our core mission to lawfully      advocate for the civil rights of the unborn.       Under the RHNDA, using any ``decision . . . related to''      abortion to inform decisions about hiring, firing, or      benefits (among other things) would expose our organization      both to enforcement actions by the District government      bureaucracy, and to private lawsuits (some of which would      likely be engendered by ``sting'' operations by pro-abortion      advocates).       Some have suggested that we would be protected from such      results by a clause in the pre-existing D.C. Human Rights Act      that makes narrow allowance for ``giving preference to      persons of the same religion or political persuasion'' as a      controlling ``religious or political organization.'' But NRLC      is neither a political nor a religious organization as those      terms are used in the law. NRLC is not ``operated, supervised      or controlled by'' any religious institution or political      party, as the law requires to claim the narrow exemption.      Moreover, our staff is made up of persons who are personally      affiliated with a wide variety of religious bodies,     or with none, and persons who belong to a variety of      political parties, or to none.       Article I of the U.S. Constitution provides that Congress      shall ``exercise exclusive legislation in all cases      whatsoever'' with respect to the seat of government, the      federal District. Therefore, the RHNDA has been enacted with      legal authority delegated to the District Council by      Congress; that local body has no other political authority      whatever under the Constitution. It follows that members of      Congress are responsible for, and accountable for, abuses of      the legal authority that Congress has delegated to District      officials. The RHNDA is just such an abuse of delegated      power--it is a politically motivated attack on our      organization and the other organizations that seek to      vindicate the human rights of unborn children.       The roll call on H. J. Res. 43, the resolution of      disapproval, will be accurately described in our scorecard      and in reports to our national membership as a fair reading      of where each Member of the House of Representatives stands      regarding a blatantly political attack on the pro-life      movement.           Respectfully,     Douglas D. Johnson,       Legislative Director.     Susan T. Muskett, J.D.,       Senior Legislative Counsel.                                  ____     Hon. Phil Mendelson,     Council of the District of Columbia,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Mendelson: We represent the city's broad and      diverse faith community. We may believe and practice our      faith differently. We may have divergent positions on      important issues. However we all agree that faith communities      have a right to freely exercise their religion and a      responsibility to promote and protect this important freedom.      We believe religious freedom is not only our priority, but      also a priority in our society.       We come together then to oppose the Reproductive Health      Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014. We believe it would      infringe upon religious employers' freedom to make employment      decisions when necessary to preserve their religious mission      and identity. In doing so, the legislation would allow for      unjust and unnecessary government interference into religious      employers' governance and operations.       While religious employers do not police employees' or      dependents' private reproductive health decisions, these      employers must have the freedom to respond to employees'      public behavior repudiating their religious mission and      identity.       We believe that the legislation would in fact discriminate      against religious employers in a manner prohibited by the      significant constitutional and legal protections provided to      religious organizations in the U.S. Constitution's First      Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act       We respectfully request that you oppose the Reproductive      Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act. We pray that you      will be fair and reasonable in your considerations of our      sincere concerns. We will follow up with you with regard to      these priority concerns.
