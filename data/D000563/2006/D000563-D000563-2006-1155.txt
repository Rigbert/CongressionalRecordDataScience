President, I would say in response to the Senator from Nevada the name Jonas Salk, a name no one ever heard of until this great researcher came up with a vaccine for polio. When we were in grade school as children and saw our fellow students crippled by polio, in fear that it could strike us, Jonas Salk, this researcher, came forward with that vaccine and he changed our lives. He took a burden off of our lives and the lives of our parents who worried about whether their kids would contract polio.  Why can't we give the same hope and same promise to a new generation of Americans with stem cell research? Why is our Government, why is this administration, why is the President blocking this research, and why won't the Senate Republican leadership bring this bill to the floor?  If this is about National Health Care Week, shouldn't we be talking about medical research? Shouldn't we be talking about new cures and new opportunities so people can have a better life? Unfortunately, we are not.
