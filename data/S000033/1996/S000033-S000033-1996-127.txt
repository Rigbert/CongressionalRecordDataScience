 Speaker, the leadership of this Congress has passed huge tax breaks for the rich and for the largest corporations in America.  But somehow, when some of us want to raise the minimum wage for millions of American workers, we are told that we are not even allowed to have a vote.  People today are working longer hours for lower wages, and they are entitled to a raise. Mr. Speaker, let us raise the minimum wage; more importantly, let us have the guts to vote on the issue.
