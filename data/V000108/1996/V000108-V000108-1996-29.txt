Speaker, I rise today to congratulate three distinguished young men for attaining the rank of Eagle Scout of the Boy Scouts of America [BSA]. Joseph Rybarczyk, Adam Summers, and Anthony Paul Pagorek are all members of the Boy Scout Troop No. 542, sponsored by St. Thomas More Catholic Church Holy Name Society of Munster. They will receive this honor at an Eagle Scout Court of Honor on Sunday, July 21, 1996, at the Munster Community Social Center located in Munster, IN.  An elite group of 2.5 percent of all Boy Scouts attain the Eagle Scout ranking, which is the highest of seven rankings in the Boy Scouts organization. In order to become an Eagle Scout, one must complete the following three tasks; earn 21 merit badges; complete a service project; and demonstrate strong leadership skills within the troop.  According to Stephen Kennedy, Troop Scout Master of BSA Troop No. 542, all three young men are longstanding members of Troop No. 542, as well as outstanding students. Joe, a student at Munster High School and a member of their school band, did an angel tree with the Salvation Army. This project provided Christmas gifts for the Salvation Army to distribute throughout the holiday. Joe was also a senior patrol leader, which is the highest position in the troop. Adam, also a member of Munster High School and their school band, took part in park improvements for the town of Munster. Specifically, he helped to restore several park benches. Anthony, an outstanding student and athlete at Andrean High School, improved landscaping around St. Thomas More Catholic Church. Anthony also attended the National Scout Preserve in Philmont, NM. This preserve is a high adventure camp with a rugged terrain.  The fact that a boy is an Eagle Scout always has carried with it special significance, not only in scouting, but also as he entershigher education, a career, or community service. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Adam Summers, Anthony Paul Pagorek, and Joseph Rybarczyk for their commendable efforts in society. It takes a great deal of tenacity and devotion to achieve such an illustrious ranking. These three young men have established promising futures, while at the same time improving the quality of life in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
