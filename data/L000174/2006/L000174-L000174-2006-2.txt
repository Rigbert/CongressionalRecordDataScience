President, on January 3, 2007, a longtime employee of the Congress and the Legislative Branch will retire from public service. After 40 years of service, Anthony J. ``Tony'' Zagami will depart as the longest serving general counsel in the history of the U.S. Government Printing Office.  Tony Zagami began his career as a young Senate Page in the mid-1960s. I first met him during my first term in the Senate representing the citizens of Vermont. At that time, Tony was working in the Senate Democratic cloakroom while completing law school. He spent a total of 25 years in various positions on Capitol Hill before leaving in 1990 to become the general counsel for GPO, the agency responsible for printing and distributing the Congressional Record and almost all other Government publications.  Years ago, my wife Marcelle and I invited Tony over for an evening at our house in McLean. Also joining us was Henry Chapin, who gave us a performance that showed us why he is known as a great balladeer. I will always remember that night of music, laughter, and friends fondly.  Throughout his career both here on the Hill and later with GPO, Tony was known for his dedication and hard work on behalf of the American people. He leaves with a lengthy and very distinguished record of public service. I thank my friend Tony Zagami for that service, and Marcelle and I wish him well as he departs to begin a new chapter in his life.
