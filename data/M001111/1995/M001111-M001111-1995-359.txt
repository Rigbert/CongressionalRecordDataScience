 President, let me just comment that of the two amendments I sent to the desk, one of them assures that we would not be creating a big, new, powerful bureaucracy at the Congressional Budget Office, and the other one relates to the effect of this bill on nuclear waste cleanup efforts. I am especially concerned about some at the Hanford site in my own State. I will be speaking on these amendments later, but I did want to submit them today under the previous unanimous consent.  I thank the Chair.
