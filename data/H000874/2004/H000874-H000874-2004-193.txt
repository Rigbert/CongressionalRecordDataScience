 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding to me and dreaming.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' office by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be postponed until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday and the balance of the week, we plan to consider several bills under a rule: H.R. 4513, the Renewable Energy Project Siting Improvement Act; H.R. 4503, the Energy Policy Act; H.R. 4517, the U.S. Refinery Revitalization Act; and H.R. 4529, the Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security and Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation Reform Act.  In addition, we expect to consider H.R. 4520, the American Jobs Creation Act, the fiscal year 2005 Department of Interior appropriations bill, and the fiscal year 2005 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill as well.  And, finally, I would like to make all Members aware that we will have votes next Friday perhaps well into the afternoon.  I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and would be happy to answer any questions he may have.
