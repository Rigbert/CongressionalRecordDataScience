Let me quote what Speaker Gingrich said in 1988 about the investigation of Speaker Wright:       I am concerned that the scope, authority and independence      of the special counsel will be limited by the guidelines the      Ethics Committee has established.  Gingrich went on--       The House of Representatives, as well as the American      public, deserve an investigation which will uncover the      truth. At this moment, I am afraid that the apparent      restrictions placed on this special counsel will not allow      the truth to be uncovered.  Speaker Gingrich was right then, and the same rules should apply today. Let the special counsel uncover the truth. If the Speaker has nothing to hide, do not limit the scope of the special counsel's investigation.                          ____________________
