Mr. Speaker, while this House was in recess, the world learned of a tragic loss. Fred Cuny, disaster relief expert, pioneer in modern humanitarian assistance, and American citizen, is now presumed by his family to have been murdered in Chechnya. He had vanished there some 5 months ago, along with a Russian translator, Galena Oleinik, and two Red Cross doctors, Andrei Sereda and Sergei Makarov, who had come with him. Their deaths are all the more tragic because they were in Chechnya not to help one side or another, but to assess the needs of innocent refugees, Chechen and Russian, driven from their homes by the conflict.  The facts of this tragedy are not entirely clear. According to information received by the Cuny family, it appears that Fred Cuny and his associates were killed by a group of Chechens, but there is evidence that Russian authorities in Chechnya may have had a hand in the killings. During the course of an investigation into his death, the Cuny family took written and spoken testimony that Russian intelligence operatives had spread disinformation about the group, alleging that Cuny's team was anti-Chechen and associated with the Russian secret service. Whether this effort was intended to discredit the team, or had more sinister motives, is immaterial. If true, it is an example of the callous disregard Russia has shown toward the fat of noncombatants in Chechnya, including those who are trying to alleviate human suffering.  Mr. Speaker, Fred Cuny cared passionately about human rights. After his first visit to Chechnya, he wrote an article entitled ``Killing Chechnya'' for the New York Review of Books, in which he documented the indiscriminate bombing and shelling of residential areas by the Russian Army, a barrage that left both Chechen and Russian civilians dead by the thousands and homeless by the tens of thousands. Just before he departed for his fateful second trip, he met with the staff of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which I have the honor to serve as chairman, recounting the willful disregard for human life that he had found in Chechnya. His words from that meeting about the innocent civilians caught up in the fighting--``they're dying like flies''--were marked by both frustration and compassion. I would add also that Fred Cuny also testified before the Commission earlier with regard to his humanitarian efforts in the former Yugoslavia and the human suffering in that corner of Europe.  Fred Cuny's concern for human rights abuses carried him all over the world, often at the behest of his country's political and military leaders, who many times--most recently, during and after the gulf war, and in the former Yugoslavia--employed him as a consultant. The company he founded, Intertect Relief and Reconstruction Agency, was devoted to finding solutions to humanitarian disaster--solutions that set a new precedent for excellence and long-range planning in the field of disaster relief. He saved tens of thousands of lives, traveling to some of the most dangerous corners of the world, often at enormous personal risk.  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken out strongly against the brutality of the war in Chechnya, and its corrosive and potentially destructive effect upon the prospect of Russian democracy. I have joined with the international community in calling for a cease-fire in Chechnya. One month ago, that call was answered. The efforts of the Russians and Chechens in establishing and holding to a cease-fire agreement should not be overlooked. But neither should the murders of Fred Cuny and his team, and neither should Russian and Chechen responsibility for the killings, if any exists.  In his compassion, courage, and ingenuity, Fred Cuny embodied so much that we hold valuable in the American spirit. But the deaths of that relief team remind us that the horrors against which he had spent his life fighting--the slaughter of innocent civilians, the deprivation of even the most basic human rights, such as food and shelter, from an entire town, the persecution of humanitarian workers--are the tools of those who would rule by repression, force, and fear.  Mr. Speaker, I offer my condolences to the Cuny family, and to the families of those who died with him. I hope that Fred Cuny will be remembered for his good work, immense courage, and for his honorable death. And, I call on both sides, Chechen and Russian, to use the current cease-fire to expose and bring to justice those responsible for this reprehensible act.                          ____________________
