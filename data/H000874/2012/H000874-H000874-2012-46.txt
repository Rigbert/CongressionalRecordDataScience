 Madam Speaker, again, the gentleman says that I'm technically correct. I presume that means I'm correct.  The bill that I'm asking to be brought to this floor to pass will not raise anybody's taxes. What the gentleman is saying is that, unless we deal with the 2 percent, the 98 percent are going to be held hostage until such time as we deal with the 2 percent. Now, the problem with that, in a democracy, we have a disagreement on that. As a matter of fact, it was pretty clear to the American public that there was a very significant and unclouded, not confusing, difference between the two candidates for President on the very issue to which the gentleman speaks, and the American public voted. And the President of the United States, who said, ``No, I don't agree with that,'' won the election. He won the election. And he is saying, I'm not going to sign the bill on the $250,000 or above.  Now, my problem, Mr. Leader, is I understand your conclusion is that if you pass the 98 percent, that you won't have a bargaining chip with which to press your point on the over $250,000, or over $200,000 individually as you correctly observe. I understand that. But, frankly, the bargaining chip is somewhat illusory in that the President said absolutely he will not sign that. Why? Because he wants to bring down the deficit. He wants to and has agreed to--and we've agreed to--over $1.7 trillion in spending cuts already for 2011, 2012, and 2013, and for the next decade--or at least until 2022. We've already agreed to that. You pressed that, you were successful. We agreed on many of those. Some we didn't agree on, but you had the votes we needed to reach an agreement and we reached an agreement. So we cut almost $2 trillion of spending already.  You're correct: we need to assure the fact that we pay for what we buy, and if we don't want to pay for it, my view is we shouldn't buy it. Frankly, that principle applies, in my opinion, to tax expenditures as well as to buying stuff because it all reduces your ability to pay for what you're buying.  So I tell my friend, it's not that I'm technically correct; I'm correct. The bill that I'm asking you to pass will simply give to the 98 percent of American taxpayers the assurance that their taxes will not go up on January 1.                              {time}  1210  If we don't pass it, they won't have that assurance. Their confidence level will not be good. The stock market will be concerned. And, yes, we'll have to deal with the other 2 percent. That is clearly going to be a part of the discussion, and hopefully there will be an agreement.  But my presumption is the reason the gentleman from Oklahoma, Tom Cole, made that comment just a few days ago--and it's not like he's a backbencher. He is the former chairman of your Republican Campaign Committee--he said, We ought to do this. We ought to get it off the agenda so we give those people confidence. He called it a Christmas present to the 98 percent. I think it's a judgment that our economy will be better off if we do it.  I would be glad to yield to my friend.
