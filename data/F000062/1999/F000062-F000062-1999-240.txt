 The amendment essentially would require that when one ships an alcoholic beverage, that there be a label on the shipping container that contains clearly and prominently an identification of the contents of the package. It would then require that upon delivery, an adult must show identification to receive it. It also would provide that it is a criminal charge to violate that, and with three violations, the BATF revokes the license.
