President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous order with respect to H.R. 3590 be modified to provide that the Vitter amendment No. 2808 to the Mikulski amendment No. 2791 be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the order be further modified to provide that the vote with respect to the Mikulski amendment should now reflect the Mikulski amendment, as amended.
