I thank the leader for those kind and extraordinary words.  Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield time to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), who has been very active in Faith and Politics and has made these trips to Alabama.                              {time}  1445  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come to the floor during this Special Order time to also pay special tribute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis). My wife and I have had the privilege of attending two trips to Selma; and even though we did not attend the one this year, we were there last year and the year before last and had the extraordinary opportunity to experience a sort of living history of what took place during that period of time.  I know it must have been a thrill to go back to Selma this year and to maybe hug or greet the new mayor of Selma. I know the gentleman has been going back there for many years, but to have somebody like the new mayor just elected in Selma must have been an extraordinary opportunity and thrill for the gentleman after so many years of fighting for voting rights.  I think part of what we learned on the trip is that voting is a precious right that we have in America, and it really comes home when you go to Selma and go to Montgomery and experience the opportunity to travel across the roads that the gentleman traveled and others traveled to gain that right for so many people. As we all lived out the election last November, it also I think gives us the idea that the right to vote is precious, and when people do not have that right and perhaps are denied that right, we can experience what the gentleman did back 35 or 36 years ago to try to win it for a whole group of people that did not have it.  I think it is a good message for all of us, to continue our efforts to make sure that when people go to the polls, the right is carried out in an accurate way and a way that reflects the will of the people.  So it has been a great experience and a good lesson for all of us, that there are many things that we do when we are elected to these jobs in terms of introducing bills and coming on the floor and debating, but the opportunity to step outside of that role and to experience what people like the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) have experienced and others have experienced I think is a good lesson for all of us in terms of what we can bring back to the House in terms of reforms that may be made as a result of that experience.  So I congratulate the gentleman. As one who has tried to practice bipartisanship and support bipartisanship, I think the trip to Selma and Montgomery is one of the extraordinary bipartisan efforts; and I congratulate the gentleman, and Faith and Politics, and Doug Tanner and the work that he does and his organization. Doug works mighty hard around here to try to bring people together, and I know that there are grand plans to do something extraordinary next year, and I hope that Members of the House will look on the opportunities we have had at Selma to build on that for other opportunities with Faith and Politics and with the gentleman.  Again, I thank the gentleman for giving all of us an opportunity to know him, know his experience, share his experience, and to really imbue in all of us the importance of how precious the right to vote really is for all of us.  I thank the gentleman for this Special Order and the chance to say a few words.
