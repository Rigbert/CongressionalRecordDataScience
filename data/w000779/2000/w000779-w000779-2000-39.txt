President, many folks in rural Oregon and other parts of rural America believe the Federal Government has abandoned them. They think Washington, D.C. has reneged on a decades-long commitment to support their schools and roads with revenue from timber harvested on Federal lands. People in timber-dependent rural America think they are being left behind to live in economic sacrifice zones.  Policy changes in Washington, DC., affecting logging on national forest across this country have caused timber receipts to fall an average of 70 percent over the last 15 years, and by as much as 90 percent in some areas. As timber receipts disappeared, roads fell deeper into disrepair, school programs were cut to the bone, and some schools even had to close their doors at least 1 day a week. Our fellow citizens who live in rural America should not be just an afterthought in our warp-speed world. The legislation before us, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, will renew the compact with timber-dependent communities without compromising our commitment to environmentally sound stewardship of our forests. It will give people in rural counties the financial predictability they need to step into the 21st century.  Since 1908, people in rural counties across this country have lived by a compact with the Federal Government. As compensation for paying no property taxes, the Federal Government would give the counties a quarter of the timber revenue. For decades, this arrangement provide adequate funds to sustain schools, roads and other basic county services, like emergency rescue. But when timber harvests began to drop off and timber jobs were lost, little effort was made to help offset the shortfall, and citizens in rural counties felt betrayed by the government in Washington, DC. We are not talkingabout a few isolated communities in remote areas of America. Timber-dependent communities are found in 709 counties in 42 states. Some 800,000 school children and millions of people live in these counties. Thirty-one of 36 counties in my State of Oregon receive timber payments. Counties in the western part of Oregon have been able to survive because of Spotted Owl safety net payments, but no such safety net exists for those in eastern Oregon. There, Grant County, has lost 90 percent of its timber receipts, from more than $12 million down to $1 million, and the county has turned to such cost-cutting measures as a 4-day school week.  Under this legislation, Oregon counties will get a total of $261 million a year--an increase of $115 million, or 79 percent. Of the $261 million, $222 million would be available for schools and roads and $39 million will remain for the counties either to invest in their backyard national forests or in forest-related county services.  The purpose of S. 1608 is to help rural communities adapt to changing national forest management policies by creating a funding formula alternative to timber receipts. The legislation will ensure that the future relationship between the people living in the 709 affected rural counties and the Federal Government does not depend on how many trees are cut. Rural communities will be connected to Federal lands through stewardship projects, maintenance of existing forest infrastructure, ecosystem restoration and improvement of land and water quality. Counties will choose how to spend the Federal payment, and projects will be developed by broad-based groups of local citizens. Collaboration with Federal land managers will help ensure projects comply with all existing environmental laws and regulations. The legislation would restore stability to the 25 percent payments compact by ensuring a predictable payment level to forest communities for six years. The amount going toward schools and roads would represent 80-85 percent of the three-year average of the highest payment years from 1985 to the present. Unlike today's system, a county will receive its payment from the general Treasury, regardless of whether a single tree is cut from national forests.  Counties will decide for themselves how to invest the remaining 15-to-20 percent of the average amount described above for projects recommended by local community advisory committees if those projects are approved by the appropriate Federal land management agency. Although locally-conceived, every project must comply with all environmental laws and regulations, as well as all applicable forest plans. Counties might also opt to pursue projects related to the forest--rather than in the forest--through Title III. These projects might include fire prevention, the purchase of easements or forest-related after-school programs. In addition, each project must--and I quote from the bill here--``improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement stewardship objectives that enhance forest ecosystems, and restore and improve land health and water quality'' on the national forests.  County choice is critical to the bill. Counties that opt not to join the program--such as those anticipating higher timber receipts in the immediate future--will continue to receive payments based on the existing formula, and they also have the option of joining the program two years down the road. Counties that opt to join the program will get stable payments based on a new formula.  There is no doubt about it. This legislation will change the traditional dynamic between logging and Federal payments to schools and counties. But altering the link between timber harvest and county payments does not mean we seek to sever the ties between people and land. S. 1608 will strengthen the bond between communities and neighboring Federal forests. The projects that would be authorized by S. 1608 are a way for the Federal government to recognize--without relaxing or compromising our environmental commitments--that timber towns grow not just trees, but people, too.  When this debate began, the issues were highly polarized. On the one side were those who would punish the Forest Service for not cutting enough trees; on the other were those who, unintentionally, would punish our rural communities and school children by not providing them the funding they so desperately need. After listening to both sides and after many long discussions, Senator Craig and I rejected the extremes and sought out a middle path that would break the gridlock. The legislation we bring to the Senate will establish a foundation to move rural communities beyond this time of crisis, and, with the forest ecosystem restoration projects, put them on a path toward sustainability in this new century.  One of my goals for this legislation was to assure the counties have as much choice as possible, and I believe this goal has been met. As I said earlier, first, counties can choose whether they would like to be part of this program and receive a stable payment. If they choose not to be part of the program, they may revisit this decision every 2 years. Second, a county that chooses to be part of the program and receive stable payments must decide the type of projects they want to invest in: projects in the forest, like stream and watershed restoration; or projects related to the forests, such as wildfire prevention or afterschool programs for their children. Also, a county can opt simply to have the money sent back to the U.S. Treasury without pursuing projects. Finally, these choices may be revisited every year.  The ecological health of the forests is a key to survival for many of these communities, making forest restoration a cornerstone of the bill. Counties have choices as to how and how much they receive so they are able to determine the best allocation of funds: whether to support forest health, job creation, ecosystem restoration or a combination of these. Whatever the choice, it is an investment in both the future of the forest and the community. This legislation is the product of many months of painstaking work. Since the beginning, it has been a bipartisan effort. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported the legislation by voice vote last April, and through negotiations with many other interested Senators, we have a managers' amendment that represents a further refinement of the bill.  I particularly want to thank Senators Craig  and Bingaman,  the Chair and ranking member of the Energy Committee. Without their dedication and willingness to put long hours into this effort, we would not have such a solid piece of legislation. I would also like to make special note of the help of Senator Baucus in crafting Title III and bringing a strong focus on wildfire prevention. I would also like to acknowledge the work of the staff on S. 1608. In particular, Jose Kardon, my chief of staff, and Sarah Bittleman, my Natural Resources counsel, have done yeoman's work on this legislation. Carole Grunberg, my legislative director, and Jeff Gagne, my Education advisor, also contributed to the effort. Special thanks also goes to Mark Rey of the Energy Committee staff, whose steady hand and creativity helped resolve so many problems successfully; to Bob Simon and Kira Finkler, of the Energy Committee Democratic staff; and to Brian Kuehl with Senator Baucus and Sara Barth with Senator Boxer.  S. 1608 is supported by thousands of groups, hundreds of counties, labor organizations and school groups including the National Education Association, National Association of Counties, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as the AFL-CIO.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                           Amendment No. 4139
