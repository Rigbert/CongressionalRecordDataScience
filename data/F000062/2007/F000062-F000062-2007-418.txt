 President, I offer today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Shigeru Yamada, a 24-year-old Japanese national who lives in Chula Vista, CA.  I have decided to re-introduce a private bill on his behalf because I believe that Mr. Yamada represents a model American citizen, for whom removal from this country would represent an unfair hardship. Without this legislation, Mr. Yamada will be forced to return to a country in which he lacks any linguistic, cultural or family ties.  Mr. Yamada legally entered the United States with his mother and two sisters in 1992 at the young age of 10. The family was fleeing from Mr. Yamada's alcoholic father, who had been physically abusive to his mother, the children and even his own parents. Since then, he has had no contact with his father and is unsure if he is even alive. Tragically, Mr. Yamada experienced further hardship when his mother was killed in a car crash in 1995. Orphaned at the age of 13, Mr. Yamada spent time living with his aunt before moving to Chula Vista to live with a close friend of his late mother.  The death of his mother marked more than a personal tragedy for Mr. Yamada; it also served to impede the process for him to legalize his status. At the time of her death, Mr. Yamada's family was living legally in the United States. His mother had acquired a student visa for herself and her children qualified as her dependants. Her death revoked his legal status in the United States. In addition, Mr. Yamada'smother was engaged to an American citizen at the time of her death. Had she survived, her son would likely have become an American citizen through this marriage.  Mr. Yamada has exhausted all administrative options under our current immigration system. Throughout high school, he contacted attorneys in the hopes of legalizing his status, but his attempts were unsuccessful. Unfortunately, time has run out and, for Mr. Yamada, the only option available to him today is private relief legislation.  For several reasons, it would be tragic for Mr. Yamada to be deported from the United States and forced to return to Japan.  First, since arriving in the United States, Mr. Yamada has lived as a model American. He graduated with honors from Eastlake High School in 2000, where he excelled in both academics and athletics. Academically, he earned a number of awards including being named an Outstanding English Student his freshman year, an All-American Scholar, and earning the United States National Minority Leadership Award. His teacher and coach, Mr. John describes him as being responsible, hard working, organized, honest, caring and very dependable. His role as the Vice-President of the Associated Student Body his senior year is an indication of Mr. Yamada's high level of leadership, as well as, his popularity and trustworthiness among his peers. As an athlete, Mr. Yamada was named the Most Inspirational Player of the Year in Junior Varsity baseball and football, as well as, Varsity football. His football coach, Mr. Jose Mendoza, expressed his admiration by saying that he has seen in Shigeru Yamada the responsibility, dedication and loyalty that the average American holds to be virtuous.  Second, Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as a local volunteer. As a member of the Eastlake High School Link Crew, he helped freshman find their way around campus, offered tutoring and mentoring services, and set an example of how to be a successful member of the student body. After graduating from high school, he volunteered his time for four years as the coach of the Eastlake High School Girl's softball team. The former head coach, who has since retired, Dr. Charles Sorge, describes him as an individual full of integrity who understands that as a coach it is important to work as a team player. His level of commitment to the team was further illustrated to Dr. Sorge when he discovered, halfway through the season, that Mr. Yamada's commute to and from practice was two hours long each way. It takes an individual with character to volunteer his time to coach and never bring up the issue of how long his commute takes him each day. Dr. Sorge hopes that, once Mr. Yamada legalizes his immigration status, he will be formally hired to continue coaching the team.  Third, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would be an immense hardship for him and his family here. Mr. Yamada does not speak Japanese. He is unaware of the nation's current cultural trends. And, he has no immediate family members that he knows of in Japan. Currently, both of his sisters are in the process of legalizing their immigration status in the United States. His older sister is married to a United States citizen and his younger sister is being adopted by a maternal aunt, who is a United States citizen. Since as all of his family lives in California, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would serve to split his family apart and separate him from everyone and everything that he knows. His sister contends that her younger brother would be lost if he had to return to live in Japan on his own. It is unlikely that he would be able to find any gainful employment in Japan due to his inability to speak or read the language.  As a member of the Chula Vista community, Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as an honorable individual. His teacher, Mr. Robert Hughes, describes him as being an upstanding All-American young man. Until being picked up during a routine check of riders' immigration status on a city bus, he had never been arrested or convicted of any crime. Mr. Yamada is not, and has never been, a burden on the State. He has never received any Federal or State assistance.  Currently, Mr. Yamada holds sophomore status at Southwestern Community College. However, he is taking this semester off in order to alleviate his financial burdens by working full time. He had hoped to pursue a career in law enforcement, but his plans have recently changed due to his current immigration status dilemma. Until he obtains citizenship, Mr. Yamada will be prohibited from pursuing a career in law enforcement. Due to the circumstances, Mr. Yamada has changed his career goal to that of becoming a high school teacher. Mr. Yamada's commitment to his education is admirable. He could have easily taken a different path but, through his own individual fortitude, he has dedicated himself to his studies so that he can live a better life.  With his hard work and giving attitude, Shigeru Yamada represents the ideal American citizen. Although born in Japan, he is truly American in every other sense. I ask you to help right a wrong and grant Mr. Yamada lawful permanent resident status so that he can continue towards his bright future.  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill on behalf of Mr. Yamada.  I also ask unanimous consent that the three letters of community support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         Eastlake High School,                         Chula Vista, California, January 9, 2007.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am more than happy to write this      letter on behalf of Shigeru Yamada as he pursues his efforts      to stay in the United States. I was Shigeru's counselor while      he attended Eastlake High School. During that time he always      displayed exemplary behavior, academic focus, and personal      determination.       Academically Shigeru was a model student. He earned a 3.84      grade point average; he made the National Honor Roll and was      nominated to Who's Who Among High School Students for three      straight years. Shigeru plans to attend a university to study      sports medicine and physical therapy so he has set high goals      for himself. He has the ability to not only handle college-     level work, but to thrive on the challenge the university      will bring. His quiet determination has been an example to      his peers and was a joy to his instructors.       Shigeru Yamada not only took the most from his high school      experience, but he has consistently ``given back'' his      talents, time, and effort to serve the school community. He      was elected ASB vice-president during his senior year. He      demonstrated leadership skills as president of the Inter-Club      Council on campus; he mentored incoming ninth-grade students      and worked on numerous service projects. In addition to his      involvement in student government, Shigeru participated in      football, baseball, and wrestling. He was named '''Most      Inspirational Player of the Year'' for both his junior      varsity baseball and football teams. He was also awarded the      J.T. Franks Memorial Award (most inspirational) from the      varsity football team. (This award carries a great deal of      respect amongst the players as it is named after a teammate      who died of cancer.) Shigeru was a role model for our      students when he attended our school: He earned good grades;      he was an athlete; and he was involved in a variety of      additional activities. He is the kind of student that      Eastlake High School has been proud to have.       A further testimony to Shigeru's character is what he has      been doing since graduating. This young man has come back to      serve as an assistant football and wrestling coach for our      students. He has given his time and energy to working with      individual students during the week and on weekends; he has      not only advised them on how to improve their athletic      skills, but he has also been a wonderful role model and      mentor. He is someone to whom the young men can relate, a      person whose opinions are valued. I have personally seen      Shigeru interact with these boys; the respect he gives them      and the respect they give Shigeru is an absolute indication      of the positive influence he has in their lives.       * * *                                  ____                                                 Word & Brown,                                  San Diego, CA, January 17, 2007.     To Whom It May Concern:       For over 11 years now Shigeru Yamada has been my best      friend. His presence in my life has been a blessing. From the      very first moment I met him I knew that he was a special      person destined to impact positively everyone's lives around      him. His ability to see the silver lining even around the      darkest rain cloud is amazing to me. As a student Shigeru was      amongst the best and brightest. He was a California      Scholarship Federation Scholar every semester, he was Spanish      student of the year two years in a row, and he served as      Associated Student Body Vice-President his senior year. As an      athlete, Shigeru was a varsity letterman in Football,      Wrestling,     and Track and Field. He also served as a team captain on the      Football team. As a member of the community, Shigeru has      donated of his time freely coaching the Eastlake High      Softball team and Eastlake High football team. His ability to      give so much and ask for so little in return is an      inspiration to all around him. For the last few years Shigeru      has been able to legally work in this country. In those few      years Shigeru has risen to the top sales levels at      Nordstrom's department store and was even promoted to      assistant manager. In every aspect and in every arena in      which Shigeru has been in he has always excelled. He      exemplifies that which makes this country great; bravery,      honesty, hard work. In this time of change and uncertainty      people like Shigeru Yamada remind me what it is that makes      this country of ours work. His pursuit of life, liberty, and      happiness has been a difficult one but he has never stopped      believing and working towards that goal. I respectfully      request that you once again push for Shigeru Yamada to be      granted full legal status in this great country of ours.     Pedro Miguel Reyes.                                  ____                                                 January 11, 2007.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to you from San Diego,      CA on behalf of my friend Shigera Yamada's life-long quest      for American citizenship.       I have known Shiggy as a fellow associate, as his manager,      as a confidante, and most importantly as a friend. Shiggy is      kind, honest, funny, giving, and intelligent. He is the type      of person who will pick you up no matter how out of his way      it is, bring you breakfast when you are sick, or just listen      to you when you need to talk.       One of the qualities I admire most about Shiggy is his      never-ending positive attitude. For the past two years that I      have known him, I have never heard him complain about his      situation. While going to school, working overtime, and      standing in as a father figure for his baby sister, he was      always there for me whenever I needed him. He has overcome so      many obstacles in his life that have only made him stronger.       Shiggy is a model citizen who has worked extremely hard to      get to where he is today. I am grateful for the chance to      have befriended Shiggy. He is one of the most respectful and      professional people I have ever met and had the chance to      work with. I know that he does not take a single thing in his      life for granted, and will continue to realize his goals      through hard work.       Our country would be lucky to acquire his high caliber of      determination, positive attitude, and perseverance as a      citizen. I admire his ability to use the curveballs life      throws his way as nothing less than learning experiences, and      highly recommend him for United States citizenship.       Thank You,                                            Sara Chaffee-Standish.                                 ______                                       By
