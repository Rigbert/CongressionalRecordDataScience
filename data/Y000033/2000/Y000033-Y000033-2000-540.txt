Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues to be aware of a revealing report issued last month by the General Accounting Office on the economy of the Northern Mariana Islands. The report's findings confirm the development of a healthy and diversified economy in our newest American territory in the Western Pacific that is not a drain on the U.S. taxpayer. However, these findings are contrary to past information by the Administration on which Congress has relied in considering changes in federal law [GAO's February 2000 report to Congressional Committees: ``Northern Mariana Islands: Garment and Tourist Industries Play a Dominant Role in the Commonwealth's Economy'' (GAO/RCED/GGD-00-79)].  This GAO report sheds new light on the economy of the Northern Marianas and the flaws of prior reports by the Administration. The findings reinforce the need for the federal government to affirmatively support, and not hinder or undermine, efforts of the public and private sectors of the Northern Marianas to improve and maintain economic self-sufficiency, and at the same time, enforce federal labor, safety, and equal employment opportunity laws.  Since I became Chairman of the Committee on Resources in January 1995, we have conducted extensive oversight investigations and hearings on worker conditions, the violation and enforcement of federal laws, and the Administration's agenda for the islands. I will continue to press for maximum public awareness of the real conditions in the Marianas public and private sectors and efforts of the federal and local governments.  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has been constituted under federal law as a local constitutional government for the primary benefit of the people of the Marianas as well as the United States as an example of democratic self-governance. There is, therefore, a careful balance that must be maintained between the respect of the wishes of the local government and enforcement of the civil and human rights that Americans hold as sacrosanct. Those decisions should be based on sound information, not subjectivepolitical agendas of the government or some private entity. For that reason, one of the most difficult aspects of Congressional oversight over these very important and often sensitive civil and human rights-related matters, has been the lack of credible information by the very executive branch agencies tasked with the responsibility for enforcement of federal laws. Throughout those oversight efforts, the Administration has given the Committee voluminous testimony and information about the Marianas. Fortunately, the GAO has now completed this independent report as mandated by the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill.  The two main industries in the Northern Marianas are the tourist and garment industries. The Department of Interior has questioned the benefits of the Islands' garment industry. Interior has issued several studies concluding that the local garment industry--and foreign labor--has an adverse fiscal impact on the Northern Marianas, findings hotly contested by the Northern Marianas' government and business sectors. Both sides have testified before my Committee to present their points of view, but for the first time an independent and unbiased government agency has looked into the Northern Marianas economy. The GAO looked specifically at the economic impact of the two dominant industries--garment and tourist; tax contributions by the local garment industry; and local government revenues as compared to other territories.  GAO found ``the garment and tourist industries are the driving forces of the CNMI economy.'' The two sectors account for a about 85 percent of the Commonwealth's total economic activity and represent--directly and indirectly--four out of every five jobs in the Northern Marianas. Critically important to the debate is the GAO's finding that ``the local resident population * * * has benefited, economically, in the form of higher incomes and better employment opportunities, from the growth in the garment and tourist industries, and from the presence of foreign workers.'' GAO concluded that without the garment and tourist industries ``the CNMI economy could not have grown to its current size and complexity.''  Significant number of foreign workers are brought into the Northern Marianas to supplement the existing workforce. The Department of Interior and several Members have criticized the use of these foreign workers, stating that the foreign workers have taken employment opportunities from local residents. Yet GAO concluded that there was no support for Interior's claim. GAO determined that the ``garment and tourist industries are dependent on foreign workers for much of their workforce because the labor pool of local residents, even including those currently unemployed, is insufficient to support an economy the size and scope that exists in the CNMI.'' Changes in the Northern Marianas ability to use foreign labor to supplement its current labor pool or legislation that would adversely impact either of these industries could have severe impacts on the Northern Marianas' economy, ``causing job losses among local residents and revenue losses to the CNMI government,'' the report stated. Several legislative proposals exist that would do just that, and I am opposed to them.  The GAO also criticizes a 1999 Interior Department study that found that the garment industry had a net negative impact. ``[T]he Interior study is methodologically flawed because it understates the contributions made by the garment and tourist industries to the CNMI economy and overstates the impact of these industries and their workers on the need for government services and infrastructure.'' The GAO determined, however, that the Northern Marianas is more self-sufficient fiscally than other territories. It also found that the Northern Marianas generates more of its government revenues locally--about 87 percent--than all other U.S. territories and all levels of government in the U.S., a remarkable fact.  Finally, the study showed that the garment industry contributes significantly to the local economy, directly contributing about $52 million, or 22 percent, of the government's $234 million budget in 1998. It determined that the Northern Marianas garment industry proportionally pays more in taxes and fees that the U.S. garment industry. That is, the garment industry in the Northern Marianas taxes and fees represented about 5 percent of their gross receipts between 1993 and 1998, whereas the U.S. garment industry overall paid only 3.3 percent of their gross receipts in taxes and fees.  During a hearing last September, my Committee heard reasoned warnings from business and government leaders about the potential impact of certain legislative initiatives to eliminate local control of immigration, to remove duty-free access, or to increase the minimum wage on the ``vulnerable'' economy of he Northern Marianas. GAO's study underscores those warnings and this body should consider carefully the potential adverse impact of any legislation on the frail economy of the Northern Marianas--or the economies of any of our territories.  I will continue to insist on full compliance with federal laws, advocate heightened federal-territorial mutual cooperation in multiple areas, and support local and private sector initiatives to manage the economy and advance self-sufficiency. I strongly encourage my colleagues to review the GAO report, ``Northern Mariana Islands: Garment and Tourist Industries Play a Dominant Role in the Commonwealth's Economy'' (GAO/RCED/GGD-00-79) which is available to the public through the Government Printing Office and also the world wide web: http://www.gao.gov/new.items/r200079.pdf.                          ____________________
