Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 901, ``The American Land Sovereignty Protection Act,'' to reestablish Congress as the ultimate decision-maker in managing public lands and maintain sovereign controls of lands in the United States. The bill insists that no land be designated for inclusion in international land use programs, such as World Heritage Sites, without the clear and direct approval of Congress and requires that local citizens and public officials participate in decisions on designating land near their homes for inclusion in these international land programs.  World Heritage Sites are natural areas of cultural monuments recognized by the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), under ``The Convention Concerning Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.'' Proponents of World Heritage Sites keep saying that they are designated at the request of local communities. They seem to believe that if they keep repeating this mantra often enough, then somehow it will prove true. The Committee on Resources has now held three hearings on this issue and has yet to find one example where a World Heritage Site designation was requested by a broad-based cross-section of either the public or local officials. On the contrary, the Committee has found that World Heritage Site designation efforts are almost always driven by federal agencies, usually the Department of Interior, and often face strong local opposition.  The Department of Interior, in cooperation with the Federal Interagency Panel for World Heritage has identified a shopping list of 94 sites in 31 States and the District of Columbia that they would like to make World Heritage Sites. So far, twenty-two of the sites on this list have been designated World Heritage Sites. I would like to include this list and the detailed descriptions of the natural properties on this list.

Yosemite National Park, California (37 deg.50' N.; 119      deg.30' W.). Granite peaks and domes rise high above broad      meadows in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, along with groves      of sequoias and related tree species. Mountains, lakes, and      waterfalls, including the nation's highest, are found here.      Criteria: (ii) An outstanding example of significant      geological processes and biological evolution, and (iii)      contains superlative natural phenomena, formations, and areas      of exceptional natural beauty.                             Sonoran Desert       Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona (32 deg.0' N.;      112 deg.50' W.). This park contains block-faulted mountains      separated by wide alluvial valleys, along with playas, lava      fields, and sands. It includes representative examples of the      Sonoran Desert found in this region and nowhere else in the      United States. This area has been designated a Biosphere      Reserve. Criteria: (ii) An outstanding example of biological      evolution, and (iii) contains superlative natural phenomena.       Saguaro National Monument, Arizona (32 deg.10' N.; 110      deg.40' W.). Giant saguaro cactus, unique to the Sonoran      Desert of southern Arizona and northwestern Mexico, reach up      to 50 feet in height in the cactus forest in this park.      Criteria: (ii) An outstanding example of biological      evolution, and (iii) contains superlative natural phenomena.                            Hawaiian Islands       Haleakala National Park, Hawaii (20 deg.40' N.; 156 deg.10'      W.). With an elevational range from sea level to 3000 m, the      park has a great variety of habitats. Alpine deserts,      subalpine shrubland, dry forests, subalpine grassland, bogs,      rainforests, and coastal vegetation all occur within a linear      distance of 25 km. Of international botanical significance,      over 95 percent of the species, and 20 percent of the genera      of flowering plants are found nowhere else on earth.      Criteria: (i) An outstanding example representing major      stages of the earth's evolutionary history, (ii) outstanding      example representing ongoing biological evolution, and (iii)      contains superlative natural beauty.                               ____________________
