President, while the Senator is still on the floor, I wish he had heard my statement. I can assure him that neither the chairman of the Judiciary Committee nor the majority leader intends to emulate what the Republicans did, with a pocket filibuster of more than 60 of President Clinton's nominees. I know of nobody on this side of the aisle who expects the Democrats to do a pocket filibuster of 60 of President Bush's nominees, as the Republicans did of President Clinton's.  It is interesting, when I hear this talk about historical averages, they weren't only--when you bring up the number of times there was a Democratic majority with a Republican President, a Republican President was treated far better than the Republicans treated a Democratic President. At no time were the Democrats ever pocket-filibustering 60 of the President's nominees.
