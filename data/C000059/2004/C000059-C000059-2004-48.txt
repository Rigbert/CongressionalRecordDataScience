We have been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Vic Jensen is one of these individuals.  Vic Jensen will retire after 34 years of service as office manager of the Department of Motor Vehicles' Winnetka, Hemet, Corona, and Norco field offices on June 26, 2004.  Vic Jensen was born in Sacramento, California, on January 27, 1937. He and his wife, Isabel, have been married for 40 years and have one daughter, Julie Kim. Vic served in the United States Navy for 4 years, before moving to Norco in 1981 and quickly becoming involved in a variety of community activities, including: Board Member and President of the Norco Chamber of Commerce for 9 years; Commissioner of the Norco Streets and Trails Commission for 7 years; Numerous positions--President, Secretary, Zone Chairman, and Regional Chairman--over 14 years with the Norco Lions Club; Chairman of the Sight and Hearing Board for the Norco/Corona Unified School District; and Member of the Citizen's Advisory Committee for the California Rehabilitation Center.  Recognition of Vic's contributions include the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, Assemblyman Ted Weggeland, State Senator Raymond Haynes, and former California Governor Pete Wilson, for his work as President of the Norco Chamber of Commerce in 1996.

Vic also spends countless hours in perfecting his passion for golf, golf, and more golf. Whenever a chance arrives he is fine-tuning his game.  Mr. Speaker, Vic's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Norco, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American, and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires from professional service, but not from community service.                          ____________________
