But now we also have to make sure that typical homeowners who are not development interests get a fair shake as well.  I am just struck by the fact that my colleagues are willing to say that the typical homeowner, 65 million of them, are supposed to be satisfied to go off and see what happens at the local level and people who want to develop their property get this Federal Express lane and rapid consideration of their claims. That is not my vision of balance.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I am just trying to get to what was a real-life example. It was a county commissioner, we did use the Clean Water Act to get an enforcement action against this individual, and he obviously felt very aggrieved. He gave lots of money to my opponent.  But the fact is that as I understood the gentleman, my downstream property owners now would have a civil right of action and this gentleman would get compensated by the taxpayers for not doing the egregious development that was going to harm the downstream people.
