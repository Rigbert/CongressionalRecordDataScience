President, would the Senator yield for a question?  Some have expressed concerns that changes proposed by this bill could cause Nunn-McCurdy breaches even when a program is performing well and when the Department has provided well-defined requirements. In particular these experts have pointed to the potential for unit cost breaches that could be caused by policy decisions to reduce the number of units that would be purchased by the program. These policy decisions could originate in the executive branch or Congress and could be made regardless of past program performance. Do you believe this legislation will have that effect, and, if so, was that your intention?  Mr. Levin. I thank the Senator for her inquiry. This legislation would not change the existing Nunn-McCurdy thresholds for unit cost breaches. I do not believe that programs that are performing well have breached Nunn-McCurdy thresholds in the past as a result of changes in the quantity of units procured under a program, and I do not consider it likely in the future. In the case of a program that is not performing well, a change in unit quantities may be sufficient to push a program over the thresholds. This is a factor that the Department may consider in deciding whether and how to continue with the program. For programs performing well, however, the likelihood of a breach is extremely small. Nonetheless, it is certainly not our intention to penalize programs performing well, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Senator as this bill proceeds through Congress to address these concerns.
