Speaker, on May 9, I came to the Floor and spoke about the March For Our Lives on March 24 and the nine extraordinarily poised students in Morristown, New Jersey, who spoke at the rally there, which I attended. I included in the Record remarks by Nile Burch. I hope my colleagues will read them and internalize the sense of fear in which our nation's students are living every day--and our responsibility as Members of Congress to do something to address this crisis of gun violence.                      March for Our Lives' Remarks                            (By Nile Burch)       Hello and good morning! My name is Nile Birch and I am from      Morristown High School.       I would like to begin by thanking Ms. Bosrock for this      incredible opportunity. I appreciate all of her support and      help in making this possible. I am so proud to be      representing my African-American and social activism club,      Melanin Minds, at the march today. Melanin Minds consists of      a group of united and ethnically diverse individuals      dedicated towards raising awareness within our communities.      Encouraging change is exactly what our club is about, and I      am honored to speak to everyone today about the issue of gun      violence on behalf of our president, Bella Simon. So why      should I take such a vested interest in this issue?       I can understand how it is a Constitutional right for      people to own guns. But, as we've all come to realize, there      is a lot of gray area in that. Nevertheless, that area should      never include questioning public safety. If people choose to      own guns, that is their prerogative, but in no way shape or      form should their interest threaten the lives of anyone or      anything else. Yet, the trouble I think we all experience is      that the current laws we haveare nowhere strict enough to      make people feel at ease. Then again, there is a fine line      between feeling `at ease' and feeling `safe.' We do not need      politicians to acknowledge what happened in past and recent      school shootings. We need them to look at Columbine, Sandy      Hook, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, and countless others as an      incentive to want to prevent more shootings from ever      happening again. In simpler terms, we need to emphasize that      it's okay to recognize what happened in the past as long as      we use those events to carve out a pathway towards our      future! To truly understand what it feels like to be safe, we      must first realize what it is like to live in fear. As an      African-American male, living in fear means wearing a hoodie      and being scared to walk to the store for some skittles or an      Arizona Iced Tea, or wanting to sell CDs. What I am saying is      that having this angst festering inside of me every day is my      reality, but it does not have to be yours too.       School shootings? Children in school. A place where      students go to learn, make friends, and find themselves as      human beings. A place parents can drop their kids and feel      safe in knowing that their precious children are protected at      all costs. It isn't true. It doesn't exist. And that, my      friends, is the sad reality of today. Why we are here. Why we      care. We must stand together so that every single one of us      can feel safe. You guys might be wondering `what does he mean      by starting to make a difference, how can I, a high school      student, have any influence?' Let me tell you guys a brief      story to make it clearer.       I remember being on the playground and looking up at those      tall monkey bars towering above the field. They seemed so big      and tall, like something incredible. Of course, to any seven-     year-old, climbing it seems a feat worth trying. But, no      matter how hard I tried it was still physically impossible      for my short arms to reach the highest bar. I tell this story      because on this day, March 24, 2018, our end goal may seem      impossible to reach. It may seem so idealistic that we doubt      seeing such immense change within the course of our lifetime.      However, I am confident that meeting our goal can become a      reality by taking the right steps to get there. I didn't      finish my childhood story. As I started to climb the bars, I      had multiple encounters with failure and defeat by slipping      off of the handlebars. Enacting change to the issue of gun      violence is no different. We have and will continue to      encounter obstacles that will try to prevent us from      succeeding. In order to overcome these difficulties, it is      imperative that we lobby Congress to change the gun laws to      ensure that only those who are able to handle the      responsibility of owning a gun can do so. It is also      paramount that organizations such as the NRA accept the      consequences of prioritizing profit over life. I remain      optimistic that we'll be able to do this because, despite      having fallen multiple times on the wood chips, I persevered      and, yes, eventually reached the top. The feeling at the top      of those monkey bars was one I'll never forget. For a brief      moment in time I felt like the king of the world with nothing      to stop me. I made my way down, and yes, fell again, but this      time it was worth it. I have no doubt that this movement will      feel the same way when we make strides. The obstacles will      never truly go away, but we will enact laws, start protests      and incite conversations that will make these obstacles      irrelevant.       Piece by piece we will inspire other students to gain the      courage to stand up for what they believe in. Piece by piece      we will show youth that they have a voice and that it does      matter. And piece by piece we will once again feel safe      enough to walk our school hallways without feeling as if that      is the last day we'll walk at all.       Contact our congressmen! These men are in the government      speaking for and representing you. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen,      Rep. Leonard Lance, Sen. Cory Booker, and Sen. Robert      Menendez all need to hear from you about how we feel about      gun violence. If we want to save lives, it begins with      speaking with our powerful elected officials. You've already      climbed your first bar just by being here today. Hopefully      you've been listening, and hopefully you take the next step      to putting an end to gun violence! I am so impressed with the      numbers here today and I want you guys to keep fighting, and      keep climbing, because eventually, we willreach the top,      together! Thank you and have a good day!                          ____________________
