President, once again, Illinois communities are assessing damage from severe storms. A confirmed tornado along with heavy winds, hail, and lightning moved through the Chicago area on Sunday leaving a path of damage in several communities.  The city of Wood Dale was hit Sunday afternoon during the last day of its Prairie Fest, an annual 4-day festival with rides, food, and music. Due to the storm, rides were stopped and organizers tried to evacuate. But the storm approached too quickly, and its winds knocked down the festival's main tent where many people had gathered to take shelter.  Twenty people were hurt and, tragically, Steven Nincic was killed. He was at the festival with his wife and two young daughters. Our thoughts and prayers are with Steven Nincic's family, as they are with those who were injured by the storm. I spoke this morning with Wood Dale's Mayor Nunzio Pulice, and I know he is leading the community through this loss.  Severe weather continued throughout the day in the Chicago area. Chicago's Lollapalooza music festival evacuated its festival grounds at Grant Park before its scheduled closing. Mayor Emanuel and I also spoke this morning. He is working to assess the damage and help residents clean up and recover from the damage.  My office is also in touch with Mayor Rhett Taylor of the Village of Grayslake, Mayor Kristina Kovarik with Village of Gurnee, and Illinois Representative Sam Yingling. These communities are hurting in the aftermath of Sunday's terrible storms that brought winds at 60 miles an hour and golf ball-sized hail.  A tornado touched down in Grayslake, ripping the roof off the high school and damaging several other buildings and homes. These storms also toppled power lines and trees, making several roads in the area impassable. Crews are working to clean up debris and restore electricity. Over 16,000 people were left without power this morning. Thankfully, no injuries were reported as a result of the Grayslake storms.  Along with other members of the Illinois congressional delegation, I stand ready to help in any way I can as the people in Dale Wood and Grayslake begin the clean-up and recovery from this weekend's deadly storms.  The State of Illinois has sustained extensive damage and managed cleanup costs following a number of severe storms already this year. I stand ready to support any request for Federal disaster aid, including the Governor's request today for FEMA's assistance with damage assessments in downstate communities still recovering from earlier storms.                          ____________________
