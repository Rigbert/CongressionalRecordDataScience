Chairman, I rise to support the gentleman's amendment and to say that he has worked so hard in the interest of maintaining both public health and restoration of the environment related to the Salton Sea. Unless you have actually seen the Salton Sea and the changing nature of the ecosytem in southern California, you can't imagine how enormous that challenge is. From the very first day he was elected, Mr. Ruiz was talking to us about the needs of that particular part of our country.  I know that polluted agricultural runoff had something to do with what has happened to the Salton Sea. The changing nature of rainfall has transformed it.  I think about the Sea of Azov in Russia and how dangerous that has become to the surrounding environment. We face the same challenge here in our country.  I know it is difficult to resolve this issue, and it will take many years, because it didn't just take one year forthe sea to become a wasteland, really, and the surrounding communities so affected.  I just want to thank the gentleman for his leadership and for keeping us and your part of America on the right course. You are very talented and very caring. I just wanted to stand in support of your efforts.  I yield back the balance of my time.
