President, first I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his very kind comments. I also want to bring to my colleagues' attention the fact that the senior Senator from West Virginia, too, is celebrating a birthday very soon; I believe tomorrow is the day. On behalf of the entire Senate family, I wish him a very happy birthday and many more. He sets a standard of public service to which we all aspire. I am delighted to give him the greetings of the Senate this evening in the hope that he will enjoy a very happy birthday with his family.
