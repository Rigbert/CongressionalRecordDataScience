President, my concern here is that those individuals who are concerned--genuinely concerned--about the problems that exist over there are concerned about damage that is inflicted by these landmines, and certainly I am one of these individuals, are also concerned about the saving of American lives. We certainly should not contemplate doing so unless the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the unified combatant commanders formally change their minds and agree such a step can be taken without jeopardizing the U.S. forces.  I also have written a letter to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton. This is just in the last few days. I have a letter back from General Shelton in which he talks about his opinion. In his response he said:       In your third question, you noted General Norman      Schwarzkopf, who has been widely portrayed as a supporter of      a complete ban on antipersonnel landmines, has been quoted in      an interview with the Baltimore Sun as saying, ``I favor a      ban on the dumb ones. Those are the ones that are causing      humanitarian problems. I think the smart ones are a military      capability we can use.''  Further quoting General Shelton, he said:       My view again is that our smart mixed ATAV munitions are      critical to our efforts to protect our men and women in the      field.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter also be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  U.S. Special Operations Command,                             Office of the Commander in Chief,                              Macdill AFB, FL, September 13, 1997.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: Thank you for your letter of 12      September in which you state your concern about the      compatibility of the emerging Oslo treaty on anti-personnel      landmines (APL) with the military's requirements today and      for the foreseeable future. I appreciate the opportunity to      express my views on these issues as Commander in Chief, U.S.      Special Operations Command.       Your first question asked for my view on the importance of      retaining the Korean exemption, limiting the systems covered      by the treaty to those ``primarily designed'' for anti-     personnel purposes, and ensuring what we are able to continue      using self-destructing/self-deactivating APL when packaged      with anti-tank landmines.       In my view, each of those positions is critical. Anti-     personnel landmines are integral to the defense of the      Republic of Korea, and as long as there is risk of aggression      in Korea and we do not have suitable alternatives fielded, we      must ensure the best protection of our forces and those of      our allies. I also believe that an accurate definition of      anti-personnel (AP) landmines is essential to prevent the      banning of mixed munitions under the treaty. Finally, I      firmly believe that our anti-tank (AT) and anti-vehicle (AV)      munitions--which are mixed systems composed entirely of smart      AT and AP mines that self-destruct or self-deactivate in a      relatively short period of time--are vital to the protection      of our men and women in the field.       Your second question asked whether I thought a landmine ban      that did not accommodate these positions would be in the      national security interest of the United States. I do not. I      believe that any treaty to which the United States agrees      must ensure that these valid national security concerns are      adequately addressed.       In your third question, you noted that General Norman      Schwarzkopf--who has been widely portrayed as a supporter of      a complete ban on anti-personnel landmines--has been quoted      in an interview with the Baltimore Sun as saying: ``I favor a      ban on the dumb ones; those are the ones that are causing the      humanitarian problem. I think the smart ones are a military      capability we can use.'' You asked whether I agree with this      assessment.       My view, again is that our smart, mixed AT/AV munitions are      critical to our efforts to protect our men and women in the      field. As I noted earlier, these systems are composed      entirely of smart mines that self-destruct or self-deactivate      in a relatively short period of time. The military utility of      these systems is, in my mind, unquestionable. Beyond that,      however, I do want to reiterate that, because of the unique      situation on the Korean peninsula, non-self-destructing (NSD)      or ``dumb'' mines are essential to our commanders in the      Republic of Korea as long as there is risk of aggression and      we have not fielded suitable alternatives to the NSD mines      used in Korea.       In your final question, you asked whether I will work to      ensure that this capability is protected in any landmine      treaty the U.S. signs. In response, let me state again that I      firmly believe that any landmine treaty to which the United      States becomes party must ensure protection of ``smart''      mixed systems.       As always, I appreciate your support of our men and women      in uniform. With all best wishes from Tampa,           Sincerely,                                             Henry H. Shelton,                                               General, U.S. Army,                                               Commander in Chief.
