 To date, Mr. Speaker, business across this country have been harmed to the tune of nearly $187 million, because the majority did not pass this bill last year, as they should have. After having ignored fiscal discipline for the last 43 months, the majority has miraculously rediscovered the principle of revenue neutrality, but are using gimmicks, phase-outs, and controversial revenue-raisers that punish working families, small business taxpayers, and charitable organizations to do so.  True, hidden among the largesse are a few deserving provisions. I would like to support those. But I cannot support this bill, which continues the path of extraordinary fiscal irresponsibility, which took us from a $5.6 trillion surplus told that we had by George Bush back in March of 2001, to the time now when we have a $3 trillion deficit confronting the children and grandchildren of this country. How sad the performance. How ill-timed and ill-conceived this legislation.
