Speaker, I rise today to recognize a milestone in the life of Wesley United Methodist Church in Toledo, Ohio. I was privileged to participate in the congregation's celebration this weekend.  In 1891, the Reverend Homer Hood found a church building on the corner of Spring Street in Toledo. He established a Sunday school class there, and the church community grew. A decade later, women of the WTCU began selling ten cent doughnuts to raise funds to build a church of their own.  In 1924, the cornerstone of Wesley United Methodist Church was laid at 2934 Stickney Avenue in the heart of Toledo's North End, the oldest part of the city. The church was raised and Wesley United Methodist Church has been firmly planted at this location ever since. Even in the dark days of America's Great Depression, the congregation grew. Notably, John G. Kingsley made the mortgage payments, at the cost of his own business. Fortunately, he was able to restart his business later. Throughout the 1940s the church continued to grow. As World War II carried on in that decade, many members were part of the war effort, with some giving the ultimate sacrifice in battle. The 1950s and 1960s saw continuing growth, mission work, choirs and a junior church with two active youth groups.  The 1970s and 1980s brought change, but the church remained an anchor in the neighborhood and provided outreach. The church welcomed its first female minister to the pulpit, with Dr. Margaret Mallory's installation in her first congregation. The 1990s brought further change and a partnership with Broadway United Methodist Church that lasted briefly. The congregation also celebrated a glorious 100th anniversary in 1991.  The dawn of the congregation's life in a third century brought Pastor Waverly Earley, whose service continues to this day. The congregation is committed to being ``the hands and feet of Jesus'' in our community. Parishioners describe themselves as a ``caring family, closely knitted together and striving to serve God in all ways that are possible.'' Living Jesus Christ's message described in Matthew 25:40 that ``Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me,'' the church is committed to active ministry and is involved in the North Toledo Citizens Circle for ex-offenders, host of Camp Toledo, and Toledo Area Ministries' Feed Your Neighbor's largest site. The church's Mary/Martha Circle continues its behind-the-scenes mission efforts to help support the congregation. The church offers a participatory youth group and youth choir and recently added a Men's Group and a men's chorus. Family is the focus with family movie nights, ice cream socials, harvest dinners, outdoor services, Vacation Bible School and milestone celebrations of faith.  Wesley United Methodist Church congregants declare that they are ``serving God and mankind with our SWEAT.'' That is, ``Service, Worship, Evangelism, Alliances, and Teachings.'' For more than a century, its members have brought that zeal to its neighborhood in North Toledo, serving as a beacon of hope and light. As the congregation celebrated 125 years of rich history, it looks forward with faith continuing its journey with Jesus.                          ____________________
