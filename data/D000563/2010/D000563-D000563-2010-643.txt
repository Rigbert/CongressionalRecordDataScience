It is $200 million for Senator Kyl--let's say $450 million between Senators McCain and Kyl, money to be sent into this Arizona situation.  I wonder if we shouldn't declare a time out in Arizona for at least some thoughtful reflection about what works and what doesn't. It seems there is no end to ideas that are being propounded down there to respond to situations real and imagined. These amendments are clear evidence.  I don't know if the Senator from New Jersey sees it the same way.
