Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our veterans who have served their country with honor and valor. This November 11, as we celebrate Veterans Day, we must recognize the commitment made by these men and women and reaffirm our Nation's commitment to honor their great sacrifices.  Whether on the beaches of Normandy, the jungle of Vietnam, the desert of Iraq, or in Korea, American men and women were there, protecting America and her allies from foreign aggressors. We, as a nation, owe a debt of gratitude to our veterans, whose accomplishments shaped America and the world.  Several events have made 1995 quite a testimony to the successes of our veterans. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, which rose above the disaster of World War II to provide assistance, hope, and peace to millions of people around the world. A new prospect for peace has arisen in the Middle East due to the historic signing of a peace accord between the P.L.O. and Israel. A Korean War Memorial was dedicated this year in our Nation's Capital finally giving due recognition to the veterans of a war that was largely forgotten. And finally, and most importantly, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Fifty years ago, our troops courageously halted the Nazi and Japanese advance. Today, as a testimony to their efforts, these two nations are among our closest allies.  It is imperative that we remember the patriotism of these great men and women. If our forces had not succeeded, the course of history would have been altered. The peace and prosperity that we have come to expect in America is directly attributable to the sacrifices made by the millions of American soldiers who risked their lives for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Let us continue to recognize their commitment to us, and let us reaffirm our commitment to our veterans on this Veterans Day, 1995.                          ____________________
