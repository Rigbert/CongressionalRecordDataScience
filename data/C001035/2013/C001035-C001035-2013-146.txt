Since it was first passed in 1994, the programs authorized under this law have provided State and local partners with more than $4.7 billion of assistance. This assistance helps to ensure that the victims of violence get the help they need to recover and has prevented incalculable suffering by stopping violent crimes before they happen.  It is extremely important to pass this legislation because all men and women--and men are victims as well as women. In some ways, the name of this law should be changed. But all women and men, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or disability deserve to be safe and protected from physical violence, and that is what this reauthorization would help to do.  Finally, this is not and never should be a partisan issue. Violence and domestic assaults do not discriminate between Republicans and Democrats, Independents and Greens, or people who are not politically active at all.  This is an equal opportunity crime that harms people regardless of their political affiliation, their profession, their location, or their status in life. It is an issue that deserves bipartisan support. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will come together and pass this important bill.  I recognize there may be some provisions of this bill which are controversial; but, surely, we can come together in support of the goal of this vital legislation. We can work out differences if not on the Senate floor then in conference with the House; but, surely, we can come together and reauthorize this law that has made such a difference to so many in our country.                               Exhibit 1                                           Maine Coalition Against                                               Sexual Assault,                                    Augusta, ME, February 4, 2013.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins:  On behalf of the Maine Coalition      Against Sexual Assault (MECASA), and the sexual assault      crisis and support centers we represent, I am writing to      express our strong support for S. 47, the Violence Against      Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) of 2013. By reauthorizing      and making significant improvements to these important      programs, this legislation will help fulfill the critical      unmet needs of victims of violence and expand protections to      currently under-protected populations.       VAWA has provided invaluable support for law enforcement,      courts, sexual assault crisis and support centers, domestic      violence service providers, prevention efforts, and community      outreach. In the past decade, nearly half of Maine's      homicides have been the result of domestic violence, many of      which included elements of sexual violence. Additionally,      nearly 13,000 Mainers will experience sexual violence this      year alone while Maine's ten-year average for rapes reported      to law enforcement is only 364. The cost of these crimes to      Maine is enormous. VAWA helps control these costs by enabling      support centers to provide free, necessary, quality services      to victims who need help, not to mention the incalculable      suffering that these programs help prevent.       Since the original passage of VAWA, Maine has strengthened      laws regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, and      stalking and has implemented programs which continue to yield      tangible results for victims and for public safety. Despite      VAWA's success, its criminal justice and community-based      programs remain acutely necessary. According to a recent      study by the University of Southern Maine's Muskie School of      Public Service, nearly one in five Mainers reported having      been the victim of sexual assault or an attempted sexual      assault in his or her lifetime. Nationally, the Center for      Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly one in      five women and one in 71 men have been raped at some time in      their lives, and one in four women and one in seven men      experience severe physical violence by an intimate partner.       MECASA supports efforts to further strengthen and improve      the response of the criminal justice, legal, and victim      support systems for survivors of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault, and stalking. We are grateful to      you for your steadfast support of VAWA and your commitment to      violence prevention and response.       Thank you for all you do on behalf of Maine and our nation.           Sincerely,                                              Elizabeth Ward Saxl,                                               Executive Director.
