 President, I am pleased to join with Senators Lautenberg, Snowe, Schumer, Coleman and many others to introduce legislation to reimburse States for prescription drug expenses they have incurred for their residents who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. States have had no other option but to step in and ensure seniors can still get their drugs because the implementation of the new Medicare drug benefit has been so poorly handled by the Bush administration.  The faulty implementation of the new drug benefit has caused a major health emergency in California and States across the country, particularly for seniors with chronic and debilitating diseases who rely on multiple medications every day to keep them alive.  It is incomprehensible to me that with all the money and time given to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, to implement this new drug benefit, stories emerge every day of seniors and disabled individuals being hospitalized because they are being told they have to pay hundreds of dollars for their medications which they cannot afford and thus don't take.  Because of severe glitches in the database run by CMS, these individuals are leaving pharmacies without their medications or are making undue sacrifices to pay for costs they should not have incurred in the first place.  So far, more than 24 States and the District of Columbia have stepped in to say they will cover the cost of prescription drugs for their residents who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and who cannot access lifesaving and life sustaining drugs as a result of Federal incompetence.  Earlier this week, the Governor of California and California's State legislative leaders announced a plan to make $150 million available for 30 days to cover drug costs for dual eligible individuals who have fallen through the system. In California, these individuals account for more than 1 million of the State's 4 million total Medicare recipients.  Problems with the Bush administration's implementation of the drug benefit have cost California $5.5 million to fill 63,000 prescriptions, as of January 18. I have no doubt these costs are just the beginning.  Unless these significant implementation errors are fixed immediately, the new drug benefit amounts to a massive unfunded mandate. The Bush administration must reimburse States, in full, for the drug costs they have absorbed as a result of major implementation errors that occurred on their watch.  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Lautenberg, Snowe, Schumer and Coleman will ensure that States are repaid in full by the Federal Government for all costs associated with prescription drugs for dual eligible individuals. The States did not create the crisis felt by our Nation's poorest and most vulnerable seniors and disabled and the States should not be responsible for costs associated with a Federal program that was intended to provide these individuals with comprehensive prescription drug coverage at little or no cost.  It is simply unacceptable for the Bush administration to tell States and the Congress not to worry because the private health insurance plans will reimburse States for the costs they've incurred. States should not be made to wait to be reimbursed because of implementation foul-ups caused by CMS.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
