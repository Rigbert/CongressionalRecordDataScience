Speaker, I rise today to once again focus my colleagues' attention on the continuing crisis in Bosnia.  Last week this House voted overwhelmingly to unilaterally lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and allow the Bosnian people to pursue their fundamental right to defend themselves.  A front page article in Sunday's New York Times crystallizes for us--indeed, if at this time we need any further clarification--the compelling reasons for lifting the embargo. The article can only lead one to conclude that the embargo is wrong and that it will never contribute to the cessation of hostilities, only the continued perpetration of aggression and genocide.  The article quotes statements, from both American and European officials with access to intelligence reports, which confirm that the Federal Yugoslav Army is not only paying the salaries of many Bosnian-Serb officers, but is also supplying their forces with fuel, spare parts, training, and ammunition.  There are credible reports that the cross-border traffic is increasing as the combat resumes in Bosnia after a winter ceasefire.  Moreover, several American analysts, according to the New York Times article, have stated that the Yugoslav Army provided the parts and technicians for maintaining the Bosnian-Serb air defenses that shot down an F-16 jet fighter on a NATO monitoring mission. Even if this were not so, the fact remains that the Bosnian-Serb air defense system continues to be electronically linked to the Yugoslav Army's computers and radar.  American officials say they have evidence of regular conversations and consultations between the Yugoslav Army's general staff in Belgrade and the officers directing operations in Bosnia and that Bosnian-Serbs wounded in battle are flown by helicopter to Yugoslav military hospitals. This would certainly make sense in view of the fact that General Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian-Serb forces, was a career officer in the Yugoslav Army and was selected to led the Bosnian Serbs by Mr. Milosevic shortly before the conflict began. In addition the recently appointed commander of Serbian forces in Croatia, Lt. Gen. Mile Mrksic until a few weeks ago was serving on the general staff of the Yugoslav Army in Belgrade.  Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleagues that last year Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic pledged to close the border between Bosnia and Serbia in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia. Despite reports to the contrary, he continues to insist that only nonlethal aid is being provided by Serbia to the Bosnian-Serb militants.  Meanwhile, the West, headed by the contact group, and most recently by United States negotiator Robert Frasure, continues to negotiate with Mr. Milosevic toward the complete lifting of sanctions against the former Yugoslavia in exchange for Milosevic's recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Milosevic continues to rebuff these overtures unless he can guarantee that once lifted, the sanctions cannot be reimposed under any circumstances.  I ask my colleagues, should the West lift economic sanctions against a government that is sustaining the Bosnian-Serbs war effort, even as it pledges to do the opposite?  Mr. Speaker, I contend that it is preposterous that the international community has even reached such a juncture. Last year the contact group--the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Russia--offered its final, take-it-or-leave-it peace plan with severe consequences for those who refused. The contact group assured Bosnia that if the Serbs plan, international sanctions against Serbia, would be tightened, more efforts would be made to afford greater protection of safe areas by the United Nations, and ultimately, the arms embargo would be lifted. The Government of Bosnia accepted, on time and without condition. The Bosnian Serbs, as we all know, effectively rejected the plan and continued to posture for more concessions which the international community has provided.  The international community's arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia has been a de facto embargo only against Bosnia. The Serbian aggressors, from the beginning, have had all the firepower and material they needed from the Yugoslav Army.  Mr. Speaker, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that the people of Bosnia have, at a minimum, the right to defend themselves. Building on the momentum of last week's vote, I urge swift consideration of H.R. 1172, legislation I have cosponsored with Mr. Smith, which would lift the arms embargo against Bosnia.  The Serbian aggressors are perpetrating genocide while the international community watches, indeed does more than watch. It facilitates the genocide by imposing and enforcing an arms embargo against the victims of the war--denying them their fundamental right recognized under international law--the right of self-defense. Not only do we refuse to assist, but we actively deny to the Bosnians the means by which they can defend themselves. I have no doubt that history will judge our European allies and ourselves critically.                          ____________________
