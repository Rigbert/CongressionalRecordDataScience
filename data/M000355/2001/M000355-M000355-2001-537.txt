 There are more speakers on the other side, which is often the case in this debate. I want to make sure Senator Hagel gets the time he needs. I will take the time I need. Unless someone else in our general orbit here on this subject comes, we will try to accommodate people on the other side. I know Senator Cochran is looking for an opportunity to speak. I hope we can accommodate him out of my time.  Having said that, Madam President, how much does the Senator from Nebraska desire?
