Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, again, the sentiments expressed by the gentleman having to do with a particular experience in his State--perhaps his district--is one thing, but this is really clear in the statutory language. It says that we will hold the public comment period. When it closes, the lease goes forward, no matter what we heard.  What the gentleman is talking about is that there was a public comment period. The public comment period was closed, and he says that some time later, outside of the public comment period, someone submitted information which was used and overcame all of the other testimony and/or comments that were provided.  That is a whole different circumstance than what this is. This is very simple. It just says that there will be a public comment period; we will listen; and at the end of that, we don't care what we heard, it has to go forward as proposed.  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah will be postponed.               Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 113-493.
