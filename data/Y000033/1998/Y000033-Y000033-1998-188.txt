Mr. Speaker, this is a relatively simple bill. It is the proposed Advisory Council on California Indian Policy Extension Act of 1997, to extend the life of the Advisory Council on California Indian Policy, ACCIP, until March 31 of the year 2000.  The ACCIP has issued 8 reports on various topics as well as an overview of California Indian history.  Some of these recommendations by the ACCIP are controversial and will not be implemented by the Congress. Other recommendations are too expensive.  However, some of the recommendations included in the 8 reports issued make good sense and should be given full consideration by the Administration and the Congress.  H.R. 3069 would add additional new duties to those provided for by Congress when the ACCIP was created in 1992. These new duties include: Working with Congress to implement its proposals; consulting with Federal departments to implement its recommendations; and presenting draft legislation to Congress.  H.R. 3069 is very important to the many Indian tribes of California. While I do not agree with each and every recommendation made by ACCIP, I think we should move forward inthe process. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3069.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
