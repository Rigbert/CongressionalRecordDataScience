President, in the coming months, the Supreme Court of the United States will consider Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T--a monumental Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, case that could vastly expand the rights of corporations to shield their activities from public view. Like many Americans who deeply value openness, transparency and accountability in our government, I urge the Court to reject efforts to broaden the personal privacy exemption to FOIA to include corporate information.  A decade after Congress first enacted the Freedom of Information Act, Congress created an exemption to this law for law enforcement records that contain sensitive personal information. The so-called ``personal privacy exemption'' for law enforcement records--FOIA exemption 7(C)--allows the government to withhold information contained in its investigatory files that ``could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.''  By creating this exemption, Congress intended to shield from public disclosure sensitive personal information about individuals who may be mentioned in government files. However, Congress never intended for this exemption to apply to corporations.  The legislative history for the personal privacy exemption makes clear that Congress intended for this exemption to protect an individual's right to privacy. Indeed, when the Senate debated this exemption in May of 1974, Senator Philip Hart, who drafted the personal privacy exemption, remarked that ``the protection for personal privacy included in [the exemption] . . . is part of the sixth exemption [to FOIA] in the present law. By adding the protective language here, we simply make clear that the protections in the sixth exemption for personal privacy also apply to disclosure under the seventh exemption. I wish to also make it clear, in case there is any doubt, that this clause is intended to protect the privacy of any person mentioned in the requested files, and not only the person who is the object of the investigation.''  Former Senator Roman Hruska also confirmed that Congress intended for the exemption to address individual privacy rights. Regarding the personal privacy exemption, he said ``we are dealing in this matter with what I believe to be the most important rights, and in some respect the most important rights, an individual may possess, his right to privacy, and his right to personal safety.'' The universal understanding that the personal privacy exemption pertains only to the privacy rights of individuals is further confirmed by the remarks of former Senator Strom Thurmond, who noted during the Senate debate that ``[a]ll of us are aware of the general feeling permeating the country, that our citizens want to know what their Government is doing . . . However, by the same token, we are also concerned about a mutual problem of invasion of an individual's privacy.''  During the more than four decades since the Congress enacted the personal privacy exemption to FOIA, our Federal courts and Federal agencies have consistently interpreted this exemption to apply only to individuals.Over the years, the Congress--with the full knowledge of how the courts have interpreted this exemption--has never amended this exemption, nor called into question the universally held view that the exemption protects the personal privacy rights of individuals.  Given the clear legislative history and the longstanding case precedent in this area, I am deeply troubled by recent efforts to vastly--and I believe improperly--expand the scope of this exemption to reach corporations. While I do not quibble with the notion that certain corporate information should be exempt from public disclosure, I firmly believe that Congress has provided meaningful and adequate protections for sensitive corporate information in other parts of FOIA. Indeed, Congress specifically enacted FOIA exemption 4 to protect trade secrets and other sensitive corporate information from public disclosure. Tellingly, American corporations have successfully relied upon exemption 4 for decades, to safeguard their sensitive business information when it is shared with the government.  I fear that vastly expanding the personal privacy exemption for law enforcement records would close a vital window into how our government works. I also fear that extending this exemption to corporations would permit corporations to shield from public view critical information about public health and safety, environmental dangers, and financial misconduct, among other things--to the great detriment of the people's right to know and to our democracy.  As Senator Hart wisely noted during the debate of the 1974 FOIA amendments, ``survival for a society such as ours hinges very importantly on the access that a citizen can have to the performance of those he has hired.'' I sincerely hope that our Nation's highest Court will carefully consider these words and that the Court will narrowly construe the personal privacy exemption, consistent with congressional intent. Should the Court decide to do otherwise, I will work with others in the Congress to ensure that FOIA, and specifically the personal privacy exemption for law enforcement records, remains a meaningful safeguard for the American people's right to know.                          ____________________
