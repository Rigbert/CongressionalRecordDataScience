 I hope that in the course of this economic recovery or economic stimulus package we can still stick to our principles that what we do will help the economy, help the right people in the economy, and not do any long-term damage to the economy.  I think this proposed Federal payroll tax holiday, month-long holiday, meets the criteria. Frankly, it will go to workers across America who draw a paycheck. They will see it on payday. It will come as quickly as we can pass the bill and enact it into law. That is money that families can use for important purchases at the end of the year. It is money that will go right into the economy and spark some growth and some activity that we really do need. It is also money that is going to go to workers, to those making incomes up to $80,000--$80,400 is the limit on the Federal payroll tax. So that really gives it to working families.  In addition, it is focused to help small businesses because I think forgiving this tax for employers will say to small businesses, we are going to help you meet some of your expenses, whether they are health insurance premiums or security needs, for your business after September 11.  I have spoken to Senator Domenici. I thank my friend and the majority leader for his reference. I hope in the course of this conference, putting together the stimulus and recovery package, that this can be included.
