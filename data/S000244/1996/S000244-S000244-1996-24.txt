Speaker, to know that had H.R. 4 become law, we would not be standing here today, because there would be no waivers required for Wisconsin to implement the W-2 welfare reform bill that the State legislature passed and Governor Thompson signed.  So anybody who voted for H.R. 4 and its conference report should really be supporting this piece of legislation enthusiastically because we already dealt with the issues then that we are dealing with today. Unfortunately, the President of the United States decided to veto H.R. 4 and that is why we are having this debate today. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
