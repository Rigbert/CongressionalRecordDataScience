Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moakley), for his leadership and his vision on this issue. Mr. Chairman, it is very difficult for me to come here tonight and to differ with my friend, my colleague and my brother from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), but I must.  Mr. Chairman, it is time to close the doors of the United States Army School of the Americas at Fort Benning. The school has not served as a bridge between the United States and our Latin American neighbors. It has been a barrier to bringing peace and democracy to the region. Too many of the school's graduates have committed human rights abuses and unspeakable acts of violence against their own people.  For too long, the United States aided and abetted Latin America dictatorships that repressed human rights and even murdered their own citizens. As a Nation, we made a mistake, and we should admit it. We made a mistake. The President of the United States went to Latin America and said, we made a mistake. I apologize. We made a mistake.  Today, we have an opportunity, we have the capacity, we have the ability to right that wrong. We can be sure, and we must close the School of the Americas.  As we enter the new millennium, we deserve better than the School of the Americas. We deserve an institution that promotes our fundamental belief of democracy, peace, and human rights. The School of the Americas diminishes each and every one of these values. It diminishes us all. We should teach people the value of peace and democracy, not of war and dictatorship. Closing the School of the Americas is the right thing to do. It is good for democracy. It is good for the cause of peace.  Mr. Chairman, it is time to close the School of the Americas. It is the right thing to do. Let us do it.                              {time}  2130
