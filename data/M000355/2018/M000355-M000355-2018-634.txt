 Jim Inhofe filled in for Senator McCain during a difficult year. He rose to the occasion and helped lead the committee in passing crucial legislation that honored the example of his predecessor and the volunteers who defend our Nation. He possesses rich experience on the committee, including decades of work on behalf of American servicemembers, as well as his own military service. Congratulations and thanks to Senator Inhofe.                          ____________________
