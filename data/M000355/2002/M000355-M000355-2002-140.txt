 President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from New York. The bill currently provides for benchmark error rates for voting systems used in Federal elections. This bill appropriately provides that, in determining the error rate, only those errors which are attributable to voting machines are included. Errors attributable to an act of the voter, such as an overvote, spoiled vote, or undervote, are not included in the benchmark. This amendment would wrongly require a second benchmark error rate for voter errors. In other words, ballots intentionally or unintentionally spoiled by a voter would be included in the error rate.  As long as there have been elections, there has been voter error. State and local officials will tell you that they see voter error in every single election.  As the Ford-Carter commission acknowledged, some portion of the residual vote number comes from intentional undervotes which can vary considerably from place to place, along with local cultures and tradition. I can say for myself, I frequently have not voted in every single race on the ballot, particularly for races where I felt I didn't know enough about the candidates to cast a vote. It is an intentional act on my part.  A State can't force people to follow directions. A State can't force people to vote as we would like them to or as we think they should. This amendment will do just that.  Let's look at what the review of uncounted Florida ballots in the 2000 election revealed about intentionally spoiled ballots. Nearly 1,000 people voted for all 10 Presidential candidates in 2000. More than 3,600 people voted for every Presidential candidate except Bush, and more than 700 people voted for every Presidential candidate except Gore.  More recently, in Palm Beach, FL made infamous in the 2000 elections county election officials spent $14 million upgrading voting equipment to touch screen computers. In an election held last month, the undervote was 3 percent. No matter what you do, some people are simply not going to participate or are going to participate in a way that we might find somewhat odd.  Primaries held in Chicago last month showed that the undervote varies widely. In Chicago, new ballot machinesgive voters the chance to fix a voting mistake. The machines inform voters if they have undervoted or overvoted, and they are offered the option of correcting that ballot or casting a new one.  The Chicago Tribune reported that even with these new machines, in the Democratic primary for Governor, 6.1 percent of the voters did not vote for the race at the top of the ticket. They just chose not to. The undervote in the Republican attorney general's race was a whopping 12.5 percent. They didn't like these guys. They chose not to vote in that race.  This amendment proposes to set a number of so-called residual votes or voter errors that would be allowed. What would happen when the so-called benchmark is exceeded? The Department of Justice would sue States and localities which have residual rates above those which are permitted by the Federal Government. The practical effect is that States will calculate how many residual votes they are permitted in an election, divide those by precinct, and notify those poll workers how many residual votes they are allowed. In calculating this allowance, officials will have to account for errors on absentee ballots as there is nothing that can be done to change those ballots.  Poll workers will monitor how many residual votes they have. And when they approach their limit under threat of Department of Justice prosecution, they will force voters to vote, or change how they voted in an election. This is exactly the wrong approach.  This bill focuses our efforts on the right approach. It provides a benchmark for measuring the reliability of voting machines. It provides for increasing voter education and encouraging voter responsibility. If a voter has a question, they should ask it. If they are unsure about the voting process, they should seek assistance. We must preserve a system that values and respects the secrecy of the ballot.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Clinton amendment.                           Amendment No. 3109  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is an amendment by Senator Nickles that has been cleared on both sides. I send that amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.
