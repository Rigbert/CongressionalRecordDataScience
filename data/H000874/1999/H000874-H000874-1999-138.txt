Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, let me just add to the response of the Chairman, I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania has raised an issue where there is a void of information on the use of relic guns and commission of crime. I think a study would be very useful. I am pleased that the chairman will work with the gentleman from Pennsylvania and myself in including such language in the conference report, and I look forward to that occurring.  Mr. Chairman, I do not believe that we have any further speakers on my side. I understand a member is coming, a member of the subcommittee who would like to speak, so while she is on her way let me make a comment, Mr. Chairman.
