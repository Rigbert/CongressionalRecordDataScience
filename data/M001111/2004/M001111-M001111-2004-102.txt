 President, this letter is actually signed by over 500 companies and associations and urges Congress to permanently extend the R tax credit and make the modifications contained in S. 664.  I share with my colleagues a portion of the letter:       The technological innovations made possible by the R      Credit enable companies to bring more products and services      to market, increase employment, and raise the standard of      living for all Americans.       R helps manufacturers and services companies with U.S.      operations maintain a competitive edge over lower-cost      foreign competitors.       It allows a small, medium or large company to reduce its      financial risk in expensive, labor-intensive R investments.       Since the credit was created in 1981, investments in      technology and innovation have spurred economic growth and      contributed greatly to our country's high standard of living.      Continued R spending is a necessary element in our      country's ability to invest for our future.  This is not some abstract economic principle. It is a real incentive that creates jobs and helps workers in America. I have seen it firsthand at companies throughout Washington State. This year, Microsoft plans to invest $6.8 billion on R Because this tax credit is targeted almost exclusively at wages, the credit will translate into additional jobs in Washington State and in the United States. That will mean jobs not just at Microsoft but at many other local companies.  In fact, according to a February 25, 2003, article in the Seattle Times, one study found that every job at Microsoft supports 3.4 other jobs in the economy. It also found that from 1990 to 2001 Microsoft was responsible for more than a fourth, 28.3 percent, of King County's growth. That is an example of how one company's investment in R is supporting good family wage jobs throughout the region.  That is just one company. There are many other companies engaged in R in Washington State and in the United States. Their investment in R will help our workers and help our economy.  I want to share some other figures that show the importance of R investment, especially in Washington State.  In the year 2000, companies performed almost $200 billion in R $9.8billion of that research was performed in Washington State.  Let me shed some light on types of employers that are doing that work. Thirty-three percent of the research done in Washington State was performed by manufacturers. We have seen a terrible loss of manufacturing jobs over the years, and this credit is one way to help them stem the tide. Mr. President, 11.4 percent of the research done in Washington State was done in the professional, scientific, and technical service industries.  This is about moving our economy forward. Technological innovations have accounted for more than one-third of our Nation's economic growth during the last decade. We know innovation is critical to sustained growth in the future.  Extending and improving the R tax credit is one of the most important steps we can take right now to foster investment at home and job creation throughout the country.  I urge my colleagues to give American workers a fair shot in the global marketplace by voting for the Hatch-Murray amendment.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                         R Credit Coalition,                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2004.     Hon. Bill Thomas,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Rangel,     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Max Baucus,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Thomas and Grassley, and Ranking Members      Rangel and Baucus: We urge you to make the enactment of a      permanent research tax credit (R Credit) with the      modifications contained in companion bills H.R. 463/S. 664 an      early legislative priority in 2004.        As you know, the technological innovations made possible      by the R Credit enable companies to bring more products and      services to market, increase employment, and raise the      standard of living for all Americans. R helps manufacturers      and services companies with U.S. operations maintain a      competitive edge over lower-cost foreign competitors. It      allows a small, medium or large company to reduce its      financial risk in expensive, labor-intensive R investments.        Since the credit was created in 1981, investments in      technology and innovation have spurred economic growth and      contributed greatly to our country's high standard of living.      Continued R spending is a necessary element in our      country's ability to invest for our future.        The growth of our economy is inextricably tied to the      ability to companies to make a sustained commitment to long-     term research. Congress has consistently demonstrated support      for the R credit. This year, in order to provide stability      and to ensure that all companies performing intensive      research in the United States are able to benefit from the      credit, Congress should make the credit permanent, increase      the Alternative Incremental Credit (AIRC) rates, and provide      an alternative simplified credit calculation.
