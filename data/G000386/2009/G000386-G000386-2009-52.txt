 This chart shows the effect on the medical expense deduction limitation. This tax increase is just one of the many tax increases likely to stay in the new Democratic proposal. On this chart, which is for the year 2019, because that is when this bill is fully implemented, we see positive dollar figures. I have highlighted these dollar figures in yellow. For those who may not be able to see, I will reiterate that this chart only has positive dollar figures on it. But remember, as I explained yesterday, when we see positive dollar figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation, that committee is telling us that taxes for these people are going to go up. That means for all of the tax returns listed on this chart, taxes will be going up for each. And this tax increase, the medical expense deduction limitation, reaches as low as someone making $10,000 a year.  Maybe some of these low-income individuals and families who will see a tax increase under this provision will receive a subsidy for health insurance. These people may be able to offset this new tax liability. But you can bet your bottom dollar that a large portion of the middle-income individuals and families are not receiving a subsidy. This means that this tax liability highlighted in yellow cannot be offset by the government benefit.  My Democratic friends cannot escape that fact. Even if my friends drop some of the tax provisions in the current Reid bill, many tax provisions will most likely remain. And those tax provisions will increase taxes on middle-class Americans. This not only breaks President Obama's pledge, but it will arbitrarily burden middle-class Americans for years to come.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).
