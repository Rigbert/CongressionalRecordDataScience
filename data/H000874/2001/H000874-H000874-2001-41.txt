Speaker, I rise on behalf of all of the Members of the House. It is not every day that Members of the House and their staffs have to evacuate their congressional offices due to an unseen but potentially lethal health hazard. In fact, as all of us know, it was unprecedented.  Today, on behalf of all of my colleagues, I want to express my sincere thanks to David Walker, the Comptroller General of the United States, and all the dedicated employees of the General Accounting Office who were relocated or otherwise inconvenienced to accommodate Members and their staffs while House office buildings underwent precautionary testing for anthrax.  Those employees' graciousness and patience demonstrated their teamwork and the fact that their important work was uninterrupted when thousands, I emphasize, Mr. Speaker, thousands of us descended on GAO headquarters, is a tribute to their professionalism and to their Americanism. It also reinforced our American ethic that, working together, there is little that we cannot do.  Again, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the entire House, I thank David Walker, all of the employees at GAO for their cooperation, their graciousness and their facilitation of the business of America.                          ____________________
