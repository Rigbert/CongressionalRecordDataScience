President, this is an interesting amendment. I am happy to cosponsor it with Senator Menendez, Senator Schumer, and Senator Clinton.  Consider this: When you went to the airport this week and you wanted to get on an airplane, they asked you to take your shoes off, right? That is what we do every week around here. That is what we do in America to make sure we are safe on an airplane.  Now comes the Senator from New Jersey with a request and a suggestion that, in the scheme of things, is much more valuable to our security. Millions of containers come into the United States every year.
