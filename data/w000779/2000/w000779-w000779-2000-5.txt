President, I rise today to state my objection to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to proceed to or adopt H.R. 4345 and S. 1508, Alaska Native Claims Technical Amendments of 2000, H.R. 4721, acquisition of certain property in Washington County, Utah, S. 2749, to establish the California Trail Interpretive Center in Elko, Nevada, and H.R. 2932, Golden Spike/Crossroads of the West, Utah, unless or until S. 2691 (to provide further protections for the watershed of the Little Sandy River as part of the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit, Oregon) is discharged, unamended, from the House of Representatives Resources Committee and passed, unamended, by the House of Representatives. I do so consistent with the commitment I have made to explain publicly any so-called ``holds'' that I may place on legislation.  S. 2691 is a bi-partisan bill, authored by myself and Senator Smith of Oregon, and supported by all the members of Oregon's Congressional delegation. It passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as the entire Senate, unanimously. This legislation protects the current and future drinking water source for the City of Portland, home to one in four Oregonians.  Despite its broad support, and my personal appeal to the Resources Committee, that Committee has failed to act on it. Oregonians expect their elected representatives will act responsibly to protect Portland's drinking water source. As a result, I cannot agree to H.R. 4345 and S. 1508, H.R. 4721, S. 2749 and H.R. 2932 until S. 2691 clears the House of Representatives unamended.                          ____________________
