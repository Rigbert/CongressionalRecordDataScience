President, if the Senator would yield. I might add to that. When I met with the distinguished Senator from Alabama last week, I had originally suggested it would be well within the appropriate timeframe of the other Justices--including Justice Roberts--that we have the hearing the week we came back from our week-long break of the Fourth of July. He had expressed--and I will let him speak for himself--some concern about that week after, and so I said: OK, we will put it a week later.  He, obviously, wanted to speak with his leadership, and that is fine. I had originally intended to speak about it on Friday, but I understood that the Republican leader had sent a letter to the majority leader because the majority leader had told me about that, and we are all aware of the date. There was never a question about what date I intended to start. I had known that for some time. But this morning I told him by telephone I was going to do that date. I talked to the President, and I so advised Judge Sotomayor.  The fact is, we are not doing something where we have problems with tens of thousands of pages just days before the hearing. We have all the material. I can't speak for other Senators, but we have a lot of work to do. We are paid well, and we have big staffs. I had hoped to take some vacation time during the Fourth of July week--I will not. I will spend that time preparing for it in my farmhouse in Vermont. I would suggest Senators may have to spend some time doing that. I know a lot of our staffs--both Republican and Democratic staffs--are going to have to plan to take time off. They are going to be working hard.  We have a responsibility to the American people. Certainly, we have a responsibility to have a Justice have time enough to get a place to live down here, hire law clerks, and get going.
