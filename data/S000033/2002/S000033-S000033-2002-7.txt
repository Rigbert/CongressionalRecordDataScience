 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, fast track essentially extends our current trade policies. And why in God's name would we want to do that when our current trade policy is an absolute disaster that has cost this country millions of decent-paying jobs and has resulted in the pushing down of wages from one end of America to the other?                              {time}  0115  The facts are clear. They are not disputable. When we have a failed policy, why do we want to extend it?  I hear some people talking about how fast track and trade policies have created new jobs. What world are they living in? The reality is today, nobody disputes it, we have a $346 billion trade deficit, recordbreaking. No one disputes that between 1994 and 2000, the United States lost more than 3 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs due to our trade policies. In 2001, manufacturing lost 1.3 million jobs. Over the past 4 years, this is incredible, our Nation has lost 10 percent, 10 percent of our manufacturing base.  Then people come up here and they say, let us continue; let us extend this absurd and failed policy. When will they catch on, when there are no more manufacturing jobs in America? When all of our kids are flipping hamburgers?  Everybody knows the truth, and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) said it. We all know it. When we go to a department store and buy a product, where is that product manufactured? We all know it. It is not manufactured in Vermont; it is not manufactured in California. It is manufactured in China.  Why is it manufactured in China? We know the answer to that. In China, desperate people, desperate people are working for 20 cents an hour, and the corporate titans in this country have sold out our people and have taken their plants to China, where people go to jail if they try to form a union; where women are brought in from the countryside to work 15, 16 hours a day making sneakers for pennies an hour.  We all know that big money has contributed huge amounts to both political parties in order to move these trade issues, but let us stand up for ordinary Americans and for the middle class. Let us not become a poor, low-wage Nation. Let us reverse our trade policies. Let us demand that corporate America reinvest in Vermont, in America, and not just in China. Let us have a fair trade policy, rather than this disastrous so-called free trade.
