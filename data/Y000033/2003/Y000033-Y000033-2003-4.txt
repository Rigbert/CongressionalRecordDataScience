Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, but I have some concerns. There are 60 separate authorizations in this bill; 10 were cleared through my committee. The remaining came from the other body. What bothers me is we have sent over to the other body a WRDA bill that they should be acting on. When we have that many projects in an appropriations bill without having to go through the due process, including my committee, I think it is inappropriate.  I have worked with the chairman and the chairman of the subcommittee. My staff has worked with them, and we worked through what the House projects should be and they were cleared. But now we see a small WRDA bill. When the conference report was filed, I was a little shocked. In fact, it has two projects in this bill which were not asked for by either the House or Senate. Two projects were inserted by the Corps itself. I think this is a bad way to legislate.  The bill overall is a good bill, but what we ought to be doing is passing aWRDA bill out of the other body and getting that done because this Nation needs a sound policy. This Nation needs restoration, it needs a sound project list to conclude.  The chairman and the ranking member did an outstanding job, but I hope this body keeps insisting to Members of the other body, two of them from each State, urge them to pass that piece of legislation that covers the whole Nation and not do it piecemeal, because it weakens the process and makes it difficult to do what we should be doing. I ask Members as we approach next year, we urge that body to act responsibly.                              {time}  1500                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
