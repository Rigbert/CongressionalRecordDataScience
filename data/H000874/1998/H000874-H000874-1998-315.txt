Speaker, I rise today to honor former Secretary of the Treasury Bill Simon for his service and dedication to helping the poor. His commitment to the poor is unfortunately a rarely publicized aspect of an extraordinary man. He served the country under two administrations as Secretary of the Treasury but his greatest gift is the hope he has given the less fortunate. My friend Paul Harvey honored Bill Simon in an address he gave on ABC Radio Networks on July 25th. In that address Mr. Harvey said and I quote:       You are likely carrying around in your pocket the autograph      of a most extraordinary man. It's on your dollar bill.      Because he was our nation's first Energy Czar and      subsequently Secretary of the Treasury under two      administrations.       After serving his Country in public office, Bill Simon went      back to the world of commerce and industry and got rich.      Though his greatest wealth is not his hundreds of millions of      dollars, but his family. His wife, two sons and five      daughters.       They remember from their earliest Christmases that dad      would arise early and leave his New Jersey home to head off      to volunteer at a shelter for runaway youths in New York      City.       As the children grew older he took them along. They'd work      in the kitchen, they'd clean, serve meals, hand out Christmas      presents--and sometimes--most important--just listen to the      poor, the disabled, the unwed mothers, the lonely elderly.       So the children matured responsibly respectful of their      obligation to help others. Bill Junior now has his own      charitable foundation. Sister Mary is much involved with the      Kids in Crisis Shelter in Connecticut.       The Simons believe as did Andrew Carnegie that people are      helped best by helping them to help themselves. And each of      the Simon siblings emulates the example of their parents.       Today you might find Bill Simon in Harlem at the Terence      Cardinal Cooke Health Center--Talking to an aids patient--     praying with him--a procedure which he has repeated with      literally thousands of terminally ill and destitute patients      at that center. He calls this Eucharistic Ministry the most      important thing that he has ever done.       I've watched Bill Simon for thirty years--demonstrating      that a good Businessman--can also be a Good businessman.       Now preparing to give away most of the rest of his 350      million dollars, he says he hopes others who can, will.       He calls giving `the ultimately rewarding experience,  Paul Harvey's speech honoring Bill Simon for his service to the less fortunate is surely an accolade Mr. Simon has long deserved. I am glad I was able to share this speech with you and I hope we all can learn from the example Bill Simon has set.                          ____________________
