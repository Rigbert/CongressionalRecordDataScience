It is not a question of what is right and popular, what the people want, and what health care professionals say will be best for the future of health care. It is a question of political muscle. The insurance companies have more political muscle in the Senate. They have stopped us from bringing this bill to the floor for a vote.  Shortly we will adjourn and go home with a lot of unfinished business. This is one of them. We came this close to doing it, but the Republican leadership said: No, we are not going to allow the Patients' Bill of Rights to come to the floor for a vote. That is an illustration of their insensitivity to what people in this country really care about: good health care. This Congress has not responded to it. In many respects, this Congress couldn't care less. That is sad because it is our responsibility, as representatives of the people of the States who elect us to listen to their needs and to respond to them. We have been totally unresponsive because of the efforts of the Republican leadership.
