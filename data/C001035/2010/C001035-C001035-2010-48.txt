President, I want to thank my colleague and friend from Tennessee for his comments and his support. We have been working on this since we first began discussing it during the appropriations markup, and he has illustrated what truly can be a devastating impact of this rule. It could prevent the renovations, the cleanup, the reconstruction work from going forward in his State. In his State even more than most States, the impact could truly be devastating. It is serious everywhere but truly devastating in Tennessee.  I have also commented to my colleague from Tennessee how proud he must be of the residents of his State. You hardly have heard of any complaints from Tennessee even though this has truly been a devastating flood. I sometimes worry that perhaps because they are trying to help one another, they are not getting enough attention in the press or from Congress. Fortunately, they have a very fine advocate in Senator Alexander and Senator Corker, and they are continuing to look out for them by cosponsoring this amendment.  I thank the Senator for his support.
