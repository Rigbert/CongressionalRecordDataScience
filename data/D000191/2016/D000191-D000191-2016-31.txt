Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I am not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to congratulate the gentleman on his persistence. This is a very commonsense amendment and it could have tremendous benefits nationwide. It is great policy. I congratulate him for his persistence because this amendment was rejected in committee, but things seem different on the floor, and that is great.  I urge our colleagues to support this fully.  I yield back the balance of my time.
