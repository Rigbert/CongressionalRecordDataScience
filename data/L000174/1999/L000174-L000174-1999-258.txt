This evening I know some of us would like to be with our families. I know it is a family-friendly Senate. But for those of us who have families and wish to be with our families--I know the Senator from New Hampshire feels the same way--can we get some idea when we might vote, so we can do that? If we had not had so many quorum calls, we would be done by now.
