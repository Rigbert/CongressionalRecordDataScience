Chairman, we need to unearth and understand any provisions of any pending trade agreements which might undermine the sovereignty of the United States or our many States or our local governments. According to Renato Ruggiero, Director General of the WTO, in referencing the pending MAI agreement, we are writing the Constitution of a single economy. That is the man in charge. He is saying, the Constitution of a single economy. That is not our Constitution. It is not compliant with our Constitution or our sovereignty.  They have so far challenged the Helms-Burton law, the Clean Air Act, a Massachusetts law that is promoting democracy in Burma, and restrictions on shrimp, and buy-America provisions and buy-Oregon provisions, or buy-California or buy-Arizona provisions will all be held to be non-compliant with this MAI.  We are asking for $1 million to the United States Trade Representative to have them fully investigate, unearth, and report to us in the Congress, the representatives of the people of this country, what the reality of these agreements and these threats are, so we may be more fully informed. Mr. Chairman, I have one agreement with the gentleman from Virginia, we should have this money and we should know what we are voting on.
