  When Senator Kyl bid farewell to this body in 2012, it took me quite a while to come to terms with the prospect that we had cast our final votes together. I went through stages of grief. Eventually, I came to acceptance, but, as it turned out, the great State of Arizona was not quite finished with this distinguished leader after all. If Jon had planned on a relaxing, undisturbed post-Senate career, then, his biggest mistake was leaving a record as one of the most earnest and effective legislators this body had seen in recent memory, because when the people of Arizona needed to step in and honor the towering legacy of our friend John McCain, through the end of this Congress, his counterpart of 18 years was the natural choice.  As the entire Nation mourned the loss of a decorated hero and statesman, Jon Kyl volunteered his even keel and sound judgment to fill the void, and while the Senate may have changed in some small ways in the 6 years since Jon left us, he has likely noticed over the past few months that some things never do. This floor remains the stage for the most important policy challenges facing our country. There is still an urgent need for hard-working public servants with expertise to enter the fray, and he is still the junior Senator from Arizona.  From his first day back, Jon has smoothly continued Senator McCain's habit of making an outsized impact for his State. He cast his vote to confirm a well-qualified Supreme Court nominee.He has joined in advancing major legislation, and he has continued his advocacy for improving our Nation's military readiness.  As we say good-bye one more time, I know every Member of this body will join me in gratitude that Jon answered the call when his experience and talents were needed.  Like the others who have been lucky enough spending 18 years with Jon already, I am especially grateful for this opportunity to work alongside such a dear friend. So I want to thank Jon for his abiding commitment to service. We wish him and his wonderful wife Caryll much health and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
