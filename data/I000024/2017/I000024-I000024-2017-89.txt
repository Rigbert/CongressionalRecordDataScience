President, I know that President Obama is gone now, but his War on Fossil Fuels is alive and well. However, they are not winning that.  Back in Oklahoma, they ask me the question sometimes: If all of the liberals are concerned and if they are all opposed to fossil fuels--and to nuclear, I might add; coal, oil, gas, and nuclear--if coal, oil, gas, and nuclear are responsible for 89 percent of the power it takes to run this country, how do you run the country without those? Those are the kinds of questions we get.  I appreciate and--I know it is a very popular statement that was made by my friend from Ohio; unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the issues we are looking at right now.  Back during the time Dodd-Frank was considered, it was dealing with banks and financial institutions. It had nothing to do with energy. Yet section 1504 was put in there. Part of section 1504 required that information be provided during the course of a competitive situation for some kind of a project.  I will give you an example. We have a private sector in our oil and gas. For China, that is a government project. If we are competing with them--let's say for some cause that is in Tanzania or someplace--they said, so that there is a safeguard and there can't be corruption, so that if we should win--I say ``we,'' but I am talking about the private sector in the United States of America--then they have to report the information to the SEC, which in turn makes it published. Their intent was not to have to break down everything that was in that offer. It is the bottom line.  What is the total cost that goes to these countries? What are the total costs? That is all they care about because if that money went to Tanzania--and there are some corrupt officials there and they might steal some of the money, but to keep that from happening, we want to report what the cost was in the winning party. You don't have to have all that information.  In fact, in 2013, the court struck this down because they said that was not the intent. The intent was to have the total figure, so they said, even suggested--and our intent at that time was to vacate that, as the court did vacate that rule and send it back and have the SEC redo it in such a way that it would affect only the amount of money that would go that might cause some corruption at some time. That is what it was all about. Unfortunately, they put together another one that was very similar and required a lot of information that was not necessary.  I would like to correct something on the CRA that the Senator from Ohio said. The CRA is there because when an unelected bureaucrat comes out with some kind of an unreasonable rule that is very costly to the people of this country and it is done by someone who is not an elected official, the elected official says: Look at this. Wait a minute. This is something that people are complaining about when I go home.  They love that because they can say: This wasn't me. This wasn't me. This was an unelected bureaucrat that put these rules in.  What a CRA does is make us in the House and in the Senate more accountable because we have to then stand up and vote on something, saying that we endorse this rule or we don't endorse this rule. That is what it is all about.  Anyway, we have an opportunity here to go ahead, and I am certainlyhoping that we will do this and change this rule so that it would make as a requirement nothing but the amount of money that is paid by the winning party in a situation where they are competing with each other.  If that happens, then we will know how much money that was, and we will be able to go to the party and find out if they are stealing some of this money. Why is it necessary to have all of the components of competition when you have the private sector in the United States of America competing with countries like China where it is a government-owned institution?  That is all this is about. All we want to do is to be able say we want to report so that the public knows how much the total bid or, in this case, the total amount was, not all the components that went into the calculation of that. That is all it is about.  My time has expired.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). The majority leader.                           Order of Business  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to lay out the schedule for everyone. I know they are interested in knowing the way forward. I have discussed with the Democratic leader where we go from here.  The Senate is going to debate the pending joint resolution tonight for as long as there is interest in debate. Tomorrow the Senate will convene at 6:30 a.m. and immediately proceed to two rollcall votes: passage of the joint resolution of disapproval and cloture on the nomination of Betsy DeVos.  Restating that, debate tonight as long as our friends on the other side would like to debate, and tomorrow we will convene at 6:30 a.m. and immediately turn to two rollcall votes: passage of the joint resolution of disapproval and cloture on the nomination of Betsy DeVos.
