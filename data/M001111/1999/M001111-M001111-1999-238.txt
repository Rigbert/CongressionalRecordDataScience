 President, I am very pleased to join Senator Jeffords as he reintroduces the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. As before, I speak as a strong supporter of this legislation, because I have always believed that every single American deserves fair treatment under the law no matter his or her gender, race, religion or sexual orientation.  As one of only a few women to ever serve in the United States Senate, and the first ever from Washington state, I understand what it means to be part of a group that seeks fairness and equal opportunity. I have never advocated for any special class, just equal treatment and protection under the law.  Not long ago, many thought it would be impossible for women to serve in the Senate or an elected office of any kind. It was felt this was not a suitable occupation for a woman and that simply being a woman meant a person was incapable of meeting the demands of the job. These people alleged that women would somehow jeopardize the work done in the U.S. Congress. While these statements may seem impossible to believe today, they do illustrate what many women faced. However, to our country's benefit, these stereotypes were overcome. I am confident that none of my colleagues today would deny the tremendous contributions women have made here, in the House, in state and local government, and at every level of public service.  People suffer when stereotypes based on fear or ignorance are used to justify discrimination. I do not believe elected leaders serve our country well if they deny any citizen equal opportunities and equal treatment under the law. A person's success or failure must depend on his or her qualifications, skills, efforts, and even luck. But, no one, I repeat, no one, should be denied opportunities because of race, gender, religion, age or sexual orientation. No one should endure discrimination such as many people have endured in the workplace because of sexual orientation.  I am always disappointed to hear about cases of economic discrimination based solely on sexual orientation. It defies logic that in today's society any employer could refuse to hire an individual, deny them equal pay, or professional advancement and subject them to harassment simply because of their sexual orientation. Our country is based on the ideal of allowing equal opportunity and basic civil rights for all Americans, but we have not fullyachieved this goal. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act will correct that wrong.  As we would all agree, discrimination based on race, gender, ethnic origin, or religion is not just unfair, but illegal as well. ENDA would simply add sexual orientation to this list. It is written even more narrowly than current law for other areas of non-discrimination, because it does not allow positive corrective actions such as quotas or other preferential treatment. It simply says that a person cannot be unfairly treated in employment, based on his or her sexuality, whether that person is heterosexual or homosexual. Mr. President, this is a reasonable expectation. In fact, it has become a reality in nine states, including California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota, and in many local jurisdictions across the country. Also, many Fortune 500 companies, such as Microsoft and IBM, have adopted their own non-discrimination policies. Companies such as these recognize that it makes good business sense to value each and every one of their employees equally. It is time that our laws reflect these values as well.  Not only do these companies and governments support a non-discrimination policy in the workplace, but the public also supports ENDA by a wide margin, according to a bipartisan 1998 poll conducted for the Human Rights Campaign. This poll found that 58 percent of Americans support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This is compelling evidence that Americans are behind ENDA, support expanding these basic civil rights to all, and believe that everyone deserves these rights. They understand that our country will be a better place when discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace is put to an end.  Mr. President, this is not about one group's protection at another's expense. This issue is still not about allowing a greater window for litigation, as opponents have previously argued. It is about common sense, common decency and our fundamental values as Americans.  In the last Congress, we came within one vote of adopting this important, bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues now to support this measure so that we can continue our proud tradition of protecting basic civil rights and opportunity for all Americans. Let us join together to pass this bill so that our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, friends and relatives will have protection against unjust discrimination. We have the opportunity to provide them with these basic civil rights now. I hope my colleagues will seize this opportunity to make our country the just, equal, and fair place it should be.                                 ______                                       By
