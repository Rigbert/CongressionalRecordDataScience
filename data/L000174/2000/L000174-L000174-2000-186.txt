President. I want to express my thanks and appreciation to my colleagues in the Senate for their support of Senate Resolution 355 congratulating Middlebury College on the successful completion of their first 200 years of higher education. I also want to thank my friend Senator Hatch and my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for discharging this resolution in such a timely manner.  Later this fall, Middlebury College will enjoy the honor of celebrating its bicentennial. Middlebury College is one of the most respected liberal arts colleges in the nation and it was one of the first institutions of higher education in Vermont. In November 1800, the school first opened its doors for business to seven students and one professor in space at the local grammar school. Today, the school has more than two thousand students, almost two hundred professors, and a main campus of over 250 acres.  In recognition of 200 years of educating students from across this country and the world, the Middlebury College Bicentennial Planning Commission has designed Celebration 2000 to commemorate this milestone in Vermont's and the nation's educational history. The year-long bicentennial celebration honors the people and events that have made and continue to make Middlebury College a leader in higher education. Celebration 2000 features concerts, plays, and symposia, both on campus and at additional locations such as the New York Public Library, and the dedication of a new science building, Bicentennial Hall, with an exterior that resembles the Old Stone Row and the school's early architectural history. This year-long celebration will culminate later this fall during Founders' Week, a series of events on campus during the first week of November.  I am pleased this body has moved so quickly to commend and congratulate Middlebury College on the completion of its first two hundred years of educational excellence. I thank my colleagues for joining Senator Jeffords, the other cosponsors of this resolution and me in honoring the contributions of the school, its students and its alumni.                          ____________________
