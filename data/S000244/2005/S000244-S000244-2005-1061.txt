Madam Chairman, I deeply respect the arguments that have been advanced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff). He put forth his proposal in committee, and it was defeated on a rollcall vote of 3 ayes to 22 noes. So the Schiff proposal did not even carry a majority of the Democratic members in the committee, let alone the Republican members.  Madam Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), who is also a sponsor of this bill.
