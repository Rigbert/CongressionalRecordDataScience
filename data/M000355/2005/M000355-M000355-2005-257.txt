 President, I today honor the life of a prominent Kentuckian, Mr. Henry Oscar Whitlow, and to pay tribute to the numerous contributions he made to his community and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  A native of Ballard County, KY, Mr. Whitlow spent his professional life practicing law in Paducah. In addition to being a respected attorney, he was also an active member of the Broadway United Methodist Church, and served as President of the Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce, the Paducah Jaycees, and the Paducah Rotary Club.  People like Henry Whitlow are what make Kentucky such a special place. I extend my condolences to his wife of 55 years, Elizabeth Ann Clement Whitlow, his son Mark Whitlow, his daughter Rebecca Gutherie, and all those that mourn the passing of this great man.  Earlier this week the Paducah Sun marked the passing of this community icon in a piece titled, ``Whitlow remembered for community contributions.'' I ask that the full article be printed in the Record and that the entire Senate join me in paying our respect to this beloved Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Paducah Sun, Nov. 8, 2005]             Whitlow Remembered for Community Contributions                          (By Bill Bartleman)       Henry Oscar Whitlow was remembered Monday as soft-spoken      and unassuming, but strong and powerful in his contribution      to the community and the legal profession.       Whitlow, 91, died at 5:42 a.m. Monday at Lourdes hospital.      His son, Mark Whitlow, said he had suffered from Alzheimer's      and had been in a nursing home since last year.       Visitation will be held at the Milner and Orr Funeral Home      of Paducah from 4 to 7 p.m. Thursday. Services will be at      Broadway United Methodist Church in Paducah at 1:30 p.m.      Friday followed by burial in Mount Kenton Cemetery.       Whitlow, a native of Monkey's Eyebrow in Ballard County,      began practicing law in Paducah in 1937 with the Waller and      Threlkeld law firm. He eventually became a partner and the      firm is now known as Whitlow Roberts Houston and Straub. It      is one of Paducah's largest and most prestigious firms.       He was a member of Broadway United Methodist Church for      almost 70 years and held every leadership position in the      church. He also was a lay speaker and a Sunday School      teacher.       He also was active in civic affairs and served as president      of what is now the Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce, the      Paducah Rotary Club, the Paducah Jaycees and many other      organizations.       Senior U.S. District Judge Edward H. Johnstone described      Whitlow as a leader with humility, a litigator with      compassion and a scholar with the common touch.       ``He was a great man,'' Johnstone said. ``The thing that      distinguished him from present-day lawyers is that he built      his reputation by what he did, not how much he advertised or      blew his own horn. His work is what sold him to the public.      He never sought glory or credit. He was unselfish and always      a perfect gentleman.''       U.S. District Judge Thomas Russell said Whitlow had a      profound effect on those around him. Russell was associated      with Whitlow's firm for almost 25 years.       Without Whitlow as a mentor, Russell said he would have      never risen to the federal judgeship. ``You can learn the      practice of law from a lot of people, but he taught me what      it takes to represent people--to feel their sorrow, their      joys and their concerns.''       Whitlow served as the attorney for the Paducah Board of      Education for more than 40 years. Bill Black Jr., a long-time      board member, said Whitlow viewed his work with the board as      public service. ``The fees he charged were not what he could      get investing his time in other legal work,'' Black said.       He said Whitlow never tried to influence board decisions      and only got involved when he thought the board was straying      in the wrong legal direction.       ``He listened very carefully and said very little,'' Black      said. ``But when he did speak, we always knew it was our time      to listen to his wisdom and take his advice.''       Black noted that Whitlow was the board attorney in 1956      when the city schools were integrated. He said Whitlow's      legal advice undoubtedly played an important role in the      successful and peaceful integration that had been mandated by      the U.S. Supreme Court.       ``Many schools in the South started integrating in the 1st      grade and did it over 12 years,'' Black said. ``Paducah      allowed any African American who wanted to attended a      previously all-white school to do it in the first year.''       Away from the legal profession, Russell said Whitlow set an      example of how a person should be a good citizen. In addition      to being a church leader, Russell said Whitlow was active in      the Boy Scouts, charitable work ``and was past president of      the Rotary Club and every other civic organization that he      belonged to. ``In all that he ever did, he didn't seek any      kind of recognition.''       Mark Whitlow, also an attorney, said his father was an      inspiration.       ``We all love our fathers,'' Whitlow said. ``But he also      was an outstanding mentor in terms of being a scholar of the      law and in his love for the community and public service. He      set a good example for all of us.''       Fred Paxton, chairman of the board of Paxton Media which      owns the Paducah Sun, said Whitlow's slight frame and soft      voice were deceiving.       ``He was a very rugged individual and very, very strong,''      Paxton said. ``If you exchange a hand shake with him, you      knew that. He also had a delightful sense of humor. It was      very low key and subtle, but rich.''       In 1993 Whitlow was honored as the Kentucky Bar      Association's ``Lawyer of the Year.''       He was humbled by the honor. ``It was like a bolt out of      the blue,'' he told the Paducah Sun. ``I still don't know how      the lightning happened to strike me. I am just an old country      boy who came up in the Depression.''       In addition to his son, Whitlow is survived by his wife of      55 years, Elizabeth Ann Clement Whitlow; a daughter, Rebecca      Gutherie of Maryland; a sister, Mildred Hughes of Tucson,      Ariz., and two grandchildren.                          ____________________[Page S12676]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            MORNING BUSINESS                                 ______                                                    TRIBUTE TO MR.
