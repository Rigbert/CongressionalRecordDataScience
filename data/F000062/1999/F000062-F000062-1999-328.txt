 President, today I am introducing the Public Lands and Recreation Investment Act of 1999. This bill will provide funding for two of our nation's most important conservation and recreation programs--the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act--that have been woefully underfunded in recent years.  Every year, the Federal government collects about $4 billion from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. These leases have detrimental impacts on our environment, so it is fitting that in 1965 Congress created the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This fund is authorized to use $900 million annually in Outer Continental Shelf lease payments to purchase park and recreation lands in or near our national parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public lands. The fund also is supposed to provide grants to states, so that state and local governments may purchase parklands and recreation facilities.  Acquisition of these lands protects some of our nation's most crucial natural resources, including key watersheds that provide drinking water to millions of Americans, and vital wildlife habitat for endangered species. Public lands also provide recreation opportunities for millions of Americans, and open spaces in increasingly crowded urban areas. Over the years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has protected lands in all 50 States, including such special places as Yellowstone National Park, the Everglades, and the California Desert.  Unfortunately, the Land and Water Conservation Fund's tremendous promise has not yet been fulfilled. Last year Congress and the President provided only $328 million of the $900 million collected by the Land and Water Conservation Fund for land acquisition. The rest went back into the Treasury, for deficit reduction or spending on other programs. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has collected over $21 billion since its creation in 1965, but only $9 billion has been spent. Unappropriated balances in the fund now total $13 billion, and they are growing every year.  In the meantime, a huge backlog has developed in the federal acquisition of environmentally sensitive land. The U.S. Department of Interior estimates that the cost of acquiring inholdings in national parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public lands now totals over $10 billion. In addition, the federal government receives about $600 million in Land and Water Conservation Fund requests each year.  The funding shortfall has been particularly difficult for State and local governments. For the last several years, Congress has provided no funding for the stateside grants portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, or to The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act, a separate program that provides for rehabilitation of recreation facilities and improved recreation programs in our nation's cities.  Last month President Clinton proposed the Lands Legacy Initiative, which would provide $1 billion from the Land and Water Conservation Fund in fiscal year 2000. The President's initiative would expand our nation's public lands, provide grants to states for land acquisition, promote open space and ``smart growth,'' improve wildlife habitat, and protect farmland from development. The Lands Legacy Initiative is a good first step, but our commitment to public lands should not be a one-year deal.  Therefore, I am pleased that other Senators have introduced bills that would provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act, as well as a number of other programs. I support Senator Boxer's bill, the Permanent Protection for America's Resources Act, and I look forward to working with her and with all Senators interested in public lands, coastal restoration, and wildlife protection.  If Senator Boxer's bill does not move, however, the bill that I am introducing today is a moderate alternative that I believe will enjoy broadbipartisan support. The bill is important for three reasons. First, it focuses exclusively on guaranteed annual funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. I want to ensure that the Land and Water Conservation Fund remains a top priority for Congress regardless of other important environmental programs that are funded. We cannot lose sight of how important the Land and Water Conservation Fund is to America's conservation and recreation efforts.  Second, the bill makes no changes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund that impede the federal government's ability to acquire land. Two bills currently pending in Congress would restrict federal land purchases to inholdings within existing parks only, and require prior Congressional authorization even for small acquisitions that have traditionally been approved through the appropriations process. These bills also require that two-thirds of the federal funding be spent east of the 100th meridian.  Under these terms, projects such as the Headwaters acquisition, where the federal government and State of California bought the largest ancient redwood stand in private hands, would have been impossible. I believe strongly that the primary purpose of the Land and Water Conservation Fund--to enable the federal government to permanently protect our nation's most special places--must be preserved and strengthened, not eroded.  Finally, this bill revives the state grants portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has funded over 37,000 state parks projects over the last three decades, as well as the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. These programs have worked well for decades, and I would like to restore funding for them while preserving broad latitude for states and local governments to determine their own conservation and recreation priorities. The bill does not establish competitive grants under the state program.  Specifically, the bill amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act to say that $900 million will be automatically appropriated each year for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. The bill also provides that 40 percent of the funds provided under this act must be spent on stateside grants. This will revive the moribund State grants program and ensure that states get their fair share of parks and recreation dollars. States will be required to ``pass through'' 50 percent of the grants they receive directly to local governments.  In addition, the bill provides that 10 percent of the funds provided under this act be allocated to the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery program. This will ensure that recreation facilities and open space remain top priorities where they are urgently needed--increasingly crowded cities. The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act will be amended to allow funds to be spent for construction of recreation facilities, and acquisition of park lands in urban areas.  The bill also requires the President to submit an annual priority list to Congress for expenditure of funds provided to federal agencies under this act. The bill specifically provides for Congressional approval of this priority list, so that Congress will retain authority to decide how Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars are spent on federal lands.  The bill changes requirements for the Land and Water Conservation Fund's stateside grants program, including a new requirement for States to develop, with public input, action agendas that identify their top conservation and recreation acquisition needs. Finally, the bill provides that Indian tribes will be recognized collectively as one state under the state grants program.  The Public Land and Recreation Investment Act will have a major and immediate impact on conservation and recreation nationwide. In my home state, increased funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund could allow for the purchase of 483,000 acres of inholdings in national parks and wilderness areas in the California Desert, dramatically improving recreation opportunities in three of our nation's newest national parks. It could permanently protect sensitive watersheds at Lake Tahoe and help preserve the Lake's astounding water quality. And it could restore wetlands in San Francisco Bay, which has lost over 80 percent of its wetlands in the last 100 years.  Nationally, funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund will help to preserve special places like Cape Cod National Seashore and the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, whose land acquisition needs have gone unmet in recent years.  Reviving the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act will help cities across our nation improve parks and recreation opportunities for their residents. In the past, the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act has funded summer recreation, anti-drug counseling, and job training for teenagers in low income neighborhoods in Fresno. The City of Milwaukee instituted a ``Park Watch'' program to help neighborhoods combat vandalism and crime in city parks. And in Tuscon, Arizona, the UPARR program funded a health and physical fitness program for children, senior citizens, and disabled youth.  This bill is strongly supported by groups that seek to protect conservation and recreation resources for all Americans.  Mr. President, I will submit for the Record at the end of my statement, letters from the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, and Defenders of Wildlife, who strongly support the Public Land and Recreation Investment Act of 1999.  Mr. President, the bottom line is that for too long, we have diverted monies intended for conservation and recreation to other purposes. This bill will help to correct that imbalance, and ensure a lasting legacy for our children and grandchildren. Whether they hike through a pristine wilderness, climb on an urban jungle gym, or picnic in a greenbelt outside their hometown, they will have the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act to thank. That is something I believe we can all be proud of.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 532       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Land and Recreation      Investment Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16      U.S.C. 460l-4 et seq.) has been critical in acquiring land to      protect America's national parks, forests, wildlife refuges,      and public land in all 50 States from potential development      and in improving recreational opportunities for all      Americans;       (2) the Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped to      preserve nearly 7,000,000 acres of America's most special      places, from the California Desert to the Everglades, in part      by providing grants that have helped States purchase over      2,000,000 acres of parkland and open space;       (3) although amounts in the Land and Water Conservation      Fund are meant to be used only for conservation and      recreation purposes, since 1980 Congress and the President      have diverted much of this vital funding for deficit      reduction and other budgetary purposes;       (4) because of chronic shortages in funding for the Land      and Water Conservation Fund, the backlog of Federal      acquisition needs now totals over $10,000,000,000; the      backlog includes key wetlands, watersheds, wilderness, and      wildlife habitat and important historic, cultural, and      recreational sites;       (5) the findings of the 1995 National Biological Service      study entitled ``Endangered Ecosystems of the United States:      A Preliminary Assessment of Loss and Degradation''      demonstrate the need to escalate conservation measures that      protect the Nation's wildlands and wildlife habitats;       (6) lack of funding for the State grants portion of the      Land and Water Conservation Fund has hampered State and local      efforts to protect parklands, coastlines, habitat areas, and      open space from development;       (7) recreation needs in America's cities have been      neglected, in part because the Urban Park and Recreation      Recovery Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.) has not been      funded since 1995;       (8) at the same time that Federal investment in      conservation and recreation has shrunk, demand for outdoor      recreation has skyrocketed: visits to our public lands have      increased dramatically in recent years, and the national      survey on recreation and the environment conducted by the      Forest Service indicates substantial growth in most outdoor      activities; and       (9) increased investment in conservation and recreation is      essential to maintaining America's environmental quality and      high quality of life.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that funding is available without further Act      of appropriation to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and      the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program;       (2) to protect the Nation's parklands, wildlife habitat,      and recreational resources;       (3) to revive the State grants portion of the Land and      Water Conservation Fund; and       (4) to ensure that local governments and Indian tribes      receive a fair share of proceeds from the Land and Water      Conservation Fund.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of Defenders of Wildlife,      the Sierra Club and our nearly one million members and      supporters, we want to thank you for your leadership in      introducing the Public Land and Recreation Improvement Act of      1999 to provide permanent increased funding for both the Land      and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and      Recreation Recovery Program.       Ensuring full and permanent funding for the Land and Water      Conservation Fund (LWCF) has been a major priority of the      environmental community for many years. LWCF represents a      promise made by Congress to the American people to reinvest      revenue from the development of non-renewable resources into      acquisition and permanent protection of key land, water, and      open space resources for future generations.       Unfortunately, the LWCF promise is one that has remained      largely unfulfilled--funding has averaged only about 25% of      its annual authorized level. As a result, numerous      conservation opportunities are being lost. Our nation's      obligation to purchase lands within our National Wildlife      Refuges, Parks, Forests, and Bureau of Land Management units      has been neglected. Rivers, estuaries, and wetlands across      the country are at risk. Pristine wilderness, vital to clean      water and habitat protection, and the foundation of our      nation's natural heritage is being threatened or destroyed.      Parks and open space--the cornerstone for quality of life in      our urban areas--are falling victim to urban sprawl and      unchecked development.       As the Public Land and Recreation Improvement Act of 1999      correctly asserts, the need to provide additional protection      to our nation's vanishing wildlands and habitats is greater      than ever. The National Biological Service warned in a 1995      report that the nation's ecosystems are in decline and many      of our park and forest areas must be acquired quickly before      lands and wildlife are destroyed.       Your bill takes an important step forward in renewing the      commitment made to the American people more than 30 years ago      when the LWCF Act was originally passed to preserve--instead      of losing forever--these irreplaceable land and water      resources.       As you know, the President has also recently made a      commitment to seek full and permanent funding for LWCF and      other related programs to protect habitat, open space, and      important marine and coastal resources. Moreover, the      environmental community strongly supports the dedication of      funding both for marine and coastal resource protection and      critically underfunded state non-game wildlife conservation      programs. We are eager to work with you, the President, and      other leaders on these issues in Congress to ensure permanent      and mandatory funding that addresses all of these crucial      needs without creating any incentives for new offshore      drilling as some current proposals in Congress would do.       Again, we applaud your leadership in introducing this      important legislation and thank you for your commitment to      preserving our magnificent natural heritage.           Sincerely,     Rodger Schlickeisen,       President, Defenders of Wildlife.     Carl Pope,       Executive Director, Sierra Club.                                  ____                                       The Wilderness Society,                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1999.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Wilderness Society would like      to commend your efforts in introducing the ``Public Lands and      Recreation Investment Act of 1999''. By focusing your bill on      LWCF and the Urban Park and Recreation and Recovering (UPAAR)      program, it will address needs of expanding population and      urban sprawl.       This bill crystallizes several important concepts. It      dramatically elevates the funding for LWCF and resuscitates      the state-size grant program. Additionally, it reactivates      UPAAR and adapts it to respond to contemporary urban needs by      allowing land acquisition. Furthermore, the inclusing of      language that allow tribes to participate equally with states      for matching grants for planning acquisition and      rehabilitation sets an important standard.       We support your thoughtful efforts on behalf America's      public lands and appreciate the leadership you have provided.           Sincerely,                                               William H. Meadows,                                                        President.                                 ______                                       By
