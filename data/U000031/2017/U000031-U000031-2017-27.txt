Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this commonsense hydropower streamlining process for modernizing the way we permit in order to bolster the process for over 400 existing hydropower projects in the United States. It is very important in my area as well.  Hydropower delivers clean, reliable, and renewable power 24 hours a day, unlike other renewable power sources which fluctuate with time of day, weather, sun or wind, or lack thereof.  California has a long history of hydropower generation. In 2014, California, alone, produced 14,000 megawatts of electricity from hydropower facilities--again, clean, renewable, and reliable. You turn on the switch, hydroelectric power.  My district in northern California is home to two of the largest facilities in the country: Oroville Dam and Shasta Dam. Each of these facilities delivers cost-efficient power, provides flood control, and generates significant local economic activity for the community via stored water and recreation.  With local input, which is very important, we need to address the streamlining of this process and expanding renewable hydropower production in this country to pave the way for new jobs and affordable power to consumers everywhere.  Relicensing permits ought not be a wish list for every special interest, but, indeed, on measures of the power that can be generated.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the time, and I wholeheartedly support and urge this House to support H.R. 3043.
