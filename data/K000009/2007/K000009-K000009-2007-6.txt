Chairman, I thank Congressman Green and express gratitude to Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, Subcommittee Chair Watt and Congressman Miller for their extraordinary efforts to restore confidence in our Nation's housing markets and address the housing mortgage crisis facing our Nation, this crisis has been felt no more harshly than in the State of Ohio, one of the hardest hit States in our Union, where our foreclosure filing rates have gone up 300 percent since just last year, thousands upon thousands of Ohioans having for sale and foreclosure signs in front of their homes. In Ohio, $20 billion and growing is the gap, the financing gap.  I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment, but want to clarify that under the bill, any legal case that has been filed can proceed forward, indeed until the regulations for implementation of the bill are completed after it is signed by the President. States are not limited in their ability to prosecute in cases of fraud, collusion, misrepresentation, deception, false advertising or civil rights. Importantly, any mortgage made in the future will have to assure the borrower's ability to repay and that the borrower be yielded a net tangible benefit.  As this bill moves forward, I believe it can be perfected even more to restore confidence, discipline and provide accountability in our troubled, very troubled, housing markets, which are helping to drive our Nation into recession.  I just want to say to Chairman Frank, you are the right man in the right place at the right time. I just hope that the other body and the President of the United States follow your leadership on this really critical issue, take it not just to Ohio, but to our country.Stockton, Detroit, Riverside-San Bernardino Post Top Metro Foreclosure                               Rates in Q3                         (By RealtyTrac Staff)       IRVINE, Calif.--Nov. 14, 2007--RealtyTrac'      (realtytrac.com), the leading online marketplace for      foreclosure properties, today released its Q3 2007      Metropolitan Foreclosure Market Report, which shows Stockton,      Calif., Detroit and Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.,      documented the three highest foreclosure rates among the      nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas during the third      quarter.

Real Estate and The Wall Street      Journal's Real Estate Journal.       ``Although cities in just three states--California, Ohio      and Florida--accounted for more than two-thirds of the top 25      metro foreclosure rates, increasing foreclosure activity was      not limited to just a few hot spots,'' said James J.      Saccacio, chief executive officer of RealtyTrac. ``In fact,      77 out of the top 100 metro areas reported more foreclosure      filings in the third quarter than they had in the previous      quarter. Still, there continue to be pockets of the country--     most noticeably metro areas in the Carolinas, Virginia and      Texas--that have thus far dodged the foreclosure bullet.'' california, ohio, florida cities dominate top metro foreclosure rates       Stockton, Calif., documented one foreclosure filing for      every 31 households during the quarter, the highest      foreclosure rate along the nation's 100 largest metro areas.

Detroit reported the third highest number of      foreclosure filings during the quarter.       Atlanta's foreclosure filing total of 21,695 on 18,940      properties was the fourth highest foreclosure filing total,      and the metro area's foreclosure rate of one foreclosure      filing for every 92 households ranked No. 18 among the top      100 metro areas.       Other cities with foreclosure filing totals among the 10      highest were Phoenix, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Cleveland,      Chicago, Miami and Sacramento, Calif.                           report methodology       The RealtyTrac Metro Foreclosure Market Report provides the      total number of foreclosure filings by metropolitan area,      along with the number of households per foreclosure filing.      The household numbers are based on the U.S. Census Bureau's      2005 estimates of total housing units.       Beginning with the Midyear 2007 report, the report also      includes counts of properties with at least one foreclosure      filing reported against them. This new metric only counts a      property once, even if there were multiple foreclosure      actions filed against the property during the time period      covered by the report.
