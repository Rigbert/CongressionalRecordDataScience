Speaker, I'm proud that Maryland is home to some of the finest military installations in the country, where our nation's most dedicated service-members and civilian defense employees work to keep our country safe. Over the last eighteen years, they and their families and the communities that support our installations have had an outstanding advocate in Brigadier General Michael Hayes USMC (Ret.). Since August, 1999, after his retirement from a distinguished career as a decorated Marine Corps officer, Mike has led the State of Maryland's Office of Military and Federal Affairs as its first Director.  Under Mike's leadership, the Office of Military and Federal Affairs and the Maryland Military Installation Council have overseen efforts to bring community, academic, and military--as well as federal, state, and local--resources together to promote regional development and economic growth. I've had the pleasure of working closely with him over the years to ensure that Fifth District military installations--Patuxent River, Webster Field, and Indian Head--can continue to grow, serve our national defense, and bring jobs and opportunities to surrounding communities. Mike has played a pivotal role in these efforts, which have earned him accolades, including being named one of two national `Public Officials of the Year' by the Association of Defense Communities (ADC) in 2007 and becoming a member of the ADC Board of Directors in 2011.  Mike's service to the State of Maryland caps a long career as a Marine officer. He served on active duty during the Vietnam War, commanding artillery batteries during two tours. Later, he went on to command Marine units based in the United States, Japan, and Panama before serving as Chief of Staff to the II Marine Expeditionary Force during Operation Desert Storm. Following his return home, Mike served as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Facilities and Services at the Marine Corpsheadquarters before his retirement from thirty-three years of commissioned service in 1999.  A native of Wisconsin, Mike obtained his B.S. in Economics from the University of Wisconsin, and he holds degrees as well from the Naval War College and the National War College. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in thanking Mike for his long career of service to our nation and to the State of Maryland. I wish him and his wife Barbara, as well as their two children and three grandchildren, all the best.                          ____________________
