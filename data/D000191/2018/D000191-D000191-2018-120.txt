Chair, as the co-chair of the Northwest Energy Caucus, I was pleased to be a cosponsor of the Newhouse amendment.  Included in President Trump's Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019 budget requests were proposals to sell off transmission assets of the Power Marketing Administrations, including the Bonneville Power Administration. Previous presidents, of both parties, have proposed the same. The theory behind selling the assets is the U.S. gets a one-time influx of cash with no harm to ratepayers.  I recognize these proposals for what they are: budget gimmicks that will only serve to drive up energy costs for Oregon and other Northwest residents and businesses. It's important to note that BPA costs the federal government nothing; it is entirely funded by Pacific Northwest ratepayers. Any money BPA borrows from the U.S. treasury is repaid, with interest.  By law, BPA is required to sell power at cost. No private company would buy BPA's assets unless it was assured it would make a profit, which would translate into higher electricity costs.  Additionally, BPA serves millions of rural customers, and maintaining transmission infrastructure is costly. There is no guarantee that a private company would invest in less profitable lines that serve rural areas, harming rural communities. In fact, it could lead to serious neglect or complete abandonment of the lines.  In May, President Trump thankfully listened to Northwest lawmakers and scrapped his FY19 proposal. This amendment would ensure that no funds could be spent to reconsider the idea                          ____________________
