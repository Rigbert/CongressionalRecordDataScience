President, I have spoken several times on the Senate floor about the situation in Bosnia. Just last night, the Senate voted in support of our troops.  Time and again, I have listened to Senators cite the amount of phone calls and letters they have received from their constituents both for and against sending American ground troops to Bosnia.  I, too, have heard from a number of Vermonters about this issue. Over the past several weeks, opponents of President Clinton's Bosnia policy have outnumbered supporters by a 3 to 1 margin.  I think it is appropriate, however, that on the day the Bosnian peace agreement is signed in Paris, I share with the Senate a letter I received from my friend, Colonel R.W. van de Velde USA (Ret.).  I ask unanimous consent to insert his letter in the Congressional Record after my statement and yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          ____________________
