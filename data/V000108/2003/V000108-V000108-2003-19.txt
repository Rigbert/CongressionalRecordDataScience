Chairman, I appreciate the chairman yielding me his time, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I too am opposed to the Andrews amendment. I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman, but I disagree with him on the policy of this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel).
