I will read that language to you. The language states:       Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the United States      Government to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the      Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel      Mines and on Their Destruction as soon as practicable.  My amendment merely agrees to that language but adds, provided ``the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the unified combatant commanders certify in writing to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives that'' such a step ``is consistent with the combat requirements and safety of the armed forces of the United States.''  So essentially what we are doing is saying that we agree that the language is--even though I would prefer the language not be in there, the language remain in there, but it be qualified. I am always a little bit confused and disturbed when I see the qualifier ``as practicable.'' I don't know what ``as practicable'' means, and so I think this actually would improve the language that was put in by the Senator from Vermont giving some qualifications.  I think also that the Senator from Vermont has a lot of passion on this issue. I certainly understand that. When I was a freshman, I was seated up there where the President is seated right now and listened to his comments for about an hour. I know his concern comes from the heart. I think he is also equally concerned about the safety of troops deployed overseas, thousands of troops in South Korea and troops all around the world.  A statement that was made by the Senator from Vermont, referring to the Ottawa Treaty, was: I think we can get to it sooner, and I and others will be pushing to do so. So I think there is going to be an ongoing effort to get to this treaty sooner than some of us would want to do that.  The fact is that our senior military commanders, both those currently in uniform and many of those now in retirement, have already put us on notice: The U.S. military requires the ability to make responsible use of self-destructing APLs. This is particularly true in those situations where American forces are forced to operate in hostile territory, often severely outnumbered. The alternative to the responsible use of antipersonnel landmines is to have their positions overrun, to beachhead loss and heavy casualty loss unnecessarily sustained.  So, Mr. President, here is what every Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and every one of the unified combatant commanders wrote last year, and I am quoting right now.       Self-destructing landmines are particularly important to      the protection of early entry and light forces which must be      prepared to fight outnumbered during the initial stages of      deployment. The lives of our sons and daughters should be      given the highest priority when deciding whether or not to      ban unilaterally the use of self-destructing APLs.  I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of this extraordinary letter dated July 10 of 1997 printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    The Joint Chiefs of Staff,                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1997.     Hon. Strom Thurmond,     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are seriously concerned about the new      legislative proposal to permanently restrict the use of funds      for new deployment of antipersonnel landmines (APL)      commencing January 1, 2000. Passing this bill into law will      unnecessarily endanger U.S. military forces and significantly      restrict the ability to conduct combat operations      successfully. As the FY 1998 Defense Authorization Bill and      other related legislation are considered, your support is      needed for the Service members whose lives may depend on the      force protection afforded by such landmines.       We share the world's concern about the growing humanitarian      problem related to the indiscriminate and irresponsible use      of a lawful weapon, non-self-destructing APL. In fact we have      banned non-self-destructing [dumb] APL, except for Korea. We      support the President's APL policy which has started us on      the road to ending our reliance on any anti-personnel      landmines. Having taken a great step toward the elimination      of APL, we must at this time, retain the use of self-     destructing APL in order to minimize the risk to U.S.      soldiers and marines in combat. However, we are ready to ban      all APL when the major producers and suppliers ban theirs or      when an alternative is available.       Landmines are a ``combat multiplier'' for U.S. land forces,      especially since the dramatic reduction of the force      structure. Self-destructing landmines greatly enhance the      ability to shape the battlefield, protect unit flanks, and      maximize the effects of other weapons systems. Self-     destructing landmines are particularly important to the      protection of early entry and light forces, which must be      prepared to fight outnumbered during the initial stages of a      deployment.       This legislation, in its current form, does not      differentiate between non-self-destructing and self-     destructing APL. Banning new deployments of APL will prevent      use of most modern U.S. remotely delivered landmine systems      to protect U.S. forces. This includes prohibiting use of most      antitank landmine systems because they have APL embedded      during production. Self-destructing APL are essential to      prevent rapid breaching of antitank mines by the enemy. These      concerns were reported to you in the recent ``Chairman of the      Joint Chiefs of Staff Report to Congress on the Effects of a      Moratorium Concerning Use by Armed Forces of APL.'' Also of      concern is that the bill's definition of an APL jeopardizes      use of other munitions essential to CINC warplanes.       We request that you critically review the new APL      legislation and take appropriate action to ensure maximum      protection for our soldiers and marines who carry out      national security policy at grave personal risk. Until the      United States has a capable replacement for self-destructing      APL, maximum flexibility and warfighting capability for      American combat commanders must be preserved. The lives of      our sons and daughters should be given the highest priority      when deciding whether or not to ban unilaterally the use of      self-destructing APL.           Sincerely,         Joseph W. Ralston, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of            Staff; Dennis J. Reimer, General, U.S. Army, Chief of            Staff; Ronald R.
