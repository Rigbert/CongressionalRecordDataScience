We have adopted the language of the Senator from South Carolina in S. 1, 96 to 2. We sent it over to the House for consideration. The Senator from South Carolina came to the floor while the House was deliberating and insisted that we move forward. We said we had to wait for House action, and House action has taken place, moving us to a conference. Now the Senator from South Carolina is objecting to going to a conference so that this could become the law of the land and the rules applying to the Senate. Is that where we are today? The Republican Senate is objecting to going to conference on ethics and lobbying reform?
