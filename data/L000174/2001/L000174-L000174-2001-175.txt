STEVENS. No--one must only show a need--from innocent victims of landmines to those with muscular dystrophy--the Wheelchair Foundation has a single mission of bringing mobility and independence to those who cannot walk.  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Leahy, it is clear that Senator Stevens has come to us on behalf of an organization worthy of receiving U.S. support and I look forward to hearing of the accomplishments they make in the coming year.
