President, today I am introducing a bill to right a bureaucratic wrong that has prevented capable and qualified veterans from serving their home States as work-study students in Congressional offices.  For years, veterans have served in the office of their representative or senator as a vital part of an office's constituent service efforts. These student veterans gain employment experience while providing valuable expertise to our offices. Student veterans work together with our staffs to assist other veterans from their home State wade through the often confusing and lengthy process of receiving benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congressional offices benefit by providing better services to their constituents without having to hire a disproportionate number of people to assist with veterans affairs. Veteran work-study students also benefit the VA by shouldering up-front some of the administrative burdens of claims processing.  Congressional offices have served as qualified work sites for VA work-study students for over 25 years. Student veterans have worked in congressional offices during my time in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. In recent months, however, Oregon congressional offices were notified that they would no longer be eligible sites for VA work-study programs.  I am deeply troubled that the proud tradition of student veterans serving fellow veterans in Oregon congressional offices is in jeopardy. At a time when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased the number of veterans seeking our help with VA benefits and services, the instability of the program is particularly unfortunate. Moreover, my concerns are heightened due to the reduction in work-study positions available to Oregon veterans during an economic recession that has sent unemployment rates over 12 percent in some areas.  I share the VA's hope to provide high quality, prompt, and seamless service to veterans and their dependents, through the VA work-study program. That is why I am introducing legislation today to return these talented student veterans to Congressional offices. These student veterans provide an invaluable resource to our staffs. I hope that we are able to pass this legislation quickly to provide valuable employment opportunities for our Nation's veterans.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3082       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXPANSION OF WORK-STUDY ALLOWANCE TO INCLUDE                    CERTAIN OUTREACH SERVICES CONDUCTED THROUGH                    CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES.       Section 3485(a)(4) of title 38, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(G) The following activities carried out at the offices      of Members of Congress for such Members:       ``(i) The distribution of information to members of the      Armed Forces, veterans, and their dependents about the      benefits and services under laws administered by the      Secretary and other appropriate governmental and non-     governmental programs.       ``(ii) The preparation and processing of papers and other      documents, including documents to assist in the preparation      and presentation of claims for benefits under laws      administered by the Secretary.''.                                 ______                                       By
