 President, I rise today to join in the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month and to recognize the many invaluable contributions that have been made by the Hispanic-American community.  For generations, a vibrant Hispanic community has worked tirelessly to enrich and strengthen our Nation.  With ancestors coming to the U.S. from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America, the Hispanic community's rich culture has enhanced the great diversity of the United States.  According to the latest census numbers, there are more than 54 million people of Hispanic heritage living in the United States, including 4 million in Puerto Rico alone.  All across America, a vibrant Hispanic-American community is contributing to all sectors of our economy and is playing a key role as small business entrepreneurs and government leaders on the Federal, State and local levels.  This is especially true in California, my home State, which boasts over 1,000 publicly elected officials of Hispanic heritage. These dedicated public officials serve as Members of the U.S. Congress, the California State Legislature, and hold numerous positions on the city and county levels of government.  This year, I was proud to support the nomination of Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California. Her nomination is historic, as she would be the first Latina judge to serve on that court.  Judge Gonzalez represents an American success story, as her path in life has been extraordinary. Of her parents, her sixteen aunts and uncles, and their children, Judge Gonzalez Rogers is one of only three family members to attend college.  She has been able to rise from modest beginnings to graduate from two of the best universities in the country.  It is my hope that many more young people will follow Judge Gonzalez's journey. That is why I believe it is in America's best interest to give talented young adults who have good moral character and are dedicated to serving the United States the opportunity to succeed. The DREAM Act embodies the values of hard work that make this country great and I will continue to support this important legislation.  I believe it is also important to recognize the 1.1 million Hispanic Americans 18 years or older who are veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. Americans of Hispanic descent have defended and served our country with valor in every conflict since the Revolutionary War.  Forty-one Hispanic Americans have received the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest military award presented by the United States.  I commend our Hispanic-American veterans, as well as those on active duty, who have risked and given their lives for the safety and well-being of our Nation.  It is my hope that more of today's young people, including those of Hispanic heritage, will soon have the opportunity to pursue their dreams of obtaining a higher education degree or serving in the U.S. military.  On the larger front, we must continue to strive towards reforming our broken immigration system, which is crucial to the future success of the Nation's economy.  This country was built by people who risked everything because they believed in the promise and opportunities available in America. Part of the American dream is that anyone with a desire and a will to work can make a life for themselves here.  As the current generation of Hispanic Americans continues to strive to fulfill the American dream, I am pleased to celebrate their past accomplishments as well as their future achievements that will continue to make this country great.                          ____________________
