 President, let me begin by commending the distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, for introducing S. 761, the America COMPETES Act, and bringing it to the floor, along with the minority leader, Senator McConnell, Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, and a number of other Senators in a true spirit of bipartisanship.
