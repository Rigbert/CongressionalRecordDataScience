 President, today Senator Baucus and I are pleased to introduce the Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2006.  Technical Corrections measures are routine for major tax acts, and are necessary to ensure that the provisions of the acts are working consistently with Congressional intent, or to provide clerical corrections. Because these measures carry out Congressional intent, no revenue gain or loss is scored from them.  Technical corrections are derived from a deliberative and consultative process among the Congressional and Administration tax staffs. That means the Republican and Democratic staffs of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees are involved, as is the staff of the Treasury Department. All of this work is performed with the participation and guidance of the non-partisan staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. A technical enters the list only if all staffs agree it is appropriate.  By filing this bill, we hope interested parties and practitioners will comment and provide direction on further edits, additions, or deletions.
