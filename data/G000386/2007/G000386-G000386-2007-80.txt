 President, the ``ExpressLane'' option in the bill clearly requires a State to confirm the citizenship of applicants. I want to make that clear. The ``ExpressLane'' makes sure you have to be a citizen of the United States.  Since some Members clearly are not reading the bill, let me read from those provisions:       Verification of citizenship or Nationality status: The      State shall satisfy the requirements of section 1902(a)      (460)(B) or section 2105(c)(10), as applicable for      verifications of citizenship or nationality status.  I don't know how much more clear it can be, and I hope it puts to rest a very sad mischaracterization of the bill.  To sum up, the bill before us now is an improvement on the bill that passed the Senate. It strengthens the number of provisions that Republicans have been concerned about. I hope with the amendment I am working on with Chairman Baucus, Senator Hatch, Senator Rockefeller, and Members of both parties from the House of Representatives, that we will be able to increase the number of Republicans who vote to support this bill here in the Senate.  I support cloture in the vote just coming up and I ask my colleagues to do it so we can proceed on this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote the same way.  I yield the floor.                             Cloture Motion
