President, if the Senator will yield, I would like to say on behalf of those who didn't support the bankruptcy bill that, in all fairness, I think it was a spirited and a very positive debate, during the course of the debate for over 2 weeks. But that really boiled down to about 6 or 7 days. We entertained 30 amendments to the bankruptcy bill. Not one amendment went on extraordinarily long. Members took a limited amount of time, expressed themselves, debated quickly and thoroughly, and voted.  I hope that we can continue to follow that model. I think, as I have said, we got perilously close to debate in the U.S. Senate, which hardly ever happens around here. I hope that we can continue along those lines in the future.  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I could just say to my friend, I couldn't agree more. I think the debate was handled very nicely. Members got an opportunity to have their say, to get their votes, and the Senate has done itself proud. In spite of the mixed views about the outcome, the Senate did itself proud with the first two bills this year, and I hope it is a good recipe for the future.                          ____________________[Page S2503]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, tomorrow the Senate will be in a period of morning business. As I announced earlier, there will be no rollcall votes during tomorrow's session. The next vote will occur Monday afternoon around 5:30 p.m.  A few moments ago, we completed action on the bankruptcy bill. I want to particularly thank all of our colleagues for the work on the bill and, in particular, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Sessions, and others on both sides of the aisle who have been working on this legislation for, lo, these many years--7 or 8 years, I was told by Senator Biden a while ago.  Next week, we will be considering the budget resolution. We will have long, long evening sessions, and many, many rollcall votes throughout the week.  I ask, on behalf of myself and the majority leader, for Senators to make themselves available throughout the week. And I particularly want to emphasize that next Friday, the end of the week, could be a long day. I want to let all Members know there is an overwhelming likelihood that Friday will be a full day. Members should expect to be here throughout the day next Friday. We will go up into the evening. It will be an unusual Friday. We don't have many of those in the course of a year. But next Friday will be an unusual Friday, and people should make plans accordingly.
