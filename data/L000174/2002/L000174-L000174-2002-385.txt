President, I rise today to commend the Vermont Small Business Development Center, commonly known as the Vermont SBDC, for its impressive first ten years of operation.  In 1992, this new partnership of government, education, and business was established in Vermont to help spur the state's economy. The parties involved were the U.S. Small Business Administration, the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development, the Vermont State Colleges, and Vermont's twelve Regional Development Corporations.  With a staff of five and a lean budget, the SBDC set out to accomplish its statewide mission: to help Vermont small businesses succeed. In its first year of operation, nearly 3,000 hours of free business counseling were provided to 736 clients. The positive impact of SBDC activities in just its first three years of existence is attested to by the attendance of nearly 1,400 people at its small business seminars held around the state in 1995.  Over the past 10 years, the SBDC has provided more than 44,000 hours of counseling to 11,000 clients. Over half were women, and half were new business startups. In addition, over 15,000 Vermonters have attended SBDC business seminars.  Evaluation is a critical component to the SBDC. The annual impact assessment implemented in 1996 measured the economic impact that SBDC clients were having in Vermont. It found that SBDC clients created jobs at twice the rate of other Vermont businesses. It is not surprising that client satisfaction was rated at 97 percent.  In 1998, the Vermont SBDC was recognized by the U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, as the Outstanding National SBDC; a wonderful feat for an organization that accomplishes so much with so little. In fact, last year's economic impact assessment revealed that SBDC clients have led to the addition of over $3.2 million in incremental tax revenues to the Vermont treasury. Considering the current state match contribution of about $300,000, that equates to more than 9 to 1 return on the state's investment.  The impressive achievements of SBDC must be viewed in light of the active role of the various partners that support it. Since its inception, SBDC has been housed at Vermont Technical College, which also provides facilities for workshops and seminars. The SBA provided the initial seed funding and by validating SBCD's effectiveness continues to provide federal funding. The Vermont Agency for Commerce and Community Development provides matching state funds and is an integral partner in the SBDC network. The Agency considers SBDC a primary component of their economic development strategy. The Vermont Regional Development Corporations (RDC) are the local partners which ensure that services are provided uniformly throughout the state. SBDC counselors are housed at the twelve RDC centers around the state.  Leveraging resources and working with other organizations has been the hallmark of the SBDC over the years. Private sector and other external network partners have been absolutely essential for service delivery. The SBDC works with countless external organizations on a daily basis to form a broad delivery and support network. For example, approximately 60 percent of referrals for SBDC counseling and business planning assistance come from the banking community and other lenders.  In the face of potential reduction of funding, clients and friends of the SBDC are coming together to emphasize the benefit and economic contributions of the SBDC. Together, they are sending the message that now is not the time to cut SBDC resources. Rather, a challenging economy is the time to invest in partnerships like the SBDC. At return rates of 9 to 1 it is difficult to justify not providing the funding necessary to maintain the resources needed to meet market need.  Once again, I am proud of the initiative and hard work SBDC has contributed to making our state a national leader among small business development organizations. Small business is truly the backbone of Vermont's business community. And Vermont is an example of how small states can leverage their limited resources for the maximum benefit of their citizens. Over the years, SBDC has found ways to partner with the federal government, the private sector, and higher education to double its available funding, provide free quality services to businesses, help develop businesses and economic independence, and at the same time provide a return on investment that more than pays for the program. I congratulate them on their tenth anniversary.                          ____________________
