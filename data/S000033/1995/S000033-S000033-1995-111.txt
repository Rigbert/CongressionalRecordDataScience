 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My good friend from Wisconsin has got it wrong, and my good friend from Illinois has got it wrong. So-called progress is not necessarily a good thing. It is the function of human beings to determine what is good and what is not good.  Right now one of the reasons that family farmers all over this country are being driven off of the land is the prices that they are receiving are dropping precipitously. The reason their prices are dropping is we have too much milk. If we believe in the importance of the family farm, and I know the people in Vermont do, I know the people in Wisconsin do, and I know the people in America do, then we have a right to say, why are we using a synthetic hormone. And here is where my friend from Illinois is wrong. All of the studies that I have seen suggest that BST makes cows sicker and increases the rate of mastitis. That is not, that is an established fact by many studies. When cows get sicker, farmers are obliged to use more antibiotics.  Nobody here suggested that the milk that comes from those cows is unhealthy. What we are simply saying is, what sense does it make when we already have too much milk to be supporting a product which increases milk production, which makes cows sicker, which drives family farmers off of the land?  Whether we can do anything about that or not, I do now know. But at the very least, we can do two things:  No. 1, $1 million for a study so my friend from Wisconsin will know what the impact of BST has been on his farmers. No. 2, a simple study developed by the FDA so we can have a test to know whether the milk comes from BST cows or does not.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
