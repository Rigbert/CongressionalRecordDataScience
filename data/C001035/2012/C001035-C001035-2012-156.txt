 Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing us to pose a question through the Chair. I hope our colleagues have heard this exchange, this colloquy, which clarifies what appears to be a rather widespread misunderstanding about the reach of this bill. As I said, the 30-day issue is a different issue, a legitimate dispute as to whether that is too aggressive. We have some colleagues who think it should be a 10-day reporting period and an amendment has been filed to implement that. I personally prefer the 90 days in the original bill. I think that is more realistic. But the fact is there is a lot of misinformation and questions regarding what is reported. I appreciate the clarification from the Senator, the chairman of the committee.  At this point I yield to Senator Coburn for the next amendment.
