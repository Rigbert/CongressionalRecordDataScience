President, I will yield all of my remaining time after making one comment. The Senator from Washington suggests that a majority vote is a ``simple thing.'' A majority vote is how we rule in the United States of America. It is the exception which requires a supermajority.  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New Jersey.
