Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H. Res. 194, supporting the goals of International Women's Day, provides us with an opportunity to celebrate the important contributions to all levels of society and social advancement of women around the globe.  I would like to focus my comments on three areas referenced in the resolution on which so much more needs to be done to ensure women and girls worldwide achieve their full potential. One is with respect to the horrible phenomenon, the criminality, of human trafficking. The resolution cites reported estimates that between one and two million women are trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labor, and domestic servitude each year. Some NGO estimates are far higher than that number. Women are robbed of their dignity, fundamental human rights, and forced into bondage and sexual servitude. They are modern-day slaves.  In 2000, I was the prime sponsor of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 which, together with its reauthorizations, including Chairman Berman's legislation reauthorizing the law last year named after the great British parliamentarian William Wilberforce, who stopped the slave trade in London, has made the United States a leader in addressing the egregious human rights violations of trafficking and motivated other countries and governments to do the same. Yet much work remains to be done if we are to eliminate this scourge. Too much demand, enabled by crass indifference, unbridled hedonism and misogynistic attitudes, has turned women and girls into objects, valued only for their utility in the brothel or in the sweatshop. Society has helped perpetuate this heinous crime by failing to utilize all the means at our disposal to combat it.  Legislation that I will soon introduce, along with Don Payne from my own home State of New Jersey, entitled the ``International Megan's Law,'' would address this omission with respect to sex tourism to exploit children. It would seek to protect girls and boys around the world from sexual exploitation by establishing a notification system between governments when a known high-risk sex offender is traveling or intends to travel internationally.  Government representatives from other countries, including Thailand, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Australia, have expressed a desire to cooperate with the United States to address the degrading exploitation that occurs as a result of sex tourism. Girls are the primary victims in this often overlooked form of trafficking.  Another key area in critical need of improvement is that of maternal health. Most of us are familiar with the appalling statistic that in sub-Saharan Africa, the lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 16, compared with 1 in 2,800 in developed countries. It is unacceptable and awful in the extreme that most of these maternal deaths are preventable.                              {time}  1400  During the Africa Subcommittee's hearing about safe blood that I chaired in the 109th Congress, we heard from Dr. Neelam Dhingra of the World Health Organization. Dr. Dhingra informed us that the most common cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa is severe bleeding, which can take the life of even a healthy woman within 2 hours if not properly and immediately treated. She gave us the astonishing statistic that in Africa severe bleeding during delivery or after childbirth contributes to up to 44 percent of maternal deaths, many of which could be prevented simply by having access to safe blood. A sufficient quantity and quality of immediately available and usable blood must become the norm and not the exception. I congratulate Chaka Fattah from Philadelphia, a Member of Congress, for his work in promoting safe blood.  Another unacceptable risk for many women giving birth in the developing world, especially Africa, is obstetric fistula. Fistula, Mr. Speaker, can be treated and repaired through a relatively minor surgical procedure that costs, on average, $150 per surgery. Still, large numbers of women, an estimated 2 million, endure tremendous pain and numbing isolation that comes from being the walking wounded, incontinent and ostracized, and not able to get to a hospital--like the famous hospital in Addis, which performs these wonderful interventions. I visited that hospital and saw dozens of women who got fistula repair, and the smiles on their faces were amazing. With just a small investment of health care dollars, the lives of women throughout Africa could be dramatically changed.  Helping mothers and helping babies goes hand in hand, Mr. Speaker. There is no dichotomy. When women receive proper prenatal and maternal health care, they are less likely to die in childbirth, and when unborn babies are healthy in the womb, they emerge as healthier, stronger newborns.  Birth is not the beginning of life, it is merely an event in the baby's life that began at fertilization. Life is a continuum with many stages. I believe, Mr. Speaker, human rights should be respected from womb to tomb, and that no violence is acceptable against anyone, regardless of age, race, religion, gender, disability, or condition of dependency. We need to recognize this biological fact in policy, funding and programs, and treat both mother and baby, including the unborn child, as two patients in need of respect, love and tangible assistance. We need to affirm them both.  I would like to conclude by raising the plight of women, and especially the girl child, who suffer from the coercive population control agenda of the Chinese Government.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, I was blocked from offering two pro-life, pro-child, pro-women amendments to the huge $410 billion omnibus. One of those amendments would have restored the Kemp-Kasten policy for all organizations, including the U.N. Population Fund, if they had been found to be involved with coercive population control.  I held 26 hearings, Mr. Speaker, on human rights in China when I was the chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee and met with numerous women during frequent human rights missions to China. There is no doubt that the U.N. Population Fund has supported, co-managed, and whitewashed the most pervasive crimes against women in all of human history.  China's one-child-per-couple policy relies on pervasive coerced abortion, involuntary sterilization, ruinous fines in the amounts of up to ten times the salary of both parents, imprisonment, and job loss or a demotion to achieve its quotas. In China today, brothers and sisters are illegal. Women are told when and if they can have the one child permitted by law. And rather than showing compassion and tangible assistance to unwed mothers, unwed moms, even if it's their first baby, are forcibly aborted. Let me say that again. There are no unwed moms in China, they are all forcibly aborted.  Women are severely harmed emotionally, psychologically and physically. Chinese women are violated by the state. The suicide rate for Chinese women is about 500 per day, according to the most recent Human Rights Report from the Department of State--it just came out 2 weeks ago--and that number far exceeds any other number.  Then there are the missing girls, upwards of 100 million girls missing in China as a direct result of sex selection abortions. This gendercide is a direct result of the one-child-per-couple policy combined with a preference for boys. That human rights abuse has to be made much more visible. The Chinese Government has to take corrective action. And all of us have to do our part to stop this gendercide of young girls, of little girls.  I urge unanimous support for H. Res. 194. It is an excellent resolution.
