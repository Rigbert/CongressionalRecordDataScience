I spoke to this issue before his arrival on the floor, and I will not belabor the point. I will say, for colleagues who are wondering what role the smaller states play, Senator Gorton and I coauthored two amendments. My amendment asks that the Baltic States and Romania be considered in terms of funds for preparation to be part of NATO. The amendment then, coauthored by the Senator and myself and presently pending before the Senate, says--and I think this is important--``upon satisfying the criteria for NATO membership, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be invited to become full members . . .'' So it is a two-step process.  I think both amendments are consistent, coauthored by the same two Senators, because we believe that given the funds, given the opportunity, the Baltic States, Romania, and perhaps Bulgaria added by amendment, could certainly then apply as eligible for membership.  I join with my colleague from Washington in saying that at this moment I hope the United States will lead the way in saying that the Baltic States, subjugated to Soviet tyranny for half a century, would have that moment they are praying for, full membership in NATO.  I thank the Senator for yielding and including me in this important amendment.
