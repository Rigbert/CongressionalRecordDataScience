 President, I want to announce to the Senate--a lot of Senators probably kept up with it over the evening's time--we have made considerable progress on the Transportation appropriations bill, and we are at that point in time--Senator Lautenberg and I and our staffs have been conferring with the majority leader and Democratic leader--if there is anyone who has an amendment they want to offer, they ought to come down and offer it so we can move on. We are nearly to the point--not quite--where we would like to go to third reading of the bill. So this should serve as a friendly notice that if you have an amendment, come down and pursue it or call us and let us know if you are going to do something else with it later.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
