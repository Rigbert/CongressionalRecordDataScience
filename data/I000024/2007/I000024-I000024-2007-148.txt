We need to raise awareness of Huntington's disease, which is a progressive degenerative neurological disease that causes total physical and mental deterioration over a 12-15 year period. Though Huntington's disease typically begins in midlife, between the ages of 30 and 45, onset may occur as early as the age of 2. The average lifespan after onset of Huntington's disease is 10 to 20 years. The younger a person contracts the disease, the more rapid the progression. Additionally, children who develop the juvenile form of the disease rarely live to adulthood, and a child of a Huntington's disease parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the Huntington's disease gene.  Since the discovery of the gene that causes Huntington's disease in 1993, the pace of Huntington's disease research has accelerated. Although scientists and researchers are hopeful that breakthroughs are forthcoming, no cures for this disease currently exist.  The need for heightened awareness of Huntington's disease was brought to my attention by constituents who suffer from this disease. For the benefit of these individuals and for the well-being of sufferers in your own State and around the Nation, I ask you to join me in this effort to raise awareness of Huntington's disease.
