 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 976, the Jamestown 400th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2004.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,          U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 976, the Jamestown      400th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act of 2003.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew      Pickford.           Sincerely,                                               Elizabeth Robinson,                              (For Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Director).       Enclosure.     S. 976--Jamestown 400th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act of          2003       Summary: S. 976 would direct the U.S. Mint to produce a $5      gold coin and a $1 silver coin in calendar year 2007 to      commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of      Jamestown, Virginia. The bill would specify a surcharge on      the sales price of $35 for the gold coin and $10 for the      silver coin and would designate the Jamestown-Yorktown      Foundation (an educational institution of the Commonwealth of      Virginia), the National Park Service, and the Association for      the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (a private nonprofit      association), as recipients of the income from those      surcharges.       CBO estimates that enacting S. 976 would have no      significant net impact on direct spending over the 2004-2009      period. S. 976 contains no intergovernmental or private-     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform      Act (UMRA), and would benefit the Commonwealth of Virginia.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: S. 976 could      raise as much as $8.5 million in surcharges if the Mint sells      the maximum number of authorized coins. Recent commemorative      coin sales by the Mint suggest, however, that receipts would      be about $3 million. The legislation would require the Mint      to produce the $1 silver coin from silver available in the      National Defense Stockpile. Based on information provided by      the Defense Logistics Agency and the Mint, no silver is      available in the stockpile. Hence, CBO estimates that      receipts from only the $5 gold coin would be about $1.25      million.       Under current law, only two commemorative coins may be      minted and issued in any calendar year and the Mint must      ensure that it will not lose money on a commemorative coin      program before transferring any surcharges to a designated      recipient organization. CBO expects that the Mint would      collect most of those surcharges in fiscal year 2007 and      would transfer collections to the designated recipients in      fiscal year 2008.       In addition, CBO expects that the Mint would use gold      obtained from the reserves held at the Treasury to produce      the gold coin. Because the budget treats the sale of gold as      a means of financing governmental operations--that is, the      Treasury's receipts from such sales do not affect the size of      the deficit--CBO has not included such receipts in this      estimate. CBO estimates that S. 976 would provide the federal      government with about $3.5 million in additional cash (in      exchange for gold) for financing the federal deficit in      fiscal year 2007.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 976      contains no intergovernmental     or private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA, and would      benefit the Commonwealth of Virginia.       Previous CBO estimate: On March 22, 2004, CBO transmitted a      cost estimate for H.R. 1914, the Jamestown 400th Anniversary      Commemorative Coin Act of 2003, as ordered reported by the      House Committee on Financial Services on March 17, 2004. The      two pieces of legislation are similar and our cost estimates      are the same; however, H.R. 1914 would not require the Mint      to use silver from the National Defense Stockpile to produce      the $1 silver coin.       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Matthew Pickford;      Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Sarah Puro;      and Impact on the Private Sector: Paige Piper/Bach.       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005
