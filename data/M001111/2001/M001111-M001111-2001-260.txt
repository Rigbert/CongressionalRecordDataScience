 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to help rural and underserved communities across the country get connected to the information economy.  Today I am introducing the Community Telecommunication Planning Act of 2001. I am proud to have Senators Boxer, Landrieu, Kennedy, Cantwell, and Schumer as original cosponsors. This bill will give small and rural communities a new tool to attract high speed services and economic development.  I am especially proud at how this legislation came about. Since last year, I've been working with a group of community leaders in Washington State to find ways to help communities get connected to advanced telecommunications services.  I want to take a moment to thank the members of my Rural Telecommunication Working Group for their hard work on this bill. The members include: Brent Bahrenburg, Gregg Caudell, Dee Christensen, Dave Danner, Louis Fox, Tami Garrow, Larry Hall, Rod Fleck, Ray King, Dale King, Terry Lawhead, Dick Llarman, Jim Miller, Joe Poire, Skye Richendrfer, JimSchmit, Fred Sexton, Ted Sprague, Barbara Tilly, Terry Vann, Ron Yenney.  We met as a working group, and we held forums around the State that attracted hundreds of people. We've tapped the ideas of experts, service providers and people from across the State who are working to get their communities connected. The result in this legislation, which I am proud to say is part of Washington State's contribution to our national effort to wire all parts of our country.  This bill addresses a real need in many communities. While urban and suburban areas have strong competition between telecommunications providers, many small and rural communities are far removed from the services they need. We must ensure that all communities have access to advanced telecommunications like high speed internet access. Just as yesterday's infrastructure was built of roads and bridges, today our infrastructure includes advanced telecom services. Advanced telecommunications can enrich our lives through activities like distance-learning, and they can even save lives through efforts like telemedicine. The key is access. Access to these services is already turning some small companies in rural communities into international marketers of goods and services.  Unfortunately, many small and rural communities are having trouble getting the access they need. Before areas can take advantage of some of the help and incentives that are out there, they need to work together and go through a community planning process. Community plans identify the needs and level of demand, create a vision for the future, and show what all the players must do to meet the telecom needs of their community for today and tomorrow. These plans take resources to develop. This bill would provide those funds.  Providers say they're more likely to invest in an area if it has a plan that makes a business case for the costly infrastructure investment. Communities want to provide them with that plan, but they need help developing it. Unfortunately, many communities get stuck on that first step. They don't have the resources to do the studies and planning required to attract service. So the members of my Working Group came up with a solution: have the federal government provide competitive grants that local communities can use to develop their plans. I took that idea and put it into this bill.  When you think about it, it just makes sense. Right now the federal government already provides money to help communities plan other infrastructure improvements--everything from roads and bridges to wastewater facilities. The bill would provide rural and underserved communities with grant money for creating community plans, technical assessments and other analytical work that needs to be done.  With these grants, communities will be able to turn their desire for access into real access that can improve their communities and strengthen their economies. This bill can open the door for thousands of small and rural areas across our state to tap the potential of the information economy. I urge the Senate to support this bill and I look forward to working with my colleagues to see it passed.                                 ______                                       By
