 President, I come to the floor to support the Schumer amendment to the Defense bill regarding the development of an Iraqi police force. This is an urgent amendment--one of the most important Iraq-related amendments we have considered on the defense bill.  The Schumer amendment will focus the administration's attention on the domestic security issue in Iraq that threatens American servicemen and women, other Americans and foreigners now in Iraq, and the Iraqi people.  One of the reasons we went to war in Iraq was to liberate the Iraqi people. The military campaign was named, ``Operation Iraqi Freedom.'' Again and again, from the President on down, we have been told that we acted on behalf of the Iraqi people.  We all witnessed the scenes of jubilation at the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. Time and again, the administration has told us that we have restored freedom to the Iraqi people.  We all hope this is ultimately true. But the truth today is very different for women in Iraq and particularly in Baghdad.  Yeserday, Human Rights Watch released a report detailing reports of rape, assault, and kidnapping of women and girls in Baghdad. The report cites 25 credible allegations of rape and abduction since the fall of Saddam Hussein. It is believed that the number of rapes and sexual assaults in Baghdad is far higher. Women are discouraged from reporting the crime and face social isolation and even ``honor killings'' by other family members for being violently victimized.  Yesterday's New York Times contains a disturbing article about the dangers confronting women in Baghdad. I ask unanimous consent to have the article, ``Rape (And the Silence About It) Haunts Baghdad,'' printed in the Record.                [From the New York Times, July 16, 2003]               Rape (and Silence About It) Haunts Baghdad                          (By Neela Banerjee)       Baghdad, Iraq, July 15.--In her loose black dress, gold      hairband and purple flip-flops, Sanariya hops from seat to      seat in her living     room like any lively 9-year-old. She likes to read. She wants      to be a teacher when she grows up, and she says Michael, her      white teddy bear, will be her assistant.       But at night, the memory of being raped by a stranger seven      weeks ago pulls her into its undertow. She grows feverish and      has nightmares, her 28-year-old sister, Fatin, said. She      cries, ``Let me go!'' ``I am afraid of the gangsters,''      Sanariya whispered in the twilight of her hallway. ``I feel      like they are killing me in my nightmares. Every day, I have      these nightmares.''       Since the end of the war and outbreak of anarchy on the      capital's streets, women here have grown increasingly afraid      of being abducted and raped. Rumors swirl, especially in a      country where rape is so rarely reported.       The breakdown of the Iraqi government after the war makes      any crime hard to quantify. But the incidence of rape and      abduction in particular seems to have increased, according to      discussions with physicians, law-enforcement officials and      families involved. A new report by Human Rights Watch based      on more than 70 interviews with law-enforcement officials,      victims and their families, medical personnel and members of      the coalition authority found 25 credible reports of      abduction and sexual violence since the war. Baghdadis      believe there are far more, and fear is limiting women's role      in the capital's economic, social and political life just as      Iraq tires to rise from the ashes, the report notes.       For most Iraqi victims of abduction and rape, getting      medical and police assistance is a humiliating process.      Deeply traditional notions of honor foster a sense of shame      so strong that many families offer no consolation or support      for victims, only blame. Sanariya's four brothers and parents      beat her daily, Fatin said, picking up a bamboo slat her      father uses. The city morgue gets corpses of women who were      murdered by their relatives in so-called honor killings after      they returned from an abduction--even, in some cases, when      they had not been raped, said Nidal Hussein, a morgue nurse.       ``For a woman's family, all this is worse than death,''      said Dr. Khulud Younis, a gynecologist at the Alwiyah Women's      Hospital. ``They will face shame. If a woman has a sister,      her future will be gone. These women don't deserve to be      treated like this.''       It is not uncommon in Baghdad to see lines of cars outside      girls' schools. So fearful are parents that their daughters      will be taken away that they refuse to simply drop them off;      they or a relative will stay outside all day to make sure      nothing happens.       ``Women and girls today in Baghdad are scared, and many are      not going to schools or jobs or looking for work,'' said      Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle east and      North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. ``If Iraqi women      are to participate in postwar society, their physical      security needs to be an urgent priority.''       Beyda Jafar Sadiq, 17, made the simple decision to go to      school on the morning of May 22 and never returned. Her      family has been looking for her ever since. They have      appealed to every international nongovernmental organization,      the Iraqi police and the American authorities. Her eldest      brother, Feras, 29, has crisscrossed the country, visiting      the morgue in Basra in the south, traveling to Amara and      Nasiriya on reports from acquaintances that they saw a girl      who looked like Beyda. ``I just want to find her,'' said      Beyda's mother, Zakiya Abd, her eyes swollen with grief.      ``Whether she's alive or dead, I jut want to find her.       Some police in Baghdad concede that at this point, there is      little they can do to help. Their precinct houses were      thoroughly looted after the war. Despite promises from the      American authorities, Baghdad police still lack uniforms      weapons, communications and computer equipment and patrol      cars. ``We used to patrol all the time before the war,'' said      a senior officer at the Aadimiya precinct house. ``Now,      nothing, and the criminals realize their is no security on      the streets.''       The Human Rights Watch report alleges that sometimes when      women try to report a rape or families ask for help in      finding abducted women, they are turned away by Iraqi police      officers indifferent to the crimes. Some law-enforcement      officials insist abduction and rape have not increased, while      other officials and many medical personnel disagree. Bernard      R. Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner and now      an adviser to the Interior Ministry, told of recently firing      a precinct chief when he learned that the official had failed      to pursue a family's report of their missing 16-year-old      daughter. ``The biggest part of the issue is a culture that      precludes people from reporting,'' Mr. Kerik said. ``It      encourages people not to report.''       If an Iraqi woman wants to report a rape, she has to travel      a bureaucratic odyssey. She first has to go to the police for      documents that permit her to get a forensic test. That test      is performed only at he city morgue. The police take a      picture of the victim and stamp it and then stamp her arm.      That is so no one else goes in her place and says that she      was raped, that she lost her virginity,'' said Ms. Hussein,      the nurse. At the morgue, a committee of three male doctors      performs a gynecological examination on the victim to      determine if there was sexual abuse. The doctors are      available only from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. If a victim      arrives at any other time, she has to return the next day,      without washing away any physical evidence. Hospitals can      check victims only for broader trauma, like contusions and      broken bones.       Dr. Younis said she had seen more rape cases in the months      after the war than before. Yet even when women come to the      hospital with injuries that are consistent with rape, they      often insist something else happened. A 60-year-old woman      asserted that she had been hit by a car. The mother of a 6-     year-old girl begged the doctor to write a report saying that      her daughter's hymen had been ruptured because she fell on a      sharp object, a common lie families tell in the case of rape,      Dr. Younis said. Shame and fear compel the lies, Dr. Younis      said. ``A woman's father or brother, they feel it is their      duty to kill her'' if she has been raped, Dr. Younis said.      ``It is the tribal law. They will get only six months      in prison and then they are out.''       Sanariya's family took her to a doctor three days after her      attack only because the bleeding had not stopped. She had      been sitting on the stairs at about 4 p.m. on May 22 when an      armed man dragged her into an abandoned building next door.      He shot at neighbors who tried to help the girl. He fled when      she began screaming during the assault.       Her mother refuses to let her outside now to play. Fatin      lied to her family and said an operation had been done to      restore Sanariya's hymen. But when her eldest brother, Ahmed,      found out otherwise, he wanted to kill Sanariya, Fatin said.       Out of earshot of her family, Sanariya said she feels no      better now, two months after the attack. ``I don't sleep at      night,'' she said in the hallway. ``I don't sleep.''
