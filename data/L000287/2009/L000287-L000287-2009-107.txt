Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, at long last we will do what is right for our Nation's poorest children. Today we will expand SCHIP to 4 million more children. We have a mission, an obligation and a mandate to provide health insurance for all Americans and now we have a Congress and a President who will meet that obligation for our children.  It has taken too long. This Nation has been wrong to choose war and greed over children and health. Children need our help. They have a right to health care.  Today we will do what is right and pass this expansion of SCHIP.
