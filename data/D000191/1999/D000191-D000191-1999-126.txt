Chairman, I thank the gentleman for that, but we always reserve the power, and I have come to this floor many times to question precipitous deployment without lawful consultation with Congress and without an authorization of Congress. I have gone so far as to sue past Presidents over this issue, but we were denied standing in the courts.  So in this case, as my colleagues know, I believe that we would be given that opportunity. We can certainly grasp that opportunity by staying in town and going into session the moment we hear the accords have been signed, and then framing a resolution that properly addresses the concerns around those accords. That is the way we should proceed. So we are being given a pretty crummy choice here tonight, which is to undermine the peace negotiations by voting no or vote yes on something when we do not fully absolutely 100 percent understand the conditions and terms.  Mr. Chairman, I wish that the leadership on the other side would reconsider perhaps, pull the bill, keep us in town and take up this issue when it is more timely.
