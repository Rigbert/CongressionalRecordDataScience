  Dr. Yellen has dedicated her life to understanding the complex and evolving field of economics, and her background makes her an ideal candidate to replace Chairman Ben Bernanke and continue the Fed's efforts to boost economic growth, increase the pace of job creation, and ulitimately reduce the crushing unemployment that has been a drag on our recovery.  Dr. Yellen's academic credentials and experience in economics are first rate.  She graduated suma cum laude from Brown University in 1967 and later earned a doctorate in economics from Yale University in 1971.  She began her teaching career as an assistant professor at Harvard University, where she taught from 1971 to 1976.  In 1977 and 1978 she began her public service as an economist at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  In 1980, Dr. Yellen headed west to my home State of California to become an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, She rose to professor emeritus of business and economics and was twice awarded teacher of the year at Berkeley's distinguished Haas School of Business.  During her time at Berkeley and elsewhere, Dr. Yellen published numerous research works, including the well-regarded ``Waiting for Work,'' a comprehensive study of unemployment she completed with her husband, the economist George Akerlof.  Dr. Yellen's research has been published in the Journal of Economics, Business Economics, and the Brookings Papers on Economic Policy, amongst others.  Her research has primarily focused on unemployment, monetary policy, and international trade--a perspective that will be vitally important as the Fed works to solve the complex issues facing the global economy.  In 1997, she left the Federal Reserve to chair the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration.  Before her appointment to Vice Chairman of the Fed she led the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, keeping watch over financial conditions in the region as well as providing counsel on the direction of monetary policy.  In 2010, she was appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to be Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve where she has ably served. She has been intimately involved with the Fed's interest rate policy and its continuation of the unprecedented program of quantitative easing.  I believe that this extensive experience working on monetary policy issues at the Federal Reserve will make for a seamless transition to Chairman and provide stability to financial markets.  Recently, a lot of attention is being paid to the issue of growing income inequality in our country.  Over the last few decades, middle-class incomes have stagnated while incomes for high earners have enjoyed a stratospheric rise. Increasingly, the owners of capital are reaping a greater and greater share of the profits, while hard working Americans struggle to keep up.  If this trend continues, it will make for a more volatile economy and put middle and lower income families in increasing financial strain.  Most importantly, if income inequality is really a product of inequality of opportunity, then the United States will no longer deliver on its most fundamental promise, one that serves as the foundation for our social contract.  To me, that outcome is unacceptable, and our leading economic thinkers should be working night and day to ensure that every hard-working American has the opportunity to be successful in this country.  The most direct way to address income inequality is to increase the rate of job creation in the United States. We have made significant progress in the recovery from the great recession, but the recovery has not been robust enough to translate into a robust labor market which increases wages for all Americans.  Dr. Yellen has demonstrated a consistent ability to balance the Fed's mission of increasing employment and maintaining stable inflation. Her academic work suggests that she is keenly aware of the devastating impact of persistently high unemployment, both for families and the economy writ large.  With her keen understanding of economics and a rigorous analytical process and a distinguished career in academia, Dr. Yellen is the right person to lead the Fed at this time.  And let me just say, a woman as Chairman of the Federal Reserve--a talented and extraordinarily well qualified woman--is a positive thing.  I enthusiastically support her nomination, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.                          ____________________
