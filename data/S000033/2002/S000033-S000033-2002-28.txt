 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, the American middle class is getting angry. At a time when the richest 1 percent of the population already owns more wealth than the bottom 95 percent, what we are seeing is the CEOs of large corporations who contribute huge sums of money into the political process giving themselves giant compensation packages worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and then they cut back on the wages and health benefits of their workers. These CEOs take tax breaks from the government, corporate welfare, and they move our jobs to China. They are setting up offshore accounts in Bermuda so they do not have to pay any taxes into our government. They are cooking their books through Arthur Andersen and others so they do not have to pay their fair share of taxes.  What this whole bill is about is nothing more than absolute greed. The richest people in this country, who hold $25,000-a-plate fund-raising dinners here in Washington, they are saying to Congressmen, ``Give us huge tax breaks. We do not care about veterans, who now are wait-listed when they need to get into the VA health system. Forget about them. We need giant tax breaks.''  Let us blow up Social Security. Let us forget about the elderly people, who cannot find doctors who will treat them through Medicare or Medicaid. Let us not worry about the middle class, who cannot afford college education because the Federal Government has not kept pace in financial aid in those programs.  What we are looking about now is ugliness, is greed, is the richest people in this country, who already own so much of this Nation, saying to Congress, give us more, give us more, give us more. Forget about the middle class, forget about working families, forget about the poor.  Mr. Speaker, I am strongly opposed to the Republican proposal.
