 President, I am introducing a private relief bill that provides permanent residency to Oleg Rasulyevich Rafikova, Alfia Fanilevna Rafikova, and their children, Evgenia Olegovna Rafikova and Ruslan Khamitovich Yagudin, who without this legislation, would have to return to Russia and face possible threats of blackmail and kidnaping.  The Rafikova family came to the United States on August 28, 1997, from Ufa, Russia, on a visitor's visa to receive their inheritance from Alfia's uncle, the famous ballet dancer, Rudolf Nureyev. Rafikova's now fear returning to their home country because they fear that the local Mafia would try to extort their inheritance from them.  According to Alfia, everything changed for the family in Ufa, Russia, when the local media announced the death of her uncle, Rudolf Nureyev and exaggerated the amount of her inheritance and falsely made assertions that the family already had the money. Alfia claims that she and her husband started getting harassing phone calls, threats of kidnaping their children for ransom, and death threats. The events escalated to a day when they were robbed of everything except the clothes they were wearing.  Alfia's inheritance is substantial enough that she and her family will not be a public charge. In fact, Alfia and her husband Oleg, who is a chef by training, would like to start a restaurant in San Francisco, providing jobs for Americans. Alfia's two children are attending school in San Francisco and look forward to the day theycould call the United States their new home.  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation so we can give the Rafikova family a chance to restart their life in the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 273       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
