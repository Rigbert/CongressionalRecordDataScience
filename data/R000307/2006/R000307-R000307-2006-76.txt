President, today I rise to honor the great life and many artistic contributions of Kansas native Gordon Parks who died Tuesday at the age of 93.  Through his poetry, books, music and photography, Mr. Parks showed America a truth about its society and challenged all of us to make the country a better place.  Born in Fort Scott, KS, in 1912, Mr. Parks's family faced both poverty and discrimination. Yet in spite of these challenges--and inspired by these challenges--Mr. Parks rose to the heights of success through his largely self-taught artistic ability. He found his life experiences helped shape his art as he chronicled the African-American experience.  In 1937, Mr. Parks bought his first camera. By 1948, he was hired at Life Magazine. There, he earned his reputation as a humanitarian photojournalist capturing images of the civil rights movement and of the poverty in America and abroad. Through his photographs he reminded Americans of the harsh realities present in our culture.  In 1968, he directed the movie version of his childhood memoir, ``The Learning Tree.'' His direction of ``The Learning Tree'' also marked the first time an African American directed a major Hollywood production. He won an Emmy for his documentary ``Diary of a Harlem Family,'' and in 1971 directed the critically acclaimed movie ``Shaft.'' He is also known for composing the musical score for ``Martin,'' a ballet documenting the life of civil rights pioneer Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1970, he helped found Essence magazine.  Kansas is forever grateful for his talents. In 1986, he was named Kansan of the Year. In 1999, Kansas City opened the Gordon Parks Elementary School. And most recently, in February, the University of Kansas's William Allen White Foundation honored Mr. Parks with its National Citation for journalistic merit.  Mr. Parks showed unrelenting spirit in his work. His civil rights contributions, as told through his art will go unmatched. Today, we proudly honor a remarkable artist and pioneer for all he did for Kansas and the Nation.                           ____________________
