Speaker, I would like to commend the Latin American Community Alliance for Support and Assistance of Northwest Indiana, Inc. [LACASA], its board of directors, and its administrator, Ms. June Long, on LACASA's first annual fundraiser dinner. LACASA, whose office is located in Gary, IN, will hold this monumental event on Saturday, September 28, 1996, at the Patio Restaurant in Merrillville, IN.  The LACASA Board of Directors Officers include: Mrs. Aida Padilla, president and director of the Senior Companion Program; Mrs. Julie Tanis, vice president and public school teacher; Mr. Joaquin Rodriguez, secretary and community advocate; and Mr. Ray Acevedo, treasurer and photographer. Members of the board of directors include: Mrs. Bertha Cardenas, Mrs. Hortencia Hernandez, Mrs. Maria Magana, Mrs. Socorro Roman, Mr. Roeman Whitesell, Ms. Jeannette Hinton Padgett, Ms. Maria Vasquez, Mr. Martin Valtierra, Mr. Ben Luna, Mrs. Maria Lopez, Mrs. Mary Jean Maloney, and Ms. Finis Springer.  LACASA, which was organized in 1994, is dedicated to serving the Hispanic residents of northwest Indiana who experience difficulty in obtaining needed social and educational services. It serves northwest Indiana's Hispanic residents, who comprise 52 percent of the total population in this area, with quality services to meet their special needs.  Special programs that LACASA offers are: adult education, offered at various levels from basic adult education to preparation for the high school equivalency test; Head Start, which provides parenting skills training and an opportunity for parents to become empowered in the education of their children; and Access Assistance, which includes a food pantry, learning job search skills, and youth personal leadership and high school preparation instruction.  While LACASA already provides several beneficial services, it has plans to continue to improve the quality of life for northwest Indiana's Hispanic population. For those in need, LACASA hopes to provide transportation services to its programs, as well as agencies where its clients are referred. It would also like to offer tutoring services for Hispanic youth and establish health stations in an effort to assist Hispanic families in understanding their basic health needs and inform them about how to access the existing health care system. Finally, LACASA hopes to expand its services to the elderly, by familiarizing them with in-home care options to prevent unnecessary institutionalization.  LACASA is funded and receives support from the city of Gary-Community Development Block Grant, Lake Area United Way, Health and Human Services-ACYF, Gary Community School Corp., National Hispanic Institute, U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, Indiana Literacy Foundation, and Kankakee Workforce Development Services.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending LACASA. This fine organization should be congratulated on its continuing efforts to preserve the Hispanic culture, while at the same time improving the quality of life for the Hispanic residents of Indiana's First Congressional District. May their first annual fundraiser be a successful and joyous event.                          ____________________
