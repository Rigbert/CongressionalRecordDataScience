 President, Senator Helms and I are proud to introduce today the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002. Senator Helms is recovering from his heart surgery and is unable to be here today, but let me note our joint efforts in recognizing the importance of disease surveillance and preparing this bill for introduction. In recent years, we have joined forces on a number of sensible foreign policy initiatives and I am proud that we are doing so once again. I am also especially pleased that Senators Kennedy and Frist, the chairman and ranking member of the Public Health Subcommittee of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, have also agreed to be original cosponsors of this bill.  This bill authorizes $150 million over the next 2 years to provide assistance to developing nations to improve global disease surveillance to help prevent and contain both biological weapons attacks and naturally occurring infectious disease outbreaks around the world. As the ranking member and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, respectively, Senator Helms and I recognize all too well that biological weapons are a global threat with no respect for borders. A terrorist group could launch a biological weapons attack in Mexico in the expectation that the epidemic would quickly spread to the United States. A rogue state might experiment with new disease strains in another country, intending later to release them here. A biological weapons threat need not begin in the United States to reach our shores.  For that reason, our response to the biological weapons threat cannot be limited to the United States alone. Global disease surveillance, a systematic approach to tracking disease outbreaks as they occur and evolve around the world, is essential to any real international response.  This country is making enormous advances on the domestic front in bioterrorism defense. $3 billion has been appropriated for this purpose in FY 2002, including $1.1 billion to improve State and local public health infrastructure. Delaware's share will include $6.7 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve the public health infrastructure and $548,000 to improve hospital readiness in my State.  The House and Senate are currently in conference to reconcile competing versions of a comprehensive bioterrorism bill drafted last fall following the anthrax attacks via the U.S. postal system. Those attacks, which killed five individuals and infected more than twenty people, highlighted our domestic vulnerabilities to a biological weapons attack. We need to further strengthen our Nation's public health system, improve Federal public health laboratories, and fund the necessary research and procurement for vaccines and treatments to respond better to future bioterrorist attacks. As an original co-sponsor of the Senate bill, I know the final package taking shape in conference will achieve those goals and I look forward to its enactment into law.  Nevertheless, any effective response to the challenge of biological weapons must also have an international component. Limiting our response to U.S. territory would be shortsighted and doomed to failure. A dangerous pathogen released on another continent can quickly spread to the United States in a matter of days, if not hours. This is the dark side of globalization. International trade, travel, and migration patterns offer unlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across national borders and to move from one continent to another. Moreover, an overseas epidemic could give us our first warning of a new disease strain that was developed by a country or by terrorists for use as a biological weapon, or that could be used by others for that purpose.  We should make no mistake: in today's world, all infectious disease epidemics, wherever they occur and whether they are deliberately engineered or are naturally occurring, are a potential threat to all nations, including the United States.  How does disease surveillance fit into all of this? A biological weapons attack succeeds partly through the element of surprise. As Dr. Alan P. Zelicoff of the Sandia National Laboratory testified before the Foreign Relations Committee in March, early warning of a biological weapons attact can prevent illness and death in all but a small fraction of those infected. A cluster of flu-like symptoms in a city or region may be dismissed by individual physicians as just the flu when in fact it may be anthrax, plague, or another biological weapon. Armed with the knowledge, however, that a biological weapons attack has in fact occurred, doctors and nurses can examine their patients in a different light and, in many cases, effectively treat infected individuals.  Disease surveillance, a comprehensive reporting system to quickly identify and communicate abnormal patterns of symptoms and illnesses, can quickly alert doctors across a region that a suspicious disease outbreak has occurred. Epidemiological specialists can then investigate and combat the outbreak. And if it's a new disease or strain, we can begin to develop treatments that much earlier.  A good surveillance system requires trained epidemiological personnel, adequate laboratory tools for quick diagnosis, and communications equipment to circulate information. Even in the United States today, many States and localities rely on old-fashioned pencil and paper methods of tracking disease patterns. Thankfully, we are addressing those domestic deficiencies through the bioterrorism bill in conference.  For example, in Delaware, we are developing the first, comprehensive, state-wide electronic reporting system for infectious diseases. This system will be used as a prototype for other states, and will enable much earlier detection of infectious disease outbreaks, both natural and bioterrorist. I and my congressional colleagues in the delegation have been working for over two years to get this project up and running, and we were successful in obtaining $2.6 million in funding for thisproject over the past 2 years. I and my colleagues have requested $1.4 million for additional funding in FY 2003, and we are extremely optimistic that this funding will be forthcoming.  It is vitally important that we extend these initiatives into the international arena. However, as many developing countries are way behind us in terms of public health resources, laboratories, personnel, and communications, these countries will need help just to get to the starting point we have already reached in this country.  An effective disease surveillance system is beneficial even in the absence of biological weapons attacks. Bubonic plague is bubonic plague, whether it is deliberately engineered or naturally occurring. Just as disease surveillance can help contain a biological weapons attack, it can also help contain a naturally occurring outbreak of infectious disease. According to the World Health Organization, 30 new infectious diseases have emerged over the past thirty years; between 1996 and 2001 alone, more than 800 infectious disease outbreaks occurred around the world, on every continent. With better surveillance, we can do a better job of mitigating the consequences of these disease outbreaks.  In 2000, the World Health Organization established the first truly global disease surveillance system, the Global Alert and Response Network, to monitor and track infectious disease outbreaks in every region of the world. The WHO has done an impressive job so far with this initiative, working on a shoestring budget. But this global network is only as good as its components, individual nations. Unfortunately, developing nations, those nations most likely to experience rapid disease outbreaks, simply do not possess the trained personnel, the laboratory equipment, or the public health infrastructure to track evolving disease patterns and detect emerging pathogens.  According to a report by the National Intelligence Council, developing nations in Africa and Asia have established only rudimentary systems, if any at all, for disease surveillance, response, and prevention. The World Health Organization reports that more than sixty percent of laboratory equipment in developing countries is either outdated or non-functioning.  This lack of preparedness can lead to tragic results. In August 1994 in Surat, a city in western India, a surge of complaints on flea infestation and a growing rat population was followed by a cluster of reports on patients exhibiting the symptoms of pneumonic plague. However, authorities were unable to connect the dots until the plague had spread to seven states across India, ultimately killing 56 people and costing the Indian economy $600 million. Had the Indian authorities employed better surveillance tools, they may well have contained the epidemic, limited the loss of life, and surely avoided the panic that led to economically disastrous embargoes on trade and travel. An outbreak of pneumonic plague in India this February was detected more quickly and contained with only a few deaths, and no costly panic.  Developing nations are the weak links in any comprehensive global disease surveillance network. Unless we take action to shore up their capabilities to detect and contain disease outbreaks, we leave the entire world vulnerable to a deliberate biological weapons attack or a virulent natural epidemic.  It is for these reasons that Senator Helms and I have worked together in recent months to craft the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002. This bill will authorize $150 million in FY 2003 and FY 2004 to strengthen the disease surveillance capabilities of developing nations. First, the bill seeks to ensure in developing nations a greater number of personnel trained in basic epidemiological techniques. It offers enhanced in-country training for medical and laboratory personnel and the opportunity for select personnel to come to the United States to receive training in our Centers for Disease Control laboratories and Master of Public Health programs in American universities. Second, the bill provides assistance to developing nations to acquire basic laboratory equipment, including items as mundane as microscopes, to facilitate the quick diagnosis of pathogens. Third, the bill enables developing nations to obtain communications equipment to quickly transmit data on disease patterns and pathogen diagnoses, both inside a nation and to regional organizations and the WHO. Again, we're not talking about fancy high-tech equipment, but basics like fax machines and Internet-equipped computers. Finally, the bill gives preference to countries that agree to let experts from the United States or international organizations investigate any suspicious disease outbreaks.  If passed, the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002 will go a long way in ensuring that developing nations acquire the basic disease surveillance capabilities to link up effectively with the WHO's global network. This bill offers an inexpensive and common sense solution to a problem of global proportions, the dual threat of biological weapons and naturally occurring infectious diseases. The funding authorized is only a tiny fraction of what we will spend domestically on bioterrorism defenses, but this investment will pay enormous dividends in terms of our national security.  Let me close with an excerpt of testimony from the Foreign Relations Committee hearing last September on bioterrorism. Dr. D.A. Henderson, the man who spearheaded the successful international campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970's, recently stepped down from a short-term position as the director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness in the Department of Health and Human Services. In that position, he was vested with the responsibility for helping organize the U.S. government's response to future bioterrorist attacks. Dr. Henderson, who at the time of the hearing was the head of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, was very clear on the value of global disease surveillance:       In cooperation with the WHO and other countries, we need to      strengthen greatly our intelligence gathering capability. A      focus on international surveillance and on scientist-to-     scientist communication will be necessary if we are to have      an early warning about the possible development and      production of biological weapons by rogue nations or groups.  Dr. Henderson is exactly right. We cannot leave the rest of the world to fend for itself in combating biological weapons and infectious diseases if we are to ensure America's security.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002 be printed in the the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2487       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance      Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to      the United States. The insidious nature of the threat, the      likely delayed recognition in the event of an attack, and the      underpreparedness of the domestic public health      infrastructure may produce catastrophic consequences      following a biological weapons attack upon the United States.       (2) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon      and developed, tested, produced, or released in another      country can quickly spread to the United States. Given the      realities of international travel, trade, and migration      patterns, a dangerous pathogen released anywhere in the world      can spread to United States territory in a matter of days,      before any effective quarantine or isolation measures can be      implemented.       (3) To effectively combat bioterrorism and ensure that the      United States is fully prepared to prevent, diagnose, and      contain a biological weapons attack, measures to strengthen      the domestic public health infrastructure and improve      domestic surveillance and monitoring, while absolutely      essential, are not sufficient.       (4) The United States should enhance cooperation with the      World Health Organization, regional health organizations, and      individual countries to help detect and quickly contain      infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorism agents before      they can spread.       (5) The World Health Organization (WHO) has done an      impressive job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks      around the world, particularly with the establishment in      April 2000 of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response network.       (6) The capabilities of the World Health Organization are      inherently limited in that its     disease surveillance and monitoring is only as good as the      data and information the World Health Organization receives      from member countries and are further limited by the narrow      range of diseases (plague, cholera, and yellow fever) upon      which its disease surveillance and monitoring is based, and      the consensus process used by the World Health Organization      to add new diseases to the list. Developing countries in      particular often cannot devote the necessary resources to      build and maintain public health infrastructures.       (7) In particular, developing countries could benefit      from--       (A) better trained public health professionals and      epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of      pathogens;       (C) disease reporting that is based on symptoms and signs      (known as ``syndrome surveillance'') enabling the earliest      possible opportunity to conduct an effective response;       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in syndrome      surveillance capabilities, based on reported symptoms, and      real-time information dissemination to public health      officials; and       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information      technology to efficiently transmit information and data      within national and regional health networks, including      inexpensive, Internet-based Geographic Information Systems      (GIS) for early recognition and diagnosis of diseases.       (8) An effective international capability to monitor and      quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks will offer      dividends not only in the event of biological weapons      development, testing, production, and attack, but also in the      more likely cases of naturally occurring infectious disease      outbreaks that could threaten the United States. Furthermore,      a robust surveillance system will serve to deter terrorist      use of biological weapons, as early detection will help      mitigate the intended effects of such malevolent uses.       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To enhance the capability of the international      community, through the World Health Organization and      individual countries, to detect, identify, and contain      infectious disease outbreaks, whether the cause of those      outbreaks is intentional human action or natural in origin.       (2) To enhance the training of public health professionals      and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in      advanced Internet-based syndrome surveillance systems, in      addition to traditional epidemiology methods, so that they      may better detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease      outbreaks, especially those due to pathogens most likely to      be used in a biological weapons attack.       (3) To provide assistance to developing countries to      purchase appropriate public health laboratory equipment      necessary for infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis.       (4) To provide assistance to developing countries to      purchase appropriate communications equipment and information      technology, including appropriate computer equipment and      Internet connectivity mechanisms, to facilitate the exchange      of Geographic Information Systems-based syndrome surveillance      information and to effectively gather, analyze, and transmit      public health information for infectious disease surveillance      and diagnosis.       (5) To make available greater numbers of United States      Government public health professionals to international      health organizations, regional health networks, and United      States diplomatic missions where appropriate.       (6) To establish ``lab-to-lab'' cooperative relationships      between United States public health laboratories and      established foreign counterparts.       (7) To expand the training and outreach activities of      overseas United States laboratories, including Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Defense      entities, to enhance the public health capabilities of      developing countries.       (8) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing      regional health networks and, where appropriate, seed money      for new regional networks.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
