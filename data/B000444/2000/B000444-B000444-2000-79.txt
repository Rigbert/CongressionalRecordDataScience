  The act is making a real difference in the lives of millions of women. The legislation changed our laws, strengthened criminal penalties, and facilitated enforcement of protection orders.  I see my friend from California is here. When she was in the House of Representatives, she was one of the few people, man or woman, on either side that fought for 2 years to get this passed. I say to the Senator, the majority leader indicated he plans on making sure that this gets voted on this year. ``This year'' means the next couple of days or weeks. He says he wants to attach it to another bill.  I have been making the case, I say to my friend from California, that based on the vote in the House, 415-3 and 71 Senators cosponsoring the Biden-Hatch bill here in the Senate, we should bring this up free-standing. I was presumptuous enough to speak for you and others and say we would agree to a 5-minute time agreement on the bill.
