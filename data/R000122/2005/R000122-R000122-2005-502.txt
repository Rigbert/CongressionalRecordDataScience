President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Kennedy's amendment to the, fiscal year 2006 budget resolution. This amendment would ensure the necessary investment in education to secure our Nation's continued prosperity.  This amendment would focus on three areas critical to boosting educational opportunity and our economy. First, it would make college more affordable and accessible. The amendment would raise the maximum Pell grant by $450, to $4,500, a long overdue and necessary increase for millions of students who struggle to keep up with ever-rising college tuition. It also would restore a host of programs that give low-income Americans a lifeline to college. The President seeks to eliminate programs like TRIO, GEAR UP, and LEAP, which have opened doors for students who otherwise might never consider a college education, let alone be able to afford it.  Second, this amendment would make a crucial difference for high-need schools. We cannot remain global leaders in technology if we do not maintain a world-class standard of education in math and the sciences for all students. Yet we have a shortage of highly qualified teachers in these very areas. This amendment would use loan forgiveness as an incentive to attract and retain 57,000 teachers in math, science, and another woefully understaffed arena, special education.  Finally, this amendment would ensure the future competitiveness of the workforce by preserving investments in workforce development, adult literacy, and vocational education. In voting to reauthorize and improve the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, 99 Senators just last week recognized the indispensable nature of the act, despite the President's efforts to eliminate it. With this amendment we can restore funding for Perkins programs as well as for job training and literacy programs that give adults the tools they need to be economically productive.  The investment in these commonsense measures is one we cannot afford to forego. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment.                           Amendment No. 234  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). There will now be 30 minutes of debate equally divided on the Baucus-Conrad amendment on agriculture.  The Senator from Montana.
