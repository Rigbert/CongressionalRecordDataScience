President, the Senate has concluded our consideration of the nomination of Elena Kagan and confirmed her as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. For the second time in 2 years, we have considered a nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, one of our most consequential responsibilities. I am proud that process we followed in considering this nomination in the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate has garnered praise from many Senators for its fairness and thoroughness.  We could not have given this nomination the attention it deserved without the help of dedicated staff. For months, the staff of the Judiciary Committee has worked long hours dutifully to obtain and review extensive amounts of documents and information and help Senators in our review. I wish to thank the following members of the majority staff in particular, Jeremy Paris, Erica Chabot, Kristine Lucius, Shanna Singh Hughey, Maggie Whitney, Hasan Ali, John Amaya, Sarah Hackett, Sarah Hasazi, Michael Gerhardt, Elise Burditt, Noah Bookbinder, Anya McMurray, Liz Aloi, Tara Magner, Kelsey Kobelt, Juan Valdivieso, Matt Virkstis, Curtis LeGeyt, Roslyne Turner, Erin O'Neill, Julia Gagne, Brian Hockin, Joseph Thomas, Elizabeth Saxe, Katharine McFarland, Miles Clark, Christine Paquin, David Zayas, Lydia Griggsby, Adrienne Wojciechowski, Dan Taylor, Patrick Sheahan, Matt Smith, Scott Wilson, Kiera Flynn, Rachel Pelham, Bree Bang-Jensen, Chuck Papirmeister, and Bruce Cohen. I also thank my staff for their hard work on this nomination, in particular, Edward Pagano, David Carle, Laura Trainor, and Kevin McDonald. I would also like to thank Stacy Rich from Senator Murray's staff who helped manage the floor.  I commend and thank the hard-working staffs of the other Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee for their tremendous contributions to this effort.  I also commend and thank Senator Sessions, the committee's ranking Republican, and his staff, in particular, Brian Benczkowski, Danielle Cutrona, Ted Lehman, and Lauren Pastarnack, for their hard work and professionalism.                          ____________________
