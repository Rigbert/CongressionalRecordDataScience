Speaker, at this time I am the only remaining speaker that we can find, because we note two of our speakers who want to speak, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior), the minority whip, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Becerra), the chairman of the Hispanic Caucus, both wanted to speak. Both of them are at another event right now. We are trying to get them here. I am the only speaker remaining.
