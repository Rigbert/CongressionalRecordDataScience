 President, it is with gratitude that I pay tribute today to Mike Rust, a leading advocate for positive healthcare outcomes in Kentucky. With a long list of accomplishments and two dozen years as president of the Kentucky Hospital Association, Mike has certainly earned a relaxing and enjoyable retirement. Communities throughout our Commonwealth have benefited from Mike's leadership, and I would like to join them today in honoring his impressive career.  Before coming to Kentucky, Mike worked in senior positions at hospitals in West Virginia and with the Florida Hospital Association. Taking the impressive skills he developed throughout his career, Mike joined the KHA in 1996 as its third president. Mike and his team support the work of each and every one of Kentucky's 120-plus hospitals to enhance healthcare services in both rural and urban communities across the Commonwealth.  In addition to its advocacy work, the KHA under Mike's leadership offers critical services to its membership, including research, education, and support for patient safety and quality care. Patients and hospitals in our State will continue to benefit from Mike's great work for many years to come. Through his achievements on behalf of Kentucky's hospitals and their patients, Mike has earned the respect of his peers in our Commonwealth and across the Nation.  On a personal note, I have enjoyed partnering with Mike in my work in the Senate to support Kentucky families and communities. Just recently, the KHA supported my effort to raise the nationwide minimum purchase age for tobacco products from 18 to 21. His counsel was also particularly beneficial in our fight against the passage of Obamacare, which the KHA rightly opposed. My staff and I will miss Mike's collaboration on many important Kentucky priorities, but I am confident the organization he dedicated so much of his life to will continue building upon his legacy.  As Mike reaches this milestone, I would like to thank him for his leadership on behalf of hospitals and families across the Commonwealth. I share my best wishes with Mike and his family for many years of relaxation and enjoyment together. Finally, I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Mike Rust for a long career of distinguished advocacy and service to Kentucky.                          ____________________
