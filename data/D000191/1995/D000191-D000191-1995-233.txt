What we are doing now with the Mexico bailout is we are paying billions of dollars to speculators to attempt to prop up the Mexico peso and the Mexican economy because we are linked to them through the NAFTA agreement. We are losing jobs to Mexico, where wages and the standard of living have been reduced by 35 percent because of the devaluation of the peso.  The situation is the workers of Mexico, everyone outside of Mexico's 24 billionaires and a few hundred millionaires, have seen their standard of living go down by 35 percent in direct relation to NAFTA. Thousands at this point, over 20,000 American workers have been approved for unemployment benefits because their job loss was linked directly to the movement of their plant to Mexico.  We ran in January the first trade deficit with Mexico in 12 years, $863 million, 1-month trade deficit with Mexico, and it is predicted by next year we will run a $20 billion trade deficit with Mexico, which means, according to the Commerce Department, for every billion dollars of net on our trade balance, we create 20,000 jobs in America.  So if we run a $20 billion trade deficit with Mexico, we are ceding $400,000 to Mexico and we are paying $40 billion to do it. Absurdity on absurdity on mistake.
