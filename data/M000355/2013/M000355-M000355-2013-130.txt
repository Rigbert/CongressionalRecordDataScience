 President, this morning I would like to start by remembering the sacrifice of two 18-year veterans of the Capitol Police, Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut. On this date in 1998, Gibson and Chestnut paid the ultimate price while standing in defense of the U.S. Capitol. We know these men fell defending more than just the structure, though. We know they fell defending more than just the Members sent here or even the staffs who help each of us better serve constituents and our country. No, these men died while protecting everything this building represents--our democratic way of life, the freedom granted to each of us by a creator we often thank but never see.  We honor these men for their lives, and we honor them for the final act of heroism that ended those lives. That is why a plaque inside the Capitol commemorates their sacrifice. That is why the Capitol Police headquarters bears both of their names. That, I know, is of little solace to the wives, children, and friends left behind, but it is a small way of saying ``we remember'' when the scale of the debt owed can never truly be repaid in full.  So today the Senate honors John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut for their sacrifice, and the Senate sends its condolences and its gratitude to those who loved them most.                          ____________________
