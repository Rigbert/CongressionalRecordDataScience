Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question of the rule on this Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act of 2003. This legislation before us today and the consideration tomorrow of the Republicans' irresponsible tax bill tell the American people everything they ever wanted to know about where the majority's priorities lie. And lest anyone be mistaken, their priorities do not lie with the workers and families who are suffering through the anxiety and stress of joblessness, with more than 10 million American workers now unemployed, with the loss of 2.7 million private sector jobs since President Bush was inaugurated, and 500,000 in the last 3 months; and with the unemployment rate at 6 percent, its highest level since 1994, the majority would undercut local reemployment efforts and eliminate services for job-seeking veterans, dislocated workers, and the disabled.  This Act was authorized 4 years ago after a lengthy bipartisan process. But today, today the majority turns it into a partisan vise that will squeeze America's jobless. It gives governors unlimited authority to divert funds from adult education, disability, and veterans' services. And we will, like Pontius Pilate, wring our hands and say it was not our responsibility, it was the governors' responsibility. And it fails to restore the $440 million in cuts imposed on job-training programs or protect against 265 million more in proposed cuts for fiscal 2004.  Just imagine, just imagine, under Republican stewardship our economy has shed millions of jobs and at the same time the GOP is undermining job training programs. Republicans may call that compassion; Democrats call it indifference. Adding insult to injury, the big tent GOP seeks to change the original law to permit organizations that received Work Investment Act funds to discriminate on religious grounds in hiring, something that Dan Quayle said they should not do.  I commend my colleagues who fought to restore the current law. Their amendment should have been made in order. Was there a lack of conviction that the allowing of discrimination in this bill was an appropriate policy and they could not hold their Members on their side of the aisle for such discrimination?  Democrats believe this Congress must enact policies that jump-start our economy and create jobs, and redoubling our job-training efforts is a vital part of that.                              {time}  1045  This bill simply gives the cold shoulder to millions of jobless Americans. I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question, to vote against the rule, and to vote against this bad bill.
