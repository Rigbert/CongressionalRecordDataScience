 President, there is currently laid aside an amendment which is in the second degree, I believe, by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. I ask unanimous consent that a vote on or in relation to the Bingaman amendment occur immediately at the end of the currently scheduled vote at 6:30, and that the duration of time on that vote to immediately follow the Helms amendment be 10 minutes.
