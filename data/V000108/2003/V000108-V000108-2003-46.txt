Speaker, It is with great remorse that I rise today to pay tribute to Porter County Commissioner Larry Sheets, a special friend, a mentor and a very decent man. Larry passed away late Saturday evening at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago from a pulmonary infection acquired after undergoing a stem cell replacement to prevent the return of his leukemia. I knew Larry Sheets for many years and considered him a close personal friend. He was a good man with a good heart.  Larry was a man of true and outstanding character who loved his family, was loyal to his friends and was dedicated to making the lives of people he had never met better through politics. In all my years of association with him, I never once saw him do something that was mean or petty. He was a conciliator and a man of political courage. I always sawhim place the public good before anything else when a decision had to be made. During an age of cynicism about those in public life, this alone is truly remarkable.  This has been a heartbreaking moment for all of us in Northwest Indiana, as Larry served Porter County very ably as a public official for 17 years. He was a fine public servant, a man who sincerely cared about his constituents, his fellow citizens and his civic responsibilities. Larry retired in 1999 after 34 years as a steel worker at Bethlehem Steel's Burns Harbor Plant and in 1982 won his first election as a Porter County Commissioner.  In the early 1980s, while working for the late Congressman Adam Benjamin, Jr., I had the privilege of first meeting Larry Sheets. Later, during my first bid for Congress in 1983, Larry was the first and one of only a few public officials to endorse me. At the time I was ``nobody.'' Larry made me ``somebody.'' Our friendship was extended to a shared passion. Along with my father, Larry, Bill Wallace and I would spend many fall Saturdays together in South Bend, Indiana, watching the Fighting Irish play football.  Although his work with the community put extraordinary demands on his time, Larry never limited the time he gave to his most important interest, his family. He and his gracious wife, Paula, have two terrific children: Amber and Larry Jr.  Mr. Speaker and my other distinguished colleagues, Larry Sheets was a wonderful man. We are going to miss him in Northwest Indiana. He represented the epitome of what a dedicated public servant should be, but seldom is, and for that he will always be remembered.                          ____________________
