Speaker, one of the key reform goals of this Congress is to examine all aspects of the Federal Government's involvement in the day-to-day lives of our citizens, and determine which of those Federal roles would be more efficiently managed on the local level and/or by the private sector. The portions of the Pick-Sloan project in Kansas and Nebraska, appear to fit this category.  However, the procedures established that allow the Bureau of Reclamation to transfer title--and the management and financial responsibilities--to the irrigation districts are often contentious and inordinately time consuming.  Today I am introducing a bill to expedite this process and so all interested parties can raise their issues and concerns relative to the title transfer of the Kansas and Nebraska Pick-Sloan projects. There are sure to be provisions in this bill that some may find problematic. The introduction of this legislation will encourage a comprehensive discussion on this transfer to ensure all appropriate issues are adequately addressed.  The Missouri River Basin, Kansas and Nebraska, Pick-Sloan Facilities Transfer Act will contribute to our continuing efforts to reduce and reform the role of the Federal Government. And by the consideration of this act, Congress will provide an opportunity for all interested parties to register their concerns so they can be properly addressed.                          ____________________
