 President, I rise today to cosponsor and support the McConnell amendment. This amendment establishes a 1-year moratorium on new standard-setting rulemakings by the Department of Energy.  This amendment is necessary to maintain the competitive nature of the U.S. appliance industry, which includes home appliances as well as heating and air-conditioning equipment.  New energy standards would threaten the viability of several U.S. manufacturers of appliances, including at least four in my State.  A 1-year moratorium will allow the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to review DOE's energy-efficiency standards program to determine what impacts these standards are having on competition, and on the consumers of these products.  Senator Murkowski, the distinguished chairman of the Energy Committee, has already indicated his support for the moratorium and his willingness to conduct such a review.  Mr. President, I will just take a moment to highlight a few of the effects that new standard requirements will have on both the industry and the American consumer.  Energy standards currently exist for all major appliances. For example, manufacturers must meet these standards on such products as dishwashers, refrigerators, laundry machines, and heating and air-conditioning units.  The Department of Energy reviews the standards periodically and most products are already being considered for their second set of standards since 1990; some face their third set of standards during this period.  So these products already operate at a very high level of efficiency. If the DOE continues to increase these standards, many companies will be crippled by the burden of the capital investment necessary to meet additional standards.  Furthermore, these companies will be unable to invest in other product innovations which are absolutely vital for maintaining their competitiveness, both in the United States and in the global marketplace.  If further capital investment is required, it is likely that most of the cost will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices for appliances.  Furthermore, companies will be forced to discontinue certain models and brands because they are no longer cost-effective to produce. So consumers will have fewer products to choose from and the products that are available will cost more.  We need to call a time out, take a step back, and consider whether all of this is necessary. This amendment allows Congress the opportunity to do just that.  Mr. President, it is also important to note exactly what this amendment will not do. This amendment will not affect existing energy standards in any way. This amendment will not alter the existing energy labeling program, which enables consumers to compare competing brands of appliances. And this amendment will not undermine the energy savings already achieved in these products.  Finally, Mr. President, this amendment protects the consumer's ability to purchase energy-efficient appliances at a competitive price.  For all these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.                           amendment no. 2324(Purpose: To provide funding for cooperative lands fire management and   to increase funding for the stewardship incentive program, with an                                 offset)       On page 66, lines 3 and 4, strike ``$128,294,000, to remain      available until expended, as authorized by law'' and insert      ``$136,794,000, to remain available until expended, as      authorized by law, of which not less than $16,100,000 shall      be made available for cooperative lands fire management and      not less than $7,500,000 shall be made available for the      stewardship incentive program''.       On page 66, line 15, strike ``$1,256,043,000'' and insert      ``$1,247,543,000''.
