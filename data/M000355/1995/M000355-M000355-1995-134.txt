 President, I want to thank my friend from Massachusetts for withdrawing the amendments. It has been a useful discussion.  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the vote on the Helms amendment No. 2730, which will start momentarily, that there be 4 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a motion to table the Bingaman amendment, upon which we will vote right after the Helms amendment.
