Speaker, further reserving the right to object  Mr. Speaker, it has been a long and difficult road to campaign finance reform. But it has been a road well worth taking.  With the adoption of this package of technical amendments, the legislative branch will have worked the people's will and taken an important step forward in taming the influence of special interests.  I commend the other body for moving expeditiously on Shays-Meehan.  I urge the President to sign immediately this landmark legislation.  The technical amendments before us, with the exception of one, are just that: Technical. They simply correct minor drafting errors and clarify provisions of Shays-Meehan that this House overwhelmingly passed on February 13.  These amendments will help ensure that this historic reform legislation achieves its central purpose: Banning unregulated soft money donations to the National parties.  The foes of Shays-Meehan have lost the battle in Congress. But they are determined to continue the battle on a new battleground, the Judiciary, and they are apparently determined to do whatever it takes to become lead plaintiff.  Under our system of laws, that is their right.  To help them gain standing, one amendment before us authorizes any member of Congress to challenge this legislation. Supporters of Shays-Meehan are confident the legislation will withstand Constitutional challenge, just as it withstood legislative challenge.  Mr. Speaker, it is time for Shays-Meehan to be sent to the White House.
