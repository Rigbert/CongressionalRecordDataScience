 A highly trusted advisor and valued friend to Members of Congress, and the diplomatic and intelligence communities, Ambassador Miller's distinguished service to our nation elevated the possibilities and promise of liberty to people living in nations that had never known freedom.  He dedicated his life at liberty's edge with great humility. His steady, unselfish, and tenacious nature allowed him to tackle infinitely complex situations-- Iran, the Soviet Union, Ukraine--and advise ways forward. He never really retired and remained engaged and insightful during his golden years.  A renaissance man, Ambassador Miller's career spanned assignment in Iran, staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, senior Administrator and professor at Tufts University, chairman of the board of the Kyiv Mohyla Foundation, and president of the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations. Upon leaving Congress, the U.S. Senate recognized his leadership by passing a special resolution commending him for ``contributions and for his dedication, loyalty, integrity, and service.''  Simply, he was exceptional.  It is with deepest condolences that I offer sympathy to his beautiful wife Suzanne, their two sons, and extended family at this difficult time.  May the life he has lived continue to inspire a new generation of Americans to embrace his calling to scholarship, service, and patriotic commitment to liberty's cause at home and abroad.                  [From the Kyiv Post Sept. 24, 2019]William Green Miller, Second US Ambassador to Independent Ukraine, Dies                                at Age 88       William Green Miller, who served as U.S. ambassador to      Ukraine in the 1990s as the euphoria of national independence      gave way to the misery of economic destitution for many      Ukrainians. died in his home in northern Virginia on Sept.      23, according to friends. He was 88. He served as America's      second ambassador in Kyiv, from 1993-1998, and is the first      of nine American ambassadors to independent Ukraine to have      died.       His death was confirmed by friends, including Marta Farion,      a Ukrainian-American in Chicago who worked with Miller on the      Kyiv Mohyla Foundation of America, raising money to support      the university with 5,000 students in Kyiv. Farion spoke to      Miller's wife, Suzanne Lisle Miller, and said that the      ambassador died in his home ``one minute before noon'' on      Sept. 23, in the company of their two sons, William and      Christopher, and grandchildren. ``He was surrounded by his      leather-bound books, in front of the beautiful garden that he      and Suzanne cultivated and loved all their lives, with the      blooming flowers and many butterflies that bid him      farewell,'' Farion told the Kyiv Post.       Miller's tenure as ambassador coincided with momentous      events under Ukraine's first president, Leonid Kravchuk, who      served from 1991-1994, and then Leonid Kuchma, who ruled from      1994-2005. During Millers era, Ukraine adopted a      Constitution, launched the national currency, the hryvnia,      and signed the Budapest Memorandum in which Russia, the      United Kingdom, and the United States offered security      assurances to Ukraine for surrendering its Soviet-era nuclear      arsenal.       The agreement now is derided by many in Ukraine as a      worthless piece of paper, considering Russia's dismemberment      of Ukraine--including seizing Crimea and parts of the eastern      Donbas--as the Kremlin prosecutes a war in its sixth year      that has killed 13,000 people. His term also witnessed      Ukrainian lawlessness and the rise of the oligarchy, which      still plagues the nation today.       But his friends say that Miller always found the beauty in      Ukraine, despite its hardships. Farion described Miller as      ``a writer and poet, a Renaissance man in every respect and      Suzanne was his muse, his adviser, and his protector to the      very end. They loved Ukraine since the days when he was      ambassador there. To the end, he wanted to know what is      taking place in Ukraine.'' She said that ``Bill and Suzanne      were responsible for the establishment and renovation of the      historic building in the Podil neighborhood that became the      residence of the American ambassador, and they paid special      attention to the garden, restoring the original plants,      trees, and flowers that were cultivated there when the      building was first built. They paid attention to the      historical artifacts that were recovered while rebuilding the      residence, and they hosted many Ukrainian artists,      historians, musicians, and writers there.''       Said Farion: ``Bill embraced his role as chairman of the      board of the Kyiv Mohyla Foundation with all his vigor and      believed in the power of education and the role of Kyiv-     Mohyla Academy in building Ukraine as a democratic country,      where rule of law and human rights were priorities. He was      honored by Kyiv-Mohyla Academy with an honorary doctorate and      spoke on the stage of the university to students on many      occasions. He inspired me to push forward, to never give up,      to stand up for the truth. He was my mentor in many respects      and taught me not to be afraid. He loved the principles upon      which the United States was established and he truly believed      in those principles. He was an admirer of Thomas Jefferson.      He was a scholar. He left a book of poetry and many writings.      I will miss him and his guidance.''       Monica Eppinger served as the second secretary to Miller in      the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine and recalled her work with him as      ``the best time.'' To the end, she said ``he wanted to be a      good friend of Ukraine.'' ``I was part of that small early      team during Ambassador Millers tenure in Ukraine. He had      headed the Washington side of a late' Soviet human rights      organization, and through it was thoroughly acquainted with      the cases of the major human rights heroes of the last decade      of the U.S.S.R. When he got to Ukraine, he already had made      common cause with some--Mustafa Dzhemilev, Vyacheslav      Chornovil, Semen Gluzman. Anyone who'd done Soviet prison      time for advocating human rights was a part of his `team.' He      was a fervent Jeffersonian democrat. He also worked very      closely with Voldoymyr Horbulin (former secretary of the      Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council). especially      on denuclearization, and to the best of my knowledge      respected him and appreciated him as a pragmatic strategic      thinker who cared about Ukrainian independence.''       During Miller's ambassadorial tenure, Eppinger said, he      took a keen interest in people working on human rights and      advocating freedom of speech, religion and the press.       ``He was just really interested in the project of      independent Ukraine and really interested in Ukrainians,''      said Eppinger, a professor at St. Louis University School of      Law and director of its Center for International and      Comparative Law. He'd meet with anybody practically who      wanted to meet with him.'' She said Miller was also      interested in archaeology and remembers him stopping      frequently to visit the excavation site of what is now the      rebuilt Mikhailovsky Cathedral in Kyiv. ``All the      archaeologists at the site knew him.'' she said.       Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Green Miller      delivers remarks at the observance of the 60th anniversary of      the Voice of America's Ukrainian Service on Dec. 11, 2009, at      VOA headquarters in Washington, D.C.       Farion said that she traveled with him and a team of      archaeology students ``to the magnificent Chersonesus in      Crimea. He promoted the site to be protected by UNESCO. The      occupation of Crimea by Russia stung him personally, not only      because of the loss of the strategic territory but because he      realized that Russian authorities would raid the      archaeological site. He was deeply concerned for the fate of      the Crimean Tatars after Russia's invasion and occupation.''       Eppinger called him a big fan of ballet, especially Swan      Lake. ``He also loved the Philharmonic and actively supported      the rehabilitation of the Philharmonic building near the      Friendship Arch'' on the right bank of the Dnipro River in      central Kyiv. She said he even vacationed in Ukraine, taking      driving tours to explore ancient wooden churches of the      Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine. ``He just loved      Ukraine and his interest in Ukraine and support for Ukraine      knew no bounds.'' she said. Eppinger recalled his experiment      in taking up the Ukrainian tradition of beekeeping. He      installed beehives in the backyard of the ambassador's      residence. At a traditional Fourth of July reception, she      recalled that a colleague with the Ukrainian Ministry of      Foreign Affairs ``got stung right on the nose'' by a bee.       Miller joined the Foreign Service in 1959 and served a      five-year assignment in Iran, where he immersed himself in      Persian culture. Farion said he never lost interest in Iran.      ``He was instrumental in many informal talks between the US      and Iran, trying to find peace,'' she said.       After his Iran assignment, Eppinger said he returned to      Washington, D.C., and quit the Foreign Service over the      Vietnam War and got a job as a staff director of the U.S.      Senate Intelligence Committee.       ``He was part of the team that put together the hearings on      the U.S. intelligence services attempted assassinations in      the post-World War II/Cold War era,'' Eppinger said. ``It was      thanks to those hearings and the report that resulted that we      got a revision to the executive order that sets the      parameters to the intelligence community . . . that resulted      in the ban on assassinations by the U.S. intelligence      committee. He was sometimes criticized as a romantic or      idealist, but--as I think the intelligence committee work      shows--he also had a canniness to thinking about where a      threat to democracy could come from. and how to thwart it. I      think there was a hard practical streak in there that often      got overlooked.''       According to a Eurasia Foundation biography, Miller was      educated at Williams College, Oxford, and Harvard. After      leaving his Iran assignment in 1964, he returned to      Washington, D.C., as a line officer for U.S. Secretary of      State Dean Rusk. Miller then went to work in the U.S. Senate      in 1967, where he served as foreign policy and defense      adviser to U.S. Senator John Sherman Cooper, a Republican who      served Kentucky. In 1981 the U.S. Senate passed a special      resolution commending Miller ``for exceptional contributions      and for his dedication, loyalty, integrity, and service.''      Miller was associate dean and professor of international      politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts      University in Massachusetts from 1981 to 1983.       In 1986, Miller returned to Washington as president of the      American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations, traveling      frequently to the U.S.S.R. and living in Moscow from 1988 to      1993.       In retirement years, Miller was a senior policy scholar at      the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in      Washington, D.C., a member of the Council on Foreign      Relations, the International Institute of Strategic Studies      and the Middle East Institute. He was also co-chairman of the      Kyiv Mohyla Foundation of America and a director of the      Andrei Sakharov Foundation as well as a consultant for the      John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.       Farion said a memorial service is being planned at the      National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 12 or 13, but      that arrangements are still being finalized.                          ____________________
