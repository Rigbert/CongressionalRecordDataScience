 President, I particularly want to say how pleased I am Senator Domenici is still on the Senate floor. This is an extraordinary accomplishment for him. I congratulate him on his persistence and tenacity. Senator Stevens has been deeply involved in this issue from the very beginning and has done an extraordinary job, and I want to congratulate both of these outstanding Senators for what is going to be an accomplishment that all of us can be proud of. I also commend Senator Inouye and Senator Bingaman for their hard work as well. The final product is not perfect, but it is vastly better than the version that was sent to us by the House of Representatives.  We recognized in the Senate that the House bill couldn't pass the Senate and wouldn't be signed into law, so we fixed it, and now it will. The new fuel economy standards and the increase in renewable fuels represent a step forward in our common effort to make America more energy independent. This is something we can all be proud of as we leave to go home for the holiday recess.  This is a good accomplishment. It was achieved--as every good thing in the Senate always is--by cooperation between the parties. What we have done on this bill we have done together. In a year that has seen its fair share of partisan tensions, that is no small accomplishment either.  So, again, I congratulate the managers of the bill. I also thank my good friend, the majority leader, for bringing it back to the floor in a form that guarantees not only that it will pass the Senate but that it will be signed into law.  I am extremely pleased about this bipartisan accomplishment. I am extremely happy that we are about to show the American people we still have it in us to come together as a body and to achieve consensus on an issue that affects all of us.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
