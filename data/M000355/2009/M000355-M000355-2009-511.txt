 President, I commend to my fellow Senators the April 3, 1987 U.S. Justice Department Office of Legal Policy Report to the Attorney General entitled ``The Question of Statehood for the District of Columbia.'' I ask unanimous consent that the Executive Summary and section titled ``Proposals for Giving Representation in Congress to the District of Columbia, Voting Member in the House of Representatives'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Executive Summary       Efforts to admit the District of Columbia to the Union as a      state should be vigorously opposed. Granting the national      capital statehood through statutory means raises numerous      troubling constitutional questions. After careful      consideration of these issues, we have concluded that an      amendment to the Constitution would be required before the      District of Columbia may be admitted to the Union as a state.      Statehood for the Nation's capital is inconsistent with the      language of the Constitution, as well as the intent of its      Framers, and would work a basic change in the federal system      as it has existed for the past two hundred years. Under our      Constitution, power was divided between the states and the      federal government in the hope, as Madison wrote, that      ``[t]he different governments will control each other,'' thus      securing self-government, individual liberty, and the rights      of minorities. In order to serve its function in the federal      structure a state must be independent of the federal      government. However, the District of Columbia is not      independent; it is a political and economic dependency of the      national government.       At the same time, it is essential that the federal      government maintain its independence of the states. If the      District of Columbia were now admitted to statehood, it would      not be one state among many. Because it is the national      capital, the District would be primus inter pares, first      among equals. The ``State of Columbia . . . could come      perilously close to being the state whose sole business is to      govern, to control all the other states. It would be the      imperial state; it would be `Rome on the Potomac.''' It was      this very dilemma that prompted the Founders to establish the      federal capital in a district located outside of the borders      of any one of the states, under the exclusive jurisdiction of      Congress. Their reasons for creating the District are still      valid and militate against granting it statehood.       Many have recognized the fundamental flaws in plans to      grant the District of Columbia statehood. For instance, while      testifying in support of the proposed 1978 District      amendment, which would have treated the District of Columbia      ``as if it were a State'' for purposes of national elections,      Senator Edward Kennedy dismissed what he called ``the      statehood fallacy,'' and stated that, ``[t]he District is      neither a city nor a State. In fact, statehood may well be an      impossible alternative, given the practical and      constitutional questions involved in changing the historical      status of the Nation's Capital.'' A pamphlet entitled      ``Democracy Denied'' circulated in support of the 1978      amendment, and fully endorsed by District Delegate Walter E.      Fauntroy, plainly acknowledged that granting statehood to the      District of Columbia ``would defeat the purpose of having a      federal city, i.e., the creation of a district over which the      Congress would have exclusive control.'' That pamphlet also      recognized that statehood ``presents a troublesome problem      with the 23rd Amendment if the federal district were to be      wiped out by legislation.'' Indeed, Delegate Fauntroy has      opposed statehood for the District in the past, correctly      pointing out that ``this would be in direct defiance of the      prescriptions of the Founding Fathers.'' As former Senator      Mathias of Maryland stated, ``[i]t is not a State . . . it      should not be a State.''       These points are well taken. The factors that mitigated      against statehood for the District of Columbia in 1978 have      not changed. The rejection of the District voting rights      constitutional amendment by the states does not make      statehood any more desirable, or any less constitutionally      suspect, today than it was a decade ago. Granting statehood      to the District of Columbia would defeat the purpose of      having a federal city, would be in direct defiance of the      intent of the Founders, and would require an amendment to the      Constitution.  I. Need for an Amendment to the Constitution Before the District of             Columbia May Be Admitted to the Union as a State       Even if statehood for the District of Columbia represented      sound policy, we do not believe that it can be accomplished      merely by a statute admitting the District to the Union. The      Constitution contemplates a federal district as the seat of      the general government, and would have to be amended. The      Department of Justice has long taken this position. In 1978,      Assistant Attorney General John M. Hannon concluded on behalf      of the Carter Administration that, ``it was the intent of the      Framers that the actual seat of the Federal Government, as      opposed to its other installations, be outside any State and      independent of the cooperation and consent of the State      authorities . . . . If these reasons have lost validity, the      appropriate response would be to provide statehood for the      District by constitutional amendment rather than to ignore      the Framers' intentions.''       The retention of federal authority over a truncated,      federal service area would not answer this constitutional      objection. The language of the Constitution grants Congress      exclusive authority over the district that became the seat of      government, not merely over the seat of the government. The      district that became the seat of government is the District      of Columbia. It does not appear that Congress may, consistent      with the language of the Constitution, abandon its exclusive      authority over any part of the District.       Further, the Twenty-third Amendment requires that ``[t]he      District constituting the seat of Government of the United      States'' appoint electors to participate in the Electoral      College. The amendment was proposed, drafted and ratified      with reference to the District of Columbia. When the states      adopted this amendment, they confirmed the understanding that      the District is a unique juridical entity with permanent      status under the Constitution. Another amendment would be      necessary to remake this entity.       Finally, we believe that Congress' ability to admit the      District of Columbia into the Union as a new state would      depend upon the consent of the legislature of the original      ceding state. Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution      provides that: ``no new State shall be formed or erected      within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be      formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of      States, without the Consent of the legislatures of the States      concerned as well as of the Congress.'' Accordingly, the      consent of Maryland would be necessary before the District of      Columbia could be admitted to the Union. Should Maryland      refuse to consent, the area that is now the District of      Columbia could not be made a state without amendment of      Article IV, section 3.       Thus, before the District of Columbia may be admitted to      the Union as a state, the Constitution would have to be      amended. Such an amendment, however, would be unwise. II. The Sound Historical Reasons for a Federal District Still Operate                                  Today       In the Founders' view, a federal enclave where Congress      could exercise complete authority, insulating itself from      insult and securing its deliberations from interruption, was      an ``indispensible necessity.'' They settled upon the device      of a federal district as the means by which the federal      government might remain independent of the influence of any      single state, to avoid, in the words of Virginia's George      Mason, ``a provincial tincture to ye Natl. deliberations.''       The passing years have, if anything, increased the need for      ultimate congressional control of the federal city. The      District is an integral part of the operations of the      nation's government, which depends upon a much more complex      array of services, utilities, transportation facilities, and      communication networks than it did at the Founding. If the      District were to become a state, its financial problems,      labor troubles, and other concerns would still affect the      federal government's operations. Congress, however, would be      deprived of a direct, controlling voice in the resolution of      such problems. In a very real sense, the federal government      would be dependent upon the State of Columbia for its day to      day existence.       The retention of congressional authority over a much      reduced federal enclave would not solve this problem. The      Founder's contemplated more than a cluster of buildings,      however grand, and their surrounding parks and gardens as the      national capital. The creation of a new ``federal town'' was      intended, in large part so that Congress could independently      control the basic services necessary to the operation of the      federal government. As former Senator Birch Bayh pointed out      in 1978, ``when our Founding Fathers established this as a      capital city . . . they did not just establish a place that      should be the Federal city and say this is where the Federal      buildings are. But they envisioned this as a viable city, a      capital city with people who work, have businesses, and have      transportation lines, and homes. The essential establishment      of the Nation's Capital was not an establishment of the      Nation's Federal buildings but the Nation's city.''       Further, there remain virtually insurmountable practical      problems with District statehood. The operations of the      federal government sprawl over the District. As a result, the      new ``state'' would be honeycombed with federal      installations, its territory fragmented by competing      jurisdictions. As Assistant Attorney General Patricia Wald      asked while testifying on behalf of the Carter      Administration, regarding the proposed 1978 District      amendment, ``[w]ould the remaining non-Federal. area      constitute in any real sense a geographically homogeneous      entity that justifies statehood?'' It was for these very      reasons that former Mayor Washington expressed doubts about      statehood for the District. In 1975 he commented that the      city of Washington is ``so physically, and economically and      socially bound together that I would have problems with      statehood in terms of exacting from it some enclaves, or      little enclaves all around the city. Ultimately, it seems      to me, that would erode the very fabric of the city      itself, and the viability of the city.''       Finally, in a very real sense the District belongs not only      to those who reside within its borders, but to the Nation as      a whole. In opposing statehood for the District in 1978,      Senator Bayh, an otherwise ardent proponent of direct      District participation in congressional elections, eloquently      summed up the objection: ``I guess as a Senator from Indiana      I hate to see us taking the Nation's Capital from [5,000,000]      Hoosiers. It is part ours. I do not see why the District      should be a State because it is, indeed, the Nation's      Capital.''    III. The District of Columbia is Not Independent of the Federal                                Government     A. Dependence on the Federal Establishment       The states of the American Union are more than merely      geographic entities: Each is what has been termed ``a proper      Madisonian society''--a society composed of a ``diversity of      interests and financial independence.'' It is this diversity      which guards the liberty of the individual and the rights of      minorities. As Madison wrote, ``the security for civil rights      . . . consists in the multiplicity of interests . . . The      degree of security . . . will depend on the number of      interests . . . and this may be presumed to depend on the      extent of country and number of people comprehended under the      same government.''       The District of Columbia lacks this essential political      requisite for statehood. It has only one significant      ``industry,'' government. As a result, the District has one      monolithic interest group, those who work for, provide      services to, or otherwise deal with, the federal government.      The national government was, historically, the city's only      reason for being. Close to two-thirds of the District's      workforce is employed either directly or indirectly in the      business of the federal government. Indeed, in 1982 the      District government maintained that, in the Washington      Metropolitan area, for every federal worker laid off as a      result of government reductions in force, one person would be      thrown out of work in the private sector.       The implications of this monolithic interest are far      reaching. For instance, the Supreme Court, in Garcia v. San      Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528 (1985),      has recently decided that the delicate balance between      federal and state power is to be guarded primarily by the      intrinsic role the states play in the structure of the      national government and the political process. The      congressional delegation from the District of Columbia,      however, would have little interest in preserving the balance      between federal and state authority entrusted to it by      Garcia. The continued centralization of power in the hands of      the national government would, in fact, be to the direct      benefit of ``Columbia'' and its residents. Hence; the system      of competing sovereignties-designed to preserve our      fundamental liberties would be compromised.     B. Economic Dependence       In addition to political independence and diversity, a      state must have ``sufficient population and resources to      support a state government and to provide its share of the      cost of the Federal Government.'' The District of Columbia      simply lacks the resources both to support a state government      and to provide its fair share of the cost of the federal      government. The District is a federal dependency. Annually,      in addition to all other federal aid programs, it receives a      direct payment from the federal treasury of a half billion      dollars; some $522 million was budgeted for the District in      Fiscal 1987, $445 million to be paid directly to the      District's local government. All in all, District residents      outstrip the residents of the states in per capita federal      aid by a wide margin. For instance, in 1983 the District      received $2,177 per capita in federal aid, some five and one-     half times the national average of $384.       Not surprisingly, Washington Mayor Marion Barry has plainly      stated that the District would still ``require the support of      the Federal Government'' if statehood were granted. The      continuation of federal support is ordinarily justified      because of the percentage of federal land in the District of      Columbia that cannot be taxed by the local government.      However, the federal government owns a greater percentage of      the land area of 10 states, each of which bears the full      burdens of statehood without the sort of massive federal      support annually received by the District of Columbia. If the      District aspires to statehood, it must be prepared to stand      as an equal with the other states in its fiscal affairs.                               Conclusion       The District of Columbia should not be granted statehood.      In our considered opinion, an amendment to the Constitution      would be needed before the District could be admitted as a      state, and in any case, the reasons that led the Founder's to      establish the national capital in a district outside the      borders of any state are still valid. The District's special      status is an integral part of our system of federalism, which      itself was a compromise between pure democracy and the need      to secure individual liberties and minority rights. The      residents of the District enjoy all of the rights of other      citizens, save the right to vote in congressional elections.      They exchanged this right, as Mr. Justice Story wrote, for      the benefits of living in the ``metropolis of a great and      noble republic.'' Instead, ``their rights [are] under the      immediate protection of the representatives of the whole      Union.'' This was the price of the national capital, and      District residents have enjoyed the fruits of this bargain      for almost two centuries.                                  ____III. Proposals for Giving Representation in Congress to the District of                                 Columbia       The numerous schemes proposed over the last two hundred      years to give the residents of the federal district some sort      of direct voting representation in Congress may be distilled      into five basic proposals: (1) legislation to allow the      District a voting member in the House of Representatives      alone; (2) retrocession of the District of Columbia to      Maryland, retaining a truncated federal district; (3)      allowing District residents to vote as residents of Maryland      in national elections; (4) an amendment to the Constitution      to give the District full representation in both House and      Senate as if it were a state; and (5) full statehood. None of      these proposals offers a sound policy solution, and several      appear to be fatally flawed when exposed to constitutional      scrutiny.     A. Voting Member in the House of Representatives       From time to time it has'' been suggested that the District      be granted, by simple legislation, a voting member in the      House of Representatives. This proposal, however, runs into      significant constitutional difficulties.       Those sections of the Constitution which define the      political structure of the federal government speak uniformly      in terms of the states and their citizens. Article I, section      2 provides that, ``[t]he House of Representatives shall be      composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of      the several States . . . . No person shall be a      Representative . . . who shall not, when elected, be an      Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.''      Article I, section 3 provides that, ``[t]he Senate of the      United States shall be composed of two Senators from each      State . . . . No Person shall be a Senator. . . . who shall      not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which      he shall be chosen.'' With respect to the election of the      President, Article II, section 1 provides that, ``[e]ach      State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature      thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole      Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may      be entitled in the Congress.'' The Seventeenth Amendment      directs that ``[t]he Senate of the United States shall be      composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the      people thereof.'' In short, ``[d]irect representation in the      Congress by a voting member has never been a right of United      States citizenship. Instead, the right to be so represented      has been a right of the citizens of the States.''       The word ``state'' as used in Article I may not be      interpreted to include the District of Columbia, even though      as a ``distinct political society'' it might qualify under a      more general definition of that term. Consistent with the      intent of the Framers, such arguments were properly dismissed      long ago by Chief Justice Marshall in Hepburn v. Ellzey. In      that case, plaintiffs, residents of the District, claimed      that they were citizens of a state for purposes of diversity      jurisdiction in the federal courts. The Court rejected this      position. Marshall reasoned that Congress had adopted the      definition of ``state'' as found in the Constitution in the      act providing for diversity jurisdiction, and that the      capital could not be considered such a ``state''. Citing      Article I, sections 2 and 3, and Article II, section 1, he      concluded that ``the members of the American confederacy      only are the states contemplated.'' ``These clauses show      that the word state is used in the constitution as      designating a member of     the union, and excludes from the term the significance      attached to it by writers on the law of nations.''      Congress, to be sure, has often treated the District of      Columbia as a state for purposes of statutory benefit      programs. It is customarily included in the major federal      grant programs by the well-worn phrase ``for purposes of      this legislation, the term `State' shall include the      District of Columbia.'' The courts, also, have      occasionally interpreted the word ``state'' to include the      District of Columbia. However, the District has never been      automatically included under the term ``state'' even in      federal statutes. In District of Columbia v. Carter, the      Supreme Court held that it was not a ``State or      Territory'' under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, which creates a      federal cause of action for civil rights violations under      color of state law. Under the test articulated by Justice      Brennan in that case, ``[w]hether the District of Columbia      constitutes a ``State or Territory'' within the meaning of      any particular statutory or constitutional provision      depends upon the character and aim of the specific      provision involved.'' In any event, allowing the District      to participate on an equal footing with the states in      federal statutory programs is different in kind from      reading the language of the Constitution itself in such a      way as to allow alteration of the very composition of the      Congress by legislative fiat.       The Constitutional mandate is clear. Only United States      citizens who are also citizens of a state are entitled to      elect members of Congress. This is hardly a novel      proposition. There are many different levels of rights      recognized in our system. Aliens, for instance, enjoy certain      basic rights, including the benefit of the Equal Protection      Clause but are not citizens of the United States and have no      vote. The residents of United States possessions overseas      also enjoy the protection of the Constitution, but may not      vote in federal elections. Many of them are United States      citizens--the residents of Puerto Rico and Guam, for      instance, fit this category. Like the residents of the      District of Columbia, American citizens who are not also      citizens of a state do not participate in congressional      elections, and they never have enjoyed such participation.      The residents of the District of Columbia may not participate      directly in congressional elections without becoming citizens      of a state, or without an amendment to the Constitution.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I had the honor of raising my right hand and reciting a solemn oath required by the Constitution itself. According to that oath, the first and last duty of a U.S. Senator is to support and defend the U.S. Constitution. By opposing the legislation before us, I believe I am doing both.  The Constitution is short because its authors wanted to be clear, and on the issue of congressional representation they could not have been more so. According to Article I, Section II, only States elect Members of Congress. And, according to the same article, the seat of the Federal Government is not to be considered a State. So the question before us is not whether the Framers meant for the seat of Government to have representation in Congress. They clearly did not. Rather, the question before us is why they didn't want the seat of Government to have representation. And, as a follow-up: What recourse did they leave those who might want to revise what they had written.  In answer to the first question, the Framers opposed statehood for a number of good reasons. First, they didn't want the Federal Government to be beholden to a single State, a situation that would of course unfairly benefit the residents of that State, either materially or through added prestige, at the expense of all the other States. Second, they wanted the Federal Government to have the freedom to relocate if the need arose.  This was not an easy issue for the Framers. But the plain text of the Constitution leaves no doubt as to how they came down on the question: In the end, they decided the interests of the whole were best served by carving out a Federal district that stood apart from the States. This way Federal officials would be able to protect the interests of the whole and give the Federal Government the freedom it would need to operate with complete independence and freedom of movement.  Clearly, not everyone is satisfied with the result. But there should be no doubt about what the words of the Constitution says--not just on the day it was ratified, but throughout our history.  The 23rd amendment, for instance, gave Washington, DC the same number of electoral votes that it would receive as ``if it were a state.'' What this means, of course, is that at the time this amendment was ratified in 1961, no one was under the illusion that DC was a State--or that it should be treated as one, short of a constitutional amendment.  Clearly, the Framers recognized the deficiencies of the final product. In creating a Federal district, they knew permanent residents of that district would lack representation in Congress. And this is why they left us a remedy within the Constitution itself. If and when the ``People of the United States'' wished to revise the U.S. Constitution, they could do so by amending it, just as they did in 1961.  The process of amendment is clearly outlined in article V, and it has served the American people well for more than two centuries. Over the years, we have amended our founding document 27 times. From eradicating slavery, to securing the right to vote for women, to putting a limit on the years a President can serve in office, the people of the United States have used the amendment process as the way to secure or expand rights.  So the surest way to honor the aspirations of DC residents is to pursue a remedy which respects the Constitution. One way is through a constitutional amendment that uses the same language as the bill before us. Another would be to allow the residents of the District to vote as if they were residents of a bordering State, or even to declare them residents of a bordering State.  As the Senate's greatest student and fiercest living guardian of the Constitution, the senior Senator from West Virginia, said just last year on the Senate floor:       If we wish to grant representatives of the citizens of the      District of Columbia full voting rights, ``let us do so, once      again, the proper way, by passing a resolution to amend the      Constitution consistent with its own terms.''  The bottom line is this: Any proposal to secure the right to vote must honor the Constitution, which Lincoln called the ``only safeguard of our liberties.'' Anything less would violate the oath we have sworn to uphold, and would guarantee a challenge in the courts that would only further prolong this debate.  The better way is the surer way--and that's the constitutional way.  I will oppose this proposal. I urge my colleagues to do the same.
