President, we were very proud to present to all of America today Miss America, Shawntel Smith. She has requested that I submit her statement, which she made today on the lawn of the Capitol, for the Record.  I ask unanimous consent at this time to have printed in the Record the statement by the new Miss America, and former Miss Oklahoma, Shawntel Smith.  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            School-to-Work: Reinventing America's Work Force       (Platform Statement of Shawntel Smith, Miss America 1996)       As global communications and technological propel us toward      the 21st century, we Americans are falling further and      further behind. Everyday, millions of men and women wake up      and go to work in jobs that fall short of their American      dream, while in some places as many as 50% of our high school      students simply drop out. Because many American workers and      students are neither motivated nor clear about their economic      future, they flounder.       As a nation, our competitive positions remains stagnant.      Lagging productivity growth rates, rising unemployment and      the absence of a skilled work force widen the gap between      America and its competitors. American business and industry      struggle to fill the jobs that exist because candidates lack      the skills and education to make the grade.       America's classrooms and America's workplace today are out      of sync. We're simply not preparing our nation's youth for      the high skill, high wage jobs of a technology-based economy,      and for that we all suffer. Students who cannot find the      relevance in what they're learning, adults who cannot replace      lost jobs, educators who cannot motivate their students, and      employers who cannot compete.       As Miss America and as a student, I advocate school-to-work      solutions that prepare today's students for tomorrow's      workplace, providing them with appropriate and clearly marked      paths from school to work or to continuing education. In      doing so, I will encourage partnerships among the educators,      employers, employee groups, students, parents, government and      community leaders that spawn local school-to-work      initiatives. Such initiatives not only offer ``first chance''      opportunities to students entering the work force but      ``second chance'' opportunities to the unemployed and      underemployed as well.       My very first priority will be to generate awareness for      the school-to-work philosophy, reaching out to those who      deserve its benefits but as yet are unaware of its existence.      As I travel this country, I will seek out effective      partnerships between educators, employers and students,      sharing their stories with those who care to hear. I will      speak with a sense of urgency because, in this case, there is      no time to spare.       Among educators, I will encourage them to provide high-     standards academic and relevant education that prepares all      students for college, vocational or technical training,      career education or immediate entry into the work force. I      will ask them to take responsibility for ensuring that      America's students be ready to succeed in a high-technology      workplace.       Among employers, I will urge them to ensure the future      competitiveness of America by taking an active role in the      development of educational curricula and by providing work-     based learning opportunities for all students. I will also      ask them to examine the investments they make in human      capital and to provide job training and retraining to all      levels within the workplace.       Among students, I will motivate them to discover their      personal paths from the classroom to the workplace, showing      them that the American Dream is still attainable. I will      challenge them to stay in school, so they can take from the      education process what they'll need to succeed in the world      of work. and I will help them understand that the process of      lifelong learning is the key to their productivity and      happiness.       From America's classrooms to its tool rooms to its board      rooms, I will serve as a catalyst for change by shining the      Miss America spotlight on and bringing a forceful voice to      this new movement, a movement which seeks to put all      Americans to work and makes our country strong and      competitive once more.       These pledges I make today, the 11th day of October, 1995.                          ____________________
