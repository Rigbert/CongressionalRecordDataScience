President, the Government of the United States partially has been shut down. That is the issue here. We can have the debate that the gentleman just discussed--not a word about opening up the people's government, not a word about 800,000 people who are not getting their salaries, not a word of the financial instability that he is subjecting 800,000 people to, ``he'' being the President of the United States. They are being held hostage for the ransom of doing what they believe is the right thing to do on border security.  However, Mr. Hurd says--a Republican who has more border mileage onthe border than any other congressional district in America--what the President wants to do is not the right thing.  Senator Ron Johnson says a similar quote. Lindsey Graham said he thought it was a bad investment. Now, he didn't say it yesterday or the day before. He said it about a year ago.
