Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate an extraordinary team of young women from Maryland's fifth congressional district. The Northern High School Patriots won the 3A Maryland ``state softball finals on May 26, 2012. This is their fifth consecutive softball state championship and ninth softball championship overall. This incredible achievement was made all the more significant given the caliber of their competition.  After an undefeated season, the Patriots emerged victorious over Thomas Stone High School, Chopticon High School, Huntingtown High School, and Reservoir High School to ultimately meet Linganore High School in the state championship game at Robert E. Taylor Stadium at the University of Maryland. The Patriots prevailed, overcoming the Linganore Lancers with a final score of 10 0.  This victory demonstrates that with determination, willpower, and discipline we can work to overcome any obstacle in the path of achieving success. The Northern High School Softball team has gone above and beyond expectations. The Patriots end their 2012 season not only with a state championship, but also a perfect record of 25 0. Additionally, Northern High School has become the first softball program in state history to win five consecutive state titles.  Eighteen student-athletes contributed to this triumphant season, remaining focused and determined to continue the streak of Northern High School softball state championships.  Mr. Speaker, I offer my heartiest congratulations to the members of the championship team--Jessie Clemons, Kierstie Schaefer, Jess Cummings, Sarah Bennett, Sam Gatton, Caroline Clarry, Marleigh Smith, Lindsey Schmeiser, Madison Marinaccio, Baylee Hutchinson, Erin Adams, Julie Keleti, Carleigh Ruleman, Kristina Lozupone, Kailin Case, Allison Garzone, Kayla Grantham, and Sabrina Beil--on their victory. And, I also want to applaud Head Coach Robert Earl Radford and his coaching staff--Devin Hall, Beth Radford, and Qyntia Parks-Lewis--for their dedication and commitment while guiding these talented student-athletes.  Like all Southern Marylanders, I am very proud of these young women and I congratulate all of those involved in bringing home a state title. I ask that my colleagues join me in applauding this great accomplishment.                          ____________________
