Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1964, introduced by my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and amended by the Committee on Resources, would authorize the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to provide financial assistance to States to preserve and protect high priority conservation lands in the Highlands region. This geographic region encompasses over 2 million acres of land stretching from western Connecticut across the Lower Hudson River Valley and northern New Jersey into northeastern Pennsylvania.  Mr. Speaker, not only has the U.S. Forest Service documented the national significance of the Highlands area in two extensive studies in 1990 and 2002, but the President in his 2004 budget recognized the New York-New Jersey Highlands forest area as one of nine priority forests areas in the country that are threatened.  H.R. 1964, as amended, is supported by the administration and the majority and minority of the committee. I urge adoption of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  (
