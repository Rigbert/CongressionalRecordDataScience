McGovern's formulation, but that's what this body is for: to debate these issues of great importance to the people and resolve them in a democratic way.  I'm sorely disappointed that this amendment was not made in order. If it had, I would have voted for it.  In September, Speaker Boehner, himself, said something significant. Madam Speaker, it's important what the Speaker said, and I agree with what the Speaker said. He said this:       I have no fear in allowing the House to work its will . . .      I've long believed in it, and I continue to believe in it.  Madam Speaker, the actions of the Rules Committee last night were inconsistent with that conviction. Let the House work its will. Let's have a vote on this amendment. Let us send a message to our troops that we have an exit strategy in Afghanistan, that we'll see them safely home with their mission accomplished.
