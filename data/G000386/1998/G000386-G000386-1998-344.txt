 President, when many think of Iowa, they think of people with spirit, discipline, and a good old-fashioned work ethic. When sports enthusiasts think of Iowa, they think of superior college wrestling.  Two weekends ago in Cleveland, Ohio, for the fourth consecutive year, for the 7th time in the past 8 years, and for the 16th time in the last 21 years, the University of Iowa won the college wrestling national championship. Two weeks prior, for the 25th consecutive year, Iowa won the Big Ten Conference Championships. Individual titles were won by Mark Ironside, Jeff McGinness and Joe Williams and three other Iowans became All-Americans by placing second.  Imagine the attention a school would get if it won two, three or four consecutive NCAA basketball tournaments. Yet the University of Iowa's dominance in NCAA wrestling has become almost routine. Nevertheless, this year's victory was anything but routine. Because this year, Iowa won without its legendary coach, Dan Gable, who took the season off and is contemplating retirement.  As many know, Dan Gable is the world's most notable ambassador for the sport of wrestling. Gable grew up in Iowa and compiled a 64-0 high school record. He attended Iowa State, where he was 118-1, and went on to win the Gold Medal at the Olympics in Munich in 1972. He won the Olympic tournament without allowing an opponent to score a single point against him.  Gable then went on to coach at the University of Iowa and win 15 national championships in his 21 years as coach. In doing so, he coached 9 consecutive national championships from 1978-1986 which is an NCAA record for all sports. Incidently, that streak was broken by Iowa State University who placed 6th this year in Cleveland.  Though he is largely unheralded outside of amateur athletics, his formula for success is as simple as it is difficult--hard work. Gable once said, ``Like anything in life, it's not hard to be the best. It is as simple as outworking the opponent.'' His motto is ``Hard work solves anything.'' But Gable didn't just say the words, he lived them. And he demanded his wrestlers live them as well.  Following Gable's 1971 Gold Medal victory in the World Championships in Bulgaria, he celebrated by taking a long run. For most, that was a time to relax, to enjoy your success. For Dan Gable it was an opportunity to get one practice ahead of any opponent he might face in the upcoming 1972 Olympic Games.  The notion of work and preparation is almost second nature in an agricultural state such as Iowa, where folks understand that you cannot harvest what you do not sow. That's why the other secret to the success of Iowa wrestling is that most of its wrestlers are Iowans. Seven out of the ten wrestlers that Iowa qualified for nationals are from the state of Iowa.  Furthermore the second-place team, Minnesota, a suburb of Iowa in wrestling terms, is coached by a former product of Iowa wrestling. And the coaches of Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana are former Iowa wrestlers. Iowa's new coaches, Jim Zalesky, Lincoln McIlravy, Tom Brands and twin-brother Terry Brands collectively won 10 NCAA individual titles while wrestling for Dan Gable.  Gable once said the biggest benefit of sports is that ``* * * it teaches an athlete to deal with adversity and adversity builds character.'' Perhaps, the greatest testament to Iowa's character is that they won a National Championship without Dan Gable. No one would have wanted that more than Gable himself.  Former NFL-great Frank Gifford commented, ``Dan Gable is the most dedicated athlete I have ever known.'' The impact of his dedication prevails even in his absence, as the tradition of Iowa's wrestling dominance marches forward. Old-fashioned hard work still lives in Iowas and it still works for Iowa.  My congratulations to Iowa wrestling--the National Champions again!                          ____________________
