 President, I am glad to see that Senate Democrats have finally ended their obstruction of the bipartisan student loan bill. It has been weeks since the Democrats blew past the July 1 deadline they kept warning about, and it has been even longer since the House passed a bill similar to the one they are actually now agreeing to. But at least Democrats have finally stopped obstructing and arguing. At least now they are ready to put their partisan political fix aside and join President Obama and congressional Republicans in enacting real permanent reform for all students--the only real reform on the table that is designed to help every middle-class family.  I would like to thank the sponsors of this bill for their hard work: Senators Manchin, King, Alexander, Burr, and Coburn.
