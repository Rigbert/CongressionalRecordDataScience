Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the 107th Congress is only a few months old, but it is already apparent that this is going to be one that works to keep America's promises to veterans and their families. Later today we will begin consideration of H. Con. Res. 83, the congressional budget resolution, which contains record levels of funding for veterans' programs. As a matter of fact, it contains a 12 percent boost for VA spending, both mandatory and discretionary, to bring it to $52.3 billion, a $5.6 billion increase over fiscal year 2001.  In the past month, Mr. Speaker, the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs has met 10 times to hear the views of the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as veterans' organizations. We have heard from organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Gold Star Wives, the National Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs, the Retired Enlisted Association, Fleet Reserve Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, the Jewish War Veterans, Blinded Veterans Association, Noncommissioned Officers Association, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, Amvets, American Ex-Prisoners of War, Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Retired Officers Association, 16 organizations in all.  Mr. Speaker, we learned a great deal about what is taking place in the lives of veterans and their families. We also learned about government programs that are effective and making a difference in their lives, and about some that need to be revised and updated and reformed.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage Members and their constituents to visit the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Website to review the testimony presented at these hearings to learn more about these hearings and the testimony that we have received. For the Record, that is http://veterans.gov/. It is a font of information and a great resource on veterans legislation and hearings.  Mr. Speaker, we also heard during the course of those hearings from our distinguished VA Secretary Anthony Principi on two of those occasions. We heard about his determination to make the VA a more responsive and a more effective organization. Members of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs also told the Secretary that it is not enough that a grateful Nation remember its veterans and their sacrifice. The Nation that provides in excess of $47 billion, and as I said, that is likely to jump to $52.3 billion for veterans' programs, expects the VA to be held accountable.  We need accountability to make sure that that which we pass is faithfully implemented. We hope that in the future Secretary Principi will share this message with all of his employees. We really want the best bang for the buck. We want our veterans to be well served.  Today the House is considering two measures reported by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs last week. I would like to briefly summarize the purposes of the Veterans Opportunities Act of 2001. The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Hayworth), the very distinguished chairman of our Subcommittee on Benefits, will provide a more detailed explanation of the bill momentarily.  Mr. Speaker, the Veterans Opportunities Act of 2001 is designed to enhance nonhealth programs serving veterans and their families. Many of the ideas contained in this bill were favorably mentioned in the testimony we received from the veterans' service organizations during the 107th Congress. One of this bill's provisions updates the law governing the type of training veterans can pursue under the Montgomery GI bill. We see more and more education and training opportunities offered outside of the traditional classroom setting. Veterans pursuing a good job should be able to use their GI benefits to offset the cost of these courses, and this bill will make those types of training more affordable to veterans eligible for the Montgomery GI bill.  The life insurance program available to all active duty servicemembers and many reservists does not provide coverage to members of the servicemember's family. Since so many persons on active duty today desire coverage for family members at an affordable premium, this bill would authorize that coverage.                              {time}  1415  The bill also includes a provision to make the increase in life insurance coverage, which is scheduled to go into effect next Sunday, April 1, retroactive to cover the deaths of many of the service members who have tragically lost their lives since October 1 of last year.  I want to salute the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes), the ranking Democrat of the Subcommittee on Benefits, and the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Jo Ann Davis), a new member, for suggesting this provision in the bill.  H.R. 801 also authorizes increases in payments to families of deceased veterans for burial expenses and in amounts provided to assist seriously disabled veterans purchase cars and to fix up their homes with specially adapted devices. It also requires the VA to improve its outreach efforts so that more veterans and their families are informed about the benefits for which they qualify.  Another provision is designed to ensure that service members are fully briefed on benefits that they may qualify for before they leave the service.  Before yielding to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), I want to express my very deep appreciation for his hard work and that of our staff and his staff and many, many Members on the bills that we are discussing today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
