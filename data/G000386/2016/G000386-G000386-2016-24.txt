 President, I come to the floor for the same reason Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire is here. I rise today to speak on the Survivors' Bill of Rights. This is a noncontroversial and very bipartisan bill. It has already passed the Senate.  Amanda Nguyen is a rape victim and a survivor who has been the driving force behind this legislation. She is founder and president of an organization that goes by the acronym RISE, agroup which advocates on behalf of survivors of sexual violence. Amanda has worked hand in hand with both political parties on this bill to establish new rights for survivors of sexual violence. That is the way it should be because regardless of political party, all Members of Congress should be empowering survivors of sexual violence. However, while Republicans were ready to move forward on this bill last week, Democratic leadership has been stalling Amanda's diligent efforts.  This bill ensures that all survivors of sexual violence have equal access to all available tools in their pursuit of justice. This includes the proper collection and preservation of forensic evidence that is so vital in cases of sexual violence. This bill also guarantees these survivors a new package of rights.  As I said, this is a bipartisan bill, very noncontroversial. It has already passed this body 89 to 0.  Each day, others like Amanda will fall victim to sexual violence. The Senate should not wait one more day to help these people seek justice, so, after Senator Shaheen speaks, I am here now to request unanimous consent to move this bill. My understanding is that it is now OK with the Democrats to agree to the passage of this legislation.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, hopefully for the purpose of Senator Shaheen stating her views on this bill.
