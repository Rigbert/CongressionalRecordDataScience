 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a longtime friend and a fixture of the broadcasting industry in Kentucky and nationally, Mr. Steve Newberry. For more than 25 years, Steve, a resident of Hiseville, KY, has been a leader in Kentucky radio. He has earned the respect and admiration of his peers in the Commonwealth and throughout the country many times over. I am sad to note that next month, Steve will complete his service on the board of directors of the National Association of Broadcasters.  Over the course of his career, Steve has helped lead radio and television broadcasters on a national level, and he has had a significant impact on the broadcasting industry. This was recognized when in 2011 Steve received from his peers the prestigious National Radio Award, which is given annually to an outstanding leader in the radio industry.  Steve loved radio from an early age. He began his broadcasting career at the age of 14, when he got a job working at the local radio station in his hometown of Glasgow, KY. His parents were supportive of Steve's dream and drove him to work at that first job.  By the age of 21, Steve owned his first radio station. When he bought it, it was a 250-watt AM station that only broadcast in the daytime. Steve soon upgraded it to 500 watts and 24 hours of broadcasting a day.  Steve attended the University of Kentucky, where he received a bachelor's degree in telecommunications. While completing his senior year, he bought WKVE, an AM station in Cave City. Today he is the president and CEO of Commonwealth Broadcasting, based in Glasgow, and owns and operates 22 radio stations throughout the Bluegrass State.  As his business grew, Steve became more and more engaged in broadcasting industry matters. He was first elected to the board of directors of the National Association of Broadcasters, NAB, in 1999. He would go on to serve as part of the board's leadership, chairman of the board, and ultimately as the NAB joint board chairman, the association's top industry leadership post. Steve also served on the board of directors and executive committees for the Radio Advertising Bureau.  Steve's community service in Kentucky is equally impressive. He has served as the chairman of the Authority for Kentucky Educational Television and has worked with the Glasgow-Barren County Industrial Development Economic Authority, the Glasgow Rotary Club, and the Glasgow-Barren County Boys & Girls Club.  Steve is a past president of the Kentucky Broadcasters Association and in 2009 received their highest honor, the Distinguished Kentuckian Award. And as I already stated, Mr. President, in 2011 he received the very high honor from his peers of the prestigious National Radio Award.  It is the Commonwealth's loss that in June, Steve will end his service on the NAB board of directors. Whatever endeavors may lay ahead for him, I know he will dispatch them with the same success that has marked his career to date. I am sure his family, including his wife Vickie and his son Walker, are very proud of him.  Steve Newberry is one of Kentucky's finest broadcasters and a man of integrity. I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in congratulating him for his dedication to the radio profession, to his community, and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                          ____________________
