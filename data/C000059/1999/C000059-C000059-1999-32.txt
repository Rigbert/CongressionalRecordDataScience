HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, of course, this is a conversation, too, that I know the chairman of the full committee is very interested in; he is a very important part of this, and I appreciate this opportunity to respond to this inquiry.  As many Members with Reserve components in their district know, such as the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert) with March Air Reserve Base, the Nation's Reserve components currently play a very key role in our Nation's air mobility capacity. We could not be involved in the air campaign right now without that Reserve component.  As has been displayed in this recent conflict, the Reserve units are being heavily utilized both in air mobility and other key areas. I believe that this trend of relying on Reserve components will only continue to increase. But we should ensure that these units are outfitted with the most technologically advanced resources available. And once again, the C-17 has done a great job.
