 President, I have come to the floor to clarify an issue regarding the security at the two uranium enrichment facilities. Section 310 of the conference report which deals with the allocation between the Department and the private corporation leasing the gaseous diffusion plants of the cost of arming and providing arrest authority to security police officers at the plants. I want to make it very clear that this section does not affect the current responsibility of the Department to pay for security for the Department's highly enriched uranium activities.  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the officials with the Department of Energy and the officials from the newly privatized United States Enrichment Corporation who sat down with my office and negotiated in good faith a solution to this difficult matter. I am pleased to have an agreement once and for all.                          ____________________
