 The Senator from Missouri is not on the Rules Committee, but he developed an interest in this issue. His interest and passion is a direct result of the voter fraud issues in his home State, which he has skillfully sought to make much more difficult to happen in the future.  The parts of this bill related to fraud are entirely the result of the tireless efforts of the Senator from Missouri, and I wanted to express my gratitude to him for his intelligence, tenacity, and effectiveness in turning this into a bill I can enthusiastically and wholeheartedly support. I wish to assure him that we are going to try very hard at the conference to make sure this bill still has the important features he has worked to have included.  I yield the floor.
