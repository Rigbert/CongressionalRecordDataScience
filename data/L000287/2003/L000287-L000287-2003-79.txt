Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek), my friend and colleague, for holding this Special Order, and I want to thank all of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus for participating in this order tonight.  I want to be very brief. I had gone home and I turn on C-SPAN, and supper was happening, and I was deeply moved to come to the House floor and to say something. So I want to thank him again for doing what he is doing because I think it is important that we take time to salute and pay tribute to the young people who came here on April 1. By coming here and standing at the steps of the Supreme Court, they were standing up for what is right, for what is fair, for what is just. They were standing up for the very best in America.  I remember when I first came to Washington many, many years ago in 1961, I was 21 years old, had all of my hair, and I was a few pounds lighter, to go on something called the Freedom Ride during those days in Washington, but throughout the American South, segregation was the order of the day. We saw those signs that said white waiting, colored waiting, white men, colored men, white women, colored women. There was so much violence, so much fear, so much hate, and it was the students following in the tradition of Martin Luther King, Jr., in the tradition of Gandhi. So sitting in, going on the Freedom Ride, marching all over the country, and by marching, by sitting in or sitting down, really they have created the climate, the environment, to get the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965.                              {time}  2130  Nothing but nothing, I tell you, nothing moved me more in the last 50 years, or maybe in the last 40 years, than to see these hundreds and thousands of students really marching, protesting, exercising their constitutional right. In America we have a right to protest, as Dr. King would say, protest for what is right. This type of protest helped move our country to the point to get people to say yes, when they may have a desire to say no.  These young people believe in the Constitution. They believe in America. They, like many of us, believe in affirmative action. It is the affirmed inclusion, the participation of people, where they are left out and left behind. I like to think these young people were touched by the spirit of history. Sometimes there comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history.  In 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963 we did not have a fax machine, we did not have a Web site, we did not have a cellular telephone. We had the Constitution. We had our bodies. And that is what these young people had. They had ideas; they had the Constitution.  I think when historians pick up their pens and write about this period, Mr. Speaker, they will have to say that these young people that came to Washington on April 1, not just college students, high school students, elementary school students, by the hundreds and thousands, they started, as the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) said, a new civil rights movement.  I say to them tonight, and to young people and students all over our country, we will not go back, we will not stand still. We will go forward. We will create a truly interracial democracy in America. We will create a beloved community in America. For we are one people, we are one Nation. I say to all of these young people, keep the faith; do not give up, do not give in, do not give out, keep your eyes on the prize.
