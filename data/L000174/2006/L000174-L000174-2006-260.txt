President, I know the distinguished Senator from Virginia is going to be recognized, but I have a quick housekeeping issue.  The distinguished chairman, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, and I want to make sure we go back and forth, side to side. So following the distinguished Senator from Virginia, we will go to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. Following the next Republican, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be recognized for 15 minutes.
