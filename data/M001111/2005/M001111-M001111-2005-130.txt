 President, this amendment makes small revisions to the provision in the bill mandating the continued operation of the emergency landing field at Midway Island Atoll in the Pacific.  The bill before us, for the third consecutive year, requires a cost-sharing agreement between the appropriate Federal agencies for the continued operation of this critical airfield.  This amendment would clarify that among the costs that must be covered by the Federal agencies are the necessary capital costs for the replacement of the aged fuel farm on the island.  I am not aware of any objection on either side. I ask for adoption of the amendment.
