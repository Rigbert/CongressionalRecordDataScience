Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a criminal action pending in federal district court. In this action, the defendant is charged with eleven counts for sending threatening communications in interstate commerce, including sending threatening faxes to Senator Feinstein. Trial is set for later this month in the Eastern District of Virginia.  The government is sending trial testimony from the employee in Senator Feinstein's office who received and handled the incoming faxes. Senator Feinstein would like to cooperate with this request.  This resolution would accordingly authorize the staffer to testify as trial and to be represented by the Senate Legal Counsel.                            ____________________
