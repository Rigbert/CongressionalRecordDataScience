 President, I rise today to congratulate Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi on passage of this very important legislation. I also thank them for their assistance in including within the Higher Education Amendments Act of 2007 a bill I have worked on, the Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program.
