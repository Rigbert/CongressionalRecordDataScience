 President, I, along with Senators Boxer, Moseley-Braun, and Snowe would like to introduce the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act.  In a time of shrinking budgets and resources for breast cancer research, this legislation would provide an innovative way to provide additional funding for breast cancer research.  This bill would: authorize the U.S. Postal Service to issue an optional special first class stamp to be priced at 1 cent above the cost of normal first-class postage; earmark a penny of every stamp for breast cancer research; provide administrative costs from the revenues for post office expenses; and clarify current law, that any similar stamp would require an act of Congress to be issued in the future.  If only 10 percent of all the first class mail used this optional 33 cent stamp, $60 million could be raised for breast cancer research annually.  There is wide support for this legislation. Congressman Fazio, along with 62 cosponsors have already introduced the companion bill in the House.  The breast cancer epidemic has been called this Nation's best kept secret. There are 2.6 million women in America today with breast cancer, 1 million of whom have yet to be diagnosed with the disease.  In 1996, an estimated 184,000 will be diagnosed with, and 44,300 will die from, breast cancer. It is the No. 1 killer of women ages 40 to 44 and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 15 to 54, claiming a woman's life every 12 minutes in this country.  For California, 17,100 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 4,100 women will die from the disease in 1996.  In addition to the cost of women's lives, the annual cost of treatment of beast cancer in the United States is approximately $10 billion. This means the average American woman will have $5,000 added to her health care costs because of the disease.  Over the last 25 years, the National Institutes of Health has spent over $31.5 billion on cancer research--$2 billion of that on breast cancer. In the last 6 years alone, appropriations for breast cancer research have risen from $90 million in 1990 to $600 million today. That is the good news.  But, the bad news is that the national commitment to cancer research overall has been hamstrung since 1980. Currently, NIH is able to fund only 23 percent of applications received by all the institutes. For the Cancer Institute, only 23 percent can be funded--significant drop from the 60 percent of applications funded in the 1970's.  Most alarming is the rapidly diminishing grant funding available for new researcher applicants.  In real numbers, the National Cancer Institute will fund approximately 3,600 research projects, of which about 1,000 are new, previously unfunded activities. For investigator-initiated research, only 600 out of 1,900 research projects will be new.  The United States is privileged to have some of the most talented scientists and many of the leading cancer research centers in the world such as UCLA, UC San Francisco, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and the M.D. Anderson.  This lack of funding is starving some of the most important research--because scientists will have to look elsewhere for their livelihood.  The United States must reverse the trend of diminishing research funds if these scientists and institutions are to continue to contribute their vast talents to the war on cancer and finding a cure.  What is clear is that there is a direct correlation between increases in research funding and the likelihood of finding a cure.  Cancer mortality has declined by 15 percent from 1950 to 1992 due to increases in cancer research funding. In fact, federally funded cancer research has yielded vast amounts of knowledge about the disease--information which is guiding our efforts to improve treatment and search for a cure. We have more knowledge and improvements in prevention through: identification of a cancer gene, use of mammographies, clinical exams, and encouragement of self breast exams. Yet there is still no cure.  The Bay Area has one of the highest rates of breast cancer incidence and mortality in the world. According to data given to my staff by the Northern California Cancer Center, Bay Area white women have the highest reported breast cancer rate in the world, 104 per 100,000 population. Bay Area African-American women have the fourth highest reported rate in the world at 82 per 100,000.  I want to recognize Dr. Balazs (Ernie) Bodai who suggested this innovative funding approach. Dr. Bodai is the chief of the surgery department at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group in Sacramento, CA. He is the founder of Cure Cancer Now, which is a nonprofit organization committed to developing a funding source for breast cancer research.  As you know, last week the Postal Service introduced their breast cancer awareness stamp. Although the issuance of the awareness stamp was an important step toward educating the public about the disease, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act is a new and different effort in that it would actually raise funds for the NIH research on breast cancer, and if the stamps were purchased and not used, the postal service would still make money.  This legislation is also supported by the American Cancer Society, Association of Operating Room Nurses, California Health Collaborative Foundations, YWCA-Encore Plus, the Sacramento City Council and Mayor Joe Serna, Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors, Sutter County Board of Supervisors, Nevada County Board of Supervisors, Yuba City Council, California State Senator Diane Watson and California State Assemblywoman Dede Alpert as well as the Public Employees Union, San Joaquin Public Employees Association, and Sutter and Yuba County Employees Association.  Given the intense competition for Federal research funds in a climate of shrinking budgets, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act would allow anyone who uses the postal service to contribute in finding a cure for the breast cancer epidemic.  In a sense, this particular proposal is a pilot. I recognize that the postal service may oppose this since it has not been done before. I also recognize that in a day of diminishing Federal resources, this innovation is an idea whose time has come.  It will make money for the post office and for breast cancer research. No one is forced to buy it, but women's organizations may even wish to sell the stamps in a fundraising effort.  The administrative costs can be handled with the 1 cent added on the 32 cent stamp and conservatively it can make from $60 million per year for NIH's research on breast cancer.  We need to find a cure for breast cancer and I believe the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act is an innovative response to the hidden epidemic among women. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
