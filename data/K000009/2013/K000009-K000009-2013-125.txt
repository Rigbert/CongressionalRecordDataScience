Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the amendment.  While I understand our colleague's position, our Nation has spent upwards of $10- to $15 billion on Yucca Mountain as a repository.  When we first voted on Yucca Mountain many years ago, I opposed it. Now our Nation has made this enormous investment and one does question whether we know what we are doing and whether what we are left with is a monument to wasted resources.  Admittedly, the court cases have not been finalized. The former Secretary of Energy has stated many times that the administration would follow any direction that resulted from ongoing litigation. The bill provides funds should that eventuality occur.  At a minimum, we should learn if the licensing process can work. It was not that many years ago that completing the licensing process was the stated plan of the Department.  So again, I reluctantly oppose the amendment being offered tonight. America has to reach a decision about what we do with spent nuclear waste. I think this amendment takes us in the wrong direction at this time.  We also respect the sensitivities of the people of Nevada. They have a right to have their voices heard in this process. But as a country, we have to recognize the amount of money that's been spent by taxpayers from all of the States and the need that we have at these power plants and facilities to process this material.  I reluctantly rise in opposition to the amendment in hopes that we can reach agreement as a country on this important issue, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heck).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
