 President, today the Senate will again resume debate on H.R. 3108, the pension rate bill. Under the agreement reached yesterday, there will be 40 minutes of debate prior to disposing of the Kyl amendment No. 2236 regarding the general funding waiver. That amendment may not require a rollcall vote; therefore, we may be able to proceed to a vote on passage of the legislation prior to noon today.  In addition to completing the pension rate bill, the majority leader will be discussing with the Democratic leadership the possibility of a vote on a district judge nomination that has been available on the Executive Calendar. Therefore, additional votes may occur today and we will alert Members when that vote is confirmed.  For the remainder of the week, both sides of the aisle will be conducting retreats. Because of these important policy conferences, the Senate will be in pro forma session tomorrow, and we will be out of session on Friday. The leader will have more to say on next week's schedule at the close of business today.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
