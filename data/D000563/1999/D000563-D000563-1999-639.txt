President, as reports come in detailing the events in Kosovo, the ``ethnic cleansing'' and terror that has forced over a million people from their homes, sadness fills our hearts. Less than two weeks ago I traveled to the Balkans and visited a refugee camp, filled with thousands of people, that had been an empty field just weeks before. We are often so immersed in the accounts of those survivors who have lived through the suffering that we forget about the men and women who have dedicated their lives to ease this pain, and to bringing those who abuse human rights to justice.  Today, I rise to recognize M. Cherif Bassiouni of Chicago, Illinois for his selflessness and dedication to bringing those who commit crimes against humanity to justice. Professor Bassiouni, facing great personal risk and many obstacles, has visited many war-torn sections of Bosnia and Croatia, documenting the atrocities and crimes that have been committed there. His 3,500 pages of analysis, backed by 300 hours of videotape and 65,000 documents served as the foundation for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Professor Bassiouni has also played a key role in the UN Convention against Torture.  Professor Bassiouni has often been a powerful voice insisting that violators of human rights be brought to justice. Professor Bassiouni is a Professor of Law and President of the International Human Rights Law Institute at DePaul University in Chicago. The global impact of his work, dating back to 1964, has led to the creation of the International Criminal Court. A citizen of both the United States and Egypt, Professor Bassiouni is known and respected around the world for his accomplishments. He is the President of the Association Internationale de Troit Penal and President of the International Institute of Higher Studies in Criminal Science.  Professor Bassiouni has accomplished a great deal in his effort to see that human rights are respected. In 1977, Bassiouni co-chaired the committee that drafted the U.N. Convention Against Torture. He was appointed the independent expert by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to draft the statute establishing international jurisdiction over the implementation of the Apartheid Convention of 1981. Bassiouni was the Chairman of the U.N. Commission investigating international humanitarian law violations in the former Yugoslavia, work that led to the Ad-Hoc Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague. His many accomplishments led to his election in 1995 as Vice-Chairman of the U.N. General Assembly Committee for the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  For his work leading to the establishment of the International Criminal Court, and for his dedication to protecting human rights, Professor Bassiouni has been nominated for the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize. The nominating organization, the International and Scientific Professional Advisory Council of the UN has said that Professor Bassiouni was the ``single most driving force behind the global decision to establish the International Criminal Court.'' This court prosecutes and brings to justice internationally, those who have committed crimes against humanity. His accomplishments in this field have caused Professor Bassiouni to be known as the ``father of the International Criminal Court.''  Professor Bassiouni has been a great asset to the people of all nations. It was his dedication and perseverance, in the face of great odds, that helped create an institution that holds accountable those who choose to commit human rights abuses. The vision of Professor Bassiouni has culminated in a system that ensures that those who commit crimes against humanity do not go unpunished.  Mr. President, M. Cherif Bassiouni has made an important difference in the battle against human rights abuses. It is my pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to his extraordinary work and to congratulate him on his Nobel Peace Prize nomination.                          ____________________
