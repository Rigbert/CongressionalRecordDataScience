Mr. Speaker, The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which I chair, is conducting a series of fact finding hearings as we prepare to reauthorize the Nation's highway and mass transit programs next year.  Surface transportation and the immense infrastructure that supports our Nation's transportation system extends to every corner of this country and every Member's district. That is why we are now examining the effectiveness and funding needs of existing programs, as well as the need for any new direction that the infrastructure of our country may need into the future.  I have said many times that I am concerned about the state of the Nation's infrastructure. This concern is shared by many members of my committee.  The hearings underway in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are serving to highlight the need for a modern, effective transportation infrastructure. Our economic health depends upon our roadways and transportation infrastructure. To ignore the physical state of these systems is to invite disruption that could have enormous economic consequences to this country.  While we examine our highway programs, we will also review mass transit programs and other programs to address and avoid congestion as well as new technology that might enable us to become more efficient and to improve the transport of people and goods.  During the process of reviewing the infrastructure needs of the Nation and the role of highway and mass transit programs, it is my intention to invite comments on the future benefits and needs for the hydrogen option in our transportation system.  We may be years away from actually employing fleets of, vehicles fueled by hydrogen but we owe it to ourselves to determine how this important new fuel source can be integrated along our transportation infrastructure. Just think of the different dynamic we would face in the Middle East if our transportation system were equipped with hydrogen vehicles and refueling stations based upon hydrogen.  Nearly fifty years ago, during the Presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, the Nation embarked upon the construction of the federal interstate highway system. Today, after thousands of miles of highways have been constructed and billions of dollars expended, we have an interstate highway system that is the envy of the world.  We have a transportation network, five decades in the making, that is the lifeline upon which commerce flows. That system required enormous and sustained federal support as well as cooperation with state and local governments and agencies and the ideas, innovation and hard work of hundreds of thousands of people from the private sector.  Many of the improvements we take for granted today took decades to design, improve and construct. I believe it is time to begin work on an effort that may become just as important as that of President Eisenhower, an effort to use hydrogen as a key component of our transportation base. I believe it is time for us to realize that our future surface transportation system may well be fueled using hydrogen, so we must begin the planning and thinking now.  We are at the question stage of this process. While I am not saying we are ready to set a final course of action to install hydrogen fuel infrastructure, I do believe that hydrogen can become the key part of the nation's future transportation system. As Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I believe that we should undertake a process, in the reauthorization of our highway programs, to study the feasibility of hydrogen infrastructure in the future.  This process will allow us to question timing and to ask if such a transformation is feasible, is real, is viable, is cost efficient and is in the Nation's best interest. Because our bill will authorize the highway program for at least six years, it is important that we not miss this window of opportunity to ask these questions and possibly, to initiate actions that will expedite any transformation process.  The automobile industry and President Bush have announced an initiative known as Freedom CAR, an industry and government research and development program to develop fuel cell vehicles as well as needed R relating to the hydrogen fuel that will power these vehicles.  We already know a great deal about fuel cells and we already know a great deal about the production of hydrogen. But, we clearly do not know enough. The effort of the private industry and the Administration to develop these sources of fuel can be assisted by the review and development of a meaningful infrastructure system to refuel these vehicles.  Industry and government researchers alike have asserted that a focused infrastructure development program likely will garner the confidence needed to produce the vehicles. As we develop the confidence to proceed it also will be necessary to commit to the production of a sufficient number of vehicles for widespread demonstration. Thereafter we would be positioned to move forward towards the manufacture of thousands and then millions of such vehicles.  During each of these stages, a meaningful and effective refueling hydrogen infrastructure will be needed. We should avoid a chicken and egg problem: What comes first the vehicle or the fueling infrastructure? Will the vehicles be produced if the infrastructure is not readily available? Will the infrastructure be made available if the vehicles are not forthcoming?  The infrastructure should be developed in parallel with the vehicles. Consumers are unlikely to buy fuel cell vehicles over traditional vehicles unless the hydrogen fuel is available. We may never see the mass production of fuel cell vehicles, even after they are technically proven, unless the fueling infrastructure is in place.  We are fighting a war on terrorism that is precipitated, in part, by our country's dependence upon foreign supplies of crude oil. The lives of our military personnel are at risk every day. As long as we continue dependence upon foreign sources of oil we will face war and an enormous human and economic toll that is placed upon our society and economy. If we do nothing, our dependency on foreign oil is projected to grow from fifty percent today to more than 60 percent by 2020. That dependency has grown already from 35 percent in the mid-1970's when we first confronted war over oil in the Middle East.  Congress is facing a question that will partially ease the dependence on foreign oil sources as it conferences the energy bill. In the House, we say we should allow exploration and development of a fringe area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in my state. I passionately believe that this is vital right now. The answer to oil dependency is a sensible U.S. domestic oil production in ANWR, as well as looking for other solutions that will ease the problem in years to come.  We need to develop all possible sources of energy to insure that our country has a diversity of energy sources available. Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe is a source of energy that should be developed for application in the long term. It can be derived from gasoline, natural gas, methanol, renewables, even water. Someday, like electricity today, hydrogen could become a type of energy used in daily transportation and as a source of fuel for electricity generation to power homes, business and industry.  Now is the time to begin a serious investigation that looks beyond a successful research and development program. We need to consider the need to begin our public and private efforts now to create an infrastructure to serve and fuel a transportation system based in part upon fuel cell vehicles and the need for hydrogen.  I do not know if there will be success or failure of these efforts to perfect the technology but I think it wise to consider those actions we can take. Our design should be to encourage and maintain momentum towards adoption of a new form of transportation based not entirely upon fossil fuels from other lands. We need to begin a process to determine government's proper role in this effort that may be as technically challenging as the Apollo program and as important as the Interstate Highway System.  Regardless of the energy source that propels our vehicles, now or in the future, we must also ensure that it pays its fair share to the Highway Trust Fund, if we are to maintain a user fee based system to invest in our transportation infrastructure.  The reauthorization effort should examine where we are, what needs to be done, what resources will be required, and what partnerships need to be encouraged if we are to add hydrogen as a cornerstone of our transportation sector in a timely manner. The Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. Petri, and Ranking Member, Mr. Borski, can get the perspectives of all relevant sectors on this issue and address them in the reauthorization bill. I expect to be actively involved in this effort as well.                          ____________________
