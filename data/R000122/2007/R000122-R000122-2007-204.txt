President, I am joined by Mr. Cochran in introducing important legislation, the Librarian Incentive to Boost Recruitment and Retention in Areas of Need (LIBRARIAN) Act, to support our Nation's librarians. This legislation is also being introduced in the other body by Representative Becerra, along with Representatives Grijalva, Ehlers, and Shimkus.  Public libraries and schools across the Nation are experiencing a shortage of librarians. Approximately 25 percent of America's school libraries do not have a State certified library media specialist on staff and with more than three in five librarians becoming eligible for retirement in the next decade this shortage is anticipated to only worsen.  The LIBRARIAN Act amends the Higher Education Act to provide for Perkins loan forgiveness to individuals with master's degrees in library science who become librarians in low-income schools and public libraries. Librarians working full-time in low-income areas would qualify for up to 100 percent Perkins loan forgiveness depending on the number of years they serve.  Libraries and librarians play an essential role in our schools and communities; this legislation aims to provide the same support to librarians as other public service workers receive, including teachers working in low-income schools, Head Start staff, law enforcement officials, and nurses or medical technicians.  Today we celebrate National Library Workers Day, a day to recognize the valuable contributions made by librarians and others who work in libraries. With this legislation, we have an opportunity to encourage more individuals to pursue the field of library science and retain those skilled librarians who are already serving in our low-income schools and communities.  I was pleased that the text of this bill was included in the Higher Education Act reauthorization bill approved by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee last Congress. I will again press for its inclusion in the reauthorization bill the Committee is currently working to develop. I urge my colleagues to join us in this endeavor by cosponsoring the LIBRARIAN Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1121       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Librarian Incentive to Boost      Recruitment and Retention in Areas of Need Act of 2007'' or      the ``LIBRARIAN Act''.     SEC. 2.
