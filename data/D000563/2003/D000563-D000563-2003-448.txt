President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for accepting my amendment, cosponsored by Senators Mikulski, Landrieu, Snowe, and Hutchison, regarding the Millennium Challenge Account and considering the role of women and girls in the development process.  The Millennium Challenge Account has great potential to make a significant difference in some of the poorest countries of the world by incorporating the best practices that are known to accelerate economic development. The account will create incentives for countries to engage in these practices, and builds them into the design of development projects.  According to the bill before us, the Millennium Challenge Corporation will use indicators to see which poor countries meet criteria on good governance, economic freedom, and investing in health care and education. My amendment adds consideration of the role of women and girls in those indicators.  Why is this important? Why should women be singled out?  One of the strongest lessons we have learned over the last 30 years is that when development efforts address the different needs of women and the specific barriers they face, countries are more likely to succeed. When the needs of women are not addressed, development assistance projects are more likely to fail. It is one of the core lessons of development effectiveness.  Women are the vast majority of the world's poor. We cannot succeed in reducing poverty unless we ensure that women are fully integrated into our efforts. Around the world, social, economic, and political barriers inhibit women's access to opportunities. If we address these barriers, we can unleash women's potential to contribute to their families, their communities, and their economies.  Empowering women is a smart investment because it will help us achieve many of our other goals. Research has shown that: HIV infection rates are higher when the gap between men and women in literacy is larger. In agriculture, women have less access to education and to labor, fertilizer, and other inputs than men do in developing countries. When women receive equal access to these inputs, their yields for food such as maize, beans, and cowpeas increases by 22 percent. According to the World Bank, increased progress in closing the gap between men and women in schooling would accelerate economic growth. Increases in women's education accounted for 43 percent of the total reduction in child malnutrition in developing countries. In Egypt, increasing the education level of mothers from none or less than primary, to completion of primary school reduces the proportion of the population below the poverty line by 33.7 percent. The probability that a child will survive in urban Brazil is almost 20 times greater when women accumulate income rather then men.  Lack of understanding of women's roles lowers returns on development investments. Women participate directly or indirectly in virtually every sector of life in developing countries, from agricultural production to high-tech manufacturing, but their roles can be ``invisible''. For example, women in rural Africa are responsible for 80 percent of agricultural production. However, research shows that, even where we can show that women perform the majority of agricultural labor and are responsible for the most food production, agriculture extension services seldom reach women. According to a study in Kenya, yields among women farmers could increase 7 percent if they were given the same tools, training, and education as male farmers.  One of the greatest successes in recent years is microcredit programs, which have targeted women. People in the microcredit movement realized that many poor women have creative ideas and the willingness to work hard to improve their economic well-being. What they do not have is access to credit to make those ideas happen. When women cannot own property, or travel outside of their villages, they cannot access credit from banks. Microcredit programs bring credit to women, and they have worked. Most microcredit programs have over 95 percent repayment rates and have helped many women change their own lives and those of their families. Unless we ensure that this type of thinking is part of the MCA, we will not succeed.  Secretary of State Colin Powell has said that countries that treat women with dignity and afford them a choice in how they live their lives, give them equal access to essential services and an equal opportunity to contribute to public life are the countries that are the most stable and viable.  The amendment that I have proposed is modest, but it addresses an important gap to ensure that the MCA achieves its overall purpose. We must address the different needs, roles, barriers, and potential of women in our development interventions.  My amendment would create incentives to developing countries to do so by taking into account and assessing the role of women in eligibility criteria.  We must ensure that we are doing what we know works to create a better, more stable world. Unless we ensure that women's roles, as well as men's, are fully integrated into the design of the Millennium Challenge Account from the outset, we will not succeed.                Amendment No. 1197 to Amendment No. 1136
