President, the Senate's final passage today of the bipartisan Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, after 3 years of difficult negotiations, reflects the true nature of compromise. I am glad that we have finally come to an agreement to update our country's ineffective and outdated chemical regulatory program. While this is not a perfect bill, I believe that it goes a long way towards protecting American families from dangerous chemicals and serves as a fitting tribute to Senator Lautenberg, who was a tireless public health advocate.  This legislation overhauls the 40-year-old, outdated Toxic Substances Control Act and will bring more than 64,000 chemicals under the review of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. Under the old law, the EPA was required to approve chemicals using a burdensome and ineffective economic cost-benefit analysis, but this reform bill will require the EPA to make a decision based solely? on health and safety concerns. Additionally, the Lautenberg act gives the EPA enhanced authority to require testing of both new and existing chemicals, requiring safety reviews for all chemicals in active commerce and a safety finding for new chemicals before they are allowed on the market.  The House bill originally included a provision preempting State authority to regulate specific chemicals. State preemption is a significant concern for Vermont, especially with the discovery of perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA, contaminated water in the communities of North Bennington and Pownal. Unfortunately, due to shortcomings in the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, PFOA was one of many chemicals that had been presumed safe without any requirement for testing or review. Whilethe inclusion of even minimal State preemption action in the final bill is unfortunate, the final compromise largely retains the Senate bill's provisions and allows States 12 to 18 months to enact tougher regulations through a waiver process after the EPA formally announces that it has started the review process for a chemical. There have been assurances to the Vermont congressional delegation from the EPA that Vermont will be able to retain its more stringent regulation of PFOA. I will continue to work with both the State and with the EPA to address PFOA contamination in Vermont.  I am pleased that the final bill includes two mercury-specific provisions: The creation of a mercury inventory and the expansion of the export ban to certain mercury compounds. These provisions are sections of the Mercury Use Reduction Act that I was proud to cosponsor in the 112th Congress. Under the mercury inventory provision, the EPA will be required to prepare an inventory of mercury supply, use, and trade in the United States every 3 years. This data will enhance our ability to reduce the health risks from mercury exposure. The second mercury provision builds upon the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008, expanding the export ban currently in effect for elemental mercury to include certain mercury compounds that could be traded to produce elemental mercury in commercial quantities, thus undermining the existing export ban.  This reform bill also includes new unprecedented transparency measures thanks to new limits imposed on what can qualify as ``confidential business information.'' The transparency provisions also ensure that State officials, medical professionals, and the public have access to health and safety information. In addition, the bill places time limits and requires justification for any ``confidential business information'' claims that must also be fully justified when made and will expire after 10 years if they are not re-substantiated.  Like many Vermonters, I have been concerned for years about the need to improve chemical safety standards in the United States. While I had hope for more reforms in the bill, overall, the bill is a significant improvement over current law. It is a true testament to the groundwork laid by Senator Lautenberg that we have finally heeded the calls from the American people to reform this outdated law and better protect our families from dangerous chemicals.                          ____________________
