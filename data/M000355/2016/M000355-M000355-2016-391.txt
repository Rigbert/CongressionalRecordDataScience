 President, I think we have a broad bipartisan agreement here that we would like to pass the bill. Nobody wants to be unreasonable. We have heard from both the chairman and the ranking member that whatever interest there is in the bill is related to the bill. What I am going to propound here is an opportunity for us to get onto the bill and to move forward. I think this is as close to a good-faith situation as I can imagine, and I hope we trust each other enough to go forward and complete a bill that almost everybody seems to be in favor of. I don't know how to reassure my good friend, the Democratic leader, but I hope I have.
