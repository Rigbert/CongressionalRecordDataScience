 President, I rise this morning to introduce private relief legislation to assist Mrs. Ruth Hairston, of Carson, California. Identical legislation is proceeding through the House, an effort led by Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald and I am pleased to support this effort.  Mrs. Hairston requires this extreme step in order to be able to pursue a federal court appeal of the Merit Systems Protection Board (# CSF 2221413), which denied Mrs. Hairston's eligibility for an annuity following the retirement and untimely death of her former husband. The legislation does not require the annuity, but will only permit the filing of an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals. As a result, Mrs. Hairston will be permitted to challenge the denial on the merits, rather than accept the denial due to the failure to file an appeal within thirty days.  I would briefly like to describe the facts which warrant this legislation.  Mr. Paul Hairston retired in 1980, electing a survivor annuity for Mrs. Hairston. However, the couple was divorced in 1985, entitling Mrs. Hairston to receive \1/2\ the retirement benefit under the settlement terms. Mr. and Mrs. Hairston began receiving benefits in 1988.  The Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews Civil Service retirement claims, concluded Mr. Hairston had failed to register Mrs. Hairston for survivors benefits following passage of 1985 law, renewing the survivor annuity previously selected in 1985. As a result, the spousal survivor benefits for Mrs. Hairston were canceled. Following Mr. Hairston's death in 1995, Mrs. Hairston's benefits, her portion of his retirement benefit under the divorce settlement, ceased. Mrs. Hairston was denied eligibility as a surviving spouse, but did not challenge or appeal the denial of eligibility, due to hospitalization and poor health.  I am pleased to introduce this private relief legislation to assist my constituent Mrs. Ruth Hairston. While this legislation represents an extraordinary measure, the step is necessary in order to permit a federal court appeal of the denial of eligibility by he Merit Systems Protection Board. As I have previously stated, this legislation does not require any specific outcome. The federal court will review the appeal with all the rigor the case deserves. However, Mrs. Hairston will receive her day in court and the opportunity to challenger the decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board to deny eligibility.  This legislation was brought to my attention by Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald, who has been pursuing identical legislation in the House. I understand Mrs. Hairston is under considerable financial pressure and could face foreclosure on her home. I am pleased to try to assist Mrs. Hairston in her appeal.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1773       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF DEADLINE FOR APPEAL.       For purposes of a petition by Mrs. Ruth Hairston of Carson,      California, for review of the final order issued October 31,      1995, by the Merit Systems Protection Board with respect to      docket number SF-0831-95-0754-I-1, the 30-day filing deadline      in section 7703(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is      waived.                                 ______                                       By
