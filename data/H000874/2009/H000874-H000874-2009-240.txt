In addition, Mr. Speaker, we will consider H.R. 2892, the 2010 Homeland Security Appropriations Act, and the 2010 Interior and Environment Appropriations Act. We will also consider the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman.  And I would just like to ask: he noticed two appropriations bills for next week, the Homeland Security and theInterior. I was just wondering if the gentleman could tell us what he believes next week's process will be in terms of amendments.  And I yield.
