  We have seen getting rid of the right of detainees to file habeas corpus petitions.  We have seen the condoning of the use of torture.  We have seen political firings of U.S. Attorneys.  We have seen destruction of CIA tapes.  The list goes on and on and on. Those are just some of the insults to the Constitution that we have seen over the last 8 years.
