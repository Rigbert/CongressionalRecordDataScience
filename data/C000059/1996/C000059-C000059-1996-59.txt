Speaker, the rumor going around the California agricultural community is that USDA Secretary Dan Glickman is out to ruin California's multibillion-dollar-a-year fruit and vegetable industry.  Why would Secretary Glickman want to destroy California's Agricultural industry? Only he knows.  Bill Clinton will get the blame--conventional wisdom says this is a no brainer--costing Clinton the November election.  An independent study by University of California, Riverside, Boston University, Cornell University, and Oregon State University states that USDA has not used good science.  Allowing pest ridden Mexican avocados into the United States is a recipe for disaster. They will bring in fruit flies, stem borers and seed weevils. The invasion of these pests will destroy California's crops for generations to come.  Secretary Glickman, use common sense. Don't allow pest ridden Mexican avocados into our country. It is bad policy, based on bad science.                          ____________________
