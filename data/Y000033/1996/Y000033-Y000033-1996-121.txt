Mr. Speaker, today we are considering H.R. 3487, the National Marine Sanctuaries Preservation Act. This bill was introduced by Jim Saxton, chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans.  H.R. 3487 reauthorizes the National Marine Sanctuaries Act and makes minor improvements to the National Marine Sanctuaries Program. The National Marine Sanctuaries Program oversees 14 National Marine Sanctuaries and is administered by the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  H.R. 3487 will ensure ongoing protection and management for certain marine areas that are environmentally or historically significant.  This bill also renames the Stellwagon Bank National Marine Sanctuary as the Gerry E. Studds Stellwagon Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Gerry has long been a leading proponent in the House of the protection of the marine environment--most prominently when he served as chairman of the former Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Now that Gerry is leaving after 24 years of service, I believe this is a fitting tribute.  I would like to commend subcommittee chairman Saxton for his leadership on the issue of marine sanctuaries, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on this measure.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
