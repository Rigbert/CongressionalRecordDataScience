Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.  [[Page H2911]] This is an outrageous rule, and my opposition is not based on any underlying opposition to the bill as it came from the Committee on the Judiciary. I was one of two Democrats who supported this bill as it came to the Committee on the Judiciary. But what has taken place with this rule is that the Committee on Rules has cut off consideration of important amendments.  For example, the gentleman from California [Mr. Berman] has an amendment that would clarify the issue of de minimis tort feasors. This amendment received bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. It was not made in order.  The gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum] has an amendment to raise the punitive damage ceiling to $1 million. Once again this amendment received bipartisan support in the committee and is not being allowed to be considered on this floor today. That is outrageous. I think the reason is because these amendments do have bipartisan support. They would have likely engaged not only a full debate but they may well have passed and may well have improved this legislation. And clearly, that seems to be the last thing the majority wants to do at this moment, make better legislation or conduct a fair and open debate on these issues.  In addition to these points, they have made matters worse by approving a whole list of amendments which, if they pass, have the potential of making this bill a special interest Christmas tree, not tort reform but a special interest Christmas tree.  Furthermore, they have compounded that by in fact, through the rule, changing amendments that they were adopting in the Rules Committee, and this is a travesty.  Mr. Speaker, we should reject this rule and get on to real tort reform, not rhetoric on the floor.
