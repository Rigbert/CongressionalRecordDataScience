Speaker, I would like to honor a great citizen who has made a tremendous impact on educating children in the School City of Hammond, IN. Mrs. Marge Keltner, title I director for the School City of Hammond, retired at the end of the 1996 school year.  Mrs. Keltner began her career in education in 1955 as a fourth grade classroom teacher. She came to the School City of Hammond in 1959 in the same capacity. In 1965, Mrs. Keltner's teaching assignment changed when she became the title I reading teacher. Title I is a federally funded educational program that assists students who have reading problems. Mrs. Keltner's role with title I expanded through the years as she became a title I reading teacher coordinator, instructional supervisor, and, finally, program director. Mrs. Keltner also taught undergraduate and graduate level education at Indiana University Northwest and Purdue University Calumet.  In addition to her work with the title I program, Mrs. Keltner worked diligently to foster literacy. She is currently a charter member of the Hammond Area Reading Council and has served on the board of directors for the Calumet Area Literary Council. In addition, Mrs. Keltner served two terms as president of the Indiana State Reading Council and was appointed by Governor Bayh to a statewide Literacy Coalition.  Marge Keltner can be very proud of the work she has done to improve the quality of life for the citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District. She serves as a positive role model for teachers and students alike, and proves that with a little assistance from a caring teacher, a child can grow into and prosper as a productive adult.                          ____________________
