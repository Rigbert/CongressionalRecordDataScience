Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this well crafted bipartisan bill. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure produced the current aviation law, and subsequent updates, that protects survivors and families of accident victims against ill-treatment after major airline accidents. Today, we are considering a closely parallel measure that would offer the same protections in the wake of any major railroad passenger train accident.  The successful record of the Aviation Family Assistance Law since its enactment in 1996, and the strong track record of the National Transportation Safety Board in administering that law, make me highly confident that this bill, once enacted, will be just as successful.  Fortunately, there have been only a handful of rail passenger accidents involving fatalities in the last several years. Just as with aviation, we hope there are none. But it is only prudent to have in place common sense procedures that can be put into play by the NTSB and the other organizations with which it works, if a major accident happens.  This measure is a completely bipartisan product. With the exception of some technical updates, it is essentially the same legislation that the House has overwhelmingly approved in two previous Congress'. This time, we hope the other body will act, which it has failed to do in the past. But we need to get the process moving now, to get these much needed procedures in place.  I strongly urge approval of this well crafted bipartisan legislation.
