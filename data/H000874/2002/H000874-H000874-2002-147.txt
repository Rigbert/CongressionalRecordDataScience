Speaker, continuing under my reservation, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) for his remarks. I want to thank him for his leadership on this bill and so many others. Before I reference the specific provisions of this bill which are very, very important, I hope all of our colleagues are pleased with the work of our Committee on House Administration, which is charged with the responsibility of working on matters that deal with Members, visitors, and staff and which deal with other issues of how this institution and our offices are maintained and operate. I hope they are pleased, because the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and I have found a common cause in working together without political considerations, without partisanship. It is an honor and a privilege to serve with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) on this committee. As the ranking Democratic member of a committee, sometimes one does not feel included. That has never been for one second the case on this committee, where we work as colleagues and, more than that, as partners, in most cases, in lockstep in trying to accomplish objectives that we think are good for this House and good for this country. As I say, it is an honor and a privilege to serve with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney).  Mr. Speaker, since last year's attacks, Capitol Police officers have faced extraordinary challenges. For months after the attacks, most worked 12-hour shifts, 6 days a week so Congress, the people's House, the United States Senate, and the Capitol could continue to operate. The 12-hour shifts may have eased, but Capitol Police still confront extraordinary challenges. Unfortunately for Congress, its staff and visitors, Capitol Police officers also confront extraordinary opportunities.  Now, I say that is bad news for us, because we do not want to lose them, but it is a testament to them. As trained law enforcement professionals, Capitol Police officers are always in demand by other agencies. In these times of heightened security, demand for trained personnel has probably never been higher. As a result, the Capitol Police is losing trained officers at an alarming rate.  In just the first 8 months, Mr. Speaker, of fiscal year 2002, the Capitol Police have already lost 78 officers to other law enforcement agencies and have three more departures pending. This is more than double the number lost on average to other law enforcement agencies during the last 3 years.  If this rate continues, the Capitol Police will, by fiscal year's end, have lost 122 officers to other agencies; 242 percent over the 3-year average. This does not even count separations for other reasons. This attrition comes as the police strive to raise manpower to recommended levels, to respond to heightened security concerns, and demands for their services.  One Federal agency in particular, Mr. Speaker, the new Transportation Security Agency, is attracting trained officers from the Capitol Police and elsewhere to serve as sky marshals and airport security officers. TSA offers compensation that can exceed the average Capitol Police officer's pay, and I want my colleagues to hear this and digest it: TSA is offering salaries that can exceed the average Capitol Police salary by 80 percent or more.                              {time}  1730  An 80 percent pay increase is tough for anybody to turn down. There is no doubt that TSA's work is vital, but the security of the Capitol is vital, as well. Congress has a duty to ensure the Capitol Police can attract and retain the people needed to make the Capitol safe.  This is why the chairman and I introduced H.R. 5018. The bill authorizes a 5 percent pay raise for fiscal year 2003 for officers through the rank of captain. Raises for higher-ranking officers will be discretionary with the Police Board. This gives officers who may be thinking of leaving a reason to stay.  We want them to stay. We are proud of the service they give. We are respectful of their training and of their abilities. We want to send a strong message that we value their service.  Mr. Speaker, the bill also increases from 6 to 8 hours the amount of annual leave earned per pay period by officers with at least 3 year service. As a matter of fairness, the bill authorizes the Board to make whole those officers adversely affected during the recent months of heavy overtime by limits on premium pay. This will restore to officers roughly $350,000 that they earned but did not receive due to these limits.  The bill also authorizes extra pay for officers in specialty assignments, as determined by the Board. It lets the Board hire experienced officers and employees at salaries above the minimum for a particular position when needed and justified.  It authorizes, as well, a tuition reimbursement program for officers taking courses on their own time leading towards a law enforcement-related degree and authorizes bonuses upon completion of such degrees. This will give officers opportunities for professional improvement, which should lead in turn, it is our hope, to a more rapid advancement.  For Congress, this will create a more educated and better Capitol Police force. The bill authorizes bonuses for officers and employees who recruit others to join the force, potentially turning the entire agency into active recruiters.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, as important as these tangible benefits are, we recognize that there are intangible aspects that make any job more interesting, helping to persuade veterans to stay and others to seek the position. The bill encourages our chief to deploy officers in innovative ways, maximizing opportunities to rotate among various posts and duties, to be cross-trained for specialty assignments, and to utilize fully the skills and talents of individuals.  More innovative management could greatly enhance the appeal and satisfaction of the job, making retention and recruitment easier. I am convinced that the chief understands that and has the skill and management capability to do just that. If done smartly, it would also make the Capitol more secure.  Mr. Speaker, in the course of developing this bill, the committee reached out in many directions for guidance. I met with the new chief, Terry Gainer, and Assistant Chief Bob Howe, who offered very solid and important ideas. We received suggestions from other senior police officials. We received valuable input from the Fraternal Order of Police, representing the rank and file, and from numerous officers. We sought guidance from the Sergeant at Arms and Police Board. We also heard from individual Members concerned about the current attrition and who wanted to see it addressed.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, both the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and I have had the opportunity of talking to the chairman of the Subcommittee on Legislative of the Committee on Appropriations, which funds the Capitol Police, and his staff. They have also given very positive input into this process.  Mr. Speaker, this good bill would reduce Capitol Police attrition and encourage recruitment. I thank the chairman, as I said at the beginning, for his leadership on this issue. We work as a team. It is a ``we'' committee, not a ``me'' or an ``I'' committee, and it is that because of the leadership of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney). I thank him for bringing this bill to the floor, and I urge the House to support the chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
