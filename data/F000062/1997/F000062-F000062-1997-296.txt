 President, today, with my distinguished colleague, Harry Reid, I am introducing S. 248, a bill to establish a Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals.  The Commission proposal emerged last year during a debate over a controversial bill to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. As a result of that discussion, it became clear to me and the majority of my colleagues that there was no consensus on how best to resolve the problem of caseload growth in the U.S. courts. The idea of a study commission gained broad support and has independent merit.  Legislation to form a study commission was approved twice by the Senate in the 104th Congress: in March 1996 as a stand-alone bill, and later in the session as part of the Senate amendments to H.R. 3610, the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997. Although the Senate amendment was not included in the final version of H.R. 3610 signed by the President on September 23, 1996, the initial funding for the Commission was appropriated therein. The authorizing legislation deserves a speedy enactment by the 105th Congress.  The Commission legislation we are offering today is evenhanded, fair, and genuinely bipartisan. It will consist of two members appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States, two members appointed by the President, two members appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, two members appointed by the minority leader of the Senate, two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and two members appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives.  The object is to have a balanced group of individuals who will examine the issues fairly and give full consideration of all relevant perspectives. With a balanced membership, we can be confident that the Commission's recommendations will be given due weight by all three branches of the National Government.                  BROAD SUPPORT FOR A STUDY COMMISSION  The proposal for a study commission on Federal appellate structure has won enthusiastic support from prominent judges and scholars.  To underscore the need for this legislation, as well as its importance, I can do no better than quote from Judge Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain, who has served with distinction on the Ninth Circuit since his appointment by President Reagan in 1986. In a recent symposium in the Montana Law Review, Judge O'Scannlain wrote in favor of the study commission bill offered last year:       As one member of the Court of Appeals most affected, I view      [a study commission] as a far superior alternative to [a bill      that] would have immediatedly divided the Ninth Circuit. The      [study commission] bill also provides an historic opportunity      to develop a comprehensive blueprint for the structure of the      federal courts of appeals generally, and the Ninth Circuit in      particular, for the 21st Century. No comprehensive review of      the structure of the federal courts has been undertaken since      the study chaired by . . . Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska      in the 1970s (the ``Hruska Commission''), and in my view such      a review is most timely.  Chief Judge Proctor Hug., Jr. of the Ninth Circuit, also writing in the Montana Law Review symposium, observed:       Based upon its prior experience with the academic community      and the benefits obtained from their insightful      recommendations, the Ninth Circuit strongly supported Senator      Dianne Feinstein's proposed legislation to establish a study      commission . . . to take a full and fair look at the entire      federal appellate system and to make recommendations to the      Congress for how and where to make reforms.  Another participant in the symposium was Prof. Arthur D. Hellman of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, a leading national authority on the Federal appellate courts. Professor Hellman wrote:       . . . Congress should proceed systematically by creating a      new, focused commission to examine the problems of the entire      appellate system and make recommendations that will serve the      country for the long run.  In a similar vein, Prof. Carl Tobias of the University of Montana Law School, a respected scholar of Federal procedure, has written in the National Law Journal:       A preferable route would be to appoint a national      commission to seek solutions to the problems of the appellate      system as it is currently constituted, and ways of handling      its increasing dockets with efficiency. Careful study should      provide sufficient information to make a fully informed      decision . . . The time is now ripe for Congress to authorize      such a study, rather than engage in piecemeal reform.                             THE COMMISSION  Our bill directs the Commission to study ``the present division of the United States into the several judicial circuits.'' Next, the statute calls for a study of ``the structure and alignment of the Federal Court of Appeals system, with particular reference to the Ninth Circuit.'' Finally, the Commission must ``report to the President and the Congress its recommendations for suchchanges in circuit boundaries or structure as may be appropriate for the expeditious and effective disposition of the caseload of the Federal Courts of Appeal, consistent with fundamental concepts of fairness and due process.''  The language of the statute leaves no doubt that one task of the Commission would be to undertake a careful, objective analysis of the arguments raised by proposals to divide the ninth circuit. However, it is equally clear that the Commission's mandate is not limited to the ninth circuit or to the delineation of circuit boundaries generally. This reflects the fact that circuit alignment is one of a set of interrelated structural arrangements that govern the operation of the courts of appeal.  To ensure expeditious consideration of the issues at all levels, S. 248, contains three important deadlines. Section 2(b) requires that appointment of members be made within 60 days of enactment. Section 6 requires the Commission to submit its report within 2 years of the date on which its seventh member is appointed. Section 7 requires that the Senate Judiciary Committee act on the report no later than 60 days after submission.  There are three reasons why the Commission should be given 2 years in which to carry out its work. First, before the Commission can formulate its recommendations, it will have to secure informed, objective answers to specific and difficult questions. These questions cannot be answered merely through contemplation, or even by consultation with experts. They will require research, and research takes time.  Second, an important part of Commission process is obtaining public input. In particular, at an appropriate stage in its deliberations, the Commission should issue a draft report for public comment. Responses from constituencies should be taken into account in formulating the final recommendations.  Third, the 2-year timespan is supported by the experience of other commissions, such as the Hruska Commission of 1973 and Bankruptcy Commission of 1994. It may be argued that if, as with the Hruska Commission, the initial deadline proves unworkable, Congress can always extend it. But that is the wrong lesson to be drawn from the experience of the Hruska Commission. It is far more efficient to provide initially for the 2-year lifespan than to put everyone to the time and effort of seeking an extension later.  Our proposed Commission will be fair, and it will have sufficient time to conduct a credible study. The Commission will help determine the proper course for the future of our national judiciary, and therefore I urge my distinguished colleagues to support S. 248.
