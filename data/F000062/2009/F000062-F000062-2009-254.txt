 President, today I am pleased to join with Senator Boxer in introducing the Managing Arson Through Criminal History, MATCH, Act of 2009. This bill is a companion to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Bono Mack and Schiff.  The bill would establish Federal and State arson registries; require convicted arsonists and bombers to register and update certain specified information for 5 years after a first conviction, 10 years after a second conviction, and for life after a third conviction; and authorize grants and incentives through the Department of Justice so that these registries will be operational within 3 years.  Southern California just went through one of the worst fire disasters in its history. The Station Fire destroyed 160,500 acres, destroyed more than 80 homes and threatened more than 12,000 homes. Right now, the fire is still burning in wilderness areas on its eastern flank in the Angeles National Forest.  Two firefighters, Fire Captain Tedmund ``Ted'' Hall, 47, of San Bernardino County, and Firefighter Specialist Arnaldo ``Arnie'' Quinones, 34, of Palmdale, served with dedication and courage. They were killed August 30th when their truck slipped off a winding dirt road high in the Angeles National Forest. Officials believe the truck might have been overrun by flames from the wildfire.  Though the incident is still under investigation, officials believe that Hall and Quinones may have ordered dozens of people to seek shelter while they fought through active flames to search for an escape route.  There is no doubt that the Station Fire, the largest wildfire in the history of Los Angeles County, was the result of arson after investigators examined forensic evidence from scorched landscape off Angeles Crest Highway. The spot is believed to be the source of origin of the Station fire and investigators have found incendiary material near the site.  This was a disaster of massive proportions--preliminary estimates indicate that these fires will cost $100 million. In these tough economic times, this cost and its effect on the economy of California is enormous and will have an impact for years to come.  Although the Federal Government may foot 80 to 90 percent of the bill for fighting the fire, which broke out in national parkland, the state's share will hit at a time when California is in the grip of a fiscal crisis.  Unfortunately, this is not the first or last time that a wildfire in California is started by an arsonist. It doesn't need to be that way. The bill that I introduce today--the MATCH Act would assist fire investigators and law enforcement officials by giving them up-to-date information on potential arsonists and bombers.  The bill would require convicted arsonists and bombers to register and regularly update their personal information in a new arsonist registry. In the future this will allow law enforcement and fire investigators to have an accessible database they can use to either find or rule out people of interest.  This will allow them to more easily complete their investigations, find the person responsible, and ensure that more wildfires won't get started intentionally.  This bill represents common-sense legislation that will help law enforcement officers do their jobs. Hundreds of firefighters worked on controlling the Station Fire. We owe it to these brave men and women who put their lives on the line--and others like them who will do so in the future--to give fire investigators this important new tool, so they can help bring arsonists and bombers to justice.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1684       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
