President, a year ago this month, I stood with a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives to announce the introduction of the Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003. This is landmark legislation. It provides law enforcement with the training and equipment required to effectively and accurately fight crime in the 21st century. It enacts the President's DNA initiative, as the Chair probably knows, authorizing more than $1 billion over the next 5 years to eliminate the backlog crisis in the Nation's crime labs and fund other DNA-related programs. It also includes the Innocence Protection Act, a death penalty reform effort I launched more than 4 years ago.  We introduced our bill on October 1, 2003. One month later, the House passed it with overwhelming support, 357 to 57. Among those supporting the bill were the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman James Sensenbrenner, and virtually the entire Republican leadership, including Majority Leader DeLay. Clearly there was a broad consensus for action. The House vote marked a major breakthrough in finding solutions to these serious flaws in our criminal justice system.  Unfortunately, while the other body acted, we did not. Despite Chairman Hatch's sponsorship of the bill and strong support of it, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not begin work onthe bill until September, almost a year after the House had passed it. At that point we were slowed by resistance from some Republican members of the panel, but after many hours we succeeded in working through the 20-plus amendments that were offered. All of them were rejected. Then the bill was approved by a strong bipartisan majority.  That was 3 weeks ago. Since then, this critical legislation has been blocked by the same Senators who tried blocking it in committee, and unfortunately they have been buttressed by opposition from President Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft.  Undeterred by the fact that the Senate has not moved on this very important legislation, the House acted again. Yesterday it voted on the Justice For All Act of 2004, H.R. 5107. This is a criminal justice package that bundles the Senate DNA bill with another bill, already passed in the Senate, that would increase protection for victims of Federal crimes. Yesterday's House margin, 393 to 14, was even larger than it was a year ago. In these times you rarely see such bipartisan support--393 to 14. I believe it sends a loud message to us here in this body of: What are we waiting for? Let's pass this bill.  I want to take a moment to commend the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Sensenbrenner, who spearheaded this effort in the House. The chairman deserves high praise for his leadership. We could never have come as far as we have without his steadfast commitment, and the hard work of his impressive staff.  I also thank my long-term colleagues in this effort, Representative Bill Delahunt from Massachusetts--I was honored to serve overlapping time as prosecutors, me in Vermont, Mr. Delahunt in Massachusetts--and Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois. They worked tirelessly over many years to pass the Innocence Protection Act. They deserve much of the credit for building the strong bipartisan support for the bill in the House.  The House has spoken, not once but twice. I believe Senate action is long overdue. It should not be threatened by a few holdouts in the Senate, even if they are emboldened by continuing help from the Department of Justice. I remind everybody, none of us here works for the administration--I don't care whether it is a Republican administration or a Democratic administration. We are elected as individual Senators, independent of the executive branch or the judicial branch.  The Bush administration's role in the effort to kill this bill is significant and it is a matter of public record. On April 28 of this year we received a 22-page letter from Assistant Attorney General William Moschella, presenting ``the views of the Department of Justice and the administration'' regarding the bill the House of Representatives had earlier passed by a vote of 357 to 67. They expressed the Administration's strong opposition to virtually every aspect of the bill.  I have rarely seen a letter--in fact, I cannot remember a time I have seen a letter from an executive branch agency so hostile to a bipartisan legislative effort that had already passed one House of Congress. I was shocked the Department would write such a scathing letter about a bill that had been carefully negotiated by Chairman Sensenbrenner and Chairman Hatch, working very closely together. In light of the support of the congressional leadership, I thought the President would have supported the bill and worked to make the capital punishment system more fair. Instead, his Administration chose to stonewall the reforms and defend the injustices in current law.  The new House bill contains additional concessions to the Department of Justice and to the handful of Republican opponents in the Senate. But despite these concessions, despite the urgent need for reform, the Bush administration has obstinately refused to support the bill or even to withdraw its formal opposition to the bill. In particular, the Department has pressed its unreasonable demand for an arbitrary 3-year time limit on obtaining a DNA test after conviction.  If the White House kills this bill that has passed so overwhelmingly in the House, it will be a travesty. It has, after all, been supported by key members of the Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate; it has passed by an overwhelming margin in the House. To put this off another year may seem fine to the President and the Attorney General, but another year is a long time if you are a crime victim and you are hoping they may find the person who committed the crime, or if you are wrongly accused and you are waiting on death row for the chance to prove your innocence. Another year will pile more untested rape kits on to the thousands already piled up in labs across the country.  This bill is a rare example of bipartisan cooperation for a good cause, and instead of helping, the White House has actively hindered. They have been unwilling to lead. They have been unwilling to follow. Now, when all it would take is for them to get out of the way, they are even unwilling to stand aside.  I think it is time for them to understand what is happening here, and to become part of the solution instead of part of the problem. An overwhelming bipartisan coalition in both the House and the Senate supports this bill because it will mean more fair and effective criminal justice in this country.  If Congress fails to enact this much-needed law this year, I do not lay the blame on leadership in the House or the Senate, because the leadership in both parties has supported it, just as Senator Hatch and Chairman Sensenbrenner have. If the Congress fails to enact this law this year, then I lay the responsibility directly at the feet of President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft. They deserve to be held accountable, and will be if their stubborn opposition to the bill causes it to die. The leaders of their own party support it, as the leaders of my party do. They ought to stand aside.  For all those victims' groups, all those church groups, all the others who have supported this bill--as you know, if it doesn't go forward, it is not the fault of Congress. You should look down toward the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a longer statement in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                      Justice For All Act Of 2004                            October 7, 2004       A year ago this month, I stood with a bipartisan group of      Senators and Representatives to announce the introduction of      the Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003.      This landmark legislation provides law enforcement with the      training and equipment required to effectively, and      accurately, fight crime in the 21st Century. It enacts the      President's DNA Initiative, which authorizes more than $1      billion over the next five years to eliminate the backlog      crisis in the Nation's crime labs, and to fund other DNA-     related programs. It also includes the Innocence Protection      Act, a death penalty reform effort I launched more than four      years ago.       DNA is the miracle forensic tool of our lifetimes. It has      the power to convict the guilty and to exonerate the      innocent. And as DNA testing has become more and more      available, it also has opened a window on the flaws of the      death penalty process.       Hearing after hearing before the House and Senate Judiciary      Committees has shown beyond any doubt that the death penalty      system is broken. These mistakes in our system of justice      carry a high personal and social price. They undermine the      public's confidence in our judicial system, they produce      unbearable anguish for innocent people and their families and      for the victims of these crimes, and they compromise public      safety because for every wrongly convicted person, there is a      real criminal who may still be roaming the streets. Indeed,      in dozens of cases in which DNA testing has exonerated a      wrongfully convicted person, the same test has identified the      real perpetrator.       Our bill would put this powerful tool into greater use in      our police departments and our courtrooms. It also takes a      modest step toward addressing one of the most frequent causes      of wrongful convictions in capital cases--the lack of      adequate legal counsel.        Broad Bipartisan Support In Congress And Around Country       We introduced our bill on October 1, 2003. One month later,      the House passed it with overwhelming support--357 to 57.      Among those supporting the bill were the Chairman of the      House Judiciary Committee, Congressman James Sensenbrenner,      and virtually the entire Republican leadership, including      Majority Leader DeLay. Clearly there was a broad consensus      for action. The House vote was a major breakthrough in      finding solutions to the serious flaws in our justice system.       Sadly, the House acted, but the Senate did not. Despite      Chairman Hatch's sponsorship of the bill, the Senate      Judiciary Committee did not begin work on the bill until      September, almost a year later. At that point,     we were slowed by resistance from three Republican members of      the panel. After many hours, we succeeded in working through      the 20-plus amendments that were offered--all of which were      rejected--and the bill was approved by a strong bipartisan      majority.       It speaks volumes about the opposition to this bill that      one of the amendments offered in Committee sought to strike      the Innocence Protection Act in its entirety. Our opponents      want law enforcement to use DNA aggressively to fight crime,      and so do I. But they do not want to let those who are      wrongly convicted use DNA to prove their innocence. That is      wrong. DNA can convict the guilty, but it can also exonerate      the innocent. It should be available for both purposes.       That is why victims groups support the whole package of      reforms in this bill. They do not want the wrong guy locked      up while the real rapist or murderer is out committing other      crimes. Throughout the Committee's consideration of this      bill, there were two fixtures in the room--Kirk Bloodsworth      and Debbie Smith. Kirk was exonerated by DNA testing. In      Debbie's case, DNA testing led to the arrest and conviction      of her attacker. Both support the whole bill.       The Committee reported the bill to the full Senate three      weeks ago. Since then, this critical legislation has been      blocked by the same three Republican Senators who held up the      bill in Committee, buttressed by opposition from President      Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft.       This week, the House has acted again. It voted yesterday on      the Justice For All Act of 2004, H.R. 5107, a criminal      justice package that bundles the Advancing Justice Through      DNA Technology Act with another bill, already passed in the      Senate, which will increase protections for victims of      Federal crimes. Wednesday's House margin--393 to 14--was even      larger than the vote a year ago, and sends a loud and clear      message to the Senate: ``Pass this bill!''       I want to take a moment to commend the Republican Chairman      of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Sensenbrenner, who has      spearheaded this effort in the House. Chairman Sensenbrenner      deserves high praise for his leadership. We could never have      come as far as we have without his steadfast commitment and      the hard work of his impressive staff.       I also want to thank my longtime colleagues in this      endeavor, Representative Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts and      Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois. They have worked      tirelessly over many years to pass the Innocence Protection      Act, and deserve much of the credit for building the strong      support for the bill in the House.       The House has now spoken not once, but twice. Senate action      is long overdue. Sadly, Senate passage in the waning days of      this congressional session continues to be threatened by a      few holdout Republicans, emboldened by continuing opposition      from Department of Justice.                     Inaction Has Real Consequences       While Congress has failed to act, much has happened in the      real world. Over the last year, five more wrongfully      convicted individuals were cleared of the crimes that sent      them to death row, bringing to 116 the number of death row      exonerations since the reinstatement of capital punishment.      Also in the past year, another 10 wrongfully convicted      individuals were exonerated by DNA testing in non-capital      cases. That brings to 151 the number of post-conviction DNA      exonerations in this country in little over a decade.       What else has happened in the real world? Just last week,      Houston's top police official called for a moratorium on      executions of inmates who were convicted based on evidence      that was handled or analyzed by the Houston Police      Department's crime lab. In a floor statement in March 2003, I      described the widespread problems at that lab, which included      poorly trained technicians, shoddy recordkeeping, and holes      in the ceiling that allowed rain to possibly contaminate      samples. It turns out that the situation is even worse than      previously imagined.       In May, the Republican Governor of Texas pardoned Josiah      Sutton, who spent 4\1/2\ years in prison for a crime that he      did not commit. He was only a teenager when he was convicted      and sentenced to 25 years for rape, based largely on a bogus      DNA match by the Houston police lab. More recently, Houston's      district attorney admitted that chemical testing used to      convict another man was inaccurate. That was after six      forensic experts concluded that the lab's analysis of DNA      evidence in the case was ``scientifically unsound.''       The situation in Houston is appalling but it is not without      precedent. There have been similar problems in various State      crime labs, as well as in the once-distinguished FBI lab.      Crime labs across the country are suffering the consequences      of years of increased demand and decreased funding.       One consequence is sloppy lab work. Another consequence is      massive backlogs. In December 2003, the Department of Justice      estimated that there were more than 500,000 criminal cases      with biological evidence awaiting DNA testing. This estimate      included 52,000 homicide cases and 169,000 rape cases. Ten      months later, the situation has only gotten worse. While the      Senate has been idle on this bill, rape kits and other crime      scene evidence has been sitting on shelves, untested for lack      of funding. This bill would authorize the funding that our      labs so desperately need.    Bush Administration's Repeated Attempts To Sabotage Bipartisan                                Initiative       The Bush Administration's role in the effort to kill this      bill is a matter of public record. On April 28 of this year,      we received a 22-page letter from Assistant Attorney General      William Moschella presenting ``the views of the Department of      Justice and the Administration'' regarding the bill that the      House of Representatives had earlier passed by a vote of 357      to 67. The letter expressed the Administration's strong      opposition to virtually every aspect of the bill.       I have rarely seen a letter from an Executive branch agency      so hostile to a bipartisan legislative effort that had      already passed one house of Congress. I was shocked that the      Department would write such a scathing letter about a bill      that had been carefully negotiated by Chairman Sensenbrenner      and Chairman Hatch. In light of the support of the Republican      congressional leadership, I expected that the President would      support this bill and work to make the capital punishment      system more fair and effective. Instead, he chose to      stonewall reform and defend the injustices in current law.       The Justice Department's criticisms of the bill are all      unfounded. Let me respond to just a few of the key claims in      the Department's April 28 letter.       The Department claimed that the post-conviction DNA testing      provisions in the bill would invite abusive prisoner      litigation. In fact, the bill includes numerous checks      against frivolous litigation, including the following: An      applicant seeking a test must assert his ``actual innocence''      under penalty of perjury; The applicant must not have waived      the right to DNA testing, or knowingly failed to request DNA      testing in a prior post-conviction motion; A chain of custody      must be established; The proposed DNA testing must be      reasonable in scope; The applicant must identify a theory of      innocence not inconsistent with any affirmative defense      presented at trial; Testing may be ordered only if it could      produce ``new material evidence'' and raise a reasonable      probability that the applicant did not commit the offense;      And the bill establishes serious sanctions, including new      criminal charges, if DNA testing produces inculpatory      results.       The Department argued that the bill should bar post-     conviction DNA testing unless DNA technology was      ``unavailable'' at the time of the defendant's trial. But      witnesses at House and Senate hearings on the bill reported      numerous examples of defendants failing to request DNA      testing despite its availability at the time of trial because      the defense lawyers were incompetent or unfamiliar with the      technology, the defendant was mentally ill or retarded, or      the defense was simply unaware of the evidence, perhaps due      to government misconduct.       The Department complained that the bill would allow      prisoners who pleaded guilty to obtain a DNA test. But      witnesses at the hearings told Congress of the startling fact      that innocent defendants sometimes do plead guilty, due to      bad lawyers, mental retardation, or government intimidation.      David Vasquez in Virginia, Frank Townsend in Florida, and      Chris Ochoa in Texas are just three examples of this      disturbing phenomenon.       The Department claimed that the evidence retention      requirements in the bill were unduly burdensome. In fact, we      took every precaution to make sure that these requirements      would not pose an undue burden to law enforcement. Only      biological evidence must be preserved. Evidence need not be      preserved if the court denies a request for testing, the      defendant waives testing, or 180 days pass after the      defendant receives notice that the government intends to      destroy the evidence. If evidence would be impractical to      retain, the government need only take reasonable measures to      preserve a portion of the evidence. Finally, the failure to      retain evidence does not provide grounds for habeas corpus      relief.       The Department claimed that the counsel provisions in the      bill amounted to a Federal regulatory system for capital      defense. That characterization is grossly unfair. The Capital      Representation Improvement Grants authorized in the bill are      strictly voluntary. States are under no obligation to      participate. At House and Senate hearings on the bill,      witnesses enumerated numerous studies over 20 years that      document the failure of many States to provide competent      counsel in capital cases. In light of these long-standing      flaws, it is entirely appropriate for the Federal      government to offer financial assistance to those States      that seek it.       The Department claimed that the agencies responsible for      appointing capital defense lawyers would have limitless      resources. This criticism is unsupported and contrary to the      experience in states like North Carolina and New York that      have established independent defense entities which operate      within a budget.       If the White House kills this bill it will be a travesty.      Putting this off another year may seem fine to the President      or the Attorney General, but another year is a long time if      you are a crime victim or if you are wrongly accused, waiting      on death row for the chance to prove your innocence. Another      year will pile more untested rape kits on to the thousands      already piled up in labs across the country.       This bill is a rare example of bipartisan cooperation for a      good cause, and instead of helping, the White House has      actively hindered. They have been unwilling to lead.     They have been unwilling to follow. Now, when all it would      take is for them to get out of the way, they're even      unwilling to stand aside. The time has come for the President      to understand what is happening here, and to become part of      the solution instead of part of the problem.           Bush Administration Ignores Efforts to Compromise       This bill is the product of years of work and many months      of intense negotiations. It reflects a lot of compromises by      all the principal sponsors. None of us is entirely happy with      everything in the bill. There are plenty of things that I      would do differently. There are plenty of things that Senator      Hatch and other cosponsors would do differently. Nobody got      everything they wanted.       But that is why the bill has such broad bipartisan appeal.      That is what the legislative process is all about--finding      the middle ground that a broad majority can support. That is      why 393 members of the House support this bill, and why a      substantial majority of the Senate would vote for it if our      opponents would allow it to come to a vote.       The new House bill reflects a number of additional      concessions to the Department of Justice and to our      Republican opponents in the Senate. Let me briefly describe      just a few of the changes that were made.       First, to address concerns raised in Committee by Senator      Sessions and others, the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant      Program now authorizes the use of grant funds to address non-     DNA forensic science backlogs, but only if the State has no      significant DNA backlog or lab improvement needs relating to      DNA processing.       Second, the bill no longer prevents States from uploading      arrestee information into their own DNA databases, although      they must expunge such information if the charges are dropped      or result in an acquittal.       Third, the standard for getting post-conviction DNA testing      has been streamlined by striking unnecessary language that      required courts to assume exculpatory test results. Obviously      a court considering such an application cannot know for sure      what the test results would reveal and must consider the      application in a light most favorable to the applicant in      light of all the evidence.       Fourth, the bill no longer permits Federal inmates to      obtain DNA testing of evidence relating to a State offense,      except when that offense may have resulted in a Federal death      sentence.       Fifth, it is now presumed that a motion for post-conviction      DNA testing is timely if filed within five years of enactment      of the bill, or three years after the applicant was      convicted, whichever is later. Thereafter, it is presumed      that a motion is untimely, except upon good cause shown.      The Department has complained that the ``good cause''      exception is so broad you could drive a truck through it,      and its continued opposition turns in large part on the      inclusion of this language. But while I agree that the      language is broad, it is intentionally so; I would not      agree to a presumption of untimeliness that could not be      rebutted in most cases. At the same time, this provision      should allow courts to deal summarily with the      Department's hypothetical bogeyman--the guilty prisoner      who ``games the system'' by waiting until the witnesses      against him are dead and retrial is no longer possible,      and only then seeking DNA testing.       Sixth, modifications were made to the standard for      obtaining a new trial based on an exculpatory DNA test      result; instead of establishing by ``a preponderance of the      evidence'' that a new trial would result in an acquittal,      applicants must now establish this by ``compelling      evidence.'' The point of this change, which I proposed, is to      require courts to focus on the quality of the evidence      supporting an applicant's new trial motion rather than trying      to calculate the odds of a different verdict.       Finally, the bill now specifies that 75 percent of funds      awarded under the new capital representation improvement      grant program must be aimed at improving trial counsel,      unless the Attorney General waives this requirement. This      change was included to assuage concerns that this program      will somehow resurrect the post-conviction resource centers      that Congress de-funded in the mid-1990s.       With few exceptions, these most recent changes to the bill      were made at the behest of the Department of Justice, after      weeks of negotiations aimed at securing the Department's      endorsement of the bill. Yet despite the changes, and despite      the urgent need for reform, the Bush Administration has      obstinately refused to support the bill or even to withdraw      its formal opposition to the bill. As Chairman Sensenbrenner      has said, we ``bent over backwards'' to try to satisfy the      Department's concerns, but ``no matter how much we bent,      nothing could satisfy them.'' In particular, the Department      pressed its unreasonable demand for an arbitrary three-year      time limit on obtaining a DNA test after conviction.       Let us be clear what this means. A DNA test is not a get-     out-of-jail-free card; it does not even guarantee someone a      new trial. All this is about is providing access to evidence      in the government possession for purposes of forensic      testing. Judge Michael Luttig, one of the most conservative      jurists in the country, has written that this is nothing less      than a constitutional right. Senator Specter took the same      position in the last Congress. A large majority of the States      that have passed post-conviction DNA testing laws have      rejected time limits, recognizing, as I do, that there should      never be a time limit on innocence.       The reforms proposed in the Justice for All Act will mean      more fair and effective criminal justice in this country. The      few remaining opponents of the bill still wave around the      April 28 letter from the Department of Justice. If Congress      fails to enact this needed law this year I lay responsibility      directly at the feet of President Bush and Attorney General      Ashcroft. They deserve to be held accountable if their      stubborn opposition to the bill causes it to die.                          ____________________
