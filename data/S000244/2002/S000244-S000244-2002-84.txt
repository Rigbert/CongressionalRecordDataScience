Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I notice that none of the Committee on the Judiciary Democrats decided to take the time to come to the floor to manage this legislation,and that the Democratic manager is someone who does not serve on the Committee on the Judiciary.  Be that as it may, I appreciate the support for my bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas), who has spent much more time in the vineyards of trying to pass bankruptcy reform than our newfound convert over on the other side of the aisle.
