Speaker, with all due respect to the chairman of my committee, Mr. Chairman, that is inaccurate. It is inaccurate, because, as you know, you did not fund that in subcommittee. In subcommittee, the provision to which you refer had not been added.  So you are inaccurate. You had the money available. And, by the way, as you know, I supported that $500 million so that we could give additional compensation above and beyond what the law requires. The law.  This is not some speculation. The law requires that we give special compensation to high performers. I agree with that premise, as does the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis).
