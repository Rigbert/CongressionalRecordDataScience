Speaker, I thank my very good friend, the ranking member, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), for granting me this time; and also to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), the chairman of the subcommittee, for moving this conference bill to the floor. I might add, much improved from when it left this Chamber initially.  September 11 reminded us all that neglect breeds violence, and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This bill has a lot of pounds of cure in it.  Speaking as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus here in the House, I would like to speak specifically about Ukraine, noting that from when the bill left the House, the totals for that country have been raised from $125 million to $154 million, so Ukraine is no longer singled out as the only country in the world to receive a cut in foreign assistance, especially before their third parliamentary election, which will occur early next spring.  Our ultimate goal is to help the Ukrainian people participate fully in this third election so they keep moving forward and do not slip backwards, as has happened to Belarus right under our own eyes.  We hope that the funds in this bill will also help to make sure that not only their elections will be properly observed on Election Day, but they can be prepared to participate in the elections; that there will be monitoring of the electoral races, making sure that election laws are not violated and that the oligarchs are not buying votes; and that the government does not tamper with the candidates' rights to present their own platforms in those elections.  We should all do all we can do to help the Ukrainian elections to be truly free and truly fair. I urge support of this improved conference report as an improvement over the original House bill.  Again, I wish to thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), who was a very worthy and engaging advocate in this bill; and also the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) for her incredible leadership always.
