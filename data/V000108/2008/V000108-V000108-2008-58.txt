Jim Stemmler. I have known Jim for many years, and he is one of the most involved citizens I have ever known, especially when it comes to his service to the IronWorkers Local 395. Jim has been a member of the IronWorkers Local 395 for an astounding 35 years, and his contributions to the organization are immeasurable. Although Jim has been a constant fixture within the organization, he will be retiring from the Local 395 at year's end. For his efforts and many contributions to the union, Jim will be honored at a retirement celebration on Saturday, April 19, 2008, at the Radisson Hotel in Merrillville, Indiana.  Jim Stemmler was born in Hegwisch, Illinois, on December 30, 1947. He lived there until he joined the Army, in which he served during the Vietnam conflict. Following his return from Vietnam in 1973, he began his apprenticeship and became a member of the IronWorkers Local 395. Jim's service as an elected member of the union began with the position of Trustee. His dedication to the union and its members continued as he was elected Recording Secretary, and later as he served as president of the IronWorkers Local 395. With Jim's commitment to serve, it is only fitting that Jim was elected the first-ever business manager of Local 395.  Aside from his elected service to the Local 395, Jim also served on several Local 395 boards, including the joint apprenticeship committee and the health and welfare board. The respect and trust of the union's members for Jim is apparent in his appointment as the chairman of the board of trustees for Mid-America Pension Plan and to the supplemental monthly annuity fund board. Jim is also currently the President of the LaPorte, Starke, and Pulaski Building and Construction Trades Council and holds several politically appointed positions throughout the State of Indiana.  When not engaged with the union, Jim spends his spare time with those closest to him, his family. A loving husband, father, and grandfather, Jim's commitment to the union and its members is surpassed only by his dedication to his family. Jim and his wife, Sandy, have shared many wonderful years together.  Madam Speaker, Jim Stemmler has given his time and efforts selflessly to the members of the IronWorkers Local 395 for the past 35 years. As a friend to Congressman Donnelly and myself, his fellow members, and the larger community, I commend his work throughout northern Indiana. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
