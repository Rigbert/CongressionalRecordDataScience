 Doris G. Petercheff, for the many contributions she has made to raise the political discourse in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Doris has spent a lifetime advising and working for candidates and elected officials she believes in. She is respected for the sound judgment she offers and the solid reputation she has established. I have known Doris for many years and am glad to call her my friend.  On Thursday, July 5, 2007, the Somerset Commonwealth Journal published an article highlighting Doris's many years of service to Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record and that the entire Senate join me in honoring this Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Somerset Commonwealth Journal, July 5, 2007]                 A Lifetime Devoted to the American Way                   (By Bill Mardis, Editor Emeritus)       ``It's been a great ride!''       ``That's how Doris G. Petercheff sums up her life in the      political arena. In reality, her life has been molded by      politics.       ``I can't remember when politics was not discussed in my      home,'' said Petercheff. ``Quite frankly, it still is,'' she      added.       ``Petercheff, owner of One Acorn and Associates, a      political consulting firm, is slowed by health problems, but      her telephone still rings with questions about how to manage      a political campaign.       ``I interpret politics as people,'' said Petercheff.      ``That's one of the things we've forgotten--people. I love      people. God gave me a talent in politics . . . to help      people. I never had a doubt that the Lord provided me a way      to work for Congressman (Tim Lee) Carter so I could help      people.'' She was 5th District office manager for Carter for      18 years.       ``Petercheff was reared in a political atmosphere. Her      grandfather, Jacob N. Mayfield, owned and operated a country      story in the Acorn community.       ``Grandpa was a great patriot. He always displayed a large      American flag at the store,'' Petercheff recalls.       ``I thought that flag was so beautiful,'' she said. ``I      went up to Grandpa and said, `Grandpa, what is that (flag)?'      And he pulled me on his lap and told me what the flag was and      how important it was.       ``That was my first love of politics and my country,'' she      remembers. ``I was probably 3 or 4 years old at the time.''       Mayfield was a magistrate for many years. Petercheff      pointed out that those were the days before state courts were      reorganized and magistrates performed many official duties      such as marriages, signing birth certificates and other legal      functions.       ``Everybody came to the store. We were (the same as)      Somerset at that time. We sold     everything you couldn't grow,'' Petercheff remembers. She      said Ky. 1675, extending from Ky. 80 to Mt. Victory, was in      those days the main route from Crab Orchard to Sublimity      Springs, at that time a well-known health resort near Mt.      Victory.       ``Stagecoaches passed by here (on the way to Sublimity      Springs),'' she recalled.       ``We went to Somerset on `Burden Road,' '' laughed      Petercheff. ``It was really (through) Burdine Valley, but we      called it `Burden Valley.' ''       Petercheff is from a strong Republican family. Both her      Grandpa Mayfield and Grandpa John Cottongim, a deputy sheriff      from 1911 to 1916, were dyed-in-the-wool Republicans.       As a professional consultant, Petercheff would cross the      political divide.       ``One of my proudest times was working with (Democrat)      Wallace Wilkinson in 1987,'' Petercheff said. She was      organizational coordinator during Wilkinson's successful      campaign for governor, working with the now nationally famous      James Carville.       ``Democrats are a different breed,'' she remarked. ``They      are more open . . . a physically touchy, feelie kind . . .      they don't flout their affluence.       ``I am a conservative . . . a fiscal conservative, not a      social conservative,'' Petercheff said. ``I loved matching my      brains against those big consultants. It's amazing how those      big national consultants (are often off base).''       ``The key to success in politics, Petercheff said, is to      ``get organized, make a plan and then work your plan that's      how you win.''       ``On the other hand, Petercheff believes politics must be      enjoyed.       ``I've told clients, `Politics is fun. If it's not fun, we      won't do it.' ''       But an office seeker must be dedicated to the cause.      ``Campaigns are hard work,'' she assures.       If Petercheff has a political hero, it's the late      Congressman Carter.       ``Tim Lee . . . he was a country doctor. His first interest      and first desire was to help individual people. If Tim Lee      ran across a need for which he couldn't find an answer, he      would dig down in his pocket and come up with the money. And      you didn't have to vote for him to get help.       ``Tim Lee was the ultimate politician,'' she said. ``He      knew how to (handle) things politically to get people to do      what they should do.''       ``Petercheff recalls that she started working for Carter in      1964 ``. . . when women were not involved in politics . . .      maybe they stuffed envelopes.''       ``But Petercheff never took a back seat. Few people have a      more impressive profile of services.       ``Among her positions as a volunteer, Petercheff served as      chair of the Mayfield precinct for 30 years; secretary of the      Pulaski County Young Republicans Club for four years;      treasurer in 1970 for the State Young Republican Federation;      chair in 1971 of 5th District Young Republicans; and      secretary from 1972 to 1976 for the Pulaski County Republican      Executive Committee.       ``Also, in 1969 she served as president of the Pulaski      County Republican Women's Club; from 1976 to 1978 she was      chair of the 5th District Republican Party; from 1972 to 1978      she was a member, state-at-large, Republican State Central      Committee; in 1966 she was campaign chair for the U.S.      Senator John Sherman Cooper and Tim Lee Carter; and served as      campaign chair for now-Congressman Hal Rogers for state Young      Republican chairman.       Also, she was campaign coordinator for Rogers in his quest      for Pulaski County attorney; Pulaski County campaign and      headquarters secretary during Louie Nunn's successful      campaign for governor; 5th District coordinator for Tom      Emberton for governor; and state organizational coordinator      for Huda Jones's campaign for secretary of state.       ``Also, state campaign primary coordinator for Gerald Ford      for president of the United States; state campaign manager      for Hal Rogers for lieutenant governor; 5th District campaign      coordinator for Ronald Reagan, (Senior) George Bush, Mitch      McConnell and Rogers; 5th District coordinator for Jim      Bunning for governor; and 5th District campaign manager for      Hal Rogers for Congress in 1980, 1982 and 1984.       ``Petercheff has served in some position in every state,      district and local election since 1962. She started One Acorn      and Associates in 1984 with several stockholders. In April      1986, she became the sole owner and operator of One Acorn.      Her list of clients is like a ``who's who'' in local, state      and national politics.       ``Like many Pulaski Countians, to make a living,      Petercheff's family--her father, Thomas O. Cottongim, and her      mother, Mary Iva Mayfield Cottongim--left their home in Acorn      in 1941 and moved to Indianapolis. She went to high school in      the Indiana city and married her high school sweetheart,      Jimmy Petercheff, now deceased.       ``She and Jimmy returned to Pulaski County in 1959 and took      over operation of the family's general store, originally      known as J.N. Mayfield Mercantile and later Acorn Mercantile.       ``They closed the store in 1967. ``I had gone to work for      Dr. Carter and we had to hire somebody to run the store,''      Petercheff said.       ``Doris and Jimmy have four sons, 11 grandchildren and six      great-grandchildren. She admits to encouraging her children      to be politically active.       ``The Petercheff house at 4845 Highway 1675 at Acorn has a      large ``P'' on the chimney, apparently for identification.      But it's not needed. Doris Petercheff is a household name in      Somerset, Pulaski County, Kentucky and the nation.       ``As she so eloquently said: ``It's been a great ride!''                          ____________________
