President, I share the anger, frustration, and impatience of those who want to reduce our deficit. But a constitutional amendment simply is not the way to achieve that goal.  The Senate debate on this constitutional amendment and the amendments offered to improve it, which were all tabled by the majority, have reinforced my conclusion that the balanced budget amendment is a bad idea whose time has not come.  I have 10 reasons why I believe adoption of this proposed 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would be a grave mistake.               it does not reduce the debt or the deficit  First, the proposed constitutional amendment will not cut a single penny from the Federal budget or deficit this year, next year, or any year. It is a copout.  There are only two responsible ways to reduce our budget deficit: cut spending or raise taxes. Focusing our attention on this proposed amendment only delays us from making progress on those choices.                     proponents' debt tracker chart  I have noted the daily ritual of proponents of this amendment using their debt tracker chart. That practice is as deceptive as the constitutional amendment that we are debating: It misleads the American people by suggesting that this debate is responsible for billions of dollars of increased national debt.  But if this resolution had been passed on the first day of debate, the national debt would have risen just as fast and just as high. The debt tracker has nothing to do with the debate on this resolution. But it is symbolic of the lack of substance of the arguments of the proponents of this so-called balanced budget amendment.  Further, the debt tracker is indicative, not of delay by opponents of this constitutional amendment, but delay in starting the difficult process of cutting the deficit. It is the proponents of the amendment that are fiddling while the debt is growing.  It makes more sense to cast votes that will cut the deficit now and not wait until the next century. Of course, this year there is additional irony in that the Republican Party has assumed majority status in both the House and Senate. As such, it can pass any budget it wants. That only requires a majority vote.  If they want to balance the budget, eliminate the deficit, pay off the debt. They can do all that by a simple majority vote in both Houses. They do not need a constitutional amendment to do any of this; they can do it right now.  Our Republican colleagues have been preparing for their leadership role since November 9. In over 3 months, they have proposed no budget resolution, proposed no balanced budget, proposed no budget moving toward balance, indeed, proposed no budget at all. Instead, they choose to distract and delay through the use of this proposed constitutional amendment.  It is only with resolve and hard work that we make progress. Neither is evident in this effort. This is politics pure and simple and no one should play politics with the Constitution.          it will shift burdens to state and local governments  Second, the proposed amendment contains no protection against the Federal Government seeking to balance its budget by shifting burdens to the States. This is the ultimate budget gimmick--pass the buck to the States.  That is not the way to cut the Federal deficit--shifting burdens to State and local government and requiring them to raise the revenues necessary to take up the slack. Working people cannot afford tax increases any more easily because they are imposed by State and local authorities.   [[Page S3243]] Unless we carefully balance the budget, this amendment could pass the buck to the States. Studies make dire predictions if we resort to across-the-board spending cuts--the easiest way to avoid the painful choices needed to balance the budget.  In response to a request from Governor Dean of Vermont, the Treasury Department recently studied what could happen to State and local taxes under the balanced budget amendment.  Assuming that Social Security and Defense cuts were off the table, as the Republican leadership has promised, the Treasury analysis predicts cuts in Federal grants of over $200 million to Vermont in 2002.  Treasury predicts Vermont would lose $89 million per year in Medicaid funding. Treasury predicts Vermont would lose $37 million per year in highway trust fund grants. Treasury predicts Vermont would lose $13 million per year in welfare funding. And Treasury predicts Vermont would lose $68 million in other Federal funding.  To try to offset these losses, Vermont would have to raise State taxes by 17.4 percent.  The Treasury Department forecast higher State taxes not only for Vermont, but for the other 49 States as well. Louisiana would have to raise State taxes by 27.8 percent to make up for lost Federal funds. Rhode Island would have to raise State taxes by 21.4 percent to make up for lost Federal funds. South Dakota would have to raise State taxes by 24.7 percent to make up for lost Federal funds. West Virginia would have to raise State taxes by 20.6 percent to make up for lost Federal funds. Mississippi would have to raise State taxes by 20.8 percent to make up for lost Federal funds, and so on. If we try to balance the Federal budget by scaling back essential services, we will just as surely be shifting these costs and burdens on State and local governments. I know that the people of Vermont are not going to let their neighbors go hungry or without medical care.  And I expect people elsewhere will not either. As much as our churches, synagogues, charities, communities, and volunteers will contribute, a large share of the costs will fall to State and local governments.  I believe that before we are called upon to consider this constitutional amendment, we need to know what its impact is likely to be. Certainly before any State is called upon to consider ratification of such a constitutional amendment, it should be advised of the likely effects on its budget.  In spite of the majority leader's assurance more than 2 weeks ago that Republicans would provide as much detail as possible in the course of this debate about how they intend to balance the budget, we have heard none. Their secret plan remains secret. Let us get some answers and know where we are headed.                    it will hurt children's programs  Third, simple arithmetic indicates that sharp cuts will be proposed in programs for our Nation's children. Supporters of this amendment have promised not to cut Social Security and not to cut defense, although they do propose that we cut taxes. What is left?  Programs like school lunches, education, childhood immunization. Under the proposed amendment, programs like these will face likely cuts of 30 percent or more.  The Children's Defense Fund has predicted that across-the-board spending cuts from the balanced budget amendment would unfairly balance the budget on the backs of children.  Under the balanced budget amendment in 2002, the Children's Defense Fund fears that in Vermont alone: 4,850 babies, preschoolers, and pregnant women would lose infant formula under the WIC Program; 7,600 children would lose food stamps; 13,900 children would lose subsidized school lunches; 13,750 children would lose Medicaid health coverage, and 2,500 children in child care and Head Start would lose Child and Adult Care Food Program meals.  More than 7 million children nationwide may be thrown out of these Federal programs.  Let us remember that these programs for children are investments in our future. Study after study shows that healthy, educated children grow up to become productive citizens.  Take for example the WIC Program, which provides nutrition and health care for pregnant women, infants, and children. The GAO indicates that in the long haul, a dollar spent on WIC saves $3.50 in health care costs. Let us not be pennywise in our deliberations. There will be a bill to pay later for unwise, shortsighted cuts, and that bill will be left to the next generation.  I do not want to saddle our children and grandchildren with Federal debt, but neither do I want to leave them a legacy of malnutrition, poor education, and inadequate health care. Children are our most vulnerable population and our most valuable resources for the future.                   it will encourage budget gimmickry  Fourth, this proposed constitutional amendment would invite the worst kind of cynical evasion and budget gimmickry. The experience of States with balanced budget requirements only bears this out.  Many States with a balanced budget requirement achieve compliance only with what the former controller of New York State calls ``dubious practices and financial gimmicks.''  These gimmicks include shifting expenditure to off-budget accounts, postponing payments to localities and school district suppliers, delaying refunds to taxpayers, deferring contributions to pension funds, and selling State assets. The proposed balanced budget amendment does not prohibit the Federal Government from using these same and other ``dubious practices and gimmicks.''  With Congress facing a constitutional mandate, the overwhelming temptation will be to exaggerate estimates of economic growth and tax receipts, underestimate spending and engage in all kinds of accounting tricks, as was done before the honest budgeting effort of 1993.  Passing a constitutional directive that will inevitably encourage evasion, will invite public cynicism and scorn not only toward Congress, but toward the Constitution itself.  Let us not debase our national charter in a misguided, political attempt to curry favor with the American people by this declaration against budget deficits. Let us not make the mistake of other countries and turn our Constitution into a series of hollow promises.                      it is loaded with loopholes  Fifth, the loopholes in House Joint Resolution 1 already abound. One need only consult the language of the proposed amendment and the majority report for the first sets of exceptions and creative interpretations that will allow Congress to reduce the deficit only so far as Members choose to cast responsible votes. The distinguished senior Sentor from West Virginia and others have pointed out additional problems, as well.  The Senate Judiciary Committee report says that Congress will have ``flexibility'' in deciding what is off-budget for purposes of the constitutional amendment.  Proponents expressly exempt in that report the Tennessee Valley Authority as ``[a]mong the Federal programs that would not be covered.'' What other exemptions are contemplated or will be granted?  It may mean one thing this year and another the next. It can be shifted around the calendar as Congress deems appropriate. Watch out for the shifting of fiscal years in order to juggle accounts when elections are approaching.  As the senior Senator from West Virginia so ably explained, this proposed amendment gives Congress leeway to rely on estimates to measure the budget and to ignore very small or negligible deficits. But what is small, what is negligible? With an apology to Everett Dirksen: ``A billion here, a billion there, after a while it does not add up.''  I commend Senator Feingold for offering an amendment to strike the exemption for the Tennessee Valley Authority from the Judiciary Committee report. I voted for it. Unfortunately, my colleagues overwhelmingly voted to keep this loophole.  This proposed constitutional amendment uses the seemingly straightforward term ``fiscal year.'' But, according to the Senate report, this time period can mean whatever a majority in Congress wants it to mean.  The biggest loophole, of course, is using the Social Security trust fund to make the true deficit. I commend Senator Reid and Senator Feinstein for [[Page S3244]] their amendment to exclude Social Security from the balanced budget amendment. Unfortunately, it was tabled by the majority.  Social Security is the true contract with America. And we owe it to our senior citizens to make sure we do not balance the budget with their lifetime contributions.  Social Security does not add a penny to our deficit. In fact, the Social Security trust fund runs annual surpluses that are now used to offset the deficit. In 1995, the Social Security trust fund is estimated to run a $69 billion surplus, and by 2002 the Social Security trust fund will run annual surpluses totaling $636 billion.  We should not raid the annual surpluses in the Social Security trust fund to balance the budget.                        it may harm the economy  Sixth, this proposed constitutional amendment could be economically ruinous. During recessions, deficits rise because tax receipts go down and various Government payments, like unemployment insurance go up. By contrast, the amendment would demand that taxes be raised and spending be cut during a recession or depression.  Last week, the Treasury Department issued a report that concluded the balanced budget amendment would have worsened the recession of 1990-92. The Treasury Department found that:       A balanced budget amendment would force the Government to      raise taxes and cut spending in recessions--at just the      moment that raising taxes and cutting spending will do the      most harm to the economy, and aggravate the recession.  In Vermont, had this amendment been in effect, Treasury predicted that between 1,300 to 3,800 more Vermonters would have lost their jobs during the 1990-92 recession.  A study completed last year by the Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates concluded that a balanced budget amendment would devastate the economies of our States. The study found that such a constitutional amendment would cause severe job losses and drastic cuts in personal income in 2003.  For Vermont, the study predicted a loss of personal income of $1.2 billion, an average of 5.4 percent for each Vermonter, and 3,900 lost jobs, resulting in a 0.5 percent rise in Vermont's unemployment rate. The study predicted dire job loss and devastating economic consequences for every other State.  Economic policy must be flexible enough to deal with a changing and increasingly global economy. Yet, the requirements of this proposal will tie Congress' hands to address national problems that may necessitate deficit spending.  Senator Boxer and I offered an amendment that would have permitted Congress to waive the balanced budget supermajority requirement to provide Federal aid in response to a natural disaster as declared by the President.  The Boxer-Leahy amendment would have given future Congresses needed flexibility to respond to the needs of natural disaster victims under a balanced budget amendment. But once again, the majority voted in lock step to table this amendment.  We should not hamstring the legislative power expressly authorized in article I, section 8, of the Constitution. Let us not undo that which our Founders wisely provided--flexibility.  Let us not limit choices and accountability. Instead, let us exercise our constitutional responsibilities in the best interests of the American people.                   it invites constitutional clashes  Seventh, this proposed constitutional amendment risks seriously undercutting the protection of our constitutional separation of powers.  No one has yet convincingly explained how the proposed amendment will work and what roles the President and the courts are to play in its implementation and enforcement. Constitutionalizing economic policy would inevitably throw the Nation's fiscal policy into the courts, the last place issues of taxing and spending should be decided.  The effect of the proposed amendment could be to toss important issues of spending priorities and funding levels to the President or to thousands of lawyers, hundreds of lawsuits and dozens of Federal and State courts. If approved, the amendment could let Congress off the hook by kicking massive responsibility for how tax dollars are spent to unelected judges and the President.  Indeed, the Nunn amendment, as modified this morning, arguably makes things worse. It seeks to strip the Federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court of judicial power in connection with cases arising under this constitutional provision. The result of the Nunn amendment is that State courts are left to interpret and apply the constitutional provision and that any conflicts that arise in that interpretation and implementation by the courts of the 50 States cannot be considered or resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.  I do not believe that this is what Senator Nunn  intended, but that is the result of the language he has offered. This shows the difficulty and danger of seeking to draft constitutional language overnight with careful consideration and the input of constitutional experts.  I applaud Senator Johnston for his foresight in offering an amendment to preclude judicial review of this amendment unless Congress specifically provides for such review in the implementing legislation. The Johnston amendment would have dried up one of the many murky swamps surrounding this constitutional amendment. But in their zest to keep the Senate version of this constitutional amendment identical to the House version, the majority tabled the Johnston amendment.  Instead of creating future constitutional crises, let us do the job we were elected to do. Let us make the tough choices, cast the difficult votes and make progress toward a balanced budget.          it erodes the fundamental principle of majority rule  Eighth, this proposed constitutional amendment undermines the fundamental principle of majority rule by imposing a three-fifths supermajority vote to adopt certain budgets.  Our Founders rejected such supermajority voting requirements on matters within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described supermajority requirements as a ``poison.''  As one of my home state newspapers, the Rutland Herald, recently noted, James Madison condemned supermajority requirements in Federalist Paper No. 58.  Madison warned that:       In all cases where justice or the general good might      require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be      pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would      be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would      rule: The power would be transferred to the minority.  Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic distrust not just of Congress, but of the electorate itself. I reject that notion.  I am prepared to keep faith with and in the American people.                it will result in distressing surprises  Ninth, there is much truth to the axiom that the devil is in the details.  The proposed constitutional amendment uses such general terms that even its sponsors and proponents concede that implementing legislation will be necessary to clarify how it will work.  What will this implementing legislation say?  We will not find out until we see this implementing legislation what programs will be off-budget, what role the courts and the President will have in enforcing the amendment, and how much of a deficit may be financed and carried over to the next year. And who knows what other core matters will be added to implementing legislation.  I do not think that Congress should be asked to amend the Constitution by signing what amounts to a blank check. Nor should any State be asked to ratify a pig in a poke.  That is why I voted for Senator Daschle's amendment that would have required Congress to tell the American people the details of how we intend to balance the budget by 2002. The distinguished minority leader's right-to-know amendment was the right thing to do. Unfortunately, this amendment was just the first of many to be tabled by the majority.  In the interests of fair disclosure, Congress should first determine the substance of any implementing legislation, as it did in connection with the 18th amendment, the other attempt to [[Page S3245]]  draft a substantive behavioral policy in to the Constitution.                  it is not constitutionally necessary  Tenth, this amendment does not meet the requirements of article V of the Constitution for proposal to the States--it is not constitutionally necessary.  Instead of a sloganeering amendment, what we need is the wisdom to ask what programs we must cut and how much we need to raise revenues, and the courage to explain to the American people that there is no procedural gimmick that can cut the deficit or the debt.  Let us not proceed with a view to short-run popularity, but with vision of our responsibilities to our constituents and the Nation in accordance with our cherished Constitution.  We should quit playing politics with the Constitution. This is folly. There is nothing wrong with the Constitution.  Let us get on with the real business of reducing the deficit and balancing the budget.
