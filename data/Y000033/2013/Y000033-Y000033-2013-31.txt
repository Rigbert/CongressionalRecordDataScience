Alaska Native students must be afforded a culturally      relevant education.       ``(2) It is the policy of the Federal Government to      maximize the leadership of and participation by Alaska      Natives in the planning and the management of Alaska Native      education programs and to support efforts developed by and      undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve      educational opportunity for all students.       ``(3) Many Alaska Native children enter and exit school      with serious educational disadvantages.       ``(4) Overcoming the magnitude of the geographic      challenges, historical inequities, and other barriers to      successfully improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native      students in rural, village, and urban settings is      challenging. Significant disparities between academic      achievement of Alaska Native students and non-Native students      continues, including lower graduation rates, increased school      dropout rates, and lower achievement scores on standardized      tests.       ``(5) The preservation of Alaska Native cultures and      languages and the integration of Alaska Native cultures and      languages into education, positive identity development for      Alaska Native students, and local, place-based, and culture-     based programming are critical to the attainment of      educational success and the long-term well-being of Alaska      Native students.       ``(6) Improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native      students increases access to employment opportunities.       ``(7) The programs and activities authorized under this      part give priority to Alaska Native organizations as a means      of increasing Alaska Native parents' and community      involvement in the promotion of academic success of Alaska      Native students.       ``(8) The Federal Government should lend support to efforts      developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native      community to improve educational opportunity for Alaska      Native students. In 1983, pursuant to Public Law 98-63,      Alaska ceased to receive educational funding from the Bureau      of Indian Affairs. The Bureau of Indian Education does not      operate any schools in Alaska, nor operate or fund Alaska      Native education programs.
