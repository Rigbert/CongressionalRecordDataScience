 I hope this afternoon to speak on the issue of importation of drugs because I support the Dorgan amendment. Right now I wish to address the issue of the Crapo motion to commit.  This generally deals with all of the tax provisions in this 2,074-page bill. If Senator Crapo prevails--and he should--the unrelated House bill, along with the Reid amendment, would be sent to the Senate Finance Committee. The Finance Committee, under the motion, would be empowered to return the bill to the full Senate with an amendment that eliminates the heavy taxes that are in this bill. Senator Crapo has discussed the impact of the Reid amendment on middle-class families. I will lay out all the taxes that are in this bill.  In farm country, many of us who work the land often observe big freight trains rumbling across the terrain. Sometimes they scare cattle, hogs, and other animals. Those freight trains are impressive in their power, in their speed, and now the length of the trains. It is very common to see a 100-car train, 150-car trains. The partisan force with which the majority is powering this bill through the Congress is equally as impressive as that of a freight train. The speed that is being displayed for such complex legislation is something to behold. Most importantly, the sheer number and breadth of the new taxes in this bill reminds me of a very long train.  Almost $\1/2\ trillion in taxes, fees, and penalties, and I think they all have the same economic impact, whether it is a tax, a fee, or a penalty--a negative impact on the economy. These taxes, fees, and penalties are so imposing, I am calling this 2,074-page bill the tax increase express.  The locomotive driving this train is health care reform, driven by the Democratic leadership. So we have the locomotive that drives this tax increase. I don't think the American public knows the bill would impose that much, $\1/2\ trillion worth of new taxes, new fees, and new penalties on the American people.  The American public, who supported President Obama with a majority of votes 13 months ago, heard the President loudly and clearly, and that is why they gave him such an overwhelming majority.  They understood our President pledged he would not raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year. Unfortunately, the Democrats' leadership bill would violate that clear pledge.  What are the tax increases and the fees and penalties in Senator Reid's amendment? Let me take a moment to highlight them because every locomotive needs power to run. The first power source, the first car of the tax increase express, is the so-called fees on health insurance companies, medical device manufacturers, and drug manufacturers.  That might not sound like something the grassroots of America would worry about--taxes on insurance companies, medical device manufacturers, drug manufacturers--because maybe they think businesses pay taxes. But businesses and corporations do not pay taxes, only people pay taxes. So when people find out they are going to be paying these, it puts a whole new light on what is a fee and what is a tax.  There have been numerous studies that have shown that these fees on, for example, health insurers will increase health insurance premiums. Some say premiums would increase by $488 for a family, other studies say $500. Most Members on the other side of the aisle take issue with these studies. They argue these studies were performed at the request of insurance companies or conducted by independent experts with ties to that same industry.  Let me ask my Democratic friends this: Do you question the work of the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation? Well, you should not because they are like a god around here. When the CBO says something is going to cost something, that stands, unless there are 60 votes to override it in the Senate. So most everything the CBO says stands. They have respect because of the intellectual honesty of their research and the nonpartisanship they have. So these agencies--the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation--have testified that these fees will actually be passed on to health care consumers. Check the record. No one can dispute it.  The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have also testified that the fees will increasehealth insurance premiums. Check the record. No one can dispute it.  My friends in the Democratic leadership may say, once their health reforms are in place, premiums will go down, net of the fees. They will hail a recent CBO report highlighting the winners but somehow ignoring the losers. They will say these fees will not affect premiums for the vast majority of Americans. But here is the flaw in that assertion. The Congressional Budget Office analyzed premium costs, what they are projected to be in 2016 under this legislation.  What about premium costs right now in the years before these programs take effect--2010 and 2013? Why is this question important? The answer is, these fees go into effect in the year 2010, not when most of the expenditures go into effect in 2014.  The majority of the Democratic reforms which are intended to lower costs do not go into effect until 2014--4 years from now. I ought to say that 10 times because that is very important to how this bill came out to be revenue neutral.  So we ought to look at what happens in the years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Premiums will go up. Why? Because, for one, the Democrats are adding costs to the health insurance you buy by imposing these fees on health insurers, and they are giving you no government assistance to help with these added costs.  I would ask my friends in the media, dig a little bit deeper on this point, and you ought to be reporting on it. Why? Because the American public does not understand that in the short term premiums will go up. Instead, the public is simply hearing some media reports on a portion of the premiums, in 2016 and beyond. Of course, that is a very long time from now. The American public does not want to wait for their premiums to go down, if they go down at all. It appears my friends in the Democratic leadership want the tax increase express to barrel through Congress before the public realizes what health care reform actually means; that is, higher premiums as early as 2010.  Let me turn to the second car of the tax increase express. This car is the proposal to restrict the eligibility criteria for claiming the itemized deductions for medical expenses. This proposal says you can no longer deduct expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. Instead, you can only deduct expenses that exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income.  In plain English, this proposal limits tax deductions you can take for medical expenses. In other words, you will lose a portion of your tax deductions. Even the New York Times calls proposals that would take away a portion of your tax deduction a tax increase.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article from the New York Times, dated February 26, 2009, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 2009]        To Pay for Health Care, Obama Looks to Taxes on Affluent                   (By Jackie Calmes and Robert Pear)       Washington.--President Obama will propose further tax      increases on the affluent to help pay for his promise to make      health care more accessible and affordable, calling for      stricter limits on the benefits of itemized deductions taken      by the wealthiest households, administration officials said      Wednesday.       The tax proposal, coming after recent years in which wealth      has become more concentrated at the top of the income scale,      introduces a politically volatile edge to the Congressional      debate over Mr. Obama's domestic priorities.       The president will also propose, in the 10-year budget he      is to release Thursday, to use revenues from the centerpiece      of his environmental policy--a plan under which companies      must buy permits to exceed pollution emission caps--to pay      for an extension of a two-year tax credit that benefits low-     wage and middle-income people.       The combined effect of the two revenue-raising proposals,      on top of Mr. Obama's existing plan to roll back the Bush-era      income tax reductions on households with income exceeding      $250,000 a year, would be a pronounced move to redistribute      wealth by reimposing a larger share of the tax burden on      corporations and the most affluent taxpayers.       Administration officials said Mr. Obama would propose to      reduce the value of itemized tax deductions for everyone in      the top income tax bracket, 35 percent, and many of those in      the 33 percent bracket--roughly speaking, starting at      $250,000 in annual income for a married couple.       Under existing law, the tax benefit of itemizing deductions      rises with a taxpayer's marginal tax bracket (the bracket      that applies to the last dollar of income). For example,      $10,000 in itemized deductions reduces tax liability by      $3,500 for someone in the 35 percent bracket.       Mr. Obama would allow a saving of only $2,800--as if the      person were in the 28 percent bracket.       The White House says it is unfair for high-income people to      get a bigger tax break than middle-income people for claiming      the same deductions or making the same charitable      contributions.       The officials said the resulting increase in revenues,      estimated at $318 billion over 10 years, would account for      about half of a $634 billion ``reserve fund'' that Mr. Obama      will set aside in his budget to address changes in the health      care system. The other half would come from proposed cost      savings in Medicare, Medicaid and other health programs.       In a document summarizing its proposals, the White House      said it would finance coverage for the uninsured in part by      ``rebalancing the tax code so that the wealthiest pay more.''       Mr. Obama's blueprint, which will project spending and      revenues for the next decade, will flesh out the president's      thinking on his energy plans both to cap the emissions of      gases, particularly carbon dioxide, that are blamed for      climate change and to spur development of nonpolluting energy      alternatives.       The budget will show the government beginning by 2012 to      collect billions of dollars in revenues from selling permits      to businesses that emit the polluting gases, assuming the      president's energy initiative becomes law as soon as this      year, officials said.       Because utilities and other businesses would presumably      pass on their costs to customers, Mr. Obama will propose to      use most of the government's revenues from the permits to      finance an extension of the new ``Making Work Pay'' tax      credit beyond the two years covered in the $787 billion      economic recovery plan that was just enacted.       That tax relief, the administration will argue, will offset      households' higher costs for utilities and other products and      services from businesses' passing on their permit expenses.       That tax credit annually will provide $400 to low-wage and      middle-income workers or $800 to couples; Mr. Obama would      like to increase those figures to $500 and $1,000. The credit      phases out for those with incomes above $75,000 a year and      for couples with incomes of more than $150,000; no benefit      would go to individuals with more than $100,000 income and      couples with $200,000.       The tax credit will begin showing up in the form of lower      withholding for eligible workers beginning April 1.       The remainder of the projected revenues from the permits      will finance Mr. Obama's campaign promise for $15 billion a      year over 10 years to subsidize research and development of      alternative energy sources, officials said. The stimulus      package included a multibillion-dollar down payment to      develop a national electricity grid to harness and distribute      energy from such sources, including wind farms.       Behind the numbers in Mr. Obama's first budget is one of      the most far-reaching domestic agendas in years, and at a      time when the president and Congress are already grappling      with an economic crisis worse than any in decades. The      environmental permits would not take effect until 2012, at      which point the administration expects the economy to have      recovered. Similarly, some of the tax increases would not      take effect until 2011.       Democratic Congressional leaders promised to push the      agenda, which parallels their own. ``By the end of this year,      I want to do something significant dealing with health      care,'' the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada,      told reporters.       The tax proposals, however, could galvanize Republican      opposition and give conservatives a concrete target for      taking on Mr. Obama, who despite his political strength could      find some members of his own party reluctant to embrace tax      increases.       Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the      Senate Finance Committee, who has been drafting a health      plan, predicted in an interview that the Senate could pass      legislation by its August recess.       Mr. Baucus acknowledged that ``there has to be revenue'' to      offset the costs of expanded coverage initially, but he did      not endorse the proposal for limiting wealthy taxpayers'      deductions.       ``There will be lots of options to pay it, not necessarily      that one,'' Mr. Baucus said.       He would not say what revenue options he would support. But      he said tax increases of some kind would not prevent some      Senate Republicans from aligning with Democrats to pass a      health plan.       In the House, the Republican leader, Representative John A.      Boehner of Ohio, telegraphed his side's opposition to any tax      increases.       ``Everyone agrees that all Americans deserve access to      affordable health care,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement,      ``but is increasing taxes during an economic recession,      especially on small businesses, the right way to accomplish      that goal?''       Mr. Boehner likewise criticized Mr. Obama's cap-and-trade      emissions permits proposal, saying, ``Cap-and-trade is code      for increasing taxes and killing American jobs,     and that's the last thing we need to do during these troubled      economic times.''       To finance health care reform, administration officials      suggested to senior aides in Congress on Wednesday that      revenues could be raised by ending the policy of excluding      the value of employer-provided health insurance from income      taxes.       But the officials emphasized that the administration was      not advocating that option, which not only is anathema to      some in organized labor and business but also conflicts with      Mr. Obama's position in last fall's presidential campaign.       The administration is proposing a number of other      politically contentious ways of offsetting the costs of the      health care initiative. Mr. Obama wants to require drug      companies to give bigger discounts, or rebates, to Medicaid,      the health program for low-income people.       Drug makers now must provide Medicaid with a discount equal      to at least 15.1 percent of the average manufacturer price      for a brand-name product. Mr. Obama wants to require      discounts of at least 22.1 percent. Pharmaceutical companies      have strenuously resisted such proposals in recent years.       Mr. Obama will also propose cutting Medicare payments to      health insurance companies that provide comprehensive care to      more than 10 million of the 44 million Medicare      beneficiaries. He says he can save $175 billion over 10 years      with a new competitive bidding system, under which payments      to private Medicare Advantage plans would be based on an      average of the bids they submit to Medicare.
