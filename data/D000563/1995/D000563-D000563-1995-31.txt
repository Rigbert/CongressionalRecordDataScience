Speaker, why are we engaged in this heated debate? Why have we shut down the Federal Government? The answer is on this chart. It needs to be updated in this respect: Three of the thirteen appropriations bills have been passed by the Gingrich-led Congress.  As a result, 10 of these appropriations bills which keep the Government functioning have not even been submitted by the Republicans in the House and the Senate for the President's approval. They are literally 6 weeks late in their statutory obligation to pass appropriations bills, to keep the Government running.  What they are saying today is that they want to postpone this process even longer.  Remember, just a few short months ago when Mr. Gingrich and his group of revolutionaries came in and said there will be a new day in the House of Representatives? Well, now we know what it is; it is Government shutdown, it is mismanagement, it is a waste of Federal taxpayers' dollars. For all of the arguments made on the other side, this chart tells that story. In 10 out of 13 cases, the Gingrich-led Congress failed to lead.
