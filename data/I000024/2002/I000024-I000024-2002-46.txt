 I think there is this Washington, DC, mentality that floats around that somehow if we are not here in Washington, DC, we, as Senators, are not doing our work.  Let me tell you, for those of us who go back to the district and are with our people--in my case, the people of Oklahoma, who make much more sense than anybody makes around this place--that time is more valuable, and it is harder. Our hours are longer. We work long hours when we are back there. Yet we see the bed check votes such as the one that brought us back last night. We come back, and we vote on something we could have been voting on anytime--on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.  Then you see the press corps around Washington. They all think everything that is worthwhile is happening in Washington. You read the Hill and you read Roll Call and they say it is perfectly reasonable for the majority leader to say everyone ought to be in Washington all the time.  I can tell you one of the problems we have is people who are in Washington all the time lose sight of who real people are. It is so hard to explain to people around here, but people in my State of Oklahoma understand it very well. There aren't any real, normal people in Washington. Everyone is either a Member or they are a staffer or they are a lobbyist or somebody else. To be able to get what is needed for America, you need to get back into real America. Oklahoma is real America. I can cite some examples.  I will be talking to the Duma this afternoon, the Russian Duma, about our new relationship with Russia. When I go back to Oklahoma, they will say: Wait a minute; why do we still have an ABM Treaty that was set up in 1972?  Fortunately, we are going to get rid of that thing. But why did it take this long? It took this long because people around this town don't understand pure logic. The logic is that at one time there were two superpowers, the U.S.S.R. and the United States. And I have to admit, as a Republican, this was done in a Republican administration. Henry Kissinger, back in the Nixon administration, put together something that said: I will make you a deal, U.S.S.R. We won't defend ourselves against you, if you don't defend yourselves against us. And if you shoot us, we will shoot you, and everybody dies and everybody is happy. It is called mutual assured destruction.  That might have made sense to some people back in 1972. It didn't to me, but it might have to some other people. Now we have a totally different world out there in Russia, which is a friend and ally of ours; yet we do have Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya, other countries harboring terrorists, developing weapons that will reach the United States, missiles that will reach us. Already China, North Korea, and Russia have such missiles. So how does it make sense in today's world that we don't defend ourselves?  I don't get the answers, but I get the questions when I go back to Oklahoma. Then I have to try to explain to them. I was criticized the other day by some of my conservative friends as to why I voted on some of the amendments in the farm bill. I voted on those because I went back. I have town meetings, as I am sure the Chair is aware. I get around and have as many as five, six in a day.  Oklahoma, particularly in the western part of the State, is agricultural.In Oklahoma, our farmers have three sources of income: Grain, livestock, and oil. They have this so-called marginal production. For a sustained period of time, all three of these were down, and they were really hurting. I sat down in places such as Shattuck, OK, and Gage, OK. I had farmers coming in and saying: For the first time in five generations, we will have to sell our farm. We can no longer stay in business.  For that reason, I realized that we have to do something that is different than what we have done before in transitioning into a new farm policy. So we did. And some of the amendments I voted for were pretty expensive. Nonetheless, that came from going back to the State, being there and listening to them instead of staying around Washington on the weekends.  On energy and ANWR, I can't believe we took all the time we did in trying to open ANWR for exploration. Here we are in a threatened position. Everyone is aware of it. After September 11, all of a sudden we find ourselves dependent upon other countries for 57 percent of our energy. We don't even pass something that will allow us to open up the Alaska Wildlife Refuge for exploration. I have yet to find one person to go up there to the ANWR on the North Slope of Alaska and come back here shaking their head, wondering why in the world we call that a pristine wilderness. It is nothing but a mud flat. It is a tiny area up there that would give us a great capacity of domestic crude.  In my State of Oklahoma, if we had all of our marginal wells--a marginal well is one that produces 15 barrels or less a day--if we had them all opened, if we had those wells flowing that we have had closed over the last 10 years, that would have produced the same amount of oil as we are currently importing from Saudi Arabia.  When you go back, you talk to real people. Last week, when we were having a town meeting, they were talking about this community planning bill that was going to come out, and now it has come out of the Environment and Public Works Committee. It will be considered on this floor. Do you know what that is all about? What that is about is a recognition that no good decisions are made unless they are made in Washington, DC.  Many years ago when I was mayor of Tulsa, there was a guy named Dr. Robert Fryley. He had gone into San Diego. Pete Wilson was mayor at that time. I was mayor of Tulsa. He had drawn these concentric circles that said: This is the way you should plan your community.  He came to Tulsa in the first 2 or 3 weeks that I was in office. He started talking about Tulsa. I said: Wait a minute. This property is owned by people. These people bought this property. You are going to change the value of the property to these people.  They said: That is of no concern to us.  That is what we now will be considering on the floor of the Senate--a bill that is going to allow us in Washington to decide what we in Tulsa, OK, do with our property.  I see others seeking the floor. I was killing a little time.  The other day I was at Eisenhower School. It is a school that has done some great things in the public school system that others are emulating. I received some letters. I will just read a couple. This one says:       Thank you for my class. Your speech about rights and      responsibilities was great and interesting. I really enjoyed      you coming. It was fun. I learned a lot. Sincerely, Maggie.  Here is another one:       Thank you so much for your presentation today. Our class      really enjoyed it. I liked it a lot. I liked the part where      you answered my question. Once again I enjoyed it a lot.      Sincerely, Lauren Smith.  I ask unanimous consent that the rest of these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Dear Senator Inhofe: I want to thank you for coming to our      class. I really learned a lot like the pilgrims really wanted      to get to freedom so they traveled even though they knew a      lot of them wouldn't survive for a year. I also learned about      the government. I learned that there are 100 senators. Two      for each state. I felt proud that I got to meet you! It was a      pleasure to have you come to our class! You really made it an      interesting day!           Sincerely yours,                                                       Susan Diaz.       P.S. I bet you have a big responsibility!                                  ____       Dear Mr. Inhofe: I wanted to thank you for coming to our      class. I had a very good time. I learned new things too like      there are 100 senators and 435 representatives. I really like      to learn new stuff like that. Thanks again.

Sincerely,     Eva.                                  ____       Dear Senator Inhofe: I want to thank you so much for coming      to our class. That was a big opportunity that most kids don't      get to have.
