Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, the Brown motion states that this bill shall not be construed as authorizing any institution to withhold medically appropriate services from a patient. What are those ``services?'' They are abortion services, Mr. Speaker.  The problem with the Brown motion is it does not define medically appropriate, it leaves it up to further definition. Perhaps some Attorney General or health commissioner in a government that happens to be pro-abortionwould say that is what medically appropriate means, or NARAL might say that is what appropriate means, and we are talking about abortion. That is what is on the table here, and I hope all Members understand that.  This killer motion, will enable the killing of babies. It absolutely reverses the intent of conscience protection and undermines the very law that was passed a few years ago, and takes us further back than we are already right now. I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this gutting motion.  I want to remind Members that 86 percent of the hospitals in America do not perform abortions. Thank God for that. They protect and preserve and cherish the lives of babies and their mothers--all their patients. They would be compelled under the Brown motion, forced, coerced, or empower others the ability to force them to perform abortions.  This debate is all about conscience. The Bilirakis bill is a great bill, it is an important bill, it is a human rights bill that says conscience means something. We ought to take this step. Vote for it. Vote down this gutting motion.
