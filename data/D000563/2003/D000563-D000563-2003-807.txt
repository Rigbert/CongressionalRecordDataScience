SANTORUM. Let me finish, and I will be happy to yield as I have continually. The fact that a child in utero is going through a crisis does not equate that the mother is going through a health crisis. There are lots of mothers of babies with multiple defects who carry that child to term or do things to try to help that child in utero survive. One does not equate to the other.  The case of Vikki Stella--and I am just reporting--I understand the fact she was carrying a child with multiple disabilities. My heart grieves for her and for all women who have to go through such difficult pregnancies. It is horrible to find out that a child you want may not live long after birth. It is as compelling a story as you can present to me. The point is, the answer does not have to be the death of the child.
