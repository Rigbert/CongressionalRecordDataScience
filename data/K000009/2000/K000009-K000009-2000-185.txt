Chairman, but I would move to strike the last word and would like to submit for the Record articles in The New York Times today and in the Toledo Blade concerning gas prices and enter into a colloquy with the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee.  Mr. Chairman, I believe there is a critical need for a comprehensive report on how biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, can be more fully incorporated into the strategic fuel reserves of our country. Alternatives such as swaps or sales of a portion of current crude reserves for biofuels should be evaluated with estimates of funds realized to be directed toward biofuels purchase and storage costs. Also, options to encourage on-farm storage of biofuel inputs and related biofuel processing and storage capacity as a ready reserve should be evaluated.  Therefore, I would ask the chair and ranking member if they could consider the need for such a report and possibly include language in the conference report on this bill to request such a report from the Departments of Interior, Agriculture and Energy?
