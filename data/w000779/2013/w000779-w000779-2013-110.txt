President, today I wish to pay tribute to MG Raymond F. Rees, one of Oregon's most remarkable military leaders. After 51 years of service to our Nation and the State of Oregon, General Rees will retire from theOregon National Guard and the U.S. Army next week. I know I speak for Oregonians across the State in thanking him for his service.  General Rees hails from the small eastern Oregon town of Helix, which boasts a proud population of 184. He learned the importance of hard work at an early age, putting in long hours on the family ranch. After graduating from West Point in 1966, he completed airborne and Ranger training, preparing himself for a tour in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division. Upon leaving the active Army, he joined the Oregon National Guard where he commanded at every level, serving both within the State and across the country.  Those who know him were not surprised that General Rees held a number of impressive titles over his long and distinguished career. He served as the director of the Army National Guard, the vice chief of the National Guard Bureau, and as the acting chief of the entire National Guard. He also served as the chief of staff for U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. This month, he steps down as Oregon's Adjutant General, a job he held twice before. In fact, General Rees is the longest serving Adjutant General in the United States, with over 17 years of service to four different Oregon Governors.  General Rees has always been a champion of the Guard, both locally and nationally. Policy decisions he helped shape in the early 1990s enabled the National Guard to better respond after the horrible attacks of September 11, 2001. Under his leadership, the Oregon Guard deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. And Oregon units were able to respond rapidly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, sending nearly 2,000 servicemembers within 72 hours.  Nobody worked harder to strengthen the synergy between the Guard and communities across our State than General Rees, or to make sure that our returning men and women receive the vital services they earned. He helped establish the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, providing critical, sustaining support for Guardsmen and their families before, during, and after deployments. He led modernization efforts across Oregon, providing Guardsmen with the best equipment and facilities. He opened or improved projects across the State, including readiness centers in Pendleton, La Grande, Hermiston, Klamath Falls, Ontario, The Dalles, St. Helens, Clackamas, Gresham, Dallas and Salem. He was instrumental in helping us sign a new lease for the Portland Air National Guard Base, allowing the Air Guard to train and keep the skies safe along the west coast.  Building bridges between the Guard and foreign militaries is another legacy that General Rees will leave behind, and the Guard's State Partnership Program enjoyed no stronger supporter. Under this initiative, State Guard folks are partnering with more than 60 nations to improve regional and cultural awareness, increase security cooperation, and help prevent threats from emerging. I am proud to say that under General Rees' leadership, Oregon has become one of the few States to partner with two countries simultaneously: Bangladesh and Vietnam.  I could go on and on about the contributions General Rees made on behalf of servicemembers, their families, our citizens, and the State of Oregon. So today I want to join folks across the State and the country to stand and offer our congratulations to General Rees on his distinguished career. Whether as a cavalry troop commander, a cobra gunship pilot, or the Adjutant General of the Oregon National Guard, General Rees always shouldered more than his share of the task. We will miss this dedicated soldier, talented leader, and gifted diplomat--but his is a retirement well earned. I commend General Rees for his service to our country, and I want thank his wife, Mary Len, for her tireless support along the way. After decades of service, I wish Major General Rees a long and relaxing retirement. Well done!                          ____________________
