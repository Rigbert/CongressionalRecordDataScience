Back in Vermont, we celebrated on July 4 with parades and fireworks displays, as did millions of Americans around the country. It is important, however, not only to celebrate our values on July 4, but also to live by them year-round. This means that we should embrace those public servants who, while working hard to build better lives for themselves and their families, enrich our communities and contribute so much to our Nation.  We see the true meaning of patriotism in those hard-working Americans who ask what they can do for their country and pursue public service. Chief Judge Merrick Garland, who has served for nearly two decades as a Federal judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, is a perfect example. Chief Judge Garland also served for several years in the Justice Department, where he was charged with leading the Federal response to the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in our history. This is a person who makes us all proud to be Americans, but instead of honoring Chief Judge Garland's service, Senate Republicans have undertaken an unrelenting campaign of partisan obstruction against his nomination to the Supreme Court.  Recently, Reid Hoffman, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and founder of LinkedIn, penned an op-ed criticizing the Senate Republican blockade of Chief Judge Garland's nomination:       ``Effectively, [Majority Leader McConnell] and his allies      are in the midst of a year-long strike.       ``Imagine if entire departments at Fortune 500 companies      announced they were going to stop performing key functions of      their job for a year or more, with no possibility of moving      forward until a new CEO took over. Investors would start      dumping their stock. Customers would seek out alternatives.      Competitors would make these companies pay for such      dysfunctional gridlock. Eventually executives and employees      would be fired.       ``In Silicon Valley, such behavior would be corporate      suicide.''  I could not agree more. We cannot allow Senate Republicans to unilaterally decide to refuse to do its job, and essentially create ``dysfunctional gridlock.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Instead of scheduling a hearing for an impeccably qualified nominee, Republicans are holding Chief Judge Garland's nomination hostage in their hopes that the Republican Party's presumptive Presidential nominee will be elected and make a different nomination. This is the same candidate who has displayed a stunning misunderstanding of the role of the judiciary and who accused a sitting Federal judge of bias simply because of his heritage. While some Senate Republicans have rightly condemned those racist attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, they are still standing by the man who launched those racist attacks.  As former U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach in Ohio put it in a recent op-ed, ``if country really does come before party, how can anyone who calls himself an American leader still support this man who openly berates public servants based on their race?'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of thearticle be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Senate Republicans' partisan refusal to do their jobs extends to the lower courts as well. In the 19 months that Senate Republicans have had a majority, they have allowed just 21 votes on judicial nominations. As a result, Federal judicial vacancies have skyrocketed. This is not how the Senate should operate, and the American people deserve better. When Democrats controlled the Senate during the last 2 years of President George W. Bush's administration, we worked hard to confirm judicial nominees with bipartisan support. During those 2 years, we confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees and reduced the number of judicial vacancies to 34. We even held hearings and confirmation votes into late September of the election year, because filling vacancies with qualified nominees with bipartisan support is more important than scoring partisan points. Senate Republicans have not shared that priority, or else they would never have allowed judicial vacancies to nearly double from 43 to 83 since they have controlled the Senate, leaving two dozen judicial nominations pending on the Senate floor.  The nominee the Senate will finally vote on today, Brian Martinotti, was nominated over a year ago to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Judge Martinotti has been awaiting a floor vote for over 250 days, even though his nomination was reported by voice vote by the Judiciary Committee last October. Since 2002, Judge Martinotti has served as a judge on the Superior Court of New Jersey. Prior to that, he spent 15 years in private practice. Judge Martinotti has also served as a public defender, as a prosecutor, and as a municipal tax attorney. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Martinotti ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the district court, its highest rating. He has the support of his home State Senators, Mr. Menendez and Mr. Booker. I support his nomination.  Even after today's vote, there will still be 24 judicial nominations languishing on the Senate floor. One of them was reported at the same time as Judge Martinotti and has also been awaiting a vote for over 8 months. We still do not have an agreement to vote on the nomination of Edward Stanton to the Western District of Tennessee. In 2010, the Senate voted unanimously to confirm Mr. Stanton as the U.S. attorney for that district. His current nomination is supported by his two Republican home State Senators, and he was unanimously voice voted out of the Judiciary Committee. I hope the Republican Senators from Tennessee will be able to persuade the majority leader to schedule a vote for Mr. Stanton's nomination before we leave for the 7-week recess he has scheduled.  It is the Senate's duty to ensure that our independent judiciary can function. Senate Republicans must be responsible and act on Chief Judge Garland's nomination, as well as the 24 judicial nominations that are languishing on the Senate floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Medium.com, June 29, 2016]                 Obstructionism is Terrible Governance                           (By Reid Hoffman)       As an entrepreneur and investor, I prioritize construction      and collaboration. Whether it's a five-person start-up or a      global giant, the companies that are most productive are the      ones whose employees operate with a shared sense of purpose      and a clear set of policies for responding to changing      conditions and new opportunities.       That's why I'm so appalled by what's happening in the      Senate this year, and how starkly it illustrates the      differences between Silicon Valley and Washington, DC.       Just hours after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia      unexpectedly died in February, Senate Majority Leader Mitch      McConnell told the American people not to expect a      replacement any time soon. The vacancy created by Justice      Scalia's passing, McConnell insisted, ``should not be filled      until we have a new president.''       Since then, Leader McConnell's position has remained      unchanged--he won't even meet with any nominee until January      2017. Effectively, he and his allies are in the midst of a      year-long strike.       Imagine if entire departments at Fortune 500 companies      announced they were going to stop performing key functions of      their job for a year or more, with no possibility of moving      forward until a new CEO took over. Investors would start      dumping their stock. Customers would seek out alternatives.      Competitors would make these companies pay for such      dysfunctional gridlock. Eventually executives and employees      would be fired.       In Silicon Valley, such behavior would be corporate      suicide. In Washington, DC, it's business as usual.       So Mitch McConnell's strike goes on and on--he refuses to      even meet with any nominee until a new president takes      office. Other senators like Richard Burr (R-NC), Sen. Chuck      Grassley (R-IA), and Rob Portman (R-OH) have followed      McConnell's lead, either refusing to even informally meet      with Judge Garland, or meeting but still reflexively      insisting that a formal Senate hearing is not an option.       But the Constitution does not give the job of nominating      and appointing Supreme Court Justices to the next President--     it gives it to the current one.       Respecting the Constitution's authority and the obligations      of his job, President Obama nominated a potential replacement      for Justice Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland, on March 16. To      date, only two Republican senators--Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL)      and Susan Collins (R-ME)--have resisted peer pressure and      publicly stated that Judge Garland should be given a formal      hearing. The rest are joining McConnell in his strike.       In a 2013 op-ed, New York Times columnist Thomas L.      Friedman explored the difference between Silicon Valley's      conception of collaboration and Washington, DC's. In the      nation's capital, Friedman observed, collaboration ``is an      act of treason--something you do when you cross over and vote      with the other party.'' In Silicon Valley, companies that are      ``trying to kill each other in one market [are] working      together in another--to better serve customers.''       As Friedman went on to explain, Silicon Valley's version of      collaboration doesn't mean groupthink or lockstep consensus.      Vital organizations and industries cultivate diverse and      competitive viewpoints, because it's this very ``clash of      ideas'' that tends to produce innovation and adaptation.       But Silicon Valley situates its clash of ideas within a      larger framework of cooperation and compromise, under the      premise that what's good for the ecosystem as a whole will      also benefit individual players, even if they sometimes have      competing interests.       What's striking about McConnell's stance is how vividly it      illustrates DC's preference for reflexive obstruction over      the kind of collaboration and consensus-building that      characterizes healthy and productive organizations.       It's not as if the Constitution doesn't give senators like      McConnell broad room in which to operate in dissenting      fashion. Specifically, Article II, Section 2 of the      Constitution invests the President with the power to make      appointments ``by and with the advice and consent of the      Senate.''       This language clearly gives the Senate a confirming but      open-ended role. It doesn't instruct the Senate to hold      hearing within a specific number of days, for example. It      doesn't even explicitly mandate that the Senate must hold      formal hearings or meet with a nominee.       The Constitution simply directs the Senate to advise the      President in his effort to nominate and appoint nominees. But      how can the Senate credibly and effectively fulfill this      obligation without making any effort to gather information      about nominees and deliberate on their qualifications?       In keeping the language so broad in this instance, the      Constitution effectively places the Senate in far more than a      rubber-stamping role. As Barack Obama himself suggested in      2006, when he was still a senator, the Senate arguably has      the authority to examine a nominee's ``philosophy, ideology,      and record,'' not just his general character.       What Article II, Section 2 ultimately does, in other words,      is set the stage for clashes of ideas, albeit within a larger      framework of collaboration and consensus. Importantly, the      Constitution advises the Senate to work ``with'' the      President, not ``against'' him or in opposition to him.       And it presumes that the Senate will indeed be working.       Still, instead of holding hearings in which to assess Judge      Garland's suitability for the Court, McConnell and his      colleagues are doing nothing.       If their obstructionism goes unchecked, it will continue      harming American citizens in very tangible ways. Having only      eight Justices on the bench increases the possibility of a      deadlock.       When cases end in deadlock, nothing gets decided. Resources      are expended, and the American public is left hanging until      the Court can hear the case again or consider another case      with similar issues.       This has happened twice already--last week when the Court      deadlocked on an immigration reform case, and in March, in a      case regarding whether individuals should be required to      guarantee their spouses' loans. Traditionally, laws regarding      this practice have differed in various parts of the country,      creating confusion for small business owners and their      spouses about what their obligations are. Unfortunately, this      confusion and lack of clarity will persist indefinitely      because of the Court's deadlock.       What would happen if President Obama told Congress not to      bother passing any more bills this year, because he had      decided he would automatically veto any of them that made it      to his desk? How many private sector organizations would      tolerate personnel who refuse to perform key job      responsibilities until the current boss is replaced by      someone new?       According to Gallup, 84 percent of Americans disapprove of      the way Congress is doing its job. Or perhaps more      accurately, not doing its job.       Indeed, from 1900 through 1980, it took the Senate a median      of 17 days after nomination to confirm or reject a Supreme      Court nominee.       Like today's senators, those senators took an oath to      support the Constitution and ``faithfully discharge the      duties of [their] office.''       Now, however, scorched-earth partisanship has thoroughly      compromised Congress's ability to operate functionally. More      than 100 days have passed since President Obama nominated      Judge Garland--and there aren't even any plans to begin      hearings yet.       No wonder so many Americans believe our government is      severely broken.       If we truly want to make Congress a collaborative      enterprise that efficiently works in the interests of the      American people, the American people must apply pressure      directly to senators like McConnell, Burr, and Portman.       While some people might insist that these senators are      simply fighting partisanship with partisanship, blocking a      nominee that a Democrat president is trying to force upon      American voters without their say, that's a false      equivalency.       President Obama is a democratically elected official,      faithfully discharging the duties of his office. In      democracies, we aren't always governed by the people or the      parties that we voted for. But when officials are elected, we      must respect their authority, as long as they're exercising      that authority within the bounds of whatever regulatory      frameworks are in place to guide them. (In this case, it's      the Constitution.)       Every American citizen should understand this. And our      elected officials shouldn't just understand this--they should      be setting an example that all Americans can follow. Instead,      McConnell and his colleagues are doing the opposite.       Ultimately, they're not telling President Obama that they      don't think his nominee is a good one. They're saying that      they refuse to acknowledge President Obama's legitimacy as an      elected official.       This kind of partisanship is endemic in Washington, DC now.      But this latest behavior is such an egregious example of      Congressional dysfunction that Senator McConnell and his      colleagues must be held accountable.       That's why I have signed this Change.org petition urging      McConnell to give Judge Garland a hearing, and why I strongly      encourage others to join me.       Our elected officials must understand that we, the American      people, expect them to perform the duties of their office,      even when that means working with other elected officials      from different parties.       They must understand that we're fed up with business as      usual in Washington, DC. They must understand that we want      leaders who look for opportunities to collaborate and work      together productively, instead of pursuing obstructionism      that serves political parties rather than citizens.       So let Mitch McConnell know that it's time to quit      abdicating around. Tell him to do his job and schedule a      hearing for Judge Merrick Garland now.                                  ____   Is Trump's Attack on Judge Racist? If It Quacks Like a Duck . . .                         (By Steven Dettelbach)       Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the latest victim of Donald Trump's      racist attacks, is not allowed to defend himself under the      judicial rules. So I will defend him.       I will defend him as a fellow, former federal prosecutor. I      will defend him because I am the husband of an immigrant from      Mexico and the father of our two children. And I will defend      him as an American, because what Donald Trump is doing is      decidedly un-American.       Curiel is a respected jurist. Before becoming a judge, he      made a name for almost two decades as a federal prosecutor,      investigating and prosecuting Mexican drug cartels. As a      former U.S. attorney and career prosecutor myself, I know      firsthand that these cases are some of the most difficult and      dangerous in our criminal justice system. That work earned      Curiel death threats from those same Mexican cartels he      fought, threats that did not deter him from protecting this      nation for a moment.       Unlike Trump, Curiel comes from Midwestern working-class      roots. He was born just hours to the west of here--a place      Trump will visit to become the GOP nominee--in Indiana. His      parents came to this country and became citizens. His father      worked in the steel mills, just like those who built our      community, to help put his son through both Indiana      University and law school. He was first appointed to the      bench in California by another immigrant, Republican Gov.      Arnold Schwarzenegger, and then elevated to the federal bench      by President Obama after unanimous U.S. Senate confirmation.      Curiel's life is a true American success story.       None of this matters to Trump, though. All that matters to      Trump are that: 1) Trump thinks he is losing in the Trump      University lawsuit before Curiel and 2) the judge's parents      came to this country from Mexico, which is of course the only      reason he can possibly be losing the lawsuit. Apparently,      when things don't go Trump's way, he plays the race card.       In truth, Trump can't hold a candle to Curiel. Unlike      Trump, Curiel has done more than talk about protecting our      borders. He spent two decades on the border, fighting      dangerous drug cartels. Unlike Trump, Curiel was not born as      heir to a real estate empire. He earned all he has achieved      through hard work and merit.       I am a lawyer. I know that it can be frustrating when a      case does not go your way. But Trump's response to losing in      that case is to play the race card. That temperament is not      only unpresidential, it is dangerous.       Those supporting Trump need to re-evaluate whether lending      their own credibility to his racist rants is still tenable.      If country really does come before party, how can anyone who      calls himself an American leader still support this man who      openly berates public servants based on their race?       As a U.S. attorney, I saw the way career law enforcement      like Gonzalo Curiel worked to protect us. As a parent, I tell      my children that all citizens in this nation must be judged      based on what they accomplish, not how they look or where      their parents were born. That is America.       Trump evidently understands neither of these basic points.      Trump and his supporters say they value plain talk. Well,      here is some: Ignoring a person's record and judging him      based on ethnic heritage is the definition of racism. Trump      did just that. What does that make him?       Quack.
