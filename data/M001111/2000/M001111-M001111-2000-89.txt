 President, I thank my colleague for yielding to me.  I come to the floor for a brief moment to pay tribute to the victims of gun violence who were killed one year ago today.  We are all familiar with the incidents of gun violence in our schools; from Columbine to Springfield, OR, to Paducah, KY, and unfortunately to so many other schools and communities.  Gun violence is particularly disturbing when it happens in a school.  But gun violence happens everywhere. A member of my staff lost a son to gun violence. Her son was simply stopping at a convenience store when he was robbed and killed.  How many families have to suffer unnecessarily before this Congress passes commonsense gun control legislation?  The U.S. Conference of Mayors has maintained a list of the thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire since the Columbine tragedy.  Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year.  We will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session until this Republican Congress acts on sensible gun control legislation.  Here are the names of a few Americans who died due to gun violence one year ago today:  Antwan Brooks, 26, Pittsburgh, PA;  James A Brown, 22, Chicago, IL;  Kenneth Cork, 46, Houston, TX;  Marsha Cress, 32, Fort Worth, TX;  Kenneth L. Mack, 49, Chicago, IL;  Michael Powers, 29, Atlanta, GA;  Howard Rice, 31, Baltimore, MD;  Fernando Rojas, 17, Chicago, IL;  Rodney Wayne Smith, 33, Washington, DC;  Rolando Williams, 17, Pittsburgh, PA; and  Earlwin Wright, 22, Chicago, IL.
