It strikes me that it is not about the preservation of marriage, it is about the preservation of the ``majority,'' the Republican majority. That is the ``M'' word behind this debate.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, if this issue is not creating a national problem or crisis, if it ranks so low among the American people, 33rd on the list of the important things facing America, why, I ask the Senator from Nevada, has the Republican majority ignored all the issues that people care about and count on us to do something about? Why are they ignoring all these issues and moving to this issue of gay marriage and proposing a constitutional amendment?
