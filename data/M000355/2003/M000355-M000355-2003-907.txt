 The majority leader will offer an amendment related to ethanol upon going to the bill tomorrow morning. There will be no rollcall votes tomorrow, but I encourage Senators to come to the floor to debate the amendment.  Next week, on Monday, the Senate will take up the reconciliation bill. No rollcall votes will occur on Monday. However, Members are encouraged to make their opening statements during that day. The majority leader would like to remind all Senators that next week is expected to be a busy legislative week, and Members should schedule themselves accordingly. The next rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday, and Members will be notified when that vote is scheduled.                          ____________________
