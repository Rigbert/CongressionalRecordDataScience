 President Hrabowski's deep commitment to fostering talented students, especially in science and math, has helped increase UMBC's number of African-American science and engineering majors sevenfold. Today, UMBC is one of America's biggest producers of African-American science and engineering Ph.D.s. As a fellow college president put it, President Hrabowski ``has taught all of higher education that minority and low-income students . . . can meet the highest standards and excel.''  Those high standards are, importantly, a matter of national competitiveness--but they are also a measure of this nation's promise of equality. As a child in Alabama, Freeman Hrabowski remembers Martin Luther King, Jr. telling civil rights marchers: ``What you do this day will have an impact on generations as yet unborn.'' Today, at places like UMBC, that promise is coming true in the lives of the young men and women who are making the most of what those marchers won for them.  I join the members of the Maryland House delegation in thanking President Hrabowski for his commitment to his students and his extraordinary contribution to higher education. We congratulate him for this much-deserved recognition of his achievements.                          ____________________
