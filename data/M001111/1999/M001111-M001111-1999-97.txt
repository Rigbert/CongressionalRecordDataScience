 President.  I think one of the great things about the class size initiative that is so important to remember is that this money goes directly to the classrooms, with no bureaucracy and one piece of paper. There is essentially no paperwork. This money is allocated directly. There is no bureaucracy and no administration cost. This money goes to the teachers in our classrooms. That is what so many of us believe is the right way to spend our Federal dollars.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Durbin, Torricelli, Mikulski, John Kerry, Boxer, Sarbanes, and Johnson be added as cosponsors.
