 President, we are working together, Senator Lautenberg and I, and our staffs. We are close to resolving a number of amendments here, but there are some amendments that will require votes. I just ask the sponsors to come on down to the floor because we are probably going to have to have some votes on them: The McConnell amendment regarding expedited review, the McCain amendment regarding Amtrak bookkeeping, the Leahy amendment regarding helicopters, the Kerry amendment regarding Amtrak, and the Durbin amendment, smoking on international flights.  It is just a few minutes before 7. Senator Lautenberg and I are ready to move. If Members who are sponsoring those amendments would come on down and help us, I think it would expedite the bill tonight.
