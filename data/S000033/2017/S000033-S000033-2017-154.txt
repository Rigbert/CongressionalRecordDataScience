 President, I urge a strong ``no'' vote on the Barrasso amendment. The language calls for strengthening Social Security, but we all know what strengthening Social Security means. It means cutting Social Security. It means cutting Medicare. It means cutting Medicaid. We are into Orwellian language. ``Strengthening'' is not cutting programs, it is not throwing 20 million Americans off health insurance, it is not privatizing Medicare, it is not raising prescription drug costs for senior citizens. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Barrasso amendment.
