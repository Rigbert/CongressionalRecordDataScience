Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3973 is legislation which I introduced in consultation with the Alaska Federation of Natives. This legislation will authorize a study to assist in the implementation of the recommendations of the Joint Federal/State Commission on Policies and Programs affecting Alaska Natives and is needed to begin to address the social and economic crisis of Alaska Natives.  The primary focus of the 1992 Commission study was to provide an in-depth analysis, with specific recommendations to Congress, the President of the United States, the Alaska Legislature, the Governor of the State of Alaska and the Native community on the social and economic conditions of Alaska Natives. The Commission completed 2 years of research, public hearings and task force discussion and submitted its report in May of 1994.  The Committee on Resources held a joint oversight hearing in November of 1995 with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to hear testimony on the Alaska Native Commission report dated May 1994 from the Alaska Native Community, the Governor of the State of Alaska and from the administration. Their testimony focused on recommendations provided by the Commission report on how to address the extremely volatile social and economic conditions of Alaska Natives. This legislation is the outcome of the testimony accepted by all entities in the first step of addressing the crisis status of Alaska Natives.  The Administration has verbally stated no opposition to this legislation and has a letter forthcoming.  I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of H.R. 3973.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1400
