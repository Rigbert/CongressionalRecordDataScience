President, the old adage that sunlight is the best disinfectant is an old adage for one main reason: It is true.  That is why I am introducing the Financial Disclosure to Reduce Tax Haven Abuse Act of 2012, to require candidates for Federal office and certain Federal employees to disclose any financial interest they or their spouse hold that is held in an offshore tax haven.  It might seem ridiculous that we don't already know whether candidates and Members of Congress are using offshore tax havens. However, under current law, those individuals are not required to account for where their financial interests are held.  A January 26, 2012, article in the Los Angeles Times reported that Mitt Romney--a candidate for the Republican nomination for President--failed to disclose a number of accounts in countries with very low tax burdens.  Specifically, according to a review of the candidate's tax returns and financial disclosure statements:       At least 23 funds and partnerships listed in the couple's      2010 tax returns did not show up or were not listed in the      same fashion on Romney's most recent financial disclosure,      including 11 based in low-tax foreign countries such as      Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg.  The Romney campaign called the discrepancies ``trivial.''  But this information is not trivial to the American people's trust in government, and the use of offshore tax havens is not trivial to our economy.  Studies have found that tax offshore tax havens, and other similar loopholes, cost taxpayers $100 billion per year.  I want to commend Senators Levin and Conrad for the work they have done to shine a light on these nefarious practices.  Those two Senators successfully included a provision in the Senate Transportation bill that will give the Treasury Department greater tools to crack down on offshore tax haven abuse. It is an important step forward, but more must be done.  The American people are rightly concerned that the wealthy and well-connected are skirting our laws to avoid taxation, and they deserve to know that the people who hope to represent them in Washington--and those who are trying to attain those positions--aren't cheating the system.  Nothing in this bill impinges on an individual's right to hold financial interests within the global economy. If there is a legitimate reason for a candidate or a Member of Congress or any other individual who files a financial disclosure to hold their money in an account on the Cayman Islands, they should have no problem explaining it to voters. But any individual who has or wants to have the public's trust should be honest about practices they have engaged in that cost the taxpayers they wish to represent billions of dollars every year. This is an important step that we must take to restore the public trust.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                S. 2253       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Disclosure to      Reduce Tax Haven Abuse Act of 2012''.     SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNTS HELD IN TAX HAVENS.       Section 102(b)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978      (5 U.S.C. App.) is amended--       (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``, with a specific      accounting of any financial interest held by the covered      individual or their spouse in a country that is considered as      a tax haven as listed by the Secretary of the Treasury and      made available to the filer'' after ``calendar year''; and       (2) inserting at the end the following:     ``In compiling the list of tax havens under subparagraph (A),      the Secretary of the Treasury should consider for inclusion      those jurisdictions which have been previously and publicly      identified by the Internal Revenue Service as secrecy      jurisdictions in Federal court proceedings.''.                                 ______                                       By
