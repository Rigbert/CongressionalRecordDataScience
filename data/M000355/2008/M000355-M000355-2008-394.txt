 President, I appreciate the spirit in which the majority leader addressed my remarks on the housing issue. I think it is safe to say there is interest on both sides in moving forward. Whatever reservations we have on this side relate to how the minority will be treated once we have made the decision to move forward. This is something the majority leader and I will continue to discuss, as we have in the last few weeks.  With regard to judges, with the best of intentions, the majority leader and I both came up with what we thought was a reasonable goal for the number of circuit judges that ought to be approved in this Congress based on the pattern of each of the last three Presidents, which had, from their point of view, the misfortune of ending their terms with the opposition in control of the Senate. The lowest number achieved in circuit judges was under President Clinton. It was 15. We currently have six. If we are going to have any chance of getting to what the majority leader and I agreed was at least a modest, achievable goal in this Congress, we have a ways to go. I am not blaming him for that. It strikes me that the Judiciary Committee simply isn't functioning. But it remains the goal of mine--and I hope it is still his goal--to meet a sort of minimal threshold of an acceptable level of circuit judge confirmations.  I appreciate the attitude in which the majority leader has pursued that issue from the beginning of this Congress. I hope we can continue to work to try to get to some level that would be widely considered by any objective standard as a fair number in this situation.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
