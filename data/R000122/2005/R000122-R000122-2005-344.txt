 This amendment has been shared with the majority. It has been reviewed by the majority. We are not attempting to surprise anyone with this amendment. It deals with child safety locks. In fact, it is an amendment that was offered to the bill last year and passed overwhelmingly. It is my intent to provide opportunity to discuss issues with respect to gun legislation and to present them to the Senate.  Again, I would note when the majority leader requested unanimous consent to lay aside one of his amendments to offer another amendment, no one on my side objected because in fact we thought we were proceeding in good faith, that we shared amendments if we had an opportunity to look at the amendments beforehand, that we could proceed in an orderly and reasonable fashion. But I am a bit shocked. This amendment has been with the majority for the last, I would suggest, 30 or 40 minutes. It is an amendment that was presented in substance before to the floor. So I am a little bit surprised about the Senator's reaction.
