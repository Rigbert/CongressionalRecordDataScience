Arnie passed from this life at the age of 92 on March 31, 2007, leaving a legacy of love and friendship to many and rejoining his wife Jessica.  Coming to Toledo as a toddler, Arnie was a lifelong resident. He went to work at the former Willys Overland Jeep plant during World War II, and went on to the United Auto Workers International Union staff in 1951. Of note, he never missed a union convention beginning in 1941.  More than a labor leader, Arnie was an accomplished accordion player and performed in various events throughout the United States and Canada, including each of those UAW conventions. His music was appreciated, but children knew him best as Uncle Arnie the clown. He willingly gave of his talents as both accordionist and clown to all sorts of charitable causes, putting a smile on the face of everyone he met. A family man and friend of the neighborhood at heart, it is the measure of the man that all who knew him were fond of him.  He was beloved by his family and thousands in our community. The festive mood set by his joyous music, tens of thousands of balloon animals lovingly given to children, endless gifts given to strangers and friends alike, demonstrated an extraordinarily kind heart that shone through his sparkling eyes and effervescent smile. His spirit lifted every occasion and he gave and gave and gave. Arnie Shenofsky helped define Toledo as a caring community. It was my privilege to know him and witness firsthand how his presence lent splendor to every event, large and small. Many times, he chose not to speak but to let you know what he was feeling through his music. How fortunate we have been that he shared his gifts of the heart with us for nine decades.  Through the decades of his life Arnold Shenofsky sought to always be a helper, a healer, a friend to young and old alike. He was the same person with both notables and neighbors, and was truly beloved by his family. His sisters, brothers, and children and their families have mourned their loss even as they celebrate a life well lived. They carry his flame in their hearts, always.                          ____________________
