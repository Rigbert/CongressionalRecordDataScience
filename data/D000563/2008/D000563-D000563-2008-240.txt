President, I ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the amendment No. 5250 at the desk, which is the text of S. 1642 as passed by the Senate, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the table, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.
