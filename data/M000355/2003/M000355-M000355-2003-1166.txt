  Skipping over:       A senior Democratic aide said that was an ``extraordinary      circumstance''--  We will agree that the Senate ending up 50/50 was unusual. It hasn't happened since the 1880s.     --that forced them to continue under an even funding deal for      committees.       ``If we pick up a seat or two, I think it's without a doubt      we'd go back to the two-thirds/one-third,'' the aide said,      using the in-house phrase to describe normal funding levels      that gave the majority up to 67 percent of committee money.  My question to the Senator from Texas is this: I wonder what has changed between then and now. It appears that what our good friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle had in mind, had they continued to be up 51-49, was to go back to the traditional split of two-thirds/one-third. There must have been some intervening thinking, I ask my friend from Texas, some new development here.
