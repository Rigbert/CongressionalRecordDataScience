President, I wish to compliment the Senator from Nebraska for his comments. I totally agree with him.  As last year drew to a close, I spoke about the Senate's lost opportunity to take long overdue steps to address the serious vacancies crisis on Federal courts throughout the country. With nearly one out of every 10 Federal judgeships vacant, the Senate should not have adjourned with 21 judicial nominations on the calendar and stalled from having a vote. Regrettably, Senate Republicans chose to end last year using the same obstructionist tactic that they used the year before.
