''  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             California Biomedical                                         Research Association,                                 Sacramento, CA, February 9, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the CBRA Governing      Board, I am writing to encourage your ``no'' vote on the      cloture vote on S. 1601 scheduled for Tuesday, February 10,      1998. The Association urges you to support continuing debate      about the potential negative impacts of Senator Trent Lott's      legislation.       Somatic cell transfer technology is essential to continuing      research into cures for some of our greatest human health      threats--Parkinson's Disease, leukemia, diabetes, Alzheimer's      disease and spinal cord injuries. Unintended consequences of      this bill as currently written could threaten the future      health of millions of Americans.       Please feel free to contact our office if you should need      further information.           Sincerely,                                                     Suzanne Ness,                                                        President.                         members (partial list)       Allergan       Alliance Pharmaceutical       ALZA Corporation       American Association for Laboratory Animal Science:      Northern, Orange County, San Diego, Southern and Palms to      Pines Branches       American Cancer Society, California Division, Inc.
