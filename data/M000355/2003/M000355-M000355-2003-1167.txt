 What is also not in doubt was that the previous Congress was an extraordinary circumstance, very unusual circumstance, in which we found ourselves in a 50/50 tie at the beginning of that Congress--and we are now at the beginning of a new Congress--and we produced a resolution that dealt not just with appointing of the committees but also funding and space. That was unusual. It had not been done before in a floor resolution, as the Senator from Texas pointed out. We switched in the middle because one Senator decided to go to the other side. It was not because the voters had voted out a Republican Senate, but a Senator decided to go over. In order to minimize the disruptions to staff who could have been laid off in the middle of a Congress after making plans and having families rely on employment at least for a 2-year period of time, to minimize the disruption, since we were in the middle of a Congress, we decided to leave it that way. I say my friend from Texas is absolutely on the mark.  There is no precedent for what is being suggested would be appropriate by the other side. It is clearly inconsistent with what they had in mind had they been up by a seat or two.
