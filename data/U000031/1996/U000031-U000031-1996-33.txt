Speaker, I rise today to honor an accomplished educator, a community leader, and a dear friend, Mr. Fred Richardson. After 38 quality years spent in school systems across Michigan and Indiana, Mr. Richardson will be stepping down this year as superintendent of St. Joseph Public Schools.  Mr. Richardson began his education career as a teacher in 1958 in Shipshewana, IN. He was quickly promoted to principal and spent time at the helm of a number of schools in Indiana before returning to teach and become principal in Fennville in his native Michigan. After spending many years with the Hillsdale Community Schools, he was eventually recognized for his talents and promoted to superintendent.  In 1982, he left Hillsdale to assume the same role in the St. Joseph Public Schools. During his tenure there he was able to turn the cash strapped organization around, balancing the system's books and creating an abundance of financial reserves. In fact, the district just recently became debt free thanks in part to Mr. Richardson's guidance.  Praised by staff, faculty, and school boards, Mr. Richardson has always cared most about the kids. Time and time again, his efforts with the children of Michigan have earned him high marks. A truly first-class individual, Mr. Richardson has also found time in his busy schedule to share his experience with the next generation of educators by teaching at Western Michigan University.  As Fred enters this next stage of his life, my wife Amey joins me in wishing him a long and healthy retirement. Thank you, Fred, for so many great years of quality service to southwest Michigan. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Fred Richardson on his retirement from a remarkable, 38-year-long career in education.                          ____________________
