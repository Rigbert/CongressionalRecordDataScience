Polis, for yielding me the time.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the rule and underlying bill by my Republican colleagues. The Republican bill favors big Wall Street megabanks and financial interests over the American people. I would ask my Republican friends: Don't you remember the financial crash of 2008 and who created it?  Their bill repeals a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule which cuts down on those companies' abilities to use so-called forced arbitration clauses which prevent cheated or defrauded consumers from going to court. In other words, they prevent the victims from going to court. They want to handcuff the customers, not the megabanks that took them to the cleaners.  This takes us back to the days of when the fine print in the credit card or other financial agreement prevented consumers from banding together in class action lawsuits to challenge illegal behavior by the most powerful financial giants in the world. Try to deal with one of them as an individual. They don't even return phone calls, for heaven's sake. You get in that robo system for hours and hours, and then the phone call cuts off.  Republicans want to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, even after the agency's work for consumers resulted in $12 billion in relief to 27 million Americans who were harmed, and that is just the beginning.  Why is this Republican-led Congress so keen on protecting companies like Wells Fargo that used arbitration clauses and class action bans to create fraudulent accounts, overcharge customers with debit fees and mortgages, and even avoid responsibility for their misconduct? Criminal misconduct.  You can laugh. Come and meet the millions of people who have lost their homes across this country or are underwater on their mortgages. There is no justice for them.  The idea that banks can rip off consumers by abusing obscure clauses buried deep in their contracts is totally outrageous.
