Speaker, what we ought to have the courage to do is to tell all our Homeland Security personnel, We are going to fund you through the end of this year, as we have told every other employee in the Federal Government that is protecting us and serving us on a day-to-day basis.  Mr. Speaker, the majority party said to the American people in a pledge to America:       We will end the practice of packaging unpopular bills with      ``must-pass'' legislation.  The funding of the Department of Homeland Security is a must-pass piece of legislation, legislation to circumvent the will of the American people.       Instead, we will advance major legislation one issue at a      time.  Mr. Speaker, they are breaking that pledge today.                              {time}  1015  Peter King, the former Republican chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, said this: ``If a clean bill comes here, as we expect to happen in just a few hours, we have to accept and vote on it.'' He then said, in reference to this cul-de-sac strategy that the majority party is following of continuing to go into a dead end, he said this, Peter King: ``I think up to this point, we've engaged in an exercise of tactical malpractice. Self-delusion is self-destructive.''  There is not a Republican in this House who believes this strategy will do anything but run them back into that cul-de-sac that they went into in December, at the expense of the confidence of Americans that their Department of Homeland Security, tasked to make them safe, tasked to provide for the security of this Nation, will, in fact, be operating on a full basis.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter dated yesterday from Secretary Jeh Johnson and read this key excerpt from it. Secretary Johnson said: ``Finally, as I have noted many times, mere extension of a continuing resolution has many of the same negative impacts''--outlined in this letter. ``A short-term continuing resolution exacerbates the uncertainty for my workforce and puts us back in the same position, on the brink of a shutdown.''  For those Republicans who believe that we ought to do the responsible thing, as Peter King has said, vote against the previous question. Vote for a rule that provides for the consideration of the Senate-passed bill, which they, 98-2, decided to put on the floor because they thought it was good policy.       KEY EXCERPT: ``Finally, as I have noted many times, mere      extension of a continuing resolution has many of the same      negative impacts. A short-term continuing resolution      exacerbates the uncertainty for my workforce and puts us back      in the same position, on the brink of a shutdown just days      from now.''                                                February 26, 2015.       Dear Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader McConnell, Minority      Leader Reid, and Minority Leader Pelosi:       Thank you for your leadership and efforts to pass a clean,      full-year appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland      Security. As you know, our funding expires tomorrow at      midnight. I write to explain to Members of Congress the real      and substantial consequences of a failure to pass a full-year      appropriations bill by that deadline.       As an initial matter, it must be noted that a potential      shutdown of the Department comes at a particularly      challenging time for homeland security. It is stunning that      we must even contemplate a shutdown of the Department in the      current global context. The global terrorist threat has      become more decentralized and complex. Terrorist      organizations are now openly calling for attacks on Western      targets. Yesterday's arrests in New York City highlight the      threat of independent actors in the homeland who support      overseas terrorist organizations and radical ideology. We are      working hard to stay one step ahead of potential threats to      aviation security. Last year at this time, the spike in      migrant children began to appear at our border; we are      deployed to prevent this situation from recurring, and to      address it aggressively if it does. The Nation is in the      midst of a very cold, harsh winter, and the Federal Emergency      Management Agency is working with states impacted by record      snowfalls.       Here are just some of the consequences for homeland      security if the Department's funding lapses and we shut down:       First, about 170,000 employees will be required to work,      but will not get paid for that work during the period of a      shutdown. This includes our Coast Guard, Border Patrol      agents, Secret Service agents, Transportation Security      Administration officers, and     others on the front lines of our homeland security. These      working men and women depend on biweekly paychecks to make      ends meet for themselves and their families. For them,      personally, work without pay is disruptive and demoralizing.      Even worse for our people are the public statements by some      that make light of a shutdown, which disregards DHS      employees' personal sacrifices and dedication to our Nation's      security.       Second, approximately 30,000 men and women of the      Department must be furloughed and sent home without pay. Our      financial management, human resources, procurement and      contracting, and information technology teams--the      institutional backbone of the Department--will be reduced by      90 percent, from over 2,000 to just 208 people. My own      immediate headquarters staff will be cut by about 87 percent.      Our Science and Technology team, which is intensely focused      on developing non-metallic explosive detection capabilities      as well as other technologies to counter threats to aviation,      will be cut 94 percent, from 448 to 26 people. Our Domestic      Nuclear Detection Office, which is our Nation's primary      research and development lead for development of advanced      nuclear detection technologies and technical forensic      capabilities, will also be cut 94 percent, from 121 to just 7      people.       Third, contracting services across the Department,      including those for critical mission support activities, will      be disrupted and/or interrupted altogether. Depending upon      the length of a shutdown, contract awards and major      acquisitions could be impacted. In the event of a shutdown,      negotiations to construct the United States Coast Guard's 8th      National Security Cutter will be delayed, potentially leading      to an increase in costs.       Fourth, our $2.5 billion-a-year grant-making to state,      local, tribal, and territorial governments, to assist them in      preventing, responding to or recovering from terrorist      attacks, major disasters and other emergencies, remains at a      standstill (it has already stopped because the Department is      currently funded by a Continuing Resolution). Of particular      note, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Emergency      Management Performance Grants, which contribute 50 percent of      the salaries of state and local emergency management      personnel, cannot be funded.       Fifth, public assistance disaster recovery payments to      communities affected by previous disasters will grind to a      halt. Though these payments are funded with prior-year money,      the Federal Emergency Management Agency's staff that      processes them must be furloughed.       Sixth, depending upon the length of a shutdown, DHS will no      longer be able to support state and local authorities with      planning, safety, and security resources for special security      events such as the Boston and Chicago Marathons.       Seventh, depending upon the length of a shutdown, work to      complete construction of the National Bio and Agro-Defense      Facility in Kansas, which will replace the aging 1950s-era      Plum Island facility in New York, could be disrupted.       Eighth, new hires across the Department must be halted,      disrupting critical missions to secure the border, protect      millions of daily airline passengers, strengthen security at      the White House, and deploy new ICE investigators. Routine      attrition hiring would cease across the Department, seriously      undermining our homeland security frontline staffing needs.      Our plans to increase CBP staffing at our ports of entry by      2,000 officers, and to maintain the Transportation Security      Administration's workforce of airport screeners and air      marshals will be undermined. Our plans to hire additional      Secret Service uniformed officers and special agents will      also be disrupted.       Ninth, without funding, all training at the Federal Law      ``Enforcement Training Centers'' will cease. Up to 2,000      local, state, and federal law enforcement trainees from      across the country will be sent home.       Finally, as I have noted many times, mere extension of a      continuing resolution has many of the same negative impacts.      A short-term continuing resolution exacerbates the      uncertainty for my workforce and puts us back in the same      position, on the brink of a shutdown just days from now.       I urge Congress, as soon as possible, to pass a clean,      full-year Fiscal Year 2015 appropriations bill for the      Department of Homeland Security.       The American people are counting on us.
