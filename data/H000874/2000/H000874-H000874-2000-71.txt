Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), for his generous comments and also for his cogent comments with respect to the impact that Historically Black Colleges and Universities have had on young African Americans, instilled in them a sense of hope, a sense of opportunity, a sense of future. We know that if young people do not have a sense of future, as too many do today, that they do not work for a future. They work only for today. That inspiration that the gentleman's mother gave him and his exposure to Albany State has enriched us all in this country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from the State of California, from Oakland, (Ms. Lee).
