Speaker, I am pleased to yield to my friend, the distinguished majority leader, for the purposes of inquiring about the schedule for next week and the remainder of the day, if there is any schedule for the remainder of the day.  So that Members who are gathered here will know, have we had the last vote of the day, Mr. Leader?  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding.  Yes, we have just had the last vote of the day.                              {time}  1415  The House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We expect to complete consideration of H.R. 2989, which is the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004. Any votes called on amendments on this bill will be rolled until after 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday we will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of these bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the day. We will plan then to consider H.R. 2622, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, and hope to conclude with consideration of the conference report on H.R. 2115, the Vision 100, Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act.  Thursday, as you know, is September 11, and we are currently working on several measures to recognize the second anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In addition to these measures, which we would expect to have broad bipartisan support on, I would certainly expect to have a moment of silence on the floor of the House and a ceremony similar to the one held in the Rayburn Courtyard last year.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to note for all the Members, we do not plan to have votes next Friday, September 12.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
