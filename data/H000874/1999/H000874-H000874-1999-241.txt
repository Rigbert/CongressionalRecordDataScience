Chairman, this is a very serious debate. We are involvedoverseas in a very serious effort, and we need to be serious.  I came here in June of 1981, and I was presented with a budget on this floor which I voted against, and I voted against it because I thought it would cause high deficits and high interest rates. I, frankly, was right.
