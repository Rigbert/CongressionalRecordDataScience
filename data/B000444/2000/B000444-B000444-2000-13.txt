 President, the only case I could find, in fact, held, as I had predicted, that willful and malicious conduct denies you from being discharged in bankruptcy, in a case where a woman was arrested for violating a restraining order or getting too close to the clinic, tried to discharge the fines against her in bankruptcy, and could not.  I repeat: No one has escaped liability under the Fair Access to Clinic Entrances Act through the abuse of the bankruptcy code, not one. As strongly as feelings are on both sides of this issue, the Schumer amendment is, I must say, a solution in search of a problem. I would support it just to make sure we have the extra protection, but in the absence of the Schumer amendment, there is no reason for the Senate to reverse its opinion on the legislation that had received such strong support.  We voted today on trying to get to a conference report that had a strong Senate stamp on it. I think we made a mistake. I think part of the reason why we made a mistake in not invoking cloture was we had a number of absences. There are 16 or 17 or 18 absences, as I count it; 15 or thereabouts were for cloture. But we will come back to it again, as the majority leader has said.  This does not in any way do anything to allow people to violate the free access to clinics law. And it actually helps women and children who depend on support payments and alimony payments. I will speak to it more later.  I see the majority leader is on the floor for important business. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
