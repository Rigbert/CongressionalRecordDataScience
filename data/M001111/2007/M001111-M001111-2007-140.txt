 President, with that, we have now cleared several amendments. We are again, for the information of all Senators, working to come up with a time agreement. We expect to have a vote in a little more than an hour, as soon as it has been cleared on the Republican side.  Again, we are going to finish this bill tonight. All Members need to get their amendments to the floor, and we will work our way through as many as possible. It will be a late night. It will be less of a late night the sooner we get amendments to the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
