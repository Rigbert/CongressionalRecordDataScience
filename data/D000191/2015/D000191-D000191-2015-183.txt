Speaker, I submit an article from Roseburg, Oregon's News-Review to honor and remember the lives of those who were taken too soon at Umpqua Community College on Thursday, October 1, 2015.  I ask that all Americans pray for the friends and families of these nine victims as they grieve and rebuild from this tragedy.  We must also keep in our thoughts and prayers those who were injured physically and emotionally by this event. It will take time and our support and patience as they grieve and recover.  Roseburg is a strong and tight-knit community. I am heartened, and not surprised, by the acts of kindness and generosity in response to an unthinkable act. We call that ``UCC Strong,'' ``Roseburg Strong.'' It is this strong spirit that will carry everyone through this difficult time.         [From the News-Review, Roseburg, Oregon, Oct. 2, 2015]    Victims' Families: `Our Lives Have Been Shattered Beyond Repair'       The victims who died in Thursday's Umpqua Community College      shooting were far more than a list of names. Five of the nine      people who died were under 21 years old.       They were youth with bright futures, a teacher who loved      the river, older students getting a fresh start.       Their families, friends and community are devastated by      their loss.                             treven anspach       Treven Anspach's close friend Danny Gil said Anspach loved      playing soccer and basketball, and he was good at it because      he was taller than everybody else. He also liked just hanging      out with friends.       ``He always had a smile on his face, I don't know. He was      just like the type of guy that was always cheerful to be      around,'' Gil said.       Gil was devastated when he heard from his roommate that a      mutual friend had seen Anspach get shot. He believes Anspach      was the victim who was brought to Mercy Medical Center and      died there.       ``I wasn't ready to let him go. I just wasn't ready for it.      I just cry about it and talk to my friends about it and my      family,'' Gil said.       Gil said Anspach had his whole life ahead of him.       ``He was doing good in college. He had a girlfriend. He was      engaged, and he was ready for life to just begin,'' he said.       In a statement, Anspach's family described him as ``one of      the most positive young men, always looking for the best in      life. Treven was larger than life and brought out the best in      those around him.''       According to his parents, Anspach was ``a perfect son.''       Anspach played basketball for the Sutherlin Bulldogs and at      UCC.       Umpqua Riverhawks basketball coach Dan Leeworthy wrote on      Facebook that Anspach wanted to ``marry his high school      sweetheart, be a firefighter like his Dad, and to serve      others.''       ``To me he was a friend and a coach's dream. He was a      friend to everyone,'' Leeworthy wrote.                              larry levine       Larry Levine was an assistant English professor at Umpqua      Community College. He was an avid fisherman, a member of the      Steamboaters fishing group and a former fly fishing guide.       Levine was teaching an English class just before the      shooting, and it was his classroom the gunman entered when      the terror began.       Friend and fellow Steamboater Dale Greenley remembered      Levine as an ``easygoing, kind of quiet, laid back'' man.      Greenley had known Levine since the 1970s. He said Levine did      whatever it took to stay by the river so he could keep on      fishing.       ``He could have gone off somewhere and probably made good      money, but he loved the Umpqua and he stayed here and he      finally got that job at the UCC and that was really nice,''      he said.       Greenley doesn't have a television set, so he didn't know      about Levine's death until he was called by a reporter with a      national news outlet.       ``That's when I found out. It was kind of a shock. I'm      still kind of processing it,'' he said.       Greenley said Levine was fun to talk to. They shared      fishing stories together. Levine was a great writer who loved      to describe the North Umpqua River he loved, Greenley said.       ``He was just part of the river,'' Greenley said. ``Larry      loved the river. He committed his life to it.''       He was also popular with students.       ``If you ever had any questions or problems or anything      else, he was Johnny-on-the-spot to help you out,'' said      Taylor Gunn, 21, of Myrtle Creek who took her first ever      community college class from Levine last spring.                        kim dietz, 59, roseburg       Kim Dietz was a strong and compassionate woman, whose love      of animals defined her, said Carolyn Whitehorn, Dietz's      mother-in-law.       Dietz owned two Great Pyrenees dogs.       Whitehorn recalled Dietz setting out to befriend a local      feral cat who was determined to stay wild.       ``Feral cats are not easy to tame,'' she said through      tears. ``But she had him tamed in what seemed like no time at      all. She would sit outside when he was around and just talk      to him and offer him food until he came close enough to      pet.''       Eventually, the cat became the family pet who lived with      Dietz for many years.       ``She was such a strong and powerful woman,'' Whitehorn      said. ``She will be missed greatly.''                       lucas eibel, 18, roseburg       Lucas Eibel's family said they have been ``trying to figure      out how to tell everyone how amazing Lucas was, but that      would take 18 years.''       Eibel was an FFA member and a volunteer with Wildlife      Safari and Saving Grace. He was a Ford Family Foundation      scholarship recipient and was studying chemistry.       He and three of his siblings were quadruplets. They were      nicknamed The Quad by their friends at Roseburg High School.       In 2014, Lucas Eibel told News-Review reporter Kate      Stringer it's ``always funny to see people's reactions'' when      they find out the four are fraternal quadruplets.       Eibel was studying chemistry in his first year at UCC. It      was his favorite subject in high school.       The family has asked that donations be given to Roseburg      High School FFA and to the injured victims.                    quinn glen cooper, 18, roseburg       Quinn Glen Cooper was in his fourth day of college.       ``We are shocked this has happened,'' his family's      statement said.       Cooper was funny, smart and compassionate. He was the kind      of guy who stood up     for other people, according to family members. He was going      to take his brown-belt test in karate next week.       ``I don't know how we're going to move forward with our      lives without Quinn. Our lives have been shattered beyond      repair,'' the family statement said.       ``I can't actually believe you are gone,'' wrote Cooper's      friend Andrew Phillips on Facebook. ``You always made me      laugh and we always finished each other's sentences.''       Former classmate Luke Counsell wrote on Facebook about a      time that Cooper was the only one to follow him to the      changing room to comfort him when he broke down while      rehearsing for a play.       ``He wasn't just a `friend,' he was a brother,'' Counsell      wrote.                  rebecka ann carnes, 18, myrtle creek       Rebecka Carnes had just started both a new job and her      college career, according to her cousin Lisa Crawford. She      was studying for a job in a health care field.       ``She had people in her life that loved her fiercely and      are devastated,'' Crawford wrote on Facebook.       Carnes was a relative of U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley--his      cousin's great-granddaughter.       Merkley called Carnes a ``beautiful spirit,'' according to      The Oregonian.       She graduated South Umpqua High School in June. She played      softball.       Kristy Westbrooks, an English teacher said, ``Going to UCC      was always her plan A she worked really hard to earn      scholarships last year.''       ``Everybody said she was a sweet person and very well      thought of,'' said Jim Howard, superintendent of the South      Umpqua School District.                      lucero alcaraz, 19, roseburg       Lucero Alcaraz was in the UCC Scholars program and studying      to become a pediatric nurse. Friends called her beautiful and      kind-hearted.       Friend Brittany Eggers said Alcaraz was a talented artist      and a great person.       ``She was probably the sweetest person I know, probably the      most genuine too,'' Eggers said. ``She never once said      anything bad about anybody.''       Eggers said she is confused and angry about what happened      to her friend.       ``I just don't understand,'' she said.       Alcaraz's sister Maria Alcaraz, heartbroken, wrote on      Facebook that she never got the chance to tell her how proud      she was of her accomplishments.       ``You were going to do great things love,'' she wrote.                       jason johnson, 33, winston       Jason Johnson spent the last few months of his life      fighting.       A part of The Salvation Army's rehabilitation program to      battle addiction, Johnson went from being beat up and      physically ill to being a role model, said close friend Chuck      Bellinger, who described their friendship as a brotherhood.       ``He was always right there,'' said Bellinger who was in      the program along with Johnson. ``His room was right next to      mine and every night I'd go to bed and before that boy would      get into his bed, he'd come pop my door open and tell me good      night and that he loved me.       ``We have to carry the torch. His torch is a bright one and      probably very difficult to go on with,'' he said.       But Bellinger said that Johnson's death was not in vain.       ``Our brother was following his dream and sobered up and      was becoming a productive member of society,'' he said. ``He      died a sober and upright man--a dude that was loving his      family and an example for everyone.''       He was attending UCC and his family said Johnson had found      the right path and they were proud of him for enrolling in      school.                  sarena dawn moore, 44, myrtle creek       Sarena Moore was a Seventh-Day Adventist who loved animals,      according to Oregon Public Broadcasting.       According to the online Adventist magazine Spectrum, Moore      was a firm believer of prayer, a single mother with few      possessions but a big heart. She attended Reno High School      and had recently moved to Myrtle Creek from Grants Pass to      attend UCC.       Her pictures on Facebook are of dogs and horses, suggesting      she was an animal lover.                          ____________________
