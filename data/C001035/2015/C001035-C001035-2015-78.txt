President, as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I am delighted to be joined today by my ranking member and good friend, Senator Claire McCaskill, in introducing the Senior$afe Act of 2015, a bill that would put in place a common sense plan to help protect American seniors from financial fraud.  According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually.  Protecting seniors from financial exploitation and fraud is one of the top priorities of the Aging Committee. Over the course of the past two and a half years, our Committee has held 15 hearings, six since January, examining how fraudsters find and exploit their victims and what can be done to stop them. The frauds we have highlighted have ranged from the infamous ``Jamaican Lottery Scam,'' that reached its height in 2013, to the notorious IRS phone scam that burst onto the scene this spring, and, more recently, to the shady practices of the pension advance industry. Sadly, not all scammers are strangers to their victims, in too many cases, the senior is exploited by someone he or she knows well.  Although the various scams we have examined differ in scope and structure, one factor is common to all--the fraudsters need to gain the trust and active cooperation of their victims. Without this, their schemes would fail. That is why it is so important that seniors recognize as quickly as possible the red flags that signal potential fraud.  Unfortunately, many seniors do not see these red flags. Sometimes they are too trusting or are suffering from diminished capacity, but, just as often, they miss the flags because the swindlers who prey on them are extremelycrafty and know how to sound convincing. Whatever the reason, a warning sign that can slip by a victim might trigger a second look by financial service representatives trained to spot common scams, who know enough about a senior's habits to question a transaction that doesn't look right. In our work on the Aging Committee, we have heard of many instances where quick action by bank and credit union employees, broker-dealers, and investment advisors has stopped a fraud in progress, saving their customers untold thousands of dollars.  Let me give you an example. Earlier this year, a senior citizen in Vassalboro, ME, was looking to wire funds from his account at Maine Savings Federal Credit Union to an out-of-state location, supposedly to bail out a relative who was in jail. Something about this transaction didn't sound right to the teller supervisor at the credit union. She questioned the customer, who told her he had gotten a call from an ``official'' at the jail, who had instructed him not to speak to anyone about the transaction. Fortunately for this senior citizen, this supervisor was able to spot this as a scam, and her quick thinking saved him from falling victim to it.  In another case, just two weeks ago, an alert bank employee in Nebraska noticed suspicious withdrawals from the checking account of a senior citizen who was a customer of the bank. Not knowing what to do, and without sharing confidential information, this bank teller called the Senate Aging Committee's fraud hotline for guidance. Our staff advised her to contact the local Area Agency on Aging. With the Senior$afe program in place, bank tellers all over the country will know how to respond when situations like this arise in the future.  Regrettably, Federal laws with the important intention of protecting consumer privacy can make it difficult for financial institutions to report suspected fraud to the proper authorities.  Our bill would clarify these laws to encourage banks, credit unions, investment advisors, and broker-dealers to report suspected financial fraud targeting senior citizens to regulators, law enforcement, or adult protective services agencies.  A key feature of the bill is the liability protection it provides: financial institutions and their employees are protected from suit so long as employees are trained in how to spot and report suspected financial exploitation; their reports are made in good faith and on a reasonable basis, and they report to the proper authorities.  Our bill is based on Maine's innovative Senior$afe program, a collaborative effort by Maine's regulators, financial institutions, and legal organizations to educate bank and credit union employees on how to identify and help stop financial exploitation of older Mainers. This program, pioneered by Maine Securities Administrator Judith Shaw, also serves as the template for model legislation developed for adoption at the state level by the North American Securities Administrators Association, or ``NASAA''. The Senior$afe Act and NASAA's model State legislation are complementary efforts, and I am pleased that NASAA has endorsed our bill.  Combating financial abuse of seniors requires regulators, law enforcement, and social service agencies at all levels of government to work collaboratively with the private sector. Financial institutions occupy a critical nexus between fraudsters and their victims, and can play an important role. Their employees, if properly trained, can be a first line of defense protecting our seniors from these fraudsters. The Senior$afe Act encourages financial institutions to train their employees, and shields them from lawsuits when they make good faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities.  I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         North American Securities                             Administrators Association, Inc.,                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2015.     Re The Senior$afe Act of 2015.     Senator Susan Collins,     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington DC.     Senator Claire McCaskill,     Ranking Member, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington          DC.       Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member McCaskill: On      behalf of the North American Securities Administrators      Association (``NASAA''), I'm writing to express strong      support for your work to better protect vulnerable adults      from financial exploitation through the introduction of the      Senior$afe Act of 2015. Your legislation will better protect      seniors by increasing the likelihood that financial      exploitation targeting the elderly will be identified by      financial services professionals, and by removing barriers      that might otherwise frustrate the reporting of such      exploitation to state securities regulators and other      appropriate governmental authorities.       Senior financial exploitation is a difficult but critical      policy challenge. Many in our elderly population are      vulnerable due to social isolation and distance from family,      caregiver, and other support networks. Indeed, evidence      suggests that as many as one out of every five citizens over      the age of 65 has been victimized by a financial fraud. To be      successful in combating senior financial exploitation, state      and federal policymakers must come together to weave a new      safety net for our elderly, breaking down barriers to      identify those who are best positioned to identify red flags      early on and to encourage reporting and referrals to      appropriate local, county, state, and federal agencies,      including law enforcement.       As you know, state securities regulators, working within      the framework of NASAA, are in the late-stages of our own      concerted effort to bolster protections for elderly investors      at risk of exploitation, including through the development of      model legislation to be enacted by states to promote      reporting of suspected exploitation. While the approaches      contemplated by the recently announced NASAA model      legislation and the Senior$afe Act differ in some respects,      they are complementary efforts, both undertaken with the      shared goal of protecting seniors by increasing the detection      and reporting of elderly financial exploitation.       The SeniorSafe Act consists of several essential features.      First, to promote and encourage reporting of suspected      elderly financial exploitation by financial services      professionals, who are positioned to identify and report      ``red flags'' of potential exploitation, the bill would      incentivize financial services employees to report any      suspected exploitation by making them immune from any civil      or administrative liability arising from such a report,      provided that they exercised due care, and that they make      these reports in good faith. Second, in order to better      assure that financial services employees have the knowledge      and training they require to identify ``red flags''      associated with financial exploitation, the bill would      require that, as a condition of receiving immunity, financial      institutions undertake to train certain personnel regarding      the identification and reporting of senior financial      exploitation as soon as practicable, or within one year.      Under the bill, employees who would be required to receive      such training as a condition of immunity include supervisory      personnel; employees who come into contact with a senior      citizen as a regular part of their duties; and employees who      review or approve the financial documents, records, or      transactions of senior citizens as a part of their regular      duties.       The benefits of the types of reporting that the Senior$afe      Act aims to facilitate and encourage are far-reaching.      Elderly Americans stand to benefit directly from such      reporting, because early detection and reporting can minimize      their financial losses from exploitation, and because      improved protection of their finances ultimately helps      preserve their financial independence and their personal      autonomy. Financial institutions stand to benefit, as well,      through preservation of their reputation, increased community      recognition, increased employee satisfaction, and decreased      uninsured losses.       In conclusion, state securities regulators congratulate you      for introducing the Senior$afe Act of 2015. We share and      support the goals of this legislation, and look forward to      working closely with you as the legislation is considered by      the Senate.           Sincerely,                                               Judith M. Shaw,                                                   NASAA President     and Maine Securities Administrator.                          ____________________
