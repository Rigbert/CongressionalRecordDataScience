President, I rise today to join the chorus of support for the Home Health Payment Fairness Act. The intent of this important legislation is two-fold--first, eliminate the impending 15 percent reduction in home health payments scheduled to take effect in October 2002, and second, restore a modicum of stability and predictability to the home health funding stream after years of volatility and turmoil. I was pleased to introduce similar language with Senator Collins last Congress; I am pleased to do so again.  Over the past several years, Congress has worked to address the unintended consequences of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, BBA. Specifically, we have sought to alleviate the tremendous financial burdens that have been borne by the home health industry and the patients who rely on these agencies for care. Since the enactment of the BBA, there has been a remarkable 48 percent decline in Medicare home health expenditures. Moreover, across the nation, home health agencies have been forced to cut back on services, and in some cases, close their doors forever. As a result, vulnerable and frail Medicare beneficiaries are being deprived of medically needed health services that enable these populations to receive care while remaining in the comfort of their homes and communities.  While we have been able to correct for a number of the problems, one issue we have yet to resolve affirmatively is the impending 15 percent for home health services. This reduction, which was originally scheduled to take effect in October 2000, has been delayed since 2002. While this delay is certainly significant, we can and must do more to restore predictability to the home health reimbursement system. We must see to it that the 15 percent cut is eliminated--and I hope we can achieve that goal this year.  As we have already seen, reductions of this magnitude are all too often shouldered by small, nonprofit home health agencies and the elderly and disabled beneficiaries they serve. Home health care agencies in my home state of Rhode Island have been especially hard hit by these changes. We have seen a significant decline in the number of beneficiaries served and access to care for more medically complex patients threatened by these cuts. These reductions have clearly had negative impact on patients who heavily rely on home health services.  Nationally, between 1997 and 1998, the number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health services has fallen 14 percent, while the total number of home health visits has fallen by 40 percent. We have seen a similar trend in Rhode Island, where over 3,000 fewer beneficiaries are receiving home health care--representing a decline of 16 percent--and the total number of visits has fallen 38 percent. These individuals are either being forced to turn to more expensive alternatives, such as institutional-based nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities for their care, or these individuals are simply going without care, which places an immeasurable burden on the family and friends of vulnerable beneficiaries.  I truly do not believe this is the path we want to remain on when it comes to home health care. In light of the impending ``senior boom'' that will be hitting our entitlement programs in a few short years, we should be doing all we can to preserve and strengthen the Medicare home health benefit. We can begin to do so by eliminating the 15 percent reduction in home health payments. By taking this step, we will alleviate an enormous burden that has been looming over financially strapped home health agencies as well as the frail and vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries who rely on these critical services.  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this critical legislation, and I look forward to working with Senator Collins and my other colleagues on the home health issue this Congress.                                 ______                                       By
