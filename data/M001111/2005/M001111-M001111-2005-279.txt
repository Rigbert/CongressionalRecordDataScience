 President, 2 weeks ago the Senate came together, not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans, to do what is right for our Nation's veterans. By a vote of 96-0, we all agreed to increase veterans funding by $1.5 billion. We agreed to fill the appalling shortfall the VA faces this year by agreeing to that amendment for $1.5 billion. It was a very clear message that we will be there for the people who have served our country. I was very proud of the Senate when we passed that amendment to do the right thing.  Shortly following that unanimous vote, the majority leader stood on the Senate floor and moved to have the Senate yield to the House of Representatives' lower figure of $975 million. That would have gone against what this Senate had just agreed to. That proposal by the majority leader also went against what the Senate Appropriations Committee had agreed to earlier that very same day. On a bipartisan and unanimous basis, the Senate Appropriations Committee members reaffirmed that the Senate should approve the full $1.5 billion in immediate funding for the VA. The Appropriations Committee and the full Senate unanimously agreed that America's veterans deserve the full $1.5 billion for this fiscal year. Then there was an attempt to accept a lower number.  We need to make sure in this Senate there is no backtracking and that veterans in this country who have served us honorably do not get shortchanged. To make it clear to our Nation's veterans and to the American public, I am here with my colleague Senator Akaka and others in the Senate, offering an amendment that clears up this confusion. It clearly says the Senate stands firmly behind our unanimous vote of $1.5 billion in emergency spending for veterans health care.  If we backtrack, if we walk away from the $1.5 billion we promised this year for our veterans, our men and women who have served this country honorably will be hurt. If we yield to the House's $975 million, the VA hiring freeze will remain in place. That means no new mental health specialists will be hired to help our veterans who are dealing with posttraumatic stress disorder.  If any of my colleagues went home as I did last week and talked to returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan, they will know as I do that these mental health specialists are absolutely needed for our men and women who are serving America today.  If we yield to the House's $975 million, the VA will not be able to build any of the new clinics our veterans have been promised. That means inconvenience and less access to care for the people who have sacrificed for our country. That is not what we promised our veterans. This is a critical priority.  We have a huge problem right now in this fiscal year 2005. Secretary Nicholson has made it very clear that the VA is at least $1 billion short this year. My colleagues know I have been here since the beginning of the year warning that this problem goes much deeper. Go out to any of your VA facilities and talk to any veterans who are trying to get access and Members will know as I do that veterans are waiting today 3 years for surgery.  The Associated Press reported in the papers today that the Army National Guard is having trouble recruiting the soldiers it needs.  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [From the Associated Press]              National Guard Misses Recruiting Goal Again       Washington (AP).--The Army National Guard, a cornerstone of      the U.S. force in Iraq, missed its recruiting goal for at      least the ninth straight month in June and is nearly 19,000      soldiers below its authorized strength, military officials      said Monday.       The Army Guard was seeking 5,032 new soldiers in June but      signed up only 4,337, a 14% shortfall, according to      statistics released Monday by the Pentagon. It is more than      10,000 soldiers behind its year-to-date goal of     almost 45,000 recruits, and has missed its recruiting target      during at least 17 of the last 18 months.       ``The recruiting environment remains difficult in terms of      economic conditions and alternatives,'' the Army said in a      statement released Monday. ``We are concerned about meeting      the fiscal year 2005 recruiting missions, but we are      confident that our recruiting initiatives will take hold and      the American public will respond.''       Jack Harrison, a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau,      said that despite the shortfall, the service is still able to      meet its commitments to the Pentagon as well as to state      governors, who call on the Guard during disasters and other      emergencies.       Some governors have complained about shortages of troops      and equipment in their Guard units, prompting the Guard to      set a goal of keeping half of each state's Guard forces at      home at any given time.       The Pentagon has already significantly reduced its use of      all Guard and reserve forces in the last two years. In April      2003, during the height of the Iraq invasion, some 224,000 of      them across all the services were mobilized for all federal      missions both at home and overseas; that figure now stands at      138,000, according to Pentagon statistics.       Harrison acknowledged the heavy use of the Guard in      missions in Iraq and Afghanistan has affected recruiting      efforts, but noted that the service is ahead of its goals in      retaining soldiers who have the option to get out.       ``We have folks that are coming back from long periods of      time in Iraq and Afghanistan who are reenlisting,'' he said.       Guard troops make up more than one-third of the soldiers in      Iraq, numbering six brigades plus a division headquarters. In      the next rotation of troops, to take place over the next two      years, the Guard's portion of the total force in Iraq is      expected to drop substantially as newly reorganized active-     duty Army units come online and take up more duties there,      officials said.       In total, the Army Guard has about 331,000 soldiers, 94.5%      of its authorized strength of 350,000, officials said.       Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Ellen Krenke said the Army      Guard last made its monthly goal in September 2004, when it      exceeded its target by 27 recruits. The last time it made its      goal before that was December 2003.       Harrison, however, said the Army Guard had not met its      monthly recruiting goal for 20 straight months, since October      2003. Officials could not immediately explain the      discrepancy. The Army Guard also missed its annual recruiting      goals for 2003 and 2004, Krenke said. The entire Army is      suffering from recruiting problems, but the other components      of the service--the active-duty force and the Reserve--made      their goals for June. Both, however, remain well behind their      annual goals, which they measure from October 2004 to      September 2005.       The regular Army has recruited 47,121 soldiers, or 86% of      its goal of 54,935 for this point in the year. It is trying      to reach 80,000 by the end of September. Officials are      becoming less hopeful they will make it, even though the      summer is considered the high season for recruiting, as      recent high school graduates look for jobs.       To deal with the problem, the Army has increased the number      of recruiters in its ranks, and augmented incentives for      those signing up.       ``We think these adjustments will begin to take hold in the      upcoming months,'' the Army statement said.       The Army Reserve has recruited 15,540 soldiers, or 79% of      its goal of 19,753 at this point in the year.       All three components of the Army are ahead on their efforts      to retain current soldiers. Officials credit that to a desire      on the part of the troops to finish the mission of making      Iraq a stable democracy.       The only other arm of the military that missed its June      recruiting goal was the Navy Reserve, which fell 8% short and      remains the same percentage behind its annual goal of 8,733      recruits. The active Navy, Air Force and Marines made their      monthly goals, and are at or ahead of their year-to-date      targets, the Pentagon said.       The Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve and Marine Corps      Reserve made their June goals; of those, the Air Force      Reserve and Marine Reserve are at or ahead of their year-to-     date goals. The Air National Guard is 17% behind its year-to-     date goal of 7,619 recruits.       The Air Force and Navy are seeing far less action in Iraq      and Afghanistan than their counterparts in the ground combat      forces of the Army and Marines, who have suffered most of the      casualties.
