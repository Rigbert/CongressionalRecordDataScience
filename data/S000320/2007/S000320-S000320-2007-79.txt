 President, today I honor Mr. Beasor Walker, who has lived a life of great service to our Nation and to my hometown of Tuscaloosa, AL.  Beasor was a celebrated soldier in the Second World War, where he fought in the June 6, 1944, Invasion of Normandy. Despite a wound to his side, Beasor stayed with his unit during the duration of the fight and was promoted to company commander. Wounded again, he returned to his unit a second time in order to fight against the Nazis in the December 1944 Battle of the Bulge. It was during this offensive that he earned the Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts. After 27 years of distinguished service to the U.S. Army, including time at Fort Jackson, where he trained replacement troops for the Korean War, Beasor retired as a colonel.  A graduate of the University of Alabama, Beasor was elected sheriff of Tuscaloosa County in 1970. He served as sheriff until 1991, and during his lengthy tenure he was able to greatly improve Tuscaloosa County. Beasor is responsible for integrating the Sheriff's Department, streamlining the homicide squads, and extensively working to improve the Alabama Boys' and Girls' Ranch. Beasor has been inducted to both the Alabama Military Hall of Honor and the Alabama Law Enforcement Hall of Fame.  His service to the Nation has been exceptional, and Beasor Walker is more than deserving of this recognition. His sacrifices are appreciated and important to the freedom we enjoy every day. I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking my friend Beasor Walker for his service to our Nation and to the State of Alabama.                          ____________________
