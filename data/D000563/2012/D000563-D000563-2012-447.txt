President, 2 weeks ago, we were given a cautionary lesson about the need to ensure that our Nation's banks are carefully regulated. We are still learning the details about the $2 billion bad bet made by banking giant JP Morgan Chase. But what we have learned is disturbing. Apparently, the London office of this Wall Street giant crafted a credit derivative trading strategy that spun out of control over the course of 6 weeks. At the center of the strategy was one single trader who was nicknamed ``the London whale.'' One trader, 6 weeks, $2 billion gone.  It is not clear how widely the repercussions of this trading loss will extend, but this incident clearly is an important reminder to all of us that we cannot afford to take a hands-off regulatory approach to the giant financial institutions on Wall Street.
