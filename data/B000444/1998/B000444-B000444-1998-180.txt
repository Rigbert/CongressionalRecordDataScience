 President, they are not talking about legitimate traders; they are talking about the mob's attempt to infiltrate Wall Street. It seems to me for us to carve out of the original legislation an exemption from RICO predicate statutes securities fraud is a serious mistake. But it would also be a serious mistake for me to push this issue without the votes at this point, because I realize there is an attempt to bring this legislation to a close.  I think it is bad legislation generally. I think it is a serious mistake to have done this, but I also have been here long enough, as I said, to be able to know where the votes are.  I withdraw the amendment.
