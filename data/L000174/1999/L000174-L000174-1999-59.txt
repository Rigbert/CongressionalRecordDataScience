President, asset forfeiture is a powerful crime-fighting tool. It has been a particularly potent weapon in the war on drugs, allowing the government to take the cars and boats and stash houses amassed by drug dealers and put them to honest use. Last year alone, the government was able to seize nearly half a billion dollars worth of assets, cutting a big chunk out of criminals' profit stream and returning it to the law-abiding community.  Unfortunately, our nation's asset forfeiture is not fail-safe; it can be abused. In hearings on this issue, the Judiciary Committee has heard examples of what happens when prosecutorial zeal skirts the boundaries of due process, leading to the taking of private property regardless of whether the owner is innocent of, or even cognizant of, the property's use in an illegal act.  In recent years, our nation's asset forfeiture system has drawn increasing and exceedingly sharp criticism from scholars and commentators. Federal judges have also added their voices to the growing chorus of concern. In 1992, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated, ``We continue to be enormously troubled by the government's increasing and virtually unchecked use of the civil forfeiture statutes and the disregard for due process that is buried in those statutes.'' Four years later, the Eighth Circuit rebuked the government for capitalizing on the claimants' confusion to forfeit over $70,000 of their currency, and expressed alarm that:       the war on drugs has brought us to the point where the      government may seize . . . a citizen's property without any      initial showing of cause, and put the onus on the citizen to      perfectly navigate the bureaucratic labyrinth in order to      liberate what is presumptively his or hers in the first      place. . . .     Should the citizen prove inept, the government may keep the      property, without ever having to justify or explain its      actions.  Similarly, the Seventh Circuit recently expressed its belief that ``the government's conduct in forfeiture cases leaves much to be desired,'' and ordered the return of over $500,000 in currency that had been improperly seized from a Chicago pizzeria.  Civil asset forfeiture rests upon the medieval notion that property is somehow guilty when it causes harm to another. The notion of ``guilty property'' is what enables the government to seize property regardless of the guilt or innocence of the property owner. In many asset forfeiture cases, the person whose property is taken is never charged with any crime.  The ``guilty property'' notion also explains the topsy-turvy nature of today's civil forfeiture proceedings, in which the property owner--not the government--bears the burden of proof. Under current law, all the government must do is make an initial showing of probable cause that the property is ``guilty'' and subject to forfeiture; it is then up to the property owner to prove a negative--that the property was not involved in any wrongdoing.  It is time to reexamine the obsolete underpinnings of our civil forfeiture laws and bring these laws in line with more modern principles of due process and fair play. We must be especially careful to ensure that innocent property owners are adequately protected.  The Hatch-Leahy Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act provides greater safeguards for individuals whose property has been seized by the government. It incorporates all of the core reforms of H.R. 1658, which passed the House of Representatives in June by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. The Hatch-Leahy bill also includes a number of additional reforms which, among other things, establish a fair and uniform procedure for forfeiting real property, and entitle property owners to challenge a forfeiture as constitutionally excessive.  During our hearing this year on civil asset forfeiture reform, the Justice Department and other law enforcement organizations expressed concern that some of the reforms included in the House bill would interfere with the government's ability to combat crime. The bill we introduce today addresses the legitimate concerns of law enforcement. In particular, the bill puts the burden of proof on the government by a preponderance of the evidence, and not by clear and convincing evidence. The preponderance standard is used in virtually all other civil cases, and we believe it is sufficient to protect the interests of property owners.  We have also removed provisions in H.R. 1658 that would allow criminals to leave their ill-gotten gains to their heirs, and would bar the government from forfeiting property if it inadvertently sent notice of a seizure to the wrong address. These provisions did little more than create procedural ``gotchas'' for criminals and their heirs, and are neither necessary nor desirable as a matter of policy.  The Hatch-Leahy bill also differs from the House bill in its approach to the issue of appointed counsel. Under H.R. 1658, anyone asserting an interest in seized property could apply for a court-appointed lawyer. There is no demonstrated need for such an unprecedented extension of the right to counsel, nor is there any principled distinction between defendants in civil forfeiture actions and defendants in other federal enforcement actions who are not eligible for court-appointed counsel. Moreover, property owners who are indigent may be eligible to obtain representation through various legal aid clinics.  The Hatch-Leahy bill authorizes courts to appoint counsel for indigent claimants in just two limited circumstances. First, a court may appoint counsel in the handful of forfeiture cases in which the property at issue is the claimant's primary residence. When a forfeiture action can result in a claimant's eviction and homelessness, there is more at stake than just a property interest, and it is fair and just that the claimant be provided with an attorney if she cannot otherwise afford one. Second, if a claimant is already represented by a court-appointed attorney in a related federal criminal case, the court may authorize that attorney to represent the claimant in the civil forfeiture action. This is both fair and efficient, and eliminates any appearance that the government chose to pursue the forfeiture in a civil proceeding rather than as part of the criminal case in order to deprive the claimant of his right to counsel.  For claimants who were not appointed counsel by the court, the Hatch-Leahy bill allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney fees and costs if they substantially prevail in court. The bill also makes the government liable for post-judgment interest on any money judgment, and imputed interest in certain cases involving currency or negotiable instruments.  Another core reform of the Hatch-Leahy bill is the elimination of the so-called ``cost bond.'' Under current law, a property owner that seeks to recover his property after it has been seized by the government must pay for privilege by posting a bond with the court. The government has strongly defended the ``cost bond,'' not as a device for ensuring that its court costs are covered, but as a way of deterring frivolous claims. Of course, we are all in favor of deterring frivolous claims, but there are ways to deter frivolous claims without offending the fundamental principle of equal and open access to the courts, a bedrock of our American system of justice. The Hatch-Leahy bill provides that a person who challenges a forfeiture must file his claim on oath, under penalty of perjury. Claimants also remain subject to the general sanctions for bad faith in instituting or conducting litigation. Further, most claimants will continue to bear the substantial costs of litigating their claims in court. The additional financial burden of the ``cost bond'' serves no legitimate purpose.  Under current law, a property owner has only 20 days from the date of first publication of the notice of seizure to file a claim challenging an administrative forfeiture, and only 10 days to file a claim challenging a judicial forfeiture. It is therefore unlikely that anyone who misses the first of three published notices will be able to file a timely claim. The Hatch-Leahy bill extends the property owner's time to file a claim following administrative and judicial forfeiture actions to 30 days. The bill also codifies current Department of Justice policy with respect to the time period for sending notice of seizure, and establishes a 90-day period for filing a complaint. The bill leaves undisturbed current laws and procedures with respect to the proper form and content of notices, claims and complaints.  Finally, the Hatch-Leahy bill will allow property owners to hold on to their property while a case in process, if they can show that continued possession of the government will cause substantial hardship to the owner, such as preventing him from working, and that this hardship outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed or concealed if returned to the owner during the pendency of the case. Unlike H.R. 1658, the Hatch-Leahy bill adopts the primary safeguards that the Justice Department wanted added to the provision--that property owners must have sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will not disappear and that certain property, such as currency and property particularly suited for use in illegal activities, cannot be returned. As amended, the hardship provision in the Hatch-Leahy bill is substantially similar to the hardship provision in another civil asset forfeiture bill, S. 1701, which the Justice Department has endorsed.  The fact is, the Justice Department has endorsed most of the core reforms contained in the Hatch-Leahy bill. Indeed, the Department has already taken administrative steps to remedy many of the civil forfeiture abuses identified in recent years by the federal courts. For this, the Department is to be commended. But administrative policy can be modified on the whim of whoever is in charge, and the law remains susceptible to abuse.  It is time for Congress to catch up with the Justice Department and the courts on this important issue. Due to internecine fighting among law enforcement officials whose views Congress always wants to take into consideration, action on civil forfeiture reform has been delayed for far too long. The Hatch-Leahy bill strikes the appropriate middle ground between theHouse bill and S. 1701, providing comprehensive and meaningful reform while ensuring the continued potency of civil asset forfeiture in the war on crime.  Senator Hatch and I share a longstanding and deeply-held appreciation for law enforcement and the officers who work on the front lines to protect our families and communities, and we have worked together on a number of crime-related issues in the past. I want to commend him for his commitment, not just to law enforcement, but to the rights of all Americans. It has been my pleasure to work with him on this issue, to bring balance back in the relationship between our police forces and the citizens of this country.                                 ______                                       By
