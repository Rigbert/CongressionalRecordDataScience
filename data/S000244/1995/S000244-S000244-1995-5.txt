Speaker, I rise in support for H.R. 1506, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995. This bill gives recording artists and their recording companies copyright protection over the transmission of digital sound recordings. Under current law, songwriters, but not recording artists or companies, receive royalties when their music is played on radio or television.  Artists and companies receive much of their compensation through the sale of compact discs, records, and tapes that are often promoted on radio and television. However, new interactive services are being created which allow consumers to use their TV's and computers to order any recording at any time. These subscriber services threaten sales of CD's, records and tapes. With this legislation recording artists will have a performance right in digital transmissions which will afford them the opportunity to receive compensation when their performances are transmitted digitally. Presently, under American copyright law, owners of almost every kind of copyrighted work have exclusive rights to authorize the public performance of that work. It is time to provide recording artists and companies some copyright protection.  H.R. 1506 is equally important for what it doesn't do. This bill does not require businesses, such as bars and restaurants to pay an additional performance royalty when they play music. Such businesses should be allowed the play ``incidental'' or background music without having to pay fees to music performers. Background music is not now and will never be a substitute for consumer purchases of prerecorded music.  I congratulate Chairman Moorhead and all the parties who contributed to the negotiations on this issue and made this compromise legislation possible. H.R. 1506 brings copyright law up-to-date to accommodate the new digital technologies in today's marketplace. I strongly urge its passage.
