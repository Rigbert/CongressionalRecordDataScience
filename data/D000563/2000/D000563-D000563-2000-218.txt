I thanked him before leaving. I don't want him to take this paper with him for this dinner hour, but I will stand by the comments of the Joint Committee on Taxation. This is not a political group, not a partisan group. It is a group authorized by Congress to make these evaluations. The Senator from Oklahoma is entitled to his opinion. I am going to stick with the facts given to me by an organization we rely on all the time.  If I can finish the presentation, though, you note when we get to the highest income categories, the Democratic bill does not provide relief under the so-called marriage penalty tax relief, and the Republican plan does, about $1,000 of tax relief for people making $250,000 a year.  The important thing to keep in mind, too, in putting this in perspective, is not too many years ago we were laboring with a national deficit and worries about how we were going to pay it off and balance our books. Some suggested we needed a constitutional amendment, a dramatic revision in the budgetary policy here in Congress.  There are many of us who believe there is another way to do it, with sound fiscal policy and leadership, not only in the White House but also in Congress. With the leadership of President Clinton and Vice President Gore, we now find ourselves talking about spending surpluses.  I would like to speak for a moment about the tax bills we have considered over the last 2 weeks, but before I do that, I would like to yield to my colleague from the State of Nevada.
