 This legislation was first introduced in the 104th Congress by former Senator Frank Lautenberg and I am pleased to be here today continuing his legacy.  The Captive Exotic Animal Protection Act would make it illegal to knowingly transfer, transport, or possess in interstate commerce of foreign commerce, a confined exotic mammal for the purposes of allowing the killing or injuring of that animal for entertainment or for the collection of a trophy. The bill protects exotic mammals that have been held in captivity for the shorter of a. the greater part of the animal's life, or b. a period of one year, whether or not the defendant knew the length of the captivity. This bill is intended to prevent the cruel and unsporting practice of what we have come to know as ``canned hunts.''  Words cannot describe a ``canned'' hunt. The images that I have seen,footage taken surreptitiously at these ranches, provides evidence that the treatment of these animals is troubling. Today, at more than 1,000 commercial canned hunt operations across the country, trophy hunters pay a fee to shoot captive exotic animals, from African lions to giraffes, blackbuck antelope, assorted African goats and sheep, a Corsican ram, or a boar, in fenced-in enclosures. The hunting of these animals typically occurs in a fenced enclosure and is often in a ``guaranteed kill'' arrangement meaning that a hunter by virtue of the fact that he has paid his fee is assured of a kill.  Now hunting is a sport and if you ask any of the hunters in my home State of Delaware or elsewhere about this they will tell you that there is an ethic of hunting that involves consideration of fair chase, affording the animal the opportunity to evade or elude the hunter. Canned hunts, in fenced-in enclosures, weigh the odds so heavily in favor of the hunters that it essentially eliminates the fair chase component. In addition, these animals on hunting ranches are often fed by hand, in a sense domesticated, and have little or no fear of humans. They don't run when they see a human being in front of them. This practice is unfair and unsportsmanlike.  But it is not just about the fact that this practice is inhumane, there are also other concerns. Clustered in a captive setting at unusually high densities, confined exotic animals often attract disease more readily than more widely dispersed native species who roam freely. These exotics then interact with native species through fences, jeopardizing the health of deer, elk, and other native species. Animal disease places hunting programs and wildlife watching programs, that generate millions of dollars in economic activity, at risk.  While a number of States have taken action to prohibit the practice of canned hunts, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming have passed such statutes, that is only a small segment of the country. Unfortunately, the regulation of the transport and treatment of exotic animals on shooting preserves falls outside the traditional domains of State agriculture departments and State fish and games agencies. The Captive Exotic Animal Protection Act is specifically designed to address this problem, which directly involves an issue of interstate commerce.  This is sensible legislation that is backed by responsible hunters, animal protection advocates, wildlife scientists, environmentalists and zoological professionals. The Boone and Crockett Club and the Izaak Walton League of America, nationally recognized hunting clubs, have policy positions affirmatively opposing canned hunts. In addition, this legislation is supported by the Humane Society of the United States, the Doris Day Animal League, the Fund for Animals, and the Animal Protection Institute.  I want to say to my colleagues who may have questions about this legislation that the Captive Exotic Animal Protection Act is limited in its scope and purpose and will not limit the licensed hunting of any native mammals or any native or exotic birds. The bill is directed at true ``canned'' hunts and covers only exotic mammals, or those not historically indigenous to the United States. Birds, native or non-native, and indigenous mammals, such as white tail deer and bears, are not covered by the bill. This legislation is a federal remedy and proposed specifically to deal with the purely commercial interstate movement of exotic animals destined to be killed at canned hunting ranches.  I hope you will join me in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
