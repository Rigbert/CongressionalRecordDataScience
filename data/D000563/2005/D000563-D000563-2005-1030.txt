President, I report to my colleagues that my amendment has been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American Dietetic Association, the American Osteopathic Association, Consumers Union, Center for Science in the Public Interest, the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, as well as two individuals, Michelle Skinlo of Mattoon, IL, mother of 31-year-old Hillary Spitz, who had a seizure in 2000 and continues to suffer long-term debilitation because of ephedra, and Kevin Riggins of Lincoln, IL, father of 16-year-old Sean Riggins, a high school football player who died after taking ephedra. The tragedy of these families does not need to be replicated, certainly on the military bases, across America.  I urge my colleagues support my amendment.  Pursuant to my earlier request, I ask the amendment be set aside and we return to the regular business.
