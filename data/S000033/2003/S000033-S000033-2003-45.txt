 Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I do understand,the gentleman is quite right. This is not the cleanest way to address the issue. I would have preferred to do it yesterday; but as the gentleman knows, because of an agreement that was reached, a number of Republicans and those of us on this side were unable to offer the amendments that we wanted to offer.  I think there may be a few other speakers who would like to speak to this issue, and I thank the chairman very much for his support.
