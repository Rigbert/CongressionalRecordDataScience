Speaker, I attempted to offer three of the thirty-one amendments to H.R. 5, the HEALTH Act, last night. Inexplicably, these were disallowed out of hand.  This rule is an abuse of the process. Yes, it might be payback to the Democrats based on some revisionist history, but more importantly, it's a payoff to the Republicans' generous benefactors in the insurance industry, and through this bill, a payoff to the pharmaceutical industry.  The Republicans claim that the underlying bill, H.R. 5, will control insurance costs through so-called ``tort reform.'' This bill won't do that. In fact, in 1999, a senior executive at the American Tort Reform Association conceded that ``We wouldn't tell you or anyone that the reason to pass tort reform would be to reduce insurance rates.''  This is the third crisis in medical malpractice in 25 years. Each of these ``crises'' happens to coincide with recessions, stock market downturns, and insurance industry investment losses.  The insurance industry is an equal opportunity market abuser. They legally can and regularly do collude to raise rates and limit availability of all lines of insurance. If this ``crisis'' in medical malpractice insurance is due to a malpractice crisis then why also is there a crisis in health insurance, homeowners' insurance, auto insurance, and general liability insurance? Health insurance costs are up 13 percent, homeowners insurance, 8 percent, and auto insurance, 8.5 percent. Maybe it's time the insurance industry was subject to the same laws as other industries.  Mr. Speaker, the solution that will bring relief and improve access to our nation's physicians will start with a repeal of the antitrust exemption of the insurance industry. Legislation like H.R. 5 simply allows the insurance industry to profit off the backs of both doctors and patients.
