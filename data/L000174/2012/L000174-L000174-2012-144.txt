President, next month, a distinguished member of our Armed Forces will retire. I want to recognize and congratulate GEN Craig McKinley, who has spent the last 38 years in service to our country, and who has led the National Guard through a unique period of challenge, change, and triumph.  General McKinley's service began during another period of dramatic change. He received his commission as a distinguished graduate of the ROTC program at Southern Methodist University and entered undergraduate pilot training at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia in 1974. With the conclusion of military engagement in Vietnam, the nation's military leaders faced a number of questions, including the future role of the National Guard. These same questions would later guide General McKinley's efforts to lead the National Guard toward its current role as an operational force.  General McKinley has had a distinguished career, including assignments as an instructor pilot, the commander of the 125th Fighter Wing, the commander of the 1st Air Force, and the commander of the Continental United States Region of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. He served in the U.S. European Command and as Director of the Air National Guard. These assignments culminated in General McKinley earning his fourth star as Chief of the National Guard Bureau. He did all of this while logging over 4,000 flying hours in a wide range of aircraft and earning the rating of command pilot.  While I could reflect on many notable moments in General McKinley's career, I will never forget one in particular. It was November 10, 2011, when Senator Levin and Senator McCain convened an historic hearing of all six sitting Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Department of Defense General Counsel, and General McKinley, to examine a proposal I had introduced to add the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Despite the arguments against this change by all six sitting Joint Chiefs, General McKinley's measured and reasonable responses won the day. Ultimately, 71 senators came to agree with General McKinley and joined as cosponsors of what is known commonly as the second National Guard Empowerment Act. This bill became law in December 2011, and General McKinley was a decisive factor in this victory for the National Guard. Without his resolve to see the almost half a million men and women of the Guard represented at the top military panel in the national command structure, we would not have triumphed.  General McKinley has offered steady leadership to the Guard during a truly historic period. I am grateful to have had him as a partner. Without him, I doubt our nation would have the world-class operational reserve that we have today.  Congratulations, General McKinley. Best wishes to you, Cheryl, Patrick, and Christina as you retire to civilian life.                          ____________________
