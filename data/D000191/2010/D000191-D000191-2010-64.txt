  Mr. DeFAZIO. To hear our Republican colleagues, you'd think they have an idea or a plan on how to put people back to work.  Remember, it was the failed deregulatory policies of the Bush administration and of the Republican majority that ultimately led to the collapse of Wall Street, to the emptying out of people's savings accounts and to the destroying of businesses across America. It was also their failed free trade policies that exported 3 million manufacturing jobs during the Bush-Republican era.  But, yeah, they always say tax cuts will cure everything. I would say that the worst part of the stimulus bill they are criticizing--and I voted against that bill--was the $340 billion in tax cuts insisted upon by three Republican Senators. How many jobs have they produced?  What did you do with your tax cuts? last week I asked my constituents.  They said, I didn't get a tax cut.  I said, Oh, yeah, you did. You got $8 less withholding.  They said, Well, that's not going to do anything. That's not going to put my neighbor back to work. That's not going to create any jobs.  Their nostrum is more tax cuts, more deficits, more debt, more deregulation, more failed free trade. We need a new direction. Yes, this administration hasn't done everything I've wanted, but it's a heck of a lot better than the disasters they've visited upon us.                          ____________________
