 I look forward to continuing to work with you, the Forest Service, Plum Creek, and other interested parties as the legislation is developed.                        THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations for their hard work. As they both know, last year I sponsored the authorizing legislation for the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. This new law directs the National Park Service to review hundreds of Underground Railroad sites in Ohio and around the country, identify the most notable locations, and produce and disseminate appropriate educational materials. I believe the history of the Underground Railroad is a part of the American story that we should be proud of. Last year, the Chairman and Ranking Member worked with me to fully fund the program in Fiscal Year 1999. I made a similar request this year. I would like to ask for clarification of some language contained in the Committee Report. Specifically, the Committee provided $1,245,891,000 to the National Park Service for park management. Is it the Chairman's intent that this figure includes $500,000 for the implementation of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom?
