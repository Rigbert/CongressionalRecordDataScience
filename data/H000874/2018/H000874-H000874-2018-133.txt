Speaker, the gentleman has not answered either one of my questions, A, whether there was a single red cent available in the Defense Department for rescission, because that money has been laying there 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years. Is there a single red cent there? B, he did not answer the question whether or not this rescission will adversely impact the discretionary baseline for the 2019 budget.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. Did the gentleman yield to me? On what point?
