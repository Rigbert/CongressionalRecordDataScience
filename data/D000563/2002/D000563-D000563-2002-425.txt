I never know it. Those 120,000 people, who thought they had done the right thing and performed their civic duty, went home proudly after voting in Cook County, and 300,000 who voted across America went home and said to their kids: This is what you have to do, you have to vote. Their ballots were tossed because they were punchcard voters who got caught in hanging chads and a system that was over 40 years old.  Are we really serious about giving people their constitutionally protected, incontrovertible right to vote, or is this going to be a haphazard system? I hope not.
