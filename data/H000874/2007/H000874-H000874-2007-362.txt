But we want to move the Energy and Water bill. It will not move out of this House. All of the earmarks that would be attached to that bill will be attached to another bill, will be listed, will have the author and the assertations and they will be subject to a vote on the House floor as any other.  So prospectively all 10 bills moving forward will have it. It is just that the Energy and Water will be not done together; they will be done separately.
