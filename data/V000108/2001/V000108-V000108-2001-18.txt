Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the next gentleman, I would want to agree with the points that the previous speaker, my good friend the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Wicker), made and particularly the point that this was not just a failure of the current administration, whatever the circumstances, as far as timing, or the Clinton administration, and would reiterate in my opening remarks I mentioned in constant dollars since 1967 we have seen the Corps budget drop from $7 billion to $4.48 billion, so that clearly is a generational failure by administrations and Congresses of both parties.  It is time we all collectively come together to come to grips with this and make a solid investment in the United States of America. So I appreciate the gentleman's comments.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).
