Speaker, I want to join my friend from Virginia (Mr. Davis) and say we see a lot of partisanship, but one of the positive things for me in this Congress is working with the Washington metropolitan delegation which is very bipartisan. It is almost half and half in terms of its makeup, and we work very well together. This was a great success for our region and for our country. I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) and certainly the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) and our four Senators who worked so hard on reaching this objective. I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) for yielding to me.
