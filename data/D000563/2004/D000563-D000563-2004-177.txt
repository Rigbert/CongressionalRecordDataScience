President, first, I salute my colleague and friend from Hawaii. I am honored to be a cosponsor of his bill. Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye are two of our very best Members in the U.S. Senate. It is rare, if ever, that they ask their colleagues for a helping hand. In this situation, Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye have shown extraordinary leadership to make recognition of a situation in their home State that deserves our help. I am more than happy to join the Senator.  I am disappointed, as Senator Akaka is, that we are not going to have a chance, apparently, to vote on this amendment. As I understand it now, Senator Frist has come to the floor of the Senate and has used a procedural device called ``filling the tree,'' which means he has filed so many amendments that no one else can file an amendment. So we are just stopped.  The underlying bill, the class action bill, is an important and controversial bill, and now Senator Frist has stopped any amendments to it. Among those that have been precluded is the amendment by the Senator from Hawaii, which has bipartisan support, a good amendment, and I hope we can get to it and get to it soon.  I see our Democratic leader in the Chamber, Senator Daschle. I know he has spoken to this issue many times. I would like to address the class action bill, but I will at this point yield to the minority leader and then ask to be recognized after he has spoken.
