 President, I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues who have risen today to talk about the remarkable service given this body, and our nation, by Admiral James W. Nance, majority staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee.  Although I am no longer on the Committee, I had the honor and pleasure of serving as a member of that Committee in the 105th Congress, and to come to know and admire ``The Admiral.''  In many ways, Admiral Nance was the living embodiment of what Tom Brokaw, in his recent book, has called ``The Greatest Generation.'' He had a distinguished career in the Navy, serving in combat in World War II, as a test pilot, and later as commander of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal.  Following his Naval career, he served as deputy assistant to the President for National Security Affairs in the Reagan administration, and then joined his boyhood friend, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, in offering his service, and his expertise, to the U.S. Senate as staff director for the Foreign Relations Committee.  His kindness to me--as a junior member of the minority party--in getting to know the ins and outs of the Committee was always appreciated, and his sage council and advice were always a welcome addition to the Committee's consideration of a range of pressing national security issues.  The Admiral will be sorely missed--but I join my colleagues in celebrating his life of service to the United States.
