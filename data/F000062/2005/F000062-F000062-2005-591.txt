 And I understand that the Banking Committee has an interest in regulating credit cards.  I would like to state here, for the record, the key points of the agreement that we have arrived at:  Senators Shelby and Sarbanes have agreed to hold a hearing within 6 months on the substance of the amendment to the Bankruptcy Bill that Senator Kyl, Brownback, and I offered, on increasing notice to credit card holders who pay only their minimum monthly payments. I understand that this hearing will address a set of issues relating to credit cards and consumer rights. However, I also understand that Senators Shelby and Sarbanes will ensure that the substance of agreement, will be directly considered, and will be an area of focus, during that hearing, and that I will be afforded the opportunity to testify.  I understand that Senators Shelby and Sarbanes will work with me, with Senator Kyl, and with members of the Banking Committee to ensure that this issue and my bill are carefully considered. My bill would give those consumers who make only the minimum required payments for 6 months detailed notice about the interest and length of time that it will take them to pay their own individual debt and interest.  Because the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee agree to take these actions, I will agree to withdraw my amendment. Do Senators Shelby and Sarbanes agree?
