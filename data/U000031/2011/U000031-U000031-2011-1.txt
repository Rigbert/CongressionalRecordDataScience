Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  This bill does a lot of things. It has real reforms. It's driven in large part by the unemployment reforms and extending the payroll tax cut, and it's all paid for.  Most Americans don't really want unemployment. They want a job. The spectrum provisions in this bill help our first responders with the allocation of the D block and creates perhaps as many as 100,000 jobs. The Keystone pipeline decision is part of this bill, too. It requires the President to review and make a decision, either way, within 60 days of enactment.  Just this morning, there were a number of press accounts that perhaps Iran will soon be conducting exercises to close the Straits of Hormuz. The Keystone pipeline will connect Canadian oil sands with refineries here in the United States, adding 20,000 private sector jobs and perhaps as many as 118,000 indirect jobs. It reduces our reliance on non-North American oil, which is a good thing. And it brings perhaps as many as 1 million barrels of oil a day--1 million barrels a day--into the United States that we don't have to import from someplace else. Canada is going to develop this no matter what. And that oil, 1 million barrels a day, is either going to come to the United States or it's going to a place like China. We want it here.  This is a good thing. It creates jobs. It reduces our reliance on oil from overseas. It is something that ought to be part of this bill, and it is. I would urge my colleagues to support it.  I reserve the balance of my time.
