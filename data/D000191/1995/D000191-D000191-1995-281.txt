  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House of Representatives concluded a long and heated debate on the exclusionary rule. It was not on the evening news. I mean who knows or cares about obscure legal arguments? There was more important news: The OJ trial, 10 minutes on the pitiful howls of the dog, the baseball strike. Well, after all, the actions taken here on the floor only shredded the fourth amendment to the Constitution:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.  America, bar your doors, they do not need warrants anymore.                          ____________________
