 President, I would like to speak in support of the effort by my senior colleague to relieve the burdensome situation within the Federal judiciary in Kentucky. I commend him for his leadership on this issue.  We have two districts in Kentucky's Federal court. And we have one judge who splits her time between the eastern and western districts. In order to fulfill her responsibilities, she often logs hundreds of miles each week. She has two principle offices and must attend administrative meetings for both districts. This is an inefficient use of her time and represents valuable time away from managing her caseload. And, this situation is no reflection on the current judge who occupies this position. These are the identical circumstances that existed with the prior occupant of this position.  I realize it may not be feasible to create a single additional Federal judge at this particular time. I am aware of the complicated balancing act that must occur any time the number of Federal judges is evaluated.  Nevertheless, I join with my senior colleague in drawing the Senate's attention to our particular circumstances in Kentucky. When the Senate Judiciary Committee considers additional Federal judges, I hope the members of the committee look at the swing judge in Kentucky. And, I urge the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to examine this unique situation.  I thank Senator Ford for his leadership on this issue.
