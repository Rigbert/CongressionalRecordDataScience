Lyme Congregational United Church of Christ in Bellevue, Ohio, celebrates its 190th anniversary in July 2007. A series of events through the month of July commemorate this historic occasion.  On July 15 and July 17 of 1817, a total of 10 people were examined to form the charter membership of the First Presbyterian Church of Wheatsborough. According to church documents, traveling minister Reverend John Seward charged the members to ``walk worthy of their high calling.'' Throughout the year, Reverend Alvin Coe, a Presbyterian missionary to the American Indians, occasionally preached to the largely Congregationalist membership. In March 1820, Lot B. Sullivan came to Lyme looking for employment and was soon ordained and installed as the congregation's first minister. This ordination was the very first performed west of the Cuyahoga River, and ministers came from 100 miles around to participate in the ``laying on of hands.'' Church records note that early salaries were $400 per year, two-thirds of which was in the form of produce for the minister and his family.  In 1828, the community of Lyme built a new schoolhouse. For the next 7 years, the church held its services in that school building. In 1835 the congregation built its own church building, which was dedicated in 1836. The building is the only church the congregationhas known and has been in continuous use for 171 years. Hand-hewn and built to stand the test of time, the church remains a beautifully simplistic structure.  Formally incorporated as a Congregational Church in 1873, Lyme Congregational U.C.C. calls itself ``A Family Church Where All Are Welcome'' and this motto rings as true today as at the church's founding. Families have grown and maintained the church through many markers of history: It was founded less than 10 years after the first settlers arrived in the Firelands of Northwest Ohio and only 2 years after the first people came to Bellevue. It was standing for 6 years already when the Erie Canal opened, and 16 years when Oberlin College--the first in the U.S. to admit women and African Americans--was established. The church continued in witness to history as our Nation passed through the Civil War, the joining of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1886, the Wright Brothers' Kitty Hawk flight in 1903, the introduction of the Model T Ford, World War I, the Suffrage of Women in 1919, World War II, the Korean War, the dawn of the space program, the first moon walk in 1969, the Vietnam War and the tragic shootings at Kent State University nearby, the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York in 2001, two Gulf Wars and United Nations missions, from telegraph to telephone to cellular phones, from the writing of letters to radio to television to computers and digital cameras. Through all of these incredible changes in one continuous thread of history, 36 ministers have led this flock. The members celebrate their history and have carefully preserved artifacts and documents from the church's founding nearly two centuries ago.  In the Book of Psalms in the Holy Bible Psalm 100 tells Christians, ``Make a joyful noise unto the Lord all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness: come before His presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is He that has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of His pasture. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise: be thankful unto Him and bless His name. For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting and His truth endures to all generations.'' Few congregations can attest to the message in this Scripture as well as that of Lyme Congregational United Church of Christ. I am very pleased to acknowledge this anniversary celebration and join in a remembrance of the past, reflection of the present, and hope for the future.                          ____________________
