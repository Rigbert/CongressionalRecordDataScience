 Bond, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Roberts) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:                            S. Con. Res. 74       Whereas the European Union has banned imports of United      States beef treated with hormones since 1989;       Whereas 9 out of 10 United States cattle are treated with      growth promoting hormones;       Whereas growth promoting hormones have been deemed safe by      all countries that have reviewed the use of such hormones,      including reviews by European Union scientists in 2 separate      studies;       Whereas since the implementation of the European Union ban,      United States cattle producers have lost hundreds of millions      of dollars in exports;       Whereas the United States beef industry loses approximately      $250,000,000 in annual sales due to the ban;       Whereas the United States beef industry, the United States      Department of Agriculture, and the United States Trade      Representative have invested substantial resources to comply      with strict dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade      Organization;       Whereas the Dispute Settlement panel and the Appellate Body      of the World Trade Organization have ruled that the European      Union's ban of United States beef is not based on sound      science or supported by a risk assessment and is therefore in      violation of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the      Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; and       Whereas noncompliance by the European Union regarding the      ban on United States beef threatens the integrity of both the      Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary      Measures and the World Trade Organization as a dispute      settlement body: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--       (1) the United States expects the European Union to      immediately and completely comply with the World Trade      Organization's ruling and grant United States beef producers      access to the European market; and       (2) the United States Trade Representative should take      immediate action to open European markets to United States      beef producers in the event the European Union fails to      comply with the World Trade Organization's ruling.
