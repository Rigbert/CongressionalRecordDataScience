 President, before the Senator from South Carolina leaves the floor, I know this is his first major policy address. I think he has addressed the Senate before on another subject, but this is his first address.  I would just like to say to the junior Senator from South Carolina that I have already learned that there is no one in this body, whether they have been here a while or just gotten here, who knows any more about the Social Security subject than the Senator from South Carolina.  Mr. President, we need that expertise. This is an extraordinarily important debate. I thank him for his support and contribution.  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator.
