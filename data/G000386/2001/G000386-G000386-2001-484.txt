 President, I rise today to introduce important tax legislation for myself and Senators Jeffords, Leahy, Murkowski, Breaux, Smith of Oregon, Dorgan, Feinstein, Craig, Murray, Johnson, Schumer, and Conrad.  This legislation, entitled the ``Bipartisan Renewable Efficient Energy with Zero Effluent, (BREEZE) Act'', extends the production tax credit for energy generated by wind for five years. The current tax credit is set to expire on January 1, 2002.  As author of the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1993, I sought to give this alternative energy source the ability to compete against traditional, finite energy sources. I strongly believe that the expansion and development of wind energy must be facilitated by this production tax credit.  Wind, unlike most energy sources, is an efficient and environmentally safe form of energy production. Wind energy makes valuable contributions to maintaining cleaner air and a cleaner environment. Every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy produced in the United States can reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 33 million metric tons by replacing the combustion of fossil fuels.  Since the inception of the wind energy production tax credit in 1993, more than 1,128 megawatts of generating capacity have been put online. This generating capacity powers nearly 300,000 homes, or 750,000 people.  Over 900 megawatts of new wind energy capacity was added just last year, bringing wind energy generating capacity in the U.S. to more than 2,500 megawatts. This new wind energy will power the equivalent of over 240,000 American homes, while displacing over 1.8 million tons of carbon dioxide.  Equally important, wind energy increases our energy independence, thereby providing the United States with insulation from an oil supply dominated by the Middle East. Our national security is currently threatened by a heavy reliance on oil from abroad.  The price of wind energy has been reduced more than 80 percent in the past two decades, making it the most affordable type of renewable energy. In order to continue this investment in America's energy future, we must extend the production tax credit.  Currently, my own State of Iowa has 4 new wind power projects ready to go online just this year. These 4 projects, with the megawatt capacity of over 240, will join the already existing 20 facilities in Iowa. Even large petroleum producing States like Texas are recognizing the growing potential of wind energy. Texas has the third largest wind farm in the world, and plans to add 5 new facilities this year, adding to the 7 already online.  Moreover, wind energy has vast potential to contribute to California's electricity supply. As we all know, California is currently suffering because of an energy market with insufficient energy generation and production that is overly dependent on natural gas.  Just in the past few weeks, plans have been unveiled to develop what will be the world's two largest wind power plants in the Northwest. One will be installed on the Oregon-Washington boundary and the other at the U.S. Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site. Together, the two plants will have a capacity of 560 megawatts and will generate enough power annually to serve more than half a million people. In addition, a number of other new projects coming online this year in the West will also bring much-needed additional generating capacity to the region.  Wind energy also produces substantial economic benefits. For each wind turbine, a farmer or rancher can receive more than $2,000 per year for 20 years in direct lease payments. Iowa's major wind farms already pay more than $640,000 per year to landowners. In California, the development of 1,000 megawatts would mean annual payments of approximately $2 million to farm and forest landowners.  Extending the wind energy tax credit would allow for even greater expansion in the wind energy field. Wind is a domestically produced natural resource, found abundantly across the country. Because wind energy is homegrown, it cannot be controlled by any foreign power.  Wind energy can be harnessed without injury to our environment. Wind is a reliable form of power that is renewable and inextinguishable. This legislation ensures that wind energy does not fall by the wayside as a productive alternative energy source.  The Senate needs to extend this important legislation and I encourage my colleagues to join us in this effort.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 530       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Bipartisan Renewable,      Efficient Energy with Zero Effluent (BREEZE) Act''.     SEC. 2. 5-YEAR EXTENSION OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCING ELECTRICITY                    FROM WIND.       Section 45(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986      (relating to wind facility) is amended by striking ``January      1, 2002'' and inserting ``January 1, 2007''.                                 ______                                       By
