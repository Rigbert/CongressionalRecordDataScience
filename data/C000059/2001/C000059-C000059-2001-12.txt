Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for protecting 348 Federal dams, 58 hydroelectric power plants, and over 8 million acres of Federal property that contain 300 recreation areas hosting over 90 million visitors each year. Yet, they do not have the authority to contract with any entity to ensure that Federal law is enforced at these facilities.  While Reclamation can contact State and local law enforcement agencies to enforce State and local laws, these entities cannot enforce Federal laws within a Reclamation project or on Reclamation-administered lands.  There continue to be incidents reported by Reclamation field offices regarding criminal acts on these lands and facilities that threaten public safety and property. This bill will vest the Bureau of Reclamation with the authority to contract with other Federal, State, tribal, or local law enforcement entities to provide services at Bureau of Reclamation facilities.  This legislation does not create a new law enforcement agency within the Bureau; it does allow Reclamation to contract with existing agencies, and reimburses them for law enforcement services.  These measures, especially in times such as we are in today, are not only prudent, they are essential. The administration has placed high priority on correcting this situation, and I urge Members to take action, and to do so by supporting this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
