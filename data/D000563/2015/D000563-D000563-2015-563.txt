President, I rise to honor the 150th anniversary for Lincoln College in Lincoln, IL. One hundred fifty years ago tomorrow, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter establishing the new college, originally known as Lincoln University. Just 6 days later, on President Abraham Lincoln's 56th birthday, ground was broken for University Hall, a building still in use today. Lincoln University was the first institution to be named for Abraham Lincoln and the only during his lifetime. The first commencement in 1868 included a total of three students--two men and one woman. Lincoln College has come a long way.  This year, Lincoln College enrolled about 640 students, and 90 percent of those who graduate will continue their education at a 4-year university. Lincoln College now has campuses in Lincoln and Normal, IL, with a tradition of personal education. By providing a low faculty to student ratio, Lincoln College offers individualized attention that makes the difference between failure and success for many students. The school provides a springboard for students who go on to continue their education and helps students find good paying jobs.  Lincoln College offers more than just great student services and academic programs that are second to none. Lincoln College fields a number of varsity sports teams that have won national championships, hosts a speaker series, and maintains Civil War era artifacts at the Lincoln Heritage Museum.  I thank President John Blackburn for his leadership at Lincoln College and congratulate the institution on 150 years of providing Illinois students with a quality affordable education.  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
