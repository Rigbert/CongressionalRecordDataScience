Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I want to congratulate the chairman of the Committee on House Oversight for bringing this legislation forward. There have been a lot of discussions. We have a lot of individuals who, as a result of the changeover in terms of the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives, there has been a substantial change of personnel. This policy was very important, in my opinion, and shared on this side of the aisle, and shared, I think, in a bipartisan fashion to treat those departing employees fairly so that in, at minimum, they received consideration for the annual leave they had accrued during the course of their service for the Congress and for individual members, and I congratulate the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] for his leadership in this effort in a bipartisan fashion.  We have adopted this; it is a good policy.
