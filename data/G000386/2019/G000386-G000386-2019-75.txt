  Unlike current House efforts, the Grassley-Wyden Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act fits the bill. It is bipartisan, and President Trump has endorsed it. My Republican colleagues in the House recently pointed to it--in other words, the Grassley-Wyden bill--during an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing as the only path forward to lower prescription drug prices. I welcome this support from Republicans in the House of Representatives.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
