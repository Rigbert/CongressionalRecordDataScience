 President, I rise today to support the Federal Financial Improvement Act. I want to thank Senator Brown, and our 11 cosponsors, for their individual efforts. I believe that the business of the people should be done as efficiently and effectively as possible. Finding a uniform standard of accounting for the executive branch agencies will be an important element of that efficiency and effectiveness. This bill will lead us to that uniform standard.  It is impossible to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the many Federal agencies when each may use a different accounting standard for making their records or books. For each to use a different standard is as if each speaks and writes in a different language that is foreign to the next. They cannot understand each other, and the story of their work cannot be written.  Therefore, the legislative branch cannot measure their efficiency and effectiveness. We cannot reconcile the consolidated Federal books. We cannot determine the presence of the relative financial failures or financial successes.  This is why this legislation is so important to the American people. The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act is crucial to efficiently and effectively doing the people's work, and it has my solid support.                          ____________________
