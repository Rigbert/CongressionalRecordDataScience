 A number of Senators have indicated they will come to the floor and pay tribute to our colleagues who will not be running for the 109th Congress. We certainly want to accommodate those requests and have set aside time accordingly.  At the close of our business this week, we will print those tributes to honor our departed colleagues. If Senators are not available to come to the floor to deliver their remarks, they are invited to submit those statements for the Record. Again, they will be printed as part of this larger document to which I just referred.  As a reminder, the majority leader has filed a cloture motion on the miscellaneous tariffs bill. That cloture vote will occur tomorrow morning. We expect cloture to be invoked; therefore, we hope to finish that conference report at an early time on Friday.  In addition, as everyone is aware, we continue to await completion of the Omnibus appropriations bill. It is still our hope and desire to finish our work on Friday, if at all possible.                          ____________________
