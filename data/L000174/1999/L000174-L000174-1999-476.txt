President, I never knew how much control I had over the schedule of debate, other than to find any time I step off the floor for a few minutes I can almost be guaranteed my friend from Utah will have a criticism of the way we are handling things over here.  So, while we are both on the floor, I tell him we have pared back to a dozen or fewer from the 90 possible amendments entered in the consent agreement last Friday. We have made significant progress. But also, because a number of Senators have pulled down amendments over here, amendments on our side, we have done it notwithstanding what we had to put up with when the Senator from New York and I were virtually ridiculed when we pointed out the flaws in the original Craig-Hatch gun legislation, something that took 2 days of voting and revoting as they drafted and redrafted and redrafted it, as the flaws became evident.
