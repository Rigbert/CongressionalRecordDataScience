 President, I rise to re-introduce the same ban on importing large capacity ammunition magazines that passed both Houses of Congress in 1999 during the Juvenile Justice debate.  That amendment passed the Senate by voice vote after a Motion to Table failed 59-39.  The same provision, offered by then-Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde on the House floor, passed by voice vote as an amendment to the House Juvenile Justice Gun Bill.  Nevertheless, these clips continue to flood into the country, because the Juvenile Justice bill became stalled in Conference, and never got to the President's desk.  It is time to take care of this once and for all--outside of politics, and outside of partisan bickering over other provisions. We simply cannot stand by and watch millions of these killer clips flood our shores.  Large-capacity ammunition clips are ammunition feeding devices, such as clips, magazines, drums and belts, which hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.  The 1994 assault weapons ban prohibited the domestic manufacture of these devices, but foreign companies are still sending them to our shores by the hundreds of thousands.  As the author of the 1994 provision, I can assure you that this was not our intent. We intended to ban the future manufacture of all high capacity clips, leaving only a narrow clause allowing for the importation of clips already on their way to this country.  Instead, due to the grandfather clause inserted into the 1994 legislation, BATF has allowed millions of foreign clips into this country, with no true method of determining date of manufacture. Between March 1998 and March 1999, BATF approved more than 11.4 million large-capacity clips for importation into America.  By voting for the amendment to the Juvenile Justice bill in 1999, a significant majority of this body has already agreed that it is both illogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to sell items to the American public--particularly items that are so often used for deadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from selling.  Supporting this legislation once again will simply finish what we already started during the juvenile justice debate, and bring foreign companies into greater compliance with the original intent of the 1994 law.  Opposing this bill would effectively allow foreign companies to continue to flout our laws, while domestic companies remain in compliance.  Let me just outline a bit of the history behind this issue.  Because of strong NRA opposition to the 1994 assault weapons ban and fears that businesses with inventories of the newly illegal products would be adversely impacted, we carved out a clause during negotiations to allow pre-existing guns and clips to remain on the shelves of stores across this country.  This so-called ``grandfather clause'' was also meant to allow guns and clips already on their way to this country to get here. Some Senators did not want to penalize companies that already had shipments in transit.  But it has now been more than six years, and these companies have had more than enough time to ship their pre-existing supplies of clips to the United States. Without question, many of these clips now flooding this country were made after the 1994 ban took effect. But because the ATF cannot tell when the clips were made, they must allow their import.  In 1998, President Clinton stopped the importation of most copycat assault weapons to this country with an Executive Order. However, the Justice Department advised us that the President does not have the authority to ban importation of big clips. As a result, millions of high capacity ammunition magazines continue to flow onto our shores and into the hands of criminals and, indeed, our children.  These clips come from at least 17 different countries, from Austria to Zimbabwe.  They come in sizes ranging from 15 rounds per clip to 30, 75, 90, or even 250 rounds per clip. In one recent one-year period:       20,000 clips of 250-rounds came from England;       Two million 15-round magazines came from Italy;       5,000 clips of 70-rounds came from the Czech Republic.  And the list goes on, and on, and on.  Mr. President, 75, 90 and even 250-round clips have no sporting purpose. They are not used for self defense. They have only one use--the purposeful killing of other men, women and children.  The legislation I re-introduce today will stop the flow of these clips into this country. I know that we cannot eliminate these clips from existence. But we can make them harder to obtain and, over time, dry up their supply.  These big clips allow disgruntled workers, angry children and psychopathic killers to exponentially increase the damage of their crimes. Let me give you just two examples.  In the now famous Springfield, Oregon shooting, a 15 year-old gunman with a 30-round clip killed two people and injured 22 more. Two dead, 22 wounded, all from one ammunition clip. It was only when his clip was finally empty and he had to pause to change clips that a fellow student was able to tackle and subdue him. Just imagine if the clip had held 75 rounds. Or 90. Or 250.  In the Jonesboro, Arkansas shooting, the two boys were armed with ten guns, one of which was a Universal carbine equipped with a 15-round killer clip. All 15 of the bullets in the killer clip were fired--more rounds than in all of the other nine guns combined. Five people were killed, ten other wounded.  Mr. President, in passing this legislation, we will not put an end to all incidents of gun violence now or in the near future. But we will begin to limit the destructive power of that violence. It will not stop every troubled child or adult who decides to commit an act of violence from doing so, but we can limit the tools used to carry out that act.  Passing this bill will not infringe on the legitimate rights of any adult gun owner or prevent a son or daughter from protecting the family from harm. It will not create a new category of banned guns.  But it will save some lives. It is just that simple. So let us do our best to ensure that the next time a troubled or vengeful child decides to strike out at his classmates, he cannot so easily find a gun that fires a hundred rounds a minute, or holds dozens of armor-piercing bullets.  Mr. President, I urge any of my colleagues who remain skeptical to look beyond the opposition rhetoric and into the heart of this legislation. And I urge them to look into their own hearts, and to realize that there are some things we can do to keep future Littletons from happening. This legislation is one of them.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record following the statement.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 134       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
