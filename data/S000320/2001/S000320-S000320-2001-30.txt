 President, over the course of the past several days, we have heard several Senators explain what they believe the North American Free Trade Agreement does and does not do. I believe this debate would be better served by reviewing the agreement itself.  Part Seven, Chapter Twenty, of NAFTA establishes the Free Trade Commission which shall resolve disputes that may arise regarding its interpretation or application. NAFTA also establishes a dispute settlement process in the event that the Free Trade Commission is unable to resolve a matter or if a third party brings forth a cause of action. Under NAFTA in these cases, the Commission ``shall establish an arbitral panel.'' Again, I am quoting from the agreement.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the North American Free Trade Agreement Part Seven: Administrative And Institutional Provision be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  North American Free Trade Agreement        Part Seven: Administrative and Institutional Provisions   Chapter Twenty: Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement                                Procedures                        Section A--Institutions                Article 2001: The Free Trade Commission       1. The Parties hereby establish the Free Trade Commission,      comprising cabinet-level representatives of the Parties or      their designees.       2. The Commission shall:       (a) supervise the implementation of this Agreement;       (b) oversee its further elaboration;       (c) resolve disputes that may arise regarding its      interpretation or application;       (d) supervise the work of all committees and working groups      established under this Agreement, referred to in Annex      2001.2; and       (e) consider any other matter that may affect the operation      of this Agreement.       3. The Commission may:       (a) establish, and delegate responsibilities to, ad hoc or      standing committees, working groups or expert groups;       (b) seek the advice of non-governmental persons or groups;      and       (c) take such other action in the exercise of its functions      as the Parties may agree.       4. The Commission shall establish its rules and procedures.      All decisions of the Commission shall be taken by consensus,      except as the Commission may otherwise agree.       5. The Commission shall convene at least once a year in      regular session. Regular sessions of the Commission shall be      chaired successively by each Party.                     Article 2002: The Secretariat       1. The Commission shall establish and oversee a Secretariat      comprising national Sections.       2. Each Party shall:       (a) establish a permanent office of its Section;       (b) be responsible for       (i) the operation and costs of its Section, and       (ii) the remuneration and payment of expenses of panelists      and members of committees and scientific review boards      established under this Agreement, as set out in Annex 2002.2;       (c) designate an individual to serve as Secretary for its      Section, who shall be responsible for its administration and      management; and       (d) notify the Commission of the location of its Section's      office.       3. The Secretariat shall:       (a) provide assistance to the Commission;       (b) provide administrative assistance to       (i) panels and committees established under Chapter      Nineteen (Review and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping and      Countervailing Duty Matters), in accordance with the      procedures established pursuant to Article 1908, and       (ii) panels established under this Chapter, in accordance      with procedures established pursuant to Article 2012; and       (c) as the Commission may direct       (i) support the work of other committees and groups      established under this Agreement, and       (ii) otherwise facilitate the operation of this Agreement.                     section b--dispute settlement                       Article 2003: Cooperation       The Parties shall at all times endeavor to agree on the      interpretation and application of this Agreement, and shall      make every attempt through cooperation and consultations to      arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of any matter      that might affect its operation.        Article 2004: Recourse to Dispute Settlement Procedures       Except for the matters covered in Chapter Nineteen (Review      and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping and Countervailing Duty      Matters) and as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the      dispute settlement provisions of this Chapter shall apply      with respect to the avoidance or settlement of all disputes      between the Parties regarding the interpretation or      application of this Agreement or wherever a Party considers      that an actual or proposed measure of another Party is or      would be inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement      or cause nullification or impairment in the sense of Annex      2004.                 Article 2005: GATT Dispute Settlement       1. Subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, disputes regarding any      matter arising under both this Agreement and the General      Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, any agreement negotiated      thereunder, or any successor agreement (GATT), may be settled      in either forum at the discretion of the complaining Party.       2. Before a Party initiates a dispute settlement proceeding      in the GATT against another Party on grounds that are      substantially equivalent to those available to that Party      under this Agreement, that Party shall notify any third Party      of its intention. If a third Party wishes to have recourse to      dispute settlement procedures under this Agreement regarding      the matter, it shall inform promptly the notifying Party and      those Parties shall consult with a view to agreement on a      single forum. If those Parties cannot agree, the dispute      normally shall be settled under this Agreement.       3. In any dispute referred to in paragraph 1 where the      responding Party claims that its action is subject to Article      104 (Relation to Environmental and Conservation Agreements)      and requests in writing that the matter be considered under      this Agreement, the complaining Party may, in respect of that     matter, thereafter have recourse to dispute settlement      procedures solely under this Agreement.       4. In any dispute referred to in paragraph 1 that arises      under Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary      Measures) or Chapter Nine (Standards-Related Measures):       (a) concerning a measure adopted or maintained by a Party      to protect its human, animal or plant life or health, or to      protect its environment, and       (b) that raises factual issues concerning the environment,      health, safety or conservation, including directly related      scientific matters,     where the responding Party requests in writing that the      matter be considered under this Agreement, the complaining      Party may, in respect of that matter, thereafter have      recourse to dispute settlement procedures solely under this      Agreement.       5. The responding Party shall deliver a copy of a request      made to paragraph 3 or 4 to the other Parties and to its      Section of the Secretariat. Where the complaining Party has      initiated dispute settlement proceedings regarding any matter      subject to paragraph 3 or 4, the responding Party shall      deliver its request no later than 15 days thereafter. On      receipt of such request, the complaining Party shall promptly      withdraw from participation in those proceedings and may      initiate settlement procedures under Article 2007.       6. Once dispute settlement procedures have been initiated      under Article 2007 or dispute settlement proceedings have      been initiated under the GATT, the forum selected shall be      used to the exclusion of the other, unless a Party makes a      request pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4.       7. For purposes of this Article, dispute settlement      proceedings under the GATT are deemed to be initiated by a      Party's request for a panel, such as under Article XXIII:2 of      the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947, or for a      committee investigation, such as under Article 20.1 of the      Customs Valuation Code.     Consultations                      Article 2006: Consultations       1. Any Party may request in writing consultations with any      other Party regarding any actual or proposed measure or any      other matter that it considers might affect the operation of      this Agreement.       2. The requesting Party shall deliver the request to the      other Parties and to its Section of the Secretariat.       3. Unless the Commission otherwise provides in its rules      and procedures established under Article 2001(4), a third      Party that considers it has a substantial interest in the      matter shall be entitled to participate in the consultation      on delivery of written notice to the other Parties and to its      Section of the Secretariat.       4. Consultations on matters regarding perishable      agricultural goods shall commence within 15 days of the date      of delivery of the request.       5. The consulting Parties shall make every attempt to      arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of any matter      through consultations under this Article or other      consultative provisions of this Agreement. To this end, the      consulting Parties shall:       (a) provide sufficient information to enable a full      examination of how the actual or proposed measure or other      matter might affect the operation of this Agreement;       (b) treat any confidential or proprietary information      exchanged in the course of consultations on the same basis as      the Party providing the information; and       (c) seek to avoid any resolution that adversely affects the      interests under this Agreement of any other Party.     Initation of Procedures   Article 2007: Commission--Good Offices, Conciliation and Mediation       1. If the consulting Parties fail to resolve a matter      pursuant to Article 2006 within:       (a) 30 days of delivery of a request for consultations,       (b) 45 days of delivery of such request if any other Party      has subsequently requested or has participated in      consultations regarding the same matter,       (c) 15 days of delivery of a request for consultations in      matters regarding perishable agricultural goods, or       (d) such other period as they may agree,     any such Party may request in writing a meeting of the      Commission.       2. A Party may also request in writing a meeting of the      Commission where:       (a) it has initiated dispute settlement proceedings under      the GATT regarding any matter subject to Article 2005(3) or      (4), and has received a request pursuant to Article 2005(5)      for recourse to dispute settlement procedures under this      Chapter; or       (b) consultations have been held pursuant to Article 513      (Working Group on Rules of Origin), Article 723 (Sanitary and      Phytosanitary Measures Technical Consultations) and Article      914 (Standards-Related Measures Technical Consultations).       3. The requesting Party shall state in the request the      measure or other matter complained of and indicate the      provisions of this Agreement that it considers relevant, and      shall deliver the request to the other Parties and to its      Section of the Secretariat.       4. Unless it decides otherwise, the Commission shall      convene within 10 days of delivery of the request and shall      endeavor to resolve the dispute promptly.       5. The Commission may:       (a) call on such technical advisers or create such working      groups or expert groups as it deems necessary,       (b) have recourse to good offices, conciliation, mediation      or such other dispute resolution procedures, or       (c) make recommendations, as may assist the consulting      Parties to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the      dispute.       6. Unless it decides otherwise, the Commission shall      consolidate two or more proceedings before it pursuant to      this Article regarding the same measure. The Commission may      consolidate two or more proceedings regarding other matters      before it pursuant to this Article that it determines are      appropriate to be considered jointly.     Panel Proceedings              Article 2008: Request for an Arbitral panel       1. If the Commission has convened pursuant to Article      2007(4), and the matter has not been resolved within:       (a) 30 days thereafter,       (b) 30 days after the Commission has convened in respect of      the matter most recently referred to it, where proceedings      have been consolidated pursuant to Article 2007(6), or       (c) such other period as the consulting Parties may agree,     any consulting Party may request in writing the establishment      of an arbitral panel. The requesting Party shall deliver the      request to the other Parties and to its Section of the      Secretariat.       2. On delivery of the request, the Commission shall      establish an arbitral panel.       3. A third Party that considers it has a substantial      interest in the matter shall be entitled to join as a      complaining Party on delivery of written notice of its      intention to participate to the disputing Parties and its      Section of the Secretariat. The notice shall be delivered at      the earliest possible time, and in any event no later than      seven days after the date of delivery of a request by a Party      for the establishment of a panel.       4. If a third Party does not join as a complaining Party in      accordance with paragraph 3, it normally shall refrain      therefore from initiating or continuing.       (a) a dispute settlement procedure under this Agreement, or       (b) a dispute settlement proceeding in the GATT on grounds      that are substantially equivalent to those available to that      Party under this Agreement.     regarding the same matter in the absence of a significant      change in economic or commercial circumstances.       5. Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Parties, the      panel shall be established and perform its functions in a      manner consistent with the provisions of this Chapter.                          Article 2009: Roster       1. The Parties shall establish by January 1, 1994 and      maintain a roster of up to 30 individuals who are willing and      able to serve as panelists. The roster members shall be      appointed by consensus for terms of three years, and may be      reappointed.       2. Roster members shall:       (a) have expertise or experience in law, international      trade, other matters covered by this Agreement or the      resolution of disputes arising under international trade      agreements, and shall be chosen strictly on the basis of      objectivity, reliability and sound judgment;       (b) be independent of, and not be affiliated with or take      instructions from, any Party; and       (c) comply with a code of conduct to be established by the      Commission.               Article 2010: qualifications of Panelists       1. All panelists shall meet the qualifications set out in      Article 2009(2).       2. Individuals may not serve as panelists for a dispute in      which they have participated pursuant to Article 2007(5).                     Article 2011: Panel Selection       1. Where there are two disputing Parties, the following      procedures shall apply:       (a) The panel shall comprise five members.       (b) The disputing Parties shall endeavor to agree on the      chair of the panel within 15 days of the delivery of the      request for the establishment of the panel. If the disputing      Parties are unable to agree on the chair within this period,      the disputing Party chosen by lot shall select within five      days as chair an individual who is not a citizen of that      Party.       (c) Within 15 days of selection of the chair, each      disputing Party shall select two panelists who are citizens      of the other disputing Party.       (d) If a disputing Party fails to select its panelists      within such period, such panelists shall be selected by lot      from among the roster members who are citizens of the other      disputing Party.       2. Where there are more than two disputing Parties, the      following procedures shall apply:       (a) The panel shall comprise five members.       (b) The disputing Parties shall endeavor to agree on the      chair of the panel within 15 days of the delivery of the      request for the establishment of the panel.

(c) Within 15 days of selection of the chair, the Party      complained against shall select two panelists, one of whom is      a citizen of a complaining Party, and the other of whom is a      citizen of another complaining Party. The complaining Parties      shall select two panelists who are citizens of the Party      complained against.       (d) If any disputing Party fails to select a panelist      within such period, such panelist shall be selected by lot in      accordance with the citizenship criteria of subparagraph (c).       3. Panelists shall normally be selected from the roster.      Any disputing Party may exercise a peremptory challenge      against any individual not on the roster who is proposed as a      panelist by a disputing Party within 15 days after the      individual has been proposed.       4. If a disputing Party believes that a panelist is in      violation of the code of conduct, the disputing Parties shall      consult and if they agree, the panelist shall be removed and      a new panelist shall be selected in accordance with this      Article.                    Article 2012: Rules of Procedure       1. The Commission shall establish by January 1, 1994 Model      Rules of Procedure, in accordance with the following      principles:       (a) the procedures shall assure a right to at least one      hearing before the panel as well as the opportunity to      provide initial and rebuttal written submissions; and       (b) the panel's hearing, deliberations and initial report,      and all written submissions to and communications with the      panel shall be confidential.       2. Unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree, the panel      shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with the Model      Rules of Procedure.       3. Unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree within 20      days from the date of the delivery of the request for the      establishment of the panel, the terms of reference shall be:      ``To examine, in the light of the relevant provisions of the      Agreement, the matter referred to the Commission (as set out      in the request for a Commission meeting) and to make      findings, determinations and recommendations as provided in      Article 2016(2).''       4. If a complaining Party wishes to argue that a matter has      nullified or impaired benefits, the terms of reference shall      so indicate.       5. If a disputing Party wishes the panel to make findings      as to the degree of adverse trade effects on any Party of any      measure found not to conform with the obligations of the      Agreement or to have caused nullification or impairment in      the sense of Annex 2004, the terms of reference shall so      indicate.                Article 2013: Third Party Participation       A Party that is not a disputing Party, on delivery of a      written notice to the disputing Parties and to its Section of      the Secretariat, shall be entitled to attend all hearings, to      make written and oral submissions to the panel and to receive      written submissions of the disputing Parties.                     Article 2014: Role of Experts       On request of a disputing Party, or on its own initiative,      the panel may seek information and technical advice from any      person or body that it deems appropriate, provided that the      disputing Parties so agree and subject to such terms and      conditions as such Parties may agree.                 Article 2015: Scientific Review Boards       1. On request of a disputing Party or, unless the disputing      Parties disapprove, on its own initiative, the panel may      request a written report of a scientific review board on any      factual issue concerning environmental, health, safety or      other scientific matters raised by a disputing Party in a      proceeding, subject to such terms and conditions as such      Parties may agree.       2. The board shall be selected by the panel from among      highly qualified, independent experts in the scientific      matters, after consultations with the disputing Parties and      the scientific bodies set out in the Model Rules of Procedure      established pursuant to Article 2012(1).       3. The participating Parties shall be provided:       (a) advance notice of, and an opportunity to provide      comments to the panel on, the proposed factual issues to be      referred to the board; and       (b) a copy of the board's report and an opportunity to      provide comments on the report to the panel.       4. The panel shall take the board's report and any comments      by the Parties on the report into account in the preparation      of its report.                      Article 2016: Initial Report       1. Unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree, the panel      shall base its report on the submissions and arguments of the      Parties and on any information before it pursuant to Article      2014 or 2015.       2. Unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree, the panel      shall, within 90 days after the last panelist is selected or      such other period as the Model Rules of Procedure established      pursuant to Article 2012(1) may provide, present to the      disputing Parties an initial report containing:       (a) findings of fact, including any findings pursuant to a      request under Article 2012(5);       (b) its determination as to whether the measure at issue is      or would be inconsistent with the obligations of this      Agreement or cause nullification or impairment in the sense      of Annex 2004, or any other determination requested in the      terms of reference; and       (c) its recommendations, if any, for resolution of the      dispute.       3. Panelists may furnish separate opinions on matters not      unanimously agreed.       4. A disputing Party may submit written comments to the      panel on its initial report within 14 days of presentation of      the report.       5. In such an event, and after considering such written      comments, the panel, on its own initiative or on the request      of any disputing Party, may:       (a) request the views of any participating Party;       (b) reconsider its report; and       (c) make any further examination that it considers      appropriate.                       Article 2017: Final Report       1. The panel shall present to the disputing Parties a final      report, including any separate opinions on matters not      unanimously agreed, within 30 days of presentation of the      initial report, unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree.       2. No panel may, either in its initial report or its final      report, disclose which panelists are associated with majority      or minority opinions.       3. The disputing Parties shall transmit to the Commission      the final report of the panel, including any report of a      scientific review board established under Article 2015, as      well as any written views that a disputing Party desires to      be appended, on a confidential basis within a reasonable      period of time after it is presented to them.       4. Unless the Commission decides otherwise, the final      report of the panel shall be published 15 days after it is      transmitted to the Commission.     Implementation of Panel Reports              Article 2018: Implementation of Final Report       1. On receipt of the final report of a panel, the disputing      Parties shall agree on the resolution of the dispute, which      normally shall conform with the determinations and      recommendations of the panel, and shall notify their Sections      of the Secretariat of any agreed resolution of any dispute.       2. Wherever possible, the resolution shall be non-     implementation or removal of a measure not conforming with      this Agreement or causing nullification or impairment in the      sense of Annex 2004 or, failing such a resolution,      compensation.        Article 2019: Non-Implementation--Suspension of Benefits       1. If in its final report a panel has determined that a      measure is inconsistent with the obligations of this      Agreement or causes nullification or impairment in the sense      of Annex 2004 and the Party complained against has not      reached agreement with any complaining Party on a mutually      satisfactory resolution pursuant to Article 2018(1) within 30      days of receiving the final report, such complaining Party      may suspend the application to the Party complained against      of benefits of equivalent effect until such time as they have      reached agreement on a resolution of the dispute.       2. In considering what benefits to suspend pursuant to      paragraph 1:       (a) a complaining Party should first seek to suspend      benefits in the same sector or sectors as that affected by      the measure or other matter that the panel has found to be      inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement or to      have caused nullification or impairment in the sense of Annex      2004; and       (b) a complaining Party that considers it is not      practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same      sector or sectors may suspend benefits in other sectors.       3. On the written request of any disputing Party delivered      to the other Parties and its Section of the Secretariat, the      Commission shall establish a panel to determine whether the      level of benefits suspended by a Party pursuant to paragraph      1 is manifestly excessive.       4. The panel proceedings shall be conducted in accordance      with the Model Rules of Procedure. The panel shall present      its determination within 60 days after the last panelist is      selected or such other period as the disputing Parties may      agree.    section C--domestic proceedings and private commercial dispute                                settlement  Article 2020: Referrals of Matters from Judicial or Administrative                               Proceedings       1. If an issue of interpretation or application of this      Agreement arises in any domestic judicial or administrative      proceeding of a Party that any Party considers would merit      its intervention, or if a court or administrative body      solicits the views of a Party, that Party shall notify the      other Parties and its Section of the Secretariat.
