On the other hand, looking at the energy situation we face in the United States, it is an economic, a national security, and an environmental issue, and we do need to make an investment.  New technology drives new jobs, markets, and economic opportunity, which is why we set $4.8 billion aside for the sciences in the Office of Science.  It is a national security issue, energy is, given where we buy so much of our petroleum products from, which is why we decided to invest in new vehicle technology to the extent of $273 million so we can get more miles per gallon, setting aside the issue of Yucca, investing $792 million in nuclear energy, and doing extensive biomass research.  There is an environmental aspect to this as well, and that is why we set aside monies for advanced clean energy and technologies to reduce the impact of older fossil-based fuels.  And finally, I would point out, given national security, we have set aside $1.5 billion for nuclear nonproliferation programs.
