 I would point out that the House bill includes a provision that provides that no penalty may be imposed against the States of Louisiana, Mississippi or Alabama for failure to repay a loan made to a State before October 1, 2007. This provision provides that there will be no penalty for loans made during that time.  Furthermore, I appreciate the other comments from the Senator from Louisiana. While I think that the House passed bill represents a good faith effort on behalf of the House, I agree that it does not go far enough and that the delegations of the affected States should have been consulted as this bill was assembled. The collaborative process that we relied on with Senators from States directly affected by Hurricane Katrina has been invaluable as we have worked to assemble the disaster relief package that Senator Baucus and I announced yesterday.  I also recognize that my colleagues are concerned that the Senate's position on this issue be appropriately represented in a conference with the House.  I want to assure my colleagues these welfare provisions will be addressed during a conference with the House and that the Senate's position on these welfare provisions will be vigorously represented.
