 President, I rise today to discuss the need to restore and protect Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe is a national treasure. Her alpine beauty has drawn and inspired people for centuries: artists and poets, John Muir and Mark Twain, and millions of visitors from around the world.  As a girl, I went to Lake Tahoe to ride horses through the woods, bike around the magnificent Basin and swim in the clear blue waters.  Today, I am proud to work with representatives from different ends of the political spectrum to restore Lake Tahoe to that pristine State. For 14 years, we have come together to Keep Tahoe Blue.  That is why today I am reintroducing the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2011, which is cosponsored by Senators Harry Reid, John Ensign and Barbara Boxer.  It would authorize $415 million over 10 years to improve water clarity, reduce risk of catastrophic wildfire, and restore the environment.  Specifically, it would provide $248 million over 10 years for the highest priority restoration projects, as established using scientific data. The legislation authorizes at least $72 million for stormwater management and watershed restoration projects scientifically determined to be the most effective ways to improve water clarity.  This bill also requires prioritized ranking of environmental restoration projects and authorizes $136 million for State and local agencies to implement these projects.  Now, and this is an important point, this legislation would direct investment to where it is needed most.  For example, today we know the major sources of stormwater runoff that send sedimentation into the lake, degrading water clarity.  So the monies would go to specific projects addressing California state roads, source of 23 percent of urban particle loads; the city of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., 22 percent; Washoe County, Nevada, 17 percent; and so forth.  In this bill, these stormwater projects are targeted to the areas of greatest concern. Priority projects will improve water quality, forest health, air quality and fish and wildlife habitat around Lake Tahoe. In addition, projects that benefit low-income neighborhoods are encouraged.  The bill authorizes $136 million over 10 years to reduce the threat of wildfire around Lake Tahoe. This would finance hazardous fuels reduction projects, at $17 million per year, including grants to local fire agencies.  It provides the Forest Service up to $10 million for fuels projects that have multiple environmental benefits, with an emphasis in restoring Stream Environment Zones.  This is critical because, again, these streams feed into the lake and form a critical link in the ecosystem. We need to pay attention to these stream zones if we hope to restore water clarity.  The bill protects Lake Tahoe from the threat of quagga mussels and other invasive aquatic species. Quagga mussels pose a very serious threat to Lake Tahoe, a threat made more intractable because these mussels have been shown to survive in cold waters. A few years ago University of California scientists reported that they found up to 3,000 Asian clams per square meter at spots between Zephyr Point and Elk Point in Lake Tahoe. The spreading Asian clam population could put sharp shells and rotting algae on the Lake's beaches and contribute to the spread other invasive species such as quagga mussels.  The bill would authorize $20.5 million for watercraft inspections and removal of existing invasive species. It would require all watercraft to be inspected and decontaminated.  One quagga or zebra mussel can lay 1 million eggs in a year. This means that a single boat carrying quagga could devastate the lake's biology, local infrastructure, and the local economy.  The damage that could be inflicted at Lake Tahoe by a quagga infestation has been estimated at tens of millions of dollars annually. The threat to Lake Tahoe cannot be overstated. There were no quagga mussels in Lake Mead 4 years ago. Today there are more than 3 trillion. The infestation is probably irreversible.  But there is some good news. Last summer, scientists placed long rubber mats across the bottom of Lake Tahoe to cut off the oxygen to the Asian clams. Early research suggests these mats were very effective at killing the clams. And scientists have also discovered how to decontaminate boats and kill quagga mussels.  We can fight off these invaders. But it will require drive and imagination--and the help authorized within this bill.  The bill supports reintroduction of the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The legislation authorizes $20 million over 10 years for the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Recovery Plan. The Lahontan Cutthroat Trout is an iconic species that has an important legacy in Lake Tahoe.  When John C. Fremont first explored the Truckee River in January of 1844, he called it the Salmon Trout River because he found the Pyramid Lake Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The trout relied on the Truckee River and its tributaries for their spawning runs in spring, traveling up the entire river's length as far as Lake Tahoe and Donner Lake, where they used the cool, pristine waters and clean gravel beds to lay their eggs. But dams, pollution and overfishing caused the demise of the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout.  Lake Tahoe is one of 11 historic lakes where Lahontan Cutthroat Trout flourished in the past, and it's a critical part of the strategy to recover the species.  The bills funds scientific research. The legislation authorizes $30 million over 10 years for scientific programs and research which will produce information on long-term trends in the Basin and inform the most cost-effective projects.  The bill prohibiting mining operations in the Tahoe Basin. The legislation would prohibit new mining operations in the Basin, ensuring that the fragile watershed, and Lake Tahoe's water clarity, are not threatened by pollution from mining operations.  The bill increases accountability and oversight. Every project funded by this legislation will have monitoring and assessment to determine the most cost-effective projects and best management practices for future projects.  The legislation also requires the Chair of the Federal Partnership to work with the Forest Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service and regional and state agencies, to prepare an annual report to Congress detailing the status of all projects undertaken, including project scope, budget and justification and overall expenditures and accomplishments.  This will ensure that Congress can have oversight on the progress of environmental restoration in Lake Tahoe.  The bill provides for public outreach and education. The Forest Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service and Tahoe Regional Planning Agency will implement new public outreach and education programs including: encouraging Basin residents and visitors to implement defensible space, conducting best management practices for water quality, and preventing the introduction and proliferation of invasive species.  In addition, the legislation requires signage on federally financed projects to improve public awareness of restoration efforts.  The bill allows for increased efficiency in the management of public land. Under this legislation, the Forest Service would have increased flexibility to exchange land with state agencies which will allow for more cost-efficient management of public land. There is currently a checkerboard pattern of ownership in some areas of the Basin.  Under this new authority, the Forest Service could exchange land with the California Tahoe Conservancy of approximately equal value without going through a lengthy process to assess the land.  For example, if there are several plots of Forest Service land that surround or are adjacent to Tahoe Conservancy land, the Tahoe Conservancy could transfer that land to the Forest Service so that it can be managed more efficiently.  This legislation is needed because the ``Jewel of the Sierra'' is in big trouble. If we don't act now, we could lose Lake Tahoe--and lose it with stunning speed--as climate change increases in severity.  The effects of climate change on Lake Tahoe are already visible. It is making the basin dry and tinder-hot, increasing the risks of catastrophic wildfire. Daily air temperatures have increased 4 degrees since 1911. Snowfall has declined from an average of 52 percent of overall precipitation in 1910 to just 34 percent in recent years.  Climate change has raised Lake Tahoe's water temperature 1.5 degrees in 38 years. That means the cyclical deep-water mixing of the lake's waters will occur less frequently, and this could significantly disrupt Lake Tahoe's ecosystem.  Anyone doubting that climate change poses a considerable threat to Lake Tahoe should read an alarming recent report by the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center.  It was written for the U.S. Forest Service by scientists who have devoted their professional careers to studying Lake Tahoe. And it paints a distinctly bleak picture of the future for the ``Jewel of the Sierra.''  Among its findings: The Tahoe Basin's regional snowpack could decline by as much as 60 percent in the next century, with increased floods likely by 2050 and prolonged droughts by 2100.  Even ``under the most optimistic projections,'' average snowpack in the Sierra Nevada around Tahoe will decline by 40 to 60 percent by 2100, according to the report.  This would bankrupt Tahoe's ski industry, threaten the water supply of Reno and other communities, and degrade the lake's fabled water clarity. It would be devastating.  Pollution and sedimentation have threatened Lake Tahoe's water clarity for years. In 1968, the first year UC Davis scientists measured clarity, the lake had an average depth of 102.4 feet. Clarity declined over the next 3 decades, hitting a low of 64 feet in 1997.  There has been some improvement this decade. This year scientists recorded average clarity at 69.6 feet--roughly within the range of the past eight years. But it is a fragile gain.  The University of California Davis report has determined that an all-out attack on pollution and sedimentation is the lake's last hope.  Geoff Schladow, director of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center and one of the report's authors, has highlighted the need to restore short-term water quality in Lake Tahoe--while there's still time to do it.  According to the report, ``reducing the load of external nutrients entering the lake in the coming decades may be the only possible mitigation measure to reduce the impact of climate change on lake clarity.'' In other words, the sediment and runoff entering the lake could fuel algal growth, creating a downward spiral in water quality and clarity.  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2011 would directly fund efforts to address water clarity issues and impacts from climate change.  Last year, the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2010 passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously, but there was not enough time for a floor vote. It is my hope that this legislation can be passed early in the legislative session.  A lot of good work has been done. But there's a lot more work to do, and time is running out.  Mark Twain called Lake Tahoe ``the fairest picture the whole world affords.'' We must not be the generation who lets this picture fall into ruin. We must rise to the challenge, and do all we can to preserve this ``noble sheet of water.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 432       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
