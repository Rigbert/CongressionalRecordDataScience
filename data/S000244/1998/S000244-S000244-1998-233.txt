Speaker, I rise today in support of the amendment to S. 927, The National Sea Grant College Program Reauthorization Act of 1998. I think that it is especially appropriate that we bring this bill before the House early in 1998, which has been designated by the United Nations as the ``Year of the Ocean.'' I can think of no better way to enter into the spirit of this designation than by passing the Sea Grant bill before us today.  Thirty-two years ago, the National Sea Grant College Program was established by Congress to improve our understanding of the nation's marine environment and to manage marine resources better. Since then, ocean and marine science hasn't stood still, and neither should the Sea Grant program. This latest reauthorization bill is the fruit of a bipartisan effort between the Committee on Science and the Committee on Resources to update and reinvigorate the Sea Grant program and to improve the accountability of the program to the taxpayers. I believe this bill achieves both of these goals, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.  This five-year reauthorization is not much different from the H.R. 437, which passed the House overwhelmingly last June. It adds and modifies various definitions, clarifies the responsibilities of the Program Director, and outlines the duties of the Sea Grant institutions conducting Sea Grant programs. It also includes merit reviews of grant and contract applications, repeals the Sea Grant International Program, which has never been funded, and ensures peer review of research sponsored by Sea Grant. Moreover, by limiting administrative spending to no more than 5 percent of the lesser of the amount authorized or appropriated each fiscal year, the bill also will help ensure that the taxpayers' money is being spent on research, not red tape.  In addition to the base authorization for the Sea Grant program, the bill includes additional authorizations for competitive, peer-reviewed research into the problems of zebra mussels, oyster disease, and phiesteria. I don't have to tell you how these organisms have plagued many communities throughout America and of the economic losses they have caused. This bill will help us get the best scientific minds working to improve our understanding of these problems and to find solutions.  The Sea Grant program has contributed greatly to our knowledge of the marine environment these past three decades and has earned the support of the political and scientific community. I believe the bill the Science and Resources Committees have crafted will put the program on a sound footing for the future and, just as important, will provide the taxpayer with value for money. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Before closing, I would like to commend the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], Chairman of the Science Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, and the subcommittee's ranking member, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Roemer], for their hard work on this legislation. I would also like to thank the ranking member of the Science Committee, the gentleman from California [Mr. Brown], for his support throughout the process.  I also want to take a moment to thank the gentleman from Alaska, the Chairman of the Committee on Resources [Mr. Young], and his colleagues on the Committee on Resources, including the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], the ranking member of the committee; the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton], Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Conservation, Wildlife, and Oceans; and the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie], the subcommittee's ranking member. They can be proud of their handiwork.                          ____________________
