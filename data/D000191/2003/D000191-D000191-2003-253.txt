Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to congratulate Ruth Bascom of Eugene, Oregon. On January 31, 2003, the Eugene City Council will name a bicycle and walking trail system after Ms. Bascom to honor her for her determined advocacy, intelligent leadership, and inspired vision. The Ruth Bascom Riverbank Trail System is a testament to her indomitable spirit and her remarkable civic career.  Ruth Bascom has an impressive record of public service, with over thirty years of active participation. She has been Mayor and City Councilor; served as a member of the Alton Baker Park Advisory Committee, the Mayor's Bicycle Committee, and the Governor's Bicycle Advisory Committee; was president of the Youth Symphony Board and the League of Women Voters; and worked on a variety of campaigns dedicated to enhancing our community.  Ruth Bascom gets things done--and done well. She has helped shape Eugene and is directly responsible for the award-winning bikeway system. In her many civic roles, she tirelessly fostered the riverbank trail system through design, funding, and construction phases. Her wholehearted and unwavering support for a city-wide bicycle-pedestrian trail system rallied community members, elected officials, and staff to her vision.  The opening of the East Bank Trail completes the Ruth Bascom Riverbank Trail System. The project survived ups and downs and detours because Ms. Bascom focused considerable energy, enthusiasm, and ingenuity on its success and delivered the necessary plans, funds, and allies.  Ruth Bascom is an exemplary citizen activist. I am pleased to offer her the hearty congratulations and warm thanks she so richly merits.                          ____________________
