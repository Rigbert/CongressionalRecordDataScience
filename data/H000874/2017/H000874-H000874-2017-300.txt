Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comment. I think we have demonstrated over the years that we ascribe to that concept.  My point to you is, in the first 10 or 12 days of this administration, that concept has been put at great risk. I think the gentleman's advice is good, and we have pursued that.  I simply urge the gentleman from California to suggest to the President of the United States that he adopt that concept as well.  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, it is good to have these colloquies back.
