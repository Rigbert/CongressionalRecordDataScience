Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.R. 5782, Pipeline Inspection Protection Enforcement Safety Act of 2006.  We have come a long way since the original legislation was passed in 2002. After the tragedies in Bellingham, Washington, in which committee Member Rick Larsen played a particularly key role in urging the committee forward, and Carlsbad, New Mexico, we had quite a contentious markup at that point in time, with a lot of resistance from what we saw as needed improvements in pipeline safety from the industry.  Not so this time around. In fact, there was broad consensus with the majority side, with the majority of the industry from the beginning, that we wanted to make some additional improvements in pipeline safety with this bill, but that a radical new approach was not warranted because we had already laid that groundwork with the 2002 bill.                              {time}  1715  The gentleman from the Energy and Commerce Committee will address in some detail the work done and improved upon in their committee relating to the pipeline, low-stress pipelines, which had been substantially exempt from regulation previously. Unfortunately, that led to some neglect on the part of BP in Alaska, and we had the largest North Slope oil spill because of a low pressure line which previously had been thought not to be of major concern, and in fact the company itself admitted they had been running the lines to failure.  Well, lines nowhere will be run to failure any more under this bill. We are going to have more pipeline inspectors, more enforcement. We are going to broaden the legislation to cover all pipelines and, you know, this will also have the Inspector General paying closer attention to some of the implementation of this legislation.  I want to thank my chairman, Mr. Petri, for his help in putting this together, Chairman Young, Ranking Member Oberstar and members of the committee.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
