 President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Robert E. Witt, chancellor of the University of Alabama system, who is retiring in August of this year. Dr. Witt will be long remembered for his remarkable career, his extraordinary leadership, and for his role in restoring the University of Alabama to its rightful place as the capstone of higher education.  A native of Bridgeport, CT, Dr. Witt received his bachelor's degree in economics from Bates College. He received his M.B.A. from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and his Ph.D. from the Pennsylvania State University.  Dr. Witt began his 35-year career in higher education in 1968 when he joined the business school faculty at the University of Texas at Austin. He eventually became department chair, associate dean, and in 1985, he was named dean of the UT business school. In 1995, Dr. Witt was named president of the University of Texas at Arlington, where he served until 2003 before moving to Tuscaloosa, AL.  Prior to his election as chancellor of Alabama's largest education enterprise, Dr. Witt served as president of the University of Alabama from 2003 to 2012. Throughout his tenure, I was impressed by his vision and commitment to growing the capstone into one of the leading institutions for higher education in the South.  During his 9 years as president of the university, he led an ambitious campaign for academic growth and achievement that positioned the University of Alabama as one of America's fastest growing public universities. Because of his efforts, the university has achieved a higher position academically, which continues to bring positive growth to the University of Alabama and our State as a whole.  In addition to serving as president of the University of Alabama system, Dr. Witt is chairman of the Council of the Presidents of Alabama's public colleges and universities. He is a member of the Governor's College & Career Ready Task Force, the American Cast Iron Pipe Company Board of Directors, the Alexis deTocqueville Executive Committee, the Advisory Board, and the Elizabeth Project Care Board. Dr. Witt is past chairman of the chamber of commerce of West Alabama, a past member of the Tuscaloosa County IDA Board, and the Black Warrior Council Boy Scouts of America.  In 2011, Dr. Witt was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor, which is comprised of 100 living Alabamians elected for their noteworthy service to the State.  Dr. Witt's many accomplishments, as well as his contributions to the University of Alabama, city of Tuscaloosa, and the State of Alabama, will not be soon forgotten. Our State and community have been fortunate to have a leader like Dr. Robert Witt, and I wish Dr. Witt and his wife, Sandee, the very best in their next chapter.                          ____________________
