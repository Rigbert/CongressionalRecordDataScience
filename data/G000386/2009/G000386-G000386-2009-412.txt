 President, it is no secret that I have worked for decades to bring greater transparency and accountability to all facets of Government operations. If there is one thing I have learned over those years, it is that you cannot achieve the goal of greater transparency and accountability without the access to information.  Today, we are experiencing the greatest financial crisis of our Nation's history. Daily we hear of more companies failing and the need for many more billions of Federal funds to save this bank or that investment company. In response to this crisis, the Treasury Department unveiled an initial plan to buy stakes in banks and other financial firms. That program is known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program known to all of us around here by the acronym TARP, T-A-R-P, and it is costing the American taxpayers nearly three-quarters of $1 trillion.  In an effort to bring maximum accountability to the people for the TARP funds, Congress created a strong Inspector General with the broad powers to investigate and oversee the program, including access to the records of TARP fund recipients. Similarly, in an effort to provide maximum transparency, Congress required the Government Accountability Office, known around here as GAO, to monitor and oversee the TARP program as well. The Government Accountability Office's mission is to look at the overall performance of the initiative and its impact on the financial system.  The Government Accountability Office is also required to prepare regular reports for Congress. However, the Government Accountability Office cannot do its job without access to information, and I have learned that it does not have all the access it needs. Although the Government Accountability Office can examine the records of the Treasury itself and of any of its agents or representatives, the Government Accountability Office does not have access to the books and records of private entities that receive TARP funds. The connection there is public dollars. The public ought to have the right to know.  Believe it or not, the Government Accountability Office can't have access to information from the banks and investment companies that receive billions of taxpayers' dollars; that is the problem. This legislation I am introducing is intended to fix that as well. The Government Accountability Office is supposed to be the eyes and ears of the Congress of the United States. Well, it can't do that job wearing blinders and ear plugs.                          ____________________
