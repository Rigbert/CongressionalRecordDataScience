 FRIST. I will be happy to.  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the leader share my view that one of the things we hear the most from our constituents as we go about the country is: Why can't you people in the Senate do things on a bipartisan basis? And I heard the leader indicate earlier that we obviously have bipartisan support for the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, we have bipartisan support for the tax extenders, bipartisan support for the minimum wage, and, yes, bipartisan support for a permanent reduction in the death tax.  Why in the world--with bipartisan support for all of these three measures which the leader has put on the agenda for the last week before the August break--why in the world shouldn't we come together on a bipartisan basis and do something together that would be overwhelmingly popular with the American people? We have seen the poll data on the death tax. Even after Americans understand it does not apply to them, they hate the tax and despise it because they think theyshouldn't have to visit the IRS and the undertaker on the last day. And we are not even, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, permanently repealing it, which would be our first choice but, rather, getting a permanent reduction.
