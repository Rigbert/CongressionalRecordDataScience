 Mark Woods. Mark is currently the superintendent of one of the Commonwealth of Kentucky's most important preserves of natural beauty, the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, a post he's held for 16 years. The Cumberland Gap National Historic Park sits at the border of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia, although of course, the most breathtaking parts are within the Bluegrass State.  Kentuckians will be sorry to see Mark go due to his recent and much deserved promotion: Later this month, Mark will assume his new duties as superintendent of the Blue Ridge Parkway. The Blue Ridge Parkway runs for over 450 miles through Virginia and North Carolina along the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is the most visited attraction of the entire U.S. National Park Service--more than Yellowstone, Yosemite, or the Grand Canyon.  Mark is a 33-year veteran of the National Park Service and has worked in parks in South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia as well as Kentucky. I am sure his family is very proud of him for this career accomplishment. Although I will miss working with Mark in Kentucky, I am pleased that citizens everywhere can still benefit from his knowledge and experience when they visit our national parks.  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Mark Woods for this opportunity and thanking him for his dedication to the National Park Service. Mr. Woods's career and accomplishments to date were recently profiled in a newspaper article. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear as follows:                  [From the Asheville Citizen-Times,                              Aug. 7, 2013]               SC Native Named New Parkway Superintendent                           (By Karen Chavez)       Asheville.--A 33-year National Park Service veteran with      Southern Appalachian roots has been chosen as the new      superintendent of the Blue Ridge Parkway.       Mark Woods, 53, now superintendent at Cumberland Gap      National Historic Park, which sits in Kentucky, Virginia and      Tennessee, will take over leadership of the busiest national      park site in the country September 22 at parkway headquarters      in Asheville.       ``Mark has got some great experience,'' said Bill Reynolds,      National Park Service spokesman in Atlanta. ``He spent most      of his career in the Southeast.''       Woods, who was raised in Greenville, S.C., received a      bachelor's degree in sociology from Lander University in      Greenwood, S.C., in 1982. He is married and has three      children.       He began working as an interpretive ranger for the National      Park Service in 1980 at parks including Ninety Six National      Historic Site (Ninety Six, S.C.), Kings Mountain National      Military Park (Blacksburg, S.C.), Andrew Johnson National      Historic Site (Greeneville, Tenn.), and Cumberland Island      National Seashore (St. Mary's, Ga.)       Woods will replace Phil Francis, who retired as      superintendent of the parkway in April. Monika Mayr, deputy      superintendent since 2009, has been acting superintendent      since April, and had applied for the position.       The parkway has not had a female superintendent in its 78      years.       Mayr, a 30-year park service veteran, said she has known      Woods for many years and thinks he will be a good fit.       ``He's a very good leader,'' she said. ``He has always      wanted to work at the parkway because he loves the resources      here and he knows the staff is really good.''       Woods also gets a hearty endorsement from Francis, who      oversaw the parkway for eight years and still lives in      Asheville.       ``I've known him over 20 years. He's well respected,''      Francis said.       ``He's a very able leader of Cumberland Gap. It's not as      big as the parkway, but he's already had to deal with some of      the same issues on a different scale. Sequestration cuts      happened at all national parks, so he's had to make those      same kinds of decisions.''       The federal sequester forced all national parks to reduce      their budgets by 5 percent for the remainder of the year,      starting in March.       Woods will inherit the aftermath of the nearly $800,000      budget cut, which was accomplished through facility closures,      cuts to seasonal and permanent staff, cutbacks on visitor      services such as ranger programs and a decrease in the mowing      operation and maintenance of the parkway's scenic overlooks.       He must also contend with a $450 million deferred      maintenance backlog, which has been growing for more than a      decade.       ``Mark has a tremendous background in working with gateway      communities,'' Reynolds said. ``He also has background in      facility design and construction, viewshed protection,      wilderness management and general management planning. A      broad range of excellent knowledge and experience has made      him well suited for this job.''                   SIMILAR PARKS ON DIFFERENT SCALES       Woods has been superintendent of Cumberland Gap, known as      the gateway to the western frontier, since 1997.       ``Cumberland Gap is the first doorway to the West, the path      that Daniel Boone and the pioneers used to access the West,''      said Carol Borneman, supervisory park ranger at Cumberland.       The park and the parkway have some similarities. Much like      the parkway, Cumberland Gap sits in the Appalachian      Mountains, and is steeped in Southern Appalachian history and      culture.       Cumberland Gap was authorized by Congress in 1940 to      preserve the natural gap through the mountain that pioneers      used to reach the western frontier centuries ago. It contains      24,000 acres with nearly 85 miles of forested hiking trails.      For 50 years, a major highway passed through the Gap.       But in one of the largest restoration projects undertaken      by the National Park Service, Borneman said, a highway tunnel      was built through the Gap in 1996, the old highway was ripped      out and the Gap restored to its Daniel Boone days as a      walking path. From one overlook in the park, Borneman said,      the Smokies can be seen on a clear day.       The culture, history and views drew 860,000 visitors in      2012.       Things will likely seem a little more crowded for Woods      when he gets to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The most visited of      the more than 400 units of the National Park Service,      including such popular parks as Yellowstone, Yosemite, the      Grand Canyon and the Great Smoky Mountains national parks,      the parkway had 15.2 million visitors in 2012.       The parkway stretches 469 miles from Shenandoah National      Park in Virginia through the Blue Ridge Mountains, ending in      Cherokee, and contains 81,000 acres of land and 1,200 miles      of boundary.       Established in 1935 as a scenic motor road, cars and      traffic continue to be one of its biggest issues. October is      generally the busiest month on the parkway, and Woods will      arrive just in time for the heavy fall foliage traffic.       He will also face a major closure in one of the parkway's      most popular areas in the height of summer tourist season. A      20-mile stretch just north of Asheville, through the Craggy      Gardens area to Mount Mitchell State Park, has been closed to      traffic since July 12 due to slope failure, presumably from      the excessive spring and summer rain, staff say.       Crews are now working on a temporary fix to open the      roadway by Labor Day for the fall leaf-peeping traffic, then      will close again while the road is permanently fixed.       Borneman said Cumberland Gap is sad to see Woods leave.       ``He is an incredible superintendent, so in tune to park      resources, and such a proponent of working with local      communities,'' she said. ``The parkway is lucky to be getting      him.''                          ____________________
