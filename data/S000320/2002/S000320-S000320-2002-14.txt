 President, I am pleased to join with Senator Bayh in offering an amendment to the homeland security bill.  It is a straighforward amendment designed to improve and strengthen the protection of our Department of Defense installations which contain the storage and destruction facilities for our Nation's chemical agent and munitions stockpile.  Prior to September 11, no temporary flight restrictions existed for any of our Nation's chemical weapons stockpile sites. Secretary Rumsfeld took quick action after September 11 to establish temporary flight restrictions at each of these sites, but numerous violations of these flight restrictions have occurred.  In the case of the Anniston Chemical Destruction Facility and storage site, 22 violations have occurred since flight restrictions were implemented by the Department of Defense. The latest was just today when a Lear-type jet flew over the incineration facility at less than 1000 feet. Another violation that caused great concern was a night time over-flight which included 3 passes by an unidentified aircraft.  These incursions are serious matters. Current law provides for stiff penalties to be levied against those who violate restricted air space. In the case of our chemical weapons storage sites and weapons destruction facilities, we must be ever vigilant. That is what this amendment seeks to do by:  First, requiring the Secretary of Defense to review the current temporary flight restrictions to determine if they are sufficient to provide maximum protection to these facilities from potential airborne threats and to report his findings to Congress.  Second, the amendment would require the FAA to issue a report on each violation of the temporary flight restrictions which apply to these sites. Mr. President, as I have stated, very serious penalties already exist for those who violate these restrictions. Given the tremendous danger to the workers and local citizens associated with any unintentional crash or intentional act at any one of these storage sites, I believe this amendment is both reasonable and prudent in requiring the FAA to report on actions taken in response to a confirmed and properly investigated restricted airspace violation.  Lastly, in the amendment we ask the Secretary of Defense to assess the use of periodic air patrols and military flight training exercises in terms of their effectiveness as a deterrent to airspace violations or other potential airborne threats to these facilities.  While little, if anything, could be done to stop someone intent on attacking one of these storage sites from the air, we should take every step to make sure that these flight restrictions are respected and violators are punished. This amendment is about safety, enforcement of the law, and, ultimately, protection of our citizens who live in close proximity to these chemical weapons facilities.                          ____________________
