 President, I wish to take a moment and bring to my colleagues' attention the 20th anniversary of the Valley Haven School Hike/Bike/Run. The Valley Haven School, located in Valley, AL, is a school for mentally retarded and multiple handicapped citizens of all ages. Started 37 years ago by volunteers, the school is now professionally staffed and currently offers skilled training to 95 students ranging in age from 3 months to 60 years.  Mr. President, local moneys of $100,000 must be raised each year to meet operating expenses and match State and Federal grants. The primary source of these funds is the annual Hike/Bike/Run, which consists of a 5 or 10 mile walk, an 11 or 22 mile bike ride, a skate-a-thon, a 1, 3.1, or 6.2 mile run, a 5 mile bike ride for children, and the Trike Trek for preschoolers.  Each participant in the Hike/Bike/Run obtains pledges for their participation, and all proceeds go directly to Valley Haven to support the education and training for handicapped students. In 1995, this 1 day fundraiser involved over 1,000 participants and 8,000 pledging sponsors. The event generated over $100,000 in pledges to support the work of the school.  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and commend Valley Haven and the entire Valley community for displaying such strong support and concern for these special students. This year's Hike/Bike/Run will be held on Saturday, May 4, and I know that the community will once again unite to support this wonderful program and help Valley Haven School help its students.                          ____________________
