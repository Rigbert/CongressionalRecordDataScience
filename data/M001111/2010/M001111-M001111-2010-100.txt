 President, last Sunday at midnight thousands of people in my home State of Washington, who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, had the rug pulled out from underneath them. That is because these men and women, who wake up each day to scan the classified ads and send out resumes and travel to interview after interview, had the unemployment benefits they count on suddenly cut off. In losing that critical support, they lost an important source of security they need to help them stay in their homes or make rent and the stability that allows them to continue to afford to look for work.  Over the last 2 weeks, I have traveled throughout my State, talking to my constituents and discussing our economy and working to support job-creation efforts, and I have to say the frustration is very clear. It is written on the faces of so many in my State who just cannot seem to get a break, who have come close to being hired but have been told the time is just not right, they should come back next month or next year.
