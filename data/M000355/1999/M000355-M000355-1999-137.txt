 THOMPSON. I will. But I would also like--now or later--to pose this: I was looking through this list, and in the first 6 months of this year, 37 companies, corporations, gave $50,000 or more to both parties--both parties. I would ask the Senator why he thinks they did that.  Mr. McCONNELL. I am grateful they did because it gave us an opportunity to compete with the newspapers and the special interest groups that have a constitutional right to participate in the political process. I am extraordinarily grateful that all of these disclosed contributions--and this is why my friend from Tennessee knows who contributed--extraordinarily grateful that these companies are giving us the opportunity to engage in vote buying, engage in getting out the vote, engage in issue advocacy, and the other things that benefit our parties.  I am extremely grateful they do that. And anybody who wants to make an issue out of it, it is fully disclosed, which is why my friend from Tennessee has the list.
