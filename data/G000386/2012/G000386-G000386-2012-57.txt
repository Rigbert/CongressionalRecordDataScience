 President, I wish to express my support for S. 285, a private relief bill for Soptuuchi ``Victor'' Chukwueke.  Mr. Chukwueke has a compelling story. He has suffered a serious medical condition, was abandoned by his parents, and was brought to the U.S. at a young age. He has endured several surgeries as a result of his serious medical condition, and has overcome many barriers to get where he is today.  Despite his personal story and achievements, members of the Judiciary Committee were informed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that he was an orphan and had no family in the U.S. or in Nigeria, his home country. We were led to believe that he had no family because that is how he represented himself during interviews with Federal agents. We found out later, however, that he still had a mother and father, and six siblings in Nigeria. Upon learning of this discrepancy, I immediately asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement to clear up these conflicting statements, and to provide any other background information or paper in his files, including interview notes to understand the line of questioning that took place between ICE and Mr. Chukwueke. ICE rejected sharing the file with members of the Judiciary Committee. After weeks of a standstill, ICE agreed to show committee staff what was in his alien file. The file was helpful because we could review interview notes, visa applications, pictures, and other notes on Mr. Chukwueke.  Upon completing the review of the file, committee staff held a conference call with Mr. Chukwueke. During that interview, Mr. Chukwueke stated that he told investigators that he believed he was an orphan and that he had no intention of lying. For the record, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the sworn affidavit that was provided by Mr. Chukwueke to ICE and to members of the Judiciary committee.
