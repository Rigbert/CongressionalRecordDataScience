 President. As the ranking member on military construction, I assure my colleagues that we have worked very, very carefully this year to go through the numerous requests and the needs of the military. We are extremely aware of the quality-of-life needs of our military, and they are reflected in this amendment that is before us.  This amendment adds child-care centers, inadequate housing conditions, old dining facilities and lack of physical fitness centers. These are quality-of-life issues.  I have traveled out and talked to men and women on the military bases. These are the issues they are asking us to address, and these are the ones that are addressed in this amendment. We worked very carefully in a bipartisan way to put these forward. I assure my colleagues we have done it in a fairmanner with the needs of the quality of life of our men and women in the military in mind.
