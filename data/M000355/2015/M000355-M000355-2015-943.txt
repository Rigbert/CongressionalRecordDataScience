 It hasn't been easy. We always knew obstacles would lie ahead at every turn, and they sure have, but our country needs a multiyear highway bill, and we will get there if we just continue to stick together.  Perhaps the most challenging issue now relates to amendments. Supporters of the Ex-Im Bank are demanding a vote to reauthorize it, and they have made it clear they are ready to stop all other amendments if denied that opportunity. They have already proven they have the votes to back up the threat as well. This presents a challenge for the Senate and to opponents of the Ex-Im Bank, like myself in particular, but I believe we can still move forward, and I believe the more equitable and more balanced proposal I just offered will allow us to do so.  So let me explain. It provides for votes on two long-sought, nongermane amendments. First, it allows a vote on an amendment to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, something nearly every Democrat wants. Second, it allows a vote on an amendment that would repeal ObamaCare, something nearly every Republican wants and something we will continue to fight for.  Ex-Im shouldn't be the only vote we take on this bill, and under the compromise I just filed, it will not be. That is a much fairer way forward.  I would urge my colleagues to join me in voting against Ex-Im, and I urge every Senator to take this important opportunity to join me in voting to finally give the American people the fresh start they deserve on health care.  I know we will engage in a robust debate on all of these issues--we should--and then we will take a vote. While the clock demands that we file cloture given that the highway trust fund will expire at the end of next week, I hope we still have a robust amendment process on this critical bill.  So I would encourage every one of my colleagues to work with the bill managers on their germane amendments.  Senators should also note this: Yesterday, I circulated bill language to both sides of the aisle that I intended to use to modify my amendment No. 2266. That language contained technical and conforming edits as well as the removal of a provision related to fugitive felons that was not needed to fully offset the bill.  I wanted to let my colleagues know the amendment I just offered contains one additional modification. It removes provisions that would have terminated the $1.7 billion Hardest Hit Fund mortgage program. Several Senators on both sides of the aisle--and in particular Senator Portman on our side of the aisle has been a real champion on this issue--expressed their opposition to its termination. So we have reduced spending levels in the bill to accommodate this change, while ensuring the bill remains fully paid for, for 3 years.                   Recognition of the Minority Leader
