President, as a supporter of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 I am pleased to support S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998.  The bill will create a uniform standard for securities class action lawsuits against corporations listed on the three largest national exchanges.  Class action suits are frequently the only financially feasible means for small investors to recover damages.  Yet, such lawsuits have also been subject to abuse, draining resources from corporations while inadequately representing the interests of investor plaintiffs.  Mr. President, in 1995, I voted to curtail such abusive litigation. It was obvious then that some class action suits were being filed after a precipitous drop in the value of a corporation's stock, without citing specific evidence of fraud.  These lawsuits inflict substantial costs upon corporations, harming the business and its shareholders. Unfortunately, since passage of federal procedures protecting corporations from such suits there has been some attempt by class action plaintiffs to circumvent these safeguards by filing similar lawsuits in state courts.  Mr. President, this Act will preempt this circumvention, creating a national standard for class action suits involving nationally traded securities. I favor this legislation because it recognizes the national nature of our securities markets, provides for more efficient capital formation, and protects investors.  However, Mr. President, it is essential to recognize that preemption marks a significant change concerning the obligations of Congress.  When federal legislation was enacted to combat securities fraud in 1933 and 1934, federal law augmented existing state statutes. States were free to provide greater protections from fraud to their citizens, and many have.  The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has testified concerning the traditional system by which securities have been regulated: through both public and private lawsuits in both state and federal courts.  Many of my colleagues voted for the 1995 legislation knowing that if federal standards failed to provide adequate investor protections, state suits would provide a necessary backup.  With passage of this legislation, my colleagues and I have now accepted full and sole responsibility to ensure that fraud standards allow victimized investors to recoup lost funds.  Only a meaningful right of action against those that defraud guarantees investor confidence in our national markets.  A uniform national standard concerning fraud provides no benefit to markets if issuers can, with impunity, fail to ensure that consumers receive truthful, complete information on which to base investment decisions.  Specifically, my support rests on the presumption that the liability standard was not altered by either the 1995 Act or this legislation.  I strongly endorse the Report which accompanies this legislation, which states clearly that nothing in the 1995 legislation changed either the scienter standard or the previous pleading standards associated with the most stringent rules, those of the Second Circuit.  The reason such standards were not changed in 1995 is that they are essential to providing adequate investor protection from fraud.  I have been deeply troubled by the ruling of several federal district courts which, ignoring the clear legislative history of the 1995 Act, have either changed the requirements of scienter in a fraud case or have invalidated the proper pleading standard for a 10b-5 action.  Mr. President, let me be clear: nothing in the act addressed the scienter standard: which has quite rightly been held by every Circuit to rule on the issue to include recklessness.  With regard to proper pleadings: the PSLRA requires plaintiffs to plead specific facts ``giving rise to a strong inference'' that the defendants acted with the required state of mind. Prior to the 1995 legislation, some circuit courts allowed scienter to be averred generally. However, the PSLRA's heightened standard was specifically linked to the most stringent pleading standard at the time, that of the Second Circuit. That standard allows a plaintiff to establish a case by either pleading motive and opportunity or recklessness.  Mr. President, I believe that SEC Chairman Levitt, who has a lifetime of experience as both an investor and regulator of markets, has been the most articulate concerning the need for a recklessness standard concerning the scienter requirement.  In October 21, 1997 testimony before the Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous Materials of the House's Committee on Commerce, Chairman Levitt said:       In my judgment, eliminating recklessness from the      securities anti-fraud laws would be tantamount to eliminating      manslaughter from the criminal laws. It would be like saying      you have to prove intentional murder or the defendants gets      off scot free. . . . If we were to lose the reckless      standard, in my judgement, we would leave substantial numbers      of the investing public naked to attacks by fraudsters and      schemers.  In testimony before the Banking Subcommittee Chair by Senator Gramm, on October 29, 1997, Chairman Levitt further articulated his position regarding the impact a loss of recklessness would have. He said:       A uniform federal standard that did not include      recklessness as a basis for liability would jeopardize the      integrity of the securities markets, and would deal a      crippling blow to defrauded investors with meritorious      claims. A higher scienter standard would lessen the      incentives for corporations to conduct a full inquiry into      potentially troublesome or embarrassing areas, and thus would      threaten the disclosure process that has made our markets a      model for nations around the world.  I think the danger that a loss of recklessness posses to our citizens and our markets is clear.  Mr. President, equally important is a pleading standard that allows victimized investors to recover their losses. The reason for allowing a plaintiff to establish scienter through a pleading of motive and opportunity or recklessness is clear. As one New York Federal District Court has stated, ``a plaintiff realistically cannot be expected to plead a defendant's actual state of mind.''  Since the 1995 Act allows for a stay of discovery pending a defendant's motion to dismiss, requiring a plaintiff to establish actual knowledge of fraud or an intent to defraud in a complaint raises the bar far higher than most legitimately defrauded investors can meet.  The SEC has been clear on this point and it has been well recognized by the supporters of both the 1995 and 1998 Acts that neither changed the preexisting standards.  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Chairman of the Committee and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, a prime sponsor of this legislation, have today articulated their belief that including reckless behavior in the definition of fraud is essential to the protection of our markets. I join them intheir pledge to sponsor legislation should such protections be threatened.  As a result, the legislative history of both bills well establishes that the scienter standard, as well as the pleading standard of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, remains totally intact. Therefore, it is now clear that federal district court rulings that have held otherwise are clearly in error.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an analysis, preformed for me by the staff of the SEC, of cases adjudicated under the 1995 Act.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               U.S. Securities and                                          Exchange Commission,                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1998.
