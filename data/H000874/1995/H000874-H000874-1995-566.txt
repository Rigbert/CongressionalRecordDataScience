Speaker, I reserve the right to object.  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying when this matter was previously brought up, I am not going to object, but I do want to make the point, and I think it is a point that bears consideration.  This is a very serious matter that is going to be considered by the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight tomorrow. It is a matter of great controversy. Now we have considered a lot of matters of great controversy when we have been under the 5-minute rule. My side has agreed to this, and I am not going to object because of that. The leadership on my side has consulted with their leadership and has agreed.  However, Mr. Speaker, I want to make the point under my reservation that this is a change of great magnitude for middle-income workers, that we expect to carry out our policies. The proposal is approximately a 10-percent tax increase. Now, if it were on any other people in America, the committee would not only not meet, they would be vigorously opposed to such an action. I am told that the proposal will be changed somewhat and that, in fact, the money will not be a savings, but will be applied to the retirement itself of Federal employees. But it has been projected at an $11 to $12 billion cut out of the pension benefits of some 2 million civilian Federal employees. That is a big hit on Federal employees. I am opposing that proposal, and will oppose it tomorrow, and am hopeful that it will not be approved.  Now the ranking member of the subcommittee from which that came is the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Moran]. He has raised many reasons why it should not be approved, and at this time, under my reservation of objection, I will be glad to yield to the gentleman from Virginia.
