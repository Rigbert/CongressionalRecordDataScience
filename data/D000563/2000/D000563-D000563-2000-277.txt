President, I will be offering an amendment at the close of my remarks. It involves a section of this bill which I believe was authored by Senator Domenici of New Mexico. I just spoke to him a minute ago to tell him I will be offering this amendment to strike his section. He said to proceed. He will come to the floor in a few moments, and I am sure he is following this debate in the meantime.  First, I thank Senator Byrd and Senator Gorton for their fine work on this Interior appropriations bill. I think I have expressed the feelings of many Members of the Senate that this is a spending bill that is near and dear to our hearts. It involves so many of our Nation's greatest treasures, and the stewardship which they showed on this bill will not only reflect their feelings, but will inure to the benefit of generations to come, if we do it right.  This bill is considerably different and, in my estimation, considerably better than the bill in previous years. In the past, there have been the so-called environmental riders that have been added on a variety of different issues. Most of them involved public lands and how they were to be used.  I come from the State of Illinois. We have some public land in Illinois. We have a national forest in Illinois. We have part of a National Park System--a very small part. I know that some of my colleagues from the Western States have a much different situation. Many of them represent States where the majority of the land is owned by the Federal Government. I am sure that is an awkward situation, at best. I can't quite imagine all of the ramifications of that policy, of owning that public land and managing it. But I am sure it affects their daily lives and the economy of their States.  Having said that, though, I think all of us, whether we live in one of those States with a large portion of publicly owned land or whether we live in some other part of the country, have a vested interest in this debate about the use of the public lands. The reason we have a vested interest is twofold. First, these lands are being managed now by this Presidential administration in a temporary way. Soon there will be another President. It could be President Gore; it could be President Bush. I am not certain what the outcome of the election will be. But the next administration will then be handed the responsibility of managing this public land.  Each successive administration, each President, and Congress, for that matter, have a voice in determining how that land is to be managed. And if they do the job right, in my estimation, they will hand off to the next generation succeeding an even better stewardship of this Federal land. I drew from my desk a quote from the Congressional Record. It is a quote from a former Republican President of the United States by the name of Theodore Roosevelt. For those familiar with the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt, you know he created the first national park and that he had a special interest in conserving and protecting our natural heritage and, particularly, in establishing public lands to protect them for future generations. This short quote summarizes his philosophy and, I might add, my own:       We must ask ourselves if we are leaving for future      generations an environment that is as good or better than      what we found.  That is a very simple, straightforward statement. I keep it in my desk here because, quite honestly, when the Interior appropriations bill comes up, that question is being asked of us. Are we going to manage the public lands of America in a way that future generations will look back and say we did a good job and protected that legacy from previous generations? It has been handled and managed well under your stewardship.  I think that is the test. It is the test of this appropriations bill, and it is the test of every amendment to that appropriations bill. That is half of the test. The other half of the test goes beyond our obligation to explain to future generations, if we did a good job--it goes to the question as to whether or not we have met our responsibility to God's creation because on these public lands we find a great many species, a lot of different plant life, wild flowers, grasses, which are things that, frankly, depend on our good stewardship. If we don't treat those lands well, we not only stand to disappoint future generations, we stand to destroy our natural legacy.  So when we talk about environmental issues, a lot of people like to categorize those as some kind of bureaucratic gobbledygook jargon in Washington. I think it is much more than that. It gets down to those two fundamental questions. At the end of the day, when we are called to judgment for our public service, can we say to future generations that the public lands you entrusted us with are given to you in at least as good a shape as we received them, and maybe better, and that we protected God's creation in a reasonable and thoughtful way during our years of management? That is the underlying debate that we hear on the floor of the Senate when we discuss so-called environmental riders; that is, questions of environmental policy raised in the Interior appropriations bill.  Let me address the specific issue before us in the amendment I will offer. The Bureau of Land Management is part of the Department of the Interior. It is entrusted with administering millions of acres of our Nation's valuable and diverse public lands located primarily in 12 Western States, including the State of Alaska.  Currently, the BLM manages more Federal lands than any other public agency. BLM oversees some 40 percent of our Nation's Federal lands--roughly 264 million acres of surface land predominantly in the western part of the United States. But acreage alone doesn't tell the story.  Our Nation's public lands contain a wealth of natural, cultural, historical, economic, and archaeological resources that belong to everybody. They are, in fact, part of the Treasury of the United States--not in dollar terms, but when you want to measure the assets of this country, you would certainly step back and say: I want to include not only what we find in our Treasury but our Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and all of the land owned by the people of this country. These are our assets that we have a responsibility to protect and manage.  The natural and ecological diversity of the BLM-managed public lands is perhaps the greatest of any Federal agency. BLM manages extensive grasslands and forests, islands, wild rivers, high mountains, arctic tundra, and desert landscapes. As a result of the diversity of habitat, many thousands of wildlife and fish occupy these lands. These fish and wildlife species represent a wealth of recreational, national, and economic opportunities for local communities and States in our Nation.  The single most extensive use of public land under the jurisdiction of the BLM is grazing in the lower 48. Of the roughly 179 million acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management outside of Alaska, grazing is allowed on almost 164 million acres out of 179 million, and millions of these acres also contain valuable and sensitive fish, wildlife, archaeological, recreation, or wilderness values.  At the present time, the BLM authorizes through the issuance of grazing permits approximately 17,000 livestock operators to graze on these 164 million acres of public land. These permits and public land grazing that they allow are important to thousands of Western livestock operators. Many of these livestock operators and ranchers use these permits to help secure bankloans to provide important financial resources for their operations.  BLM typically issues grazing permits for a 10-year period on public lands. Many current grazing permits were issued in the late 1980s and are now expiring in large numbers over 2- or 3-year periods of time. These permits numbering in the thousands present the BLM with an unusually large and burdensome short-term renewable task.  We addressed this very issue in previous Interior appropriations bills. Can the Bureau of Land Management keep up with expiring permits or leases and reissue them in timely fashion so that someone who is using the land, the livestock operations, can continue their business, not lose money, and not face uncertainty when it comes to financing their operations?  The unusually large number of expiring grazing permits has created a dual dilemma for the Bureau and for its many public constituents. Western livestock operators who currently hold these expiring permits are worried that delays in the processing by the Bureau may cause them to lose their permits or otherwise threaten their ability to use the permits to secure bank loans for their operations.  Conservationists-environmentalists--meanwhile believe that the Bureau has a responsibility to perform responsibly for the governmental and environmental stewardship of these lands and analyze the grazing to make certain that if there is to be a renewal it is done in a reasonable and responsible way.  It is entirely understandable to me being from my State that ranchers are concerned about issues of security and predictability. So are my farmers. I understand this. Likewise, we require the BLM to wisely manage and protect our public lands for all Americans.  The on-the-ground permit level decisionmaking that should legally accompany the BLM's permit renewal process is fundamentally important to the ecologically sound and multiple-use management of our Nation's public lands.  The BLM must conduct what we call a NEPA, which is the National Environmental Policy Act, compliance and land use planning performance review before reauthorizing permits. In other words, before they give the permit back to the livestock operator to go back on public land to use it for grazing, they take a look at public land: How are we doing? Are we doing this in a responsible environmental way so ultimately the land is not so degraded or changed as to lessen its value or to endanger species and wildlife? That is a responsibility of BLM. It is an important one.  To meet the review requirements under NEPA and other existing Federal laws and regulations, the BLM uses a lot of different teams composed of agency professionals who look at wildlife, range, wild horse, bureau and cultural, and recreation wilderness activities. The BLM also solicits public comments and relevant information from a wide array of people interested in range management, including hunters, fishermen, and many others.  The simple fact is this: On most public land, grazing allotments and all of the important decisions that determine the condition of public rangeland resources are contained in the terms and conditions of the grazing permits and in the annual decision about the amount, timing, and location of livestock grazing. These decisions determine whether streams in the areas will flourish or be degraded and whether wildlife habitat will be maintained or destroyed. Public involvement in this process is essential for balanced public management. Without the application of NEPA and related laws, the American public has no real voice in public rangeland management.  Let me at this time give you an illustration. A picture is worth more than a thousand words. Any Senator is good for a thousand words at the drop of a hat. This picture will tell you an interesting story of a NEPA review of grazing on BLM land.  Let me drop some of these acronyms and abbreviations and try to speak English so those following the debate will understand.  The ecological picture here is one of the Santa Maria River in western Arizona, which has improved dramatically as a result of permit management changes under the environmental policies of the BLM.  It is important to note that the BLM continues to allow grazing in the areas you are looking at. However, they change some of the conditions of the grazing. As a result of environmental considerations, the grazing permits on the Santa Maria River in western Arizona now contain terms and conditions requiring livestock to be kept away from the rivers and streams during the spring and summer growing season.  The Santa Maria River in western Arizona is a rarity. It is a free-flowing river in the midst of a vast, hot, low-elevation desert.  The riparian corridor provides essential habitat for dozens of species of wildlife, including 15 species listed by Federal or State agencies as threatened, endangered, or some other special status. The riparian area of Santa Maria and its ability to support wildlife were severely degraded by many years of uncontrolled and unmanaged livestock grazing in the river corridor.  The vegetation was literally stripped away. Water was so polluted that streambanks were trampled and miles of riverbed areas and riparian areas were nearly as barren as the surrounding desert.  This is the picture of the overgrazed area around the Santa Maria River in Arizona. There is the ``before'' picture. Let me tell you a little bit about the ``after'' picture, which I will refer to in a second.  For decades, the BLM issued new grazing permits to ranchers along the Santa Maria River with no terms and conditions to protect the riparian areas.  Even though the BLM developed the land-use plan that required the river to be rested from livestock grazing, that requirement was not included in the permits. In the late 1980s, a portion of the Santa Maria River received an unplanned reprieve from grazing. The rancher who held the permit went bankrupt and had to sell all his cattle.  The result of 3 years of rest from grazing can be seen in the second photo. These are roughly the same areas. This one looks like a stripped desert; the second is much different. This is a stream bed from the Santa Maria River, showing the natural vegetation and grass that has grown back in the grazing area. The riparian vegetation has begun to return, the stream banks are rebuilding, and the water is cleaner than in other portions of the river.  In the early 1990s, the bankrupt rancher sold out to a new rancher who wanted to restock the river corridor with cattle and start the grazing again in this area. The BLM proposed to transfer the grazing permit to the new rancher with no NEPA analysis; that is, no environmental analysis and no public review. The transferred permit would have had the same terms and conditions and ultimately resulted in the same condition as seen in the before picture.  A number of individuals and organizations challenged the BLM decision to renew these permits without a NEPA review and public comment. As a result of the environmental assessment, the grazing permits on the Santa Maria contain terms and conditions requiring that livestock be kept out of the riparian area during the spring and summer growing seasons. There is now a chance for vegetation to recover and water quality and wildlife to be restored.  The reason this part of the debate is important is it relates directly to the amendment I will offer. If the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico remains in this bill, permit level management changes that I have just described will be much more difficult to obtain.  Let me speak for a minute about section 116 of this bill that I would strike. This is the so-called grazing right. Most Members of the Senate have received letters from virtually every major environmental group in Washington, asking them to join in supporting my amendment to strike section 116. Here is the reason. This is the third attempt in an Interior appropriations bill to allow grazing permits to bypass current environmental regulations. Section 116 allows renewal of grazing permits that expire in fiscal year 2001 under the same old terms and conditions in which the permits were first issued.  Last year, I offered substitute language to similar offerings by the Senator from New Mexico. My languagewould have addressed ranchers' needs for the Bureau to process grazing permits in a timely fashion and in a manner by which ranching operations and financial arrangements would not be needlessly disrupted.  My intent last year was to not only protect the environment but to protect the ranchers, as well, to give them certainty as to when the new permits would be issued, and to also say that, where necessary, the Bureau of Land Management could step in and make the environmental changes to protect an area, changes that could avoid this and result more in this type of situation, which I think most of us would agree is better stewardship of the land.  However, I am pleased to report that my efforts to hold the BLM and their feet to the fire successfully on their own resulted in change. My amendment didn't succeed. But they went on to work to solve the backlog of expiring permits.  The bottom line is this: There is no longer any need whatever for section 116 in this bill.  Let me show a chart in reference to the activity of the Bureau of Land Management. The BLM issued 3,872 fully processed grazing permits and leases in fiscal year 1999. In fiscal year 2000, the Bureau of Land Management is scheduled to issue 2,893 fully processed grazing permits and leases; 1,408 have been holdovers from the previous year, but they, too, will be renewed this year. In fiscal year 2001, the Bureau of Land Management will only be faced with 1,646 permits that have expired, and a small carryover of 484 from the previous year, for a total workload of 2,130 permits in the next fiscal year. This number is fully within the capability of the Bureau of Land Management.  We will hear from the other side, those supporting this environmental rider--that is opposed by virtually every environmental group in the Nation's Capital--that we have to put this rider in place to renew old permits without review because the ranchers and livestock operators cannot be certain that the BLM will meet its obligation to issue the new permits as the old ones expire.  The numbers tell a totally different story: 3,872 permits reviewed and approved by the BLM in 1999; this year, another 2,885; in the year for which we are appropriating, the numbers will be down around the 2,100 range. Clearly, the BLM has the capability to handle many more permit renewals than we envision in the next fiscal year. There is no need for this environmental rider to create exception and to tell the old permit holders they don't have to go through the process. The process is there. It is timely. It will give them the certainty they want about their future. All but 79 of the expiring 2001 permits will be completely processed in 2001.  The BLM has decided to carry over the permits because they concern areas near the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and in the Bookcliffs allotment. Because of the environmental sensitivity of these areas, the Bureau of Land Management will conduct an environmental impact statement instead of the regular environmental assessment.  The question arises, if the BLM will no longer have a backlog of permits, why is there such concern that section 116 be included in this bill? Although that question can be easily reversed, the concern is that section 116 will create incentives for livestock operators to delay renewal of their permits in hopes of avoiding environmental compliance by gaining an automatic renewal of their old permits under the old terms and conditions.  Section 116, as presented in this bill, undercuts meaningful opportunities for public involvement in a range management process. Is that important? Remember the picture from the Santa Maria situation; the BLM didn't come up with policies that resulted in the second photo. The lands lying in rest for 3 years, and public comments, led to changes in permits, which means that instead of desert, we are going to have a very beautiful area, an important area for habitat which is not environmentally damaging.  Section 116 undercuts that opportunity for public comment because it provides for an automatic renewal of the old permit without going through public comment or environmental review. They have to renew under section 116 the old permits under the same terms and conditions for an indefinite period. It effectively eliminates public input into the stewardship of public lands.  The Senators in support of 116 are saying to the people of this country who own these lands all across America: Get out of the way. We don't want you to be part of the process. We don't want you to sit back and determine whether the livestock operator who has been on this land for 10 years has done a good job from an environmental viewpoint.  Frankly, that is why we are here. Those in Congress and in the administration who have responsibility for the management of the land have to leave it to future generations in at least as good shape as we received it. If we cannot take an objective appraisal of how a rancher or livestock operator has managed the land, if we cannot decide that perhaps there needs to be a change because the way he is managing the lands is destroying it, then frankly we are running away from our responsibility.  Section 116 in this bill, which I strike, does exactly that. It takes the public out of the process. It takes the Government, looking at this from an environmental viewpoint, an ecological viewpoint, out of the process. It says it is an automatic renewal, no questions asked or answered. That is why this section 116 is opposed by a wide array of groups, including the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. It is important to note that the League of Conservation Voters views this as a very important vote, as well.  Let me address specifically the situation involving the State of New Mexico. The BLM says that New Mexico, which is the home State of the Senator who has offered this, will process and issue all fiscal year 2001 expiring permits, as well as all carryover permits from fiscal year 2000. So if we hear the argument on the floor that this backlog is hurting the State of New Mexico, the home State of the Senator who offered section 116, the facts don't back it up.  By September 30 of this year, New Mexico is committed to fully processing and issuing all 379 carryover 1999 permits and leases and 179 of the year 2000 permits, for a total of 558. New Mexico plans to issue 192 fiscal year 2000 permits, using Public Law 106-113.  In fiscal year 2001, 221 permits and leases will expire in New Mexico. Like the BLM as a whole, in fiscal year 2001, New Mexico will process and issue all fiscal year 2000 carryover and fiscal year 2001 expiring permits, a total of 413.  This environmental rider, this section, was sold to us in years gone by as a necessity because of the backlog of cases on permits. The argument no longer holds. The BLM is fully capable of issuing new permits after the environmental consideration and public comment period, without hardship to the livestock operators and ranchers.  Let me address one other aspect of this which I think is very important. The reason why section 116 should be stricken from the bill gets to the heart of the question. Assume for a minute that you have a permit for your cattle to graze on public lands. Assume that the permit is about to expire and you are now in a position where you are having a review by the Bureau of Land Management. They come to a conclusion that the way you have used your permit over the last 10 years has been bad, you have damaged the land, you have damaged the water quality, you have destroyed habitat for wildlife, you may have threatened some species that live in that land. So they want to change, in the next permit process, the way that you, for example, graze your cattle. If you remember the example from the previous photograph, the Santa Maria River, they decided at certain times of the year cattle could not graze near the river, for many of the reasons I just explained.  If section 116 goes forward as proposed by the Senator from New Mexico, if there is a dispute between the Bureau of Land Management and the permit owner, all the permit owner needs to do is to appeal the decision by the BLM, and, frankly, he gets to live under the terms of his old permit with no restrictions on when the cattle can graze and no restrictions on activitythat might be damaging to the environment. That is the net effect of section 116, that we allow any bad actors who are destroying the environment on our land, our public land, to continue under the old terms and conditions and not face changes that would be in place.  If section 116 were not part of this bill, the Bureau of Land Management could step in with a full force and effect order and say: Even while we are debating and appealing this question, you have to stop grazing your cattle near these streams and rivers in the summer and spring seasons when the area is the most vulnerable.  The bottom line is, those who support section 116 think environmental concerns should be removed, take second place to moving forward and renewing the old permits. That is the bottom line. That is what this debate is all about. Those who believe, as I do, that this land belongs to us and future generations, that this land is in fact the habitat for many species and wildlife that need to be protected, believe, I hope, section 116 should be stricken.  Aldo Leopold wrote a great book called ``A Sand County Almanac.'' It is one of the classics, legends, when it comes to the West and the environment. This is what he said about the land:       Having to squeeze the last drop of utility out of the land      has the same desperate finality as having to chop up the      furniture to keep warm.  I hope Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, will step back and acknowledge the obvious. The BLM can meet its obligation. It can renew these permits. It can do it in an environmentally sound way. It can leave this land in as good shape as we received it and maybe better. It can leave a legacy to future generations, and even future ranchers, of which they can be proud. We do not need to carve out an exception here. We do not need to walk away from our environmental responsibility. We do not need to take the public out of the process of debating the future of public lands.  A few minutes ago one of my colleagues from Idaho came to the floor, very critical of the Clinton administration because he said they went through a process on roadless lands in the national forests and they were not public enough. The facts are otherwise. There was room for a lot of public comment. But now we are going to hear those who defend section 116 come forward and say: Take the public out of the process. Automatically renew the permits. Don't make the evaluation.  That is shortsighted. That does not meet the standard and test that Teddy Roosevelt and so many others before us established for this Nation. If we do this, we are not managing this land in the best interests of the taxpayers and the best interests of our children and in the best interests of God's creation.                           amendment no. 3810   (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to renewal of grazing                           permits and leases)
