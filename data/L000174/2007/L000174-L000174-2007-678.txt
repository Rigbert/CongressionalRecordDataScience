President, if I might answer that, last month the FBI directed written testimony to the Judiciary Committee. When GAO looked at it, the Department of Justice Inspector General found the numbers had gone way down partly because some of the resources had been converted to other matters. Regarding financial resources, as the distinguished Senator certainly knows, as he is on the Committee on Appropriations, enormous amounts of money were diverted to the very difficult setup of the computer system, the central system, and the FBI. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars literally went down the drain, and they have had to start all over.  I understand from Director Mueller's assertion that there has been an increased number of agents investigating public corruption cases, but it also appears that the resources have not been there.  If they don't want it, send it back to the Treasury. What I am concerned about, I say to my friend from Utah, and he is my friend, I recall in prosecutor days when legislative bodies would say, Boy, we are going to cut down on crime, we are going to give more crimes increased penalties; that will stop crime. And I said, Well, are you going to give us the resources to catch the people? No, we don't have money for that, but we will double the penalty.
