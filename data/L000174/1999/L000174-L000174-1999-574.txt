President, I wonder how this works. Does this mean if we have other amendments on either side that come up, just because somebody is not there to respond to it, does that mean this will now become the procedure to be followed? We will let the proponent speak, and then on Monday the opponents speak?  I ask that because we have to do something to move this on. It is frustrating to the Senator from Vermont, who has canceled all other plans today to be here into the evening, if necessary, to move forward on this bill, in keeping with what the majority leader said he wants done, if he suddenly finds he will be picking and choosing whether anybody can bring up an amendment or not.  If Senators are serious about the amendments, they can come here and offer them. It is more of a question to the distinguished Senator from Utah: Is this going to be the practice, if another Senator brings up an amendment and there is not somebody on the other side, will that Senator bring it up and speak about it, and the other Senator comes back and responds on Monday?
