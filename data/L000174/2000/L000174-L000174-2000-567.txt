President, I wonder if the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Minnesota and I can work together during the break and see if we can reach an area of agreement.  During the last few days of the session, the distinguished Senator from Utah and I, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, worked very hard to whittle down the numbers. The distinguished Senator from Nevada, the Assistant Democratic Leader, was his usual indefatigable self in working, cajoling, pleading, and, when all else failed, threatening to break arms to get rid of amendments. I knew we were successful when I saw so many Members going down to see the orthopedic surgeon in the Capitol physician's office after having a meeting with the Senator from Nevada.  I am also pleased to see my friend from Utah, the distinguished senior Senator, Orrin Hatch, back on the Senate floor. The Senator is not only one of the most gifted legislators in Congress but one of the best known. More important, to me, though, he is one of the closest friends I have had in my 25 years in the Senate. He is such a good friend that while he was campaigning in Iowa, I offered to go out and either speak for or against him, whichever would help the most. Trust me, Mr. President, I have plenty of material either way on that.  I say to Chairman Orrin Hatch, it is good to have you back here.
