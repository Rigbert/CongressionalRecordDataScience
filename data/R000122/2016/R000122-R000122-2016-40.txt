 Forgive me, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, hopefully we are going to pass the resolution that will allow interpreters to come to the United States under a special program.  I have received letters, and correspondence from literally every military leader and diplomatic leader who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record copies of those letters and correspondence.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     Headquarters,                                             Resolute Support,                                 Kabul, Afghanistan, May 20, 2016.     Hon. John McCain,     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my support for      the continuation of the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program.      It is my firm belief that abandoning this program would      significantly undermine our credibility and the 15 years of      tremendous sacrifice by thousands of Afghans on behalf of      Americans and Coalition partners. These men and women who      have risked their lives and have sacrificed much for the      betterment of Afghanistan deserve our continued commitment.      Failure to adequately demonstrate a shared understanding of      their sacrifices and honor our commitment to any Afghan who      supports the International Security Assistance Force and      Resolute Support missions could have grave consequences for      these individuals and bolster the propaganda of our enemies.       During my previous three tours in Afghanistan, I have seen      many Afghans put themselves and their families at risk to      assist our forces in pursuit of stability for their country.      The stories of these interpreters and translators are heart-     wrenching. They followed and supported our troops in combat      at     great personal risk, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of      Coalition members on the ground. Many have been injured or      killed in the line of duty, a testament to their commitment,      resolve, and dedication to support our interests. Continuing      our promise of the American dream is more than in our      national interest, it is a testament to our decency and long-     standing tradition of honoring our allies.       Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from both the Afghan      insurgency and extremist networks. We must remain committed      to helping those Afghans who, at great personal risk, have      helped us in our mission. This is the second year the Afghan      National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) are in the lead      for security. They are fighting hard and fighting well for a      stable, secure Afghanistan. The vast majority of the SIV      applicants have served as interpreters and translators for      our troops. They have exposed themselves and compromised the      safety of their families to provide critical situational      awareness and guidance, both of which have helped save      countless Afghan, American and Coalition lives.       Thank you for your continued support of American troops in      Afghanistan.           Very Respectfully,     John W. Nicholson,       General, U.S. Army, Commander, Resolute Support/United      States Forces--Afghanistan.                                  ____                                                     Headquarters,                            United States Forces--Afghanistan,                                               Kabul, Afghanistan.     Hon. John McCain,     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing you to express my strongest      support for the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program.       Since our arrival in Afghanistan, U.S. Forces have relied      upon our Afghan partners, especially our linguists, to      perform our mission. They have consistently been there with      us through the most harrowing ordeals, never wavering in      their support for our soldiers, our mission, and their own      country. Many have been injured or killed in the line of      duty.       Unfortunately, their support of our mission has resulted in      our Afghan partners facing threats from insurgent groups      throughout the country. They frequently live in fear that      they or their families will be targeted for kidnappings and      death. Many have suffered this fate already. The SIV program      offers hope that their sacrifices on our behalf will not be      forgotten.       After several ups and downs, the program remains an      extremely important way for the United States to protect      those who assisted us. By December 2014, the Department of      State had issued all 4,000 Afghan SIVs allocated under the      Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. As      you know, the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act      provides 4,000 additional SIVs for Afghan applicants. The      State Department's Status of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa      Program report in April 2015 shows there are more than 8,000      SIV applications that have been submitted. Each week, I      receive several personal requests and inquiries from      linguists and others who have worked with, or continue to      work with, U.S. Forces, seeking assistance with the Afghan      SIV program. I inform them how we are working closely with      Congress to obtain adequate SIV allocations each year. This      shows just how important this program remains to our Afghan      partners, as well our own forces.       Since I assumed command of the Resolute Support Mission/     U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, much has changed and the Afghan      National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) are in the lead to      secure the country. We have a willing and strategic partner      whose interests are aligned with our own. The ANDSF is taking      the fight to the enemy this fighting season and are      performing well. Our prospects for long-term success and a      strategic partner have never been better. We would not be in      this position without the support and leadership of the U.S.      Congress, the American people, the men and women who have      served here with distinction, and our Afghan partners.       I urge Congress to ensure that continuation of the SIV      program remains a prominent part of any future legislation on      our efforts in Afghanistan. This program is crucial to our      ability to protect those who have helped us so much.       Thank you for your support for America's Soldiers, Sailors,      Airmen, and Marines.           Sincerely,                                                 John F. Campbell,     General, U.S. Army, Commanding.                                  ____     From: David Petraeus     Date: May 12, 2016.       Dear Chairman, I write to express my support for the Afghan      Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program and to state that      additional SIVs are desperately needed.       Throughout my time in uniform, I saw how important our in-     country allies are in the performance of our missions. Many      of our Afghan allies have not only been mission-essential--     serving as the eyes and ears of our own troops and often      saving American lives--they have risked their own and their      families' lives in the line of duty. Protecting these allies      is as much a matter of American national morality as it is      American national security. I ask for your help in meeting      our obligation by appropriating additional Afghan SIVs to      bring our allies to safety in America.       It is crucial that Congress act to provide additional visas      for the SIV program. The most recent figures from the State      Department suggest that at least 10,000 applicants remain in      the SIV processing backlog; as our troop presence in      Afghanistan continues, we can expect more endangered Afghan      allies to seek our help, adding to the backlog. The      Department of State has indicated that an additional 4,000      Afghan SIVs for the year would allow it to continue to      process and issue visas in Fiscal Year 2017. If this program      falls far short of the need, it will have serious national      security implications.       I am also concerned that Congress may limit eligibility for      SIV applicants. The U.S. military presence in Afghanistan      relies on local partners who serve as translators, security      personnel, and in a multitude of other functions. All of      these individuals are vital to the U.S. mission, whether they      work directly or indirectly with U.S. forces. Afghans who      served the United States in non-military capacities or in      support of the Department of State face serious threats as a      result of their service. They are currently eligible for the      SIV program and their eligibility should remain intact.       Thank you for your support of the Special Immigrant Visa      program. Congress must ensure that the SIV program for our      Afghan allies--one of the only truly non-partisan issues of      the day--meets the needs of those we seek to help.           Sincerely,                                                    Dave Petraeus.  Mr. McCAIN. For the sake of illustration, I would like to quote from a couple of the letters I have. One is from General Nicholson, who today is our commander of resolute support, United States Forces-Afghanistan. I won't read the whole letter, but I would like to quote it because I think it is very compelling.  General Nicholson says:       During my previous three tours in Afghanistan, I have seen      many Afghans put themselves and their families at risk to      assist our forces in pursuit of stability for their country.      The stories of these interpreters and translators are heart-     wrenching. They followed and supported our troops in combat      at great personal risk, ensuring the safety and effectiveness      of Coalition members on the ground. Many have been injured or      killed in the line of duty, a testament to their commitment,      resolve, and dedication to support our interests. Continuing      our promise of the American dream is more than in our      national interest, it is a testament to our decency and long-     standing tradition of honoring our allies.  I would like to repeat General Nicholson's last sentence: ``Continuing our promise of the American dream is more than in our national interest, it is a testament to our decency and long-standing tradition of honoring our allies.''  I could not put it any better than General Nicholson did.  Finally, I would like to quote from a letter by General Campbell, who was his predecessor. General Campbell said:       I am writing you to express my strongest support for the      Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program.       Since our arrival in Afghanistan, U.S. Forces have relied      upon our Afghan partners, especially our linguists, to      perform our mission. They have consistently been there with      us through the most harrowing ordeals, never wavering in      their support of our soldiers, our mission, and their own      country. Many have been injured or killed in the line of      duty.       Unfortunately, their support of our mission has resulted in      our Afghan partners facing threats from insurgent groups      throughout the country. They frequently live in fear that      they or their families will be targeted for kidnappings and      death. Many have suffered this fate already. The SIV program      offers hope that their sacrifices on our behalf will not be      forgotten.  Again, those are two compelling statements.  I will not go further because I see the distinguished Senator from Georgia waiting, but I would like to quote from correspondence from an individual who I think is the finest military leader among the many outstanding military leaders whom I have had the opportunity of knowing. This is from GEN David Petraeus, Retired. It is a letter he wrote. He said:       Throughout my time in uniform, I saw how important our in-     country allies are in the performance of our missions. Many      of our Afghan allies have not only been mission-essential--     serving as the eyes and ears of our own troops and often      saving American lives--they have risked their own and their      families' lives in the line of duty. Protecting these allies      is as much a matter of American national morality as it is      American national security. I ask for your help in meeting      our obligation by appropriating additional Afghan SIVs to      bring our allies to safety in America.  It is signed ``Sincerely, David Petraeus.''  Both of the individuals I just quoted served multiple tours--not one, not two, sometimes as many as five--in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 14 years. These leaders know what the service and sacrifice of these Afghans and Iraqis have provided to our military at the very risk and loss of their lives since they are the No. 1 target of the Taliban in Afghanistan.  I hope my colleagues, by voice vote, will agree to increase the visa program so that we can allow these people to come to the United States of America.  I will end with this. I know that some people come to our country whom we have some doubts about--their citizenship, their commitment to democracy, their adequacy, the kind of people they are.  Well, these people have already proven their allegiance to the United States of America because they have put their lives on the line. Some of them had their family members murdered. I have no doubt as to what kind of citizens of this country they will be.  I believe that an overwhelming majority of my colleagues agree that, as General Nicholson said in his letter, it is a moral obligation. I think we will all feel better after we get this done.  I note the presence of probably the most well-informed Member of the U.S. Senate on budgetary issues, the Senator from Georgia.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Georgia.
