 President, we have many disputes around here over major issues, but I am perplexed by where we are.  What I am trying to do is to offer a complete substitute, the Roberts amendment--and I think everybody understands what that is. I must say I don't think there is a single person in America who would think any of our colleagues over here would vote to defund Planned Parenthood.  We are not trying to trick anybody. We are trying to get to the Roberts amendment, and I am offering a complete substitute for a bill with a title that I don't think sounds particularly offensive from a Democratic point of view. I am perplexed as to what the problem is here.
