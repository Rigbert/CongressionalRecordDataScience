 President, this amendment on behalf of Senator Bennett and myself speaks to a problem that we see with this bill. And that is when you meet with a very small group of people, say, 10 or less, bona fide constituents, no lobbyists present, and you have a sandwich or there is a lunch, somebody puts food in front of you, maybe you eat two bites of it, maybe you don't eat any of it, maybe you eat all of it--we all know we have been through that--you are illegal unless there is some provision that you can accept the lunch.  How many times have I gone to a speaking engagement, got involved, something is put in front of me. I don't touch it or maybe I touch it or maybe something is offered to me, maybe I eat one of it, maybe I eat two of it. It is hard to tell. With respect to these small, bona fide constituent events, one should be able to accept the meal, if one chooses, as long as the value of the meal is under $50. It seems to me that this is a reasonable amendment. The lobbyist is excluded, cannot be present. It is a bona fide constituent event. You can go to them at a Member's home. It can be a coffee. It can be a dinner. They happen all the time. I candidly see nothing wrong with it.  Sometimes you have events where people bring little amounts of food that are shared. To put a pricetag on all of this, to have to decide whether it is de minimis or not, whether it is equal to a baseball cap or a cup of coffee is extraordinarily difficult in the real world where we operate. That is the purpose of this amendment.  I yield to the ranking member.
