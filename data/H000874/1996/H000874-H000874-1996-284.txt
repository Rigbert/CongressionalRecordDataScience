Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me the time.  This is a sad day in the House of Representatives. Amending the Constitution of the United States is a very serious matter. I have voted to amend the Constitution of the United States on a number of occasions. I believe we ought to have a requirement that we will be constrained by our revenues in our expenditures. I believe that deficits eat at our economy and place at risk the next generation. But tonight, in my opinion, is the theater of the irresponsible. I do not see senior Members who have given thoughtful consideration to this speaking very much on this floor on behalf of this amendment. I do not see the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary on the floor as a proponent of this amendment. I did see a distinguished senior member of the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson], say that she believed in democracy, she believed in our Constitution, and unlike many documents, it gave to the people the right to choose.  Perhaps the people sometimes make mistakes, as each of us do, but it gave them that right. It did so for the most part by majority vote. This House, under this leadership, does not trust the people, no matter what it may see, and let me give the examples. We adopted a rule. It said that we could not raise taxes except by a three-fifths vote. We have waived that rule, of course, on a number of occasions when it suited the fancy of the leadership of this House.                              {time}  2045  Seventy-three percent of the bills that have come to this floor have come without a hearing in the substantive committees, out of the Committee on Rules. That shuts the American public out of the decisionmaking process.  One hundred sixty-five legislative riders have been added to appropriations bills without a single hearing on any of those riders.  Term limits. Term limits is a classic ``we don't trust the people.'' We do not trust them to elect the right people. Every 2 years they have that opportunity to choose in a democracy, to send us back or to retire us. But there are some in this body who believe that, no, we do not trust the people to make that decision.  We started this Congress by disenfranchising in the Committee of the Whole the representatives of American citizens from Puerto Rico, from Guam, American Samoa, the District of Columbia. Perhaps we did not trust those people as well.  We passed an amendment through this House, which I opposed, sponsored by the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Ehrlich] and the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook], which said, ``That if you get Federal money to propose a program, if you get money, you cannot spend your own money to advocate issues before the Congress or other political bodies.''  Why does this leadership not trust the people?  The line-item veto was essential, I have been told, over the years, and my friend from Texas, Mr. Stenholmand I agreed that there was a necessity for a process. But it kept even the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature. The line-item veto was essential, but not until January, not in this budget process, my colleagues. The line-item veto would go into effect next year.  My colleagues, Warren Rudman was mentioned. Warren Rudman is a distinguished Republican, a Senator from New Hampshire, not known as a profligate fiscal State. Warren Rudman opposes this amendment. Why does he oppose this amendment? Because he believes, as the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson] believes, that it will undermine, not enhance, the ability of this Nation to democratically and fairly balance the budget, which is our objective and our responsibility.
