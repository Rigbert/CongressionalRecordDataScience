 President, today, I voted for H.R. 4328, the omnibus appropriations bill. I believe that on balance, this legislation will benefit California.  This bill is 4,000 pages, 38 pounds, and stands a foot tall. It appropriates $500 billion, funds a third of the federal government for fiscal year 1999, and includes many pieces of authorizing legislation. My staff reviewed the entire bill yesterday. It includes properly written legislative bill language as well as many hand written changes and amendments. Congressional negotiators, the administration, and many staff members have worked for weeks to finalize this legislation today, but that work was often done behind closed doors without the full review of the Senate.  I do not believe that this is the way the Congress should do its work. Our choice today was to shut down the government or pass this bill.  I want, however, to note that the omnibus bill provides many benefits for Californians.                               education  This bill funds several education initiatives. It includes $1.2 billion to hire teachers and reduce elementary class sizes, an effort already underway in California. This will mean 3,500 new teachers in California. This bill also includes increased funding for Head Start, for Education Reform, for bilingual education, for charter schools, for educational technology and for student financial assistance.  California school enrollment is growing at 3 times the national rate. We need to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the growth in student population. We have students in closets, in cafeterias, in portables. We have some of the largest class sizes in the nation. We have 22,000 teachers on emergency credentials. California ranks last in the nation in the percentage of young adults with a high school diploma. Our students rank 37th in the country in SAT scores.  The California public school system has gone from one of the best, to one of the worse. Mr. President, quite simply, we welcome this assistance for the California education system.  I am disappointed that the bill includes a ``hold harmless'' provision for ESEA Title I.  Title I is the largest federal elementary and secondary education program, providing funds to virtually every school district in the country to educate disadvantaged children. Title I has often been called the ``anchor'' of all elementary and secondary education programs since its enactment in 1965. The bill includes $7.8 billion for Title I grants to school districts. California received $830 million last year.  Unfortunately, the bill includes a 100 percent ``hold harmless'' provision under which no school district would receive an allocation that is less than its allocation of the previous year. But the effect of the hold harmless provision for California, that has had an increase in the number of poor children, is not to receive all of the increase in funding to which we are entitled, entitled by law. Thankfully, the bill does include an ``extra'' $301 million that would provide some funds for high-growth states like mine. California could receive as much as $60 million out of the $301 million. I believe the dollars should go equally to all children in the country based on need.  I call on my colleagues to join me in working to join in an effort to make sure the dollars follow the children.  This Senator pledges to devote every ounce of energy I can muster to help our schools deliver on the promise of opportunity and achievement that America's public schools have always represented and I call on my colleagues to join me today in this campaign.                         california environment  I am pleased that the Omnibus Appropriations bill includes funding for a number of important land acquisition projects in California, including $2 million for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, $1 million for the Santa Rosa Mountains, and $1.5 million for the continued acquisition of Bair Island for the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. While I am pleased that the bill includes $1 million for land acquisition in the Lake Tahoe Basin, I would have preferred to see the $3 million provided by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Lake Tahoe is an important national resource, and we need to make it a higher priority if we are to stem the environmental decline that is already affecting the area. I intend to work with my colleagues to further address the problems of Lake Tahoe in the 106th Congress.  The Salton Sea bill as approved calls for completion of a plan to save the Salton Sea by January 1, 2000. It provides a total of $5 million in additional funds for biological studies and to conduct demonstration projects to clean up the New and Alamo Rivers. These funds, along with an additional appropriation for the Bureau of Reclamation in a separate section of the bill, provide all the money that will be required to prepare a plan and conduct all environmental documentation. As a result, Congress and the President will be able early in the year 2000 to authorize and appropriate funding for a project to save this incredibly valuable resource.                     transportation infrastructure  One of the most important sections of the omnibus appropriations bill provides funding for our nation's roads, airports, and transit systems. This bill will ensure that California's transit systems are more efficient and our roads and airports are safer. The bill will improve the quality of life of California residents by increasing mobility, reducing congestion, and improving the environment.  The bill provides a total of $73 million for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). This includes $62 million for the North Hollywood Red Line extension, $8 million for the Regional Transit Alternative Analysis study for the Mid city and Eastside, and $3 million for the purchase of new clean fuel buses. This funding level will allow the MTA to proceed with its restructuring plan as well as improve bus service and move towards the competition of two important rail links.  The bill also provides $27 million for the Tasman West Rail Extension project. The Tasman West Extension will link the heavily congested residential areas of Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View with the Silicon Valley. The funding in this bill will allow the project to continue without interruption and hopefully will permit it to be completed ahead of schedule and under budget as is now projected.  Other important California rail projects funded in this bill are: $23.48 million for the Sacramento south corridor extension, $3.5 million for the SanDiego Mission Valley and midcoast corridor, $3 million for the Oceanside-Escondido light rail project, $1 million for the San Bernardino Metrolink project, and $500,000 to upgrade the rail line connecting the cities of Riverside and Perris.  The bill also provides almost $420 million in formula grants to California. These grants will fund capital projects and finance improvements in equipment and facilities associated with mass transportation. This is an increase of more than $40 million from Fiscal Year 1998. Included in the formula grants are $171 million for Los Angeles, $98.8 million for San Francisco and Oakland, $35 million for San Diego, and $26 million for San Jose. The bill also provides $6.2 million in grants for the special needs of elderly and disabled people in California and $8.2 million for non-urbanized areas of the state.  Another major component of the transportation appropriations bill is funding for buses and bus facilities. Again, this is very important for California where bus systems play a vital role in the transportation infrastructure of our cities. This bill provides more than $30 million to 30 cities and transportation authorities throughout the state. While I would have preferred to see a higher level of funding for many of these projects, the appropriations in this bill will allow local communities to begin purchasing badly needed fuel efficient buses and improving deteriorating bus facilities.  I am disappointed that the conference committee reduced funding for the Bay Area Rapid Transit extension to the San Francisco Airport to $40 million. This is a dramatic cut from the $100.6 requested by the Administration and will seriously impair BART's ability to complete the project on schedule.  Project construction for the BART/SFO extension is already underway. Contracts for over 90 percent of the construction activity have been awarded totaling $607 million. The State of California has recently agreed to provide an additional $57 million for the project. It is unfortunate that the federal government has failed to demonstrate the same level of commitment to this project that has been shown at the state and local level.  I believe that bringing rapid rail transit to the San Francisco Airport is of critical importance to continued economic viability of the region. I am hopeful that this setback in federal funding will not endanger the project and I will work in the 106th Congress to insure that additional funds are made available.                          Securing the Border  The bill provides $97 million next year for 1,000 additional border patrol agents and 140 support personnel at the border, increasing our ability to interdict illegal aliens at the heaviest alien traffic areas such as the Southwest border. It also provides $21.8 million for interior enforcement, providing the badly needed resources for INS to work with state and local law enforcement against illegal immigration.  I am very pleased by the inclusion in the omnibus package of a number of measures that will have a direct impact on our efforts to prevent illegal narcotics from being transported across the Southwest border. These provisions are good news for California.  I want to thank Senator DeWine and Senator Bob Graham for their many months of leadership in this effort, and for their willingness to work with me to include provisions that will mean fewer drugs on the streets of California.  The supplemental appropriation portion of this bill will increase spending on drug interdiction by a total of $690 million for the current fiscal year. Of that total, $90 million is designated specifically for enhancements at the Southwest border, which is still, without question, ground zero for U.S. drug interdiction efforts. This amount includes $80 million for the U.S. Customs Service to purchase and deploy non-intrusive inspection technology, such as truck X-rays and gamma-imaging for drug interdiction at high-threat seaports and land border ports of entry; and $10 million for INS to purchase and deploy border barrier and surveillance technology, such as effective fences and night-vision scopes.  These funds will make a real difference on the ground. DEA Administrator Tom Constantine recently told me that he estimates that one ton of cocaine is smuggled across the Southwest border each and every day. The smugglers are growing more sophisticated every year, and our agents badly need state-of-the-art technology to counter them, which this bill provides.  In addition, the omnibus package includes the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, of which I was an original cosponsor. This act, which authorizes $2.6 billion over the next three years for enhanced drug interdiction programs, and requires annual regular reports by ONDCP and other drug-fighting agencies on their progress, contains two key provisions which will directly impact Southwest border, and which were included at my request: authorization of funding for the U.S. Customs Service to purchase truck X-rays as part of its 5-year technology plan; and authorization of $50 million for developing and purchasing computer software and hardware to facilitate direct communication between all the agencies that work on drug interdiction at the border.  Technology offers an important way to fight drug smuggling. Improved communication and coordination among our various border enforcement and drug interdiction agencies is another. Without effective interagency communications systems between Customs, INS, the FBI, DEA, and the Border Patrol, our ability to detect drug smugglers and interdict drugs at the border is seriously jeopardized. The funds authorized by this bill will enhance the effectiveness of all these agencies' interdiction efforts. That translates into fewer drugs on our streets.                         Naturalizing Citizens  The Omnibus Appropriation provides $171 million for additional naturalization services of which $11.6 million will be provided specifically for reducing the naturalization backlogs for those localities with backlogs of 15 months or longer. For California, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco along with other counties who currently have a backlog of 2 years may receive the funds to help expedite naturalization applications.                            Methamphetamine  I am very pleased that the Methamphetamine Trafficking Penalty Enhancement Act of 1998 was included in this bill. This provision increases penalties for methamphetamine trafficking, making them roughly equivalent to those for trafficking in crack cocaine. Specifically, it lowers the quantity of meth which qualifies for the highest level of federal drug penalties from 100 grams to 50 grams, the same as for crack. Dealers at this level get a 10 year mandatory minimum sentence for a first offense, a 20 year mandatory minimum for a second offense, and life for a third offense.  Similarly, it also lowers the quantity of meth which qualifies the next-most serious level of federal drug penalties from 10 grams to 5 grams. Again, this is the same quantity as is provided for crack. Dealers of this amount receive a 5 year mandatory minimum for a first offense, and a 10 year mandatory minimum for subsequent offenses.  This provision originally was part of the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, which I wrote with Senators Hatch and Biden. We were forced to drop this provision to pass the bill by unanimous consent that year, and this year it was re-introduced by Senator Ashcroft. I am proud to be the first co-sponsor of Sen. Ashcroft's bill.  Two aspects of methamphetamine make the rapid growth in California especially troubling.  First, meth leads to paranoid, violent, and even bizarre behavior by hardcore users. I will never forget the report of a New Mexico man, high on meth and alcohol, who beheaded his 14-year-old son and threw the head out of the window of his van, on a crowded highway.  Second, meth is cooked in this country in dangerous, clandestine labs, which use highly flammable chemicals, blow up in explosions, and leave toxic, hazardous waste sites, which require environmental cleanup.  This is not a silver bullet which will solve the problem, but it is one more useful step which we can take in this fight.  I am also pleased that this bill contains several appropriations which Iworked for to combat the spread of methamphetamine: $18.2 million for the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement's anti-methamphetamine strategy; $24.5 million to hire 100 new DEA agents to target meth trafficking organizations; and $5 million for hazardous waste cleanup of lab sites.  I am disappointed, however, that the conferees did not support the Senate's appropriation of $15 million for transfer to the Drug Diversion Control Fee Account. The clandestine meth labs operate primarily by converting legitimate pharmaceutical products, such as pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, into meth. The Drug Diversion Control Fee Account supports the DEA's efforts to control the diversion of such legitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit use, and we should provide it with greater support.                         justice appropriations  I am pleased that several programs for which I have worked are fully funded in this bill:  COPS funding 88,000 police officers throughout the country now has $1.4 billion provided in this bill to fund another 17,000, reaching the President's goal of hiring 100,000 police--and exceeding it by 5 percent.  Local Law Enforcement Block Grant continued funding of $523 million for this program, which is important to California's cities and counties who utilize this funding to supplement COPS funding for non-personnel law enforcement expenditures.  $283 million is provided for the Violence Against Women Act, increasing support for these programs. I have heard from women's organizations in support of funding for battered woman's shelters and other support services. California sorely needs these resources.  The President's budget request of $95 million for at-risk children's prevention programs is fully funded, as I requested. With a growing adolescent population, California needs continued funding of anti-truancy, mentoring, and curfew initiatives.  A total of $40 million is provided in various ways for the successful Weed and Seed program. Criminal gang activity is a severe problem in many California cities and localities, and many of these California gangs spread their criminal activity to other states. I am committed to curbing the growth of gangs, and Weed and Seed prevention funds are essential to that effort. I have heard from a number of California mayors, including Mayor Omar Bradley from Compton, who support the program and expanded funding.  Another $12 million is provided for prevention efforts to combat youth gangs, under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.                   Terrorism and technology programs  This bill also provides for several programs which were of particular interest to me as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information of the Judiciary Committee;  Extensive funding is provided for a variety of programs to combat terrorism and to be prepared to meet the threat which this form of evil poses, including: $145 million for the counterterrorism fund, $135 million for state and local preparedness for the threat of chemical and biological weapons, including: personnel protective gear, communications equipment, decontamination equipment, training, needs assessment, technology development; and bomb technician equipment. It also includes: $10 million for the National Critical Infrastructure Protection Center, $282 million to the FBI for counter-terrorism and foreign counterintelligence investigations.  $23.4 million is authorized from Justice's asset forfeiture fund to support more efficient use of the communications spectrum by law enforcement. The need to have adequate spectrum available for law enforcement is a particular concern of local law enforcement leaders from California. Enabling more efficient use of the available spectrum will help to address this concern.                            crime prevention  This bill also provides for several California programs to reduce crime which I have supported, including:  State Criminal Alien Assistance Program: I am particularly pleased that continued funding of $585 million to reimburse states and localities for the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens is provided, restoring the $50 million which had been cut by the Senate. This is particularly important to California, which bears the lion's share of the burden of incarcerating criminal aliens. This, however, is still not sufficient to meet the costs borne by the states and localities, and I will continue to work in the future for this program.  Delancy Street Foundation/Criminal Justice Council Juvenile Justice initiative received $750,000 earmarked for this public-private comprehensive effort designed to interrupt the cycle of chronic crime and transform a young person's negative cycle to a positive one by providing major life-altering interventions at continuous points. This program can serve as a model for the rest of the nation in simultaneously decreasing juvenile crime and providing new and real opportunities for youths.  Compton's crime problems merit special consideration and treatment. According to Mayor Omar Bradley, there are 9,000 suspected gang members in Compton, amounting to ten percent of the City's population. Compton's homicide rate is nearly 10 times that of similar sized cities in the Southeast L.A. area, with more homicides in January alone (14) than 23 of the other 27 cities had in all of 1996. Seventy-six percent of suspected homicide offenders were under the age of 27. The report directs the Justice Department to consider grants to help fight this uniquely severe crime problem by upgrading Compton's woefully outdated police computer system and by establishing a Compton Youth Intervention Center for afterschool programs to serve as a safe haven for 1,000 youth.  My colleagues from California, Senator Boxer, and I jointly requested this $2 million earmark to support this proven, successful initiative that has already helped over 12,000 California police officers better understand how they can promote tolerance and reduce prejudice in their workplaces and communities. With this additional funding, the Center can implement its plan to conduct four-day workshops to train tolerance instructors from police Departments from around the country on how to control prejudice and hate crimes. These officers will then be able to go back to their communities and teach other officers how to combat prejudice and bias.  The overwhelmed 911 emergency response system has prompted cities around the nation to experiment with a 311 non-emergency number to relieve the burden and improve access to emergency assistance. The 311 telephone system would allow police departments such as Los Angeles' to free officers from the burden of responding to non-emergency 911 calls and gives the community an easy-to-remember link to the police, thus strengthening community policing. The conference report supports the use of funds for non-emergency numbers such as 311.                            cancer research  The bill also includes $2.9 billion for the National Cancer Institute, a 15 percent increase. Cancer afflicts 1.2 million Americans each year. Cancer will kill 1,500 people a day this year. But we currently invest less than 2 percent of cancer's health care costs in research to find a cure and treatments. NCI can currently only fund 28 percent of grants, less than one-third approved for funding.  In the September 25 hearing of the Senate Cancer Coalition, Dr. Allen Lichter, President of the American Society for Clinical Oncology said, ``It often takes several years to get a clinical cancer trial activated from the idea stage to the point of involving patients because of insufficient funds. For every clinical trial that gets activated, there are many worthwhile trials sitting undone.''  I submit that this is not a vigorous war on cancer, when we are funding less than one-third of grants proposed.                         BREAST RECONSTRUCTION  I am also pleased that the bill includes language requiring insurance plans that cover mastectomies to also cover breast reconstruction and prostheses. The language in this bill is taken from S. 249, a bill that I introduced with Senator D'Amato on January 30, 1997. One study found that 84 percent of patients were denied insurance coverage for reconstruction of the removed breast, calling it ``cosmetic.'' Plans have arbitrarily denied this very necessary surgery, to make a woman whole. Twelve states require coverageof breast reconstruction, including my own, but we need a national standard. This provision can bring hope and help restore self-esteem to thousands of women who lose their breast to breast cancer every year.                  PROTECTING CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY  The Omnibus Appropriations bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take steps to protect children's privacy on the Internet, similar to provisions authored by Senator Feinstein in S. 504, the Children's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment bill. Specifically, the Omnibus bill directs the FTC to require commercial website operators to follow fair information practices in collecting and using personal information from children age 12 and under. Commercial websites must obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children. States are authorized to enforce the regulations. The bill further directs the FTC to provide incentives for self-regulation by operators to protect such information. The FTC is required to report to Congress on the implementation of the regulations.                           EMPOWERMENT ZONES  I am also pleased that the bill includes $60 million in social services grant funding for a second round of 20 urban and rural empowerment zones. The empowerment zone concept has shown great promise in promoting economic development in some of our nation's income communities. I know of a number of California communities who are applying for empowerment zone designation in this latest round, and if selected, this funding will enable them to attract business to their area and prepare residents for jobs.                            NEW COURTHOUSES  The bill includes funding to acquire sites for two new Federal courthouses, in San Jose and San Diego. These courthouses are badly needed to relieve the pressure of rising criminal, civil, and bankruptcy case filings. The bill includes $15.4 million to purchase land for the new courthouse in San Diego, and $10.8 million to purchase land for the new courthouse in San Jose.  The Omnibus Appropriations include $36 million for the State of California, pursuant to the agreement worked out between the state and the federal government to settle California's claim to lands that were located in the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve. This funding has been a bipartisan priority for California's entire delegation, and I am pleased to see that it was included in the final bill.                         INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS  The international affairs provisions of this omnibus package contain a number of important steps forward in stabilizing the global economy and combating the scourge of international drug trafficking.  I am pleased that our colleagues in the House finally saw the wisdom of providing the $17.9 billion to the International Monetary Fund that the President requested. These funds are among the best investments we can ever make. In 1998, we have seen economies across Asia and Latin America and in Russia go into virtual free fall. And if there is one principle of the global economy today, it is that economic turmoil abroad is sure to affect us here at home.  When the currencies of our trading partners fall through the floor, as we have seen repeatedly this year, they are unable to purchase U.S. exports. That translates into lost American jobs, as our producers discover that there is no one overseas to buy their products. The funds we are providing the IMF in this bill, and the additional funds they will leverage from other donors, will help to stabilize the economies of our trading partners, protecting our export markets from further collapse, and saving U.S. jobs. In a state with an export-driven economy like California, this is good news. The IMF reforms called for in this bill that will ensure greater transparency and more market-based lending practices are helpful, but the most important news is that the IMF's coffers will be replenished, allowing it to provide further assistance to vulnerable economies around the world.  The Foreign Operations Appropriations section of this bill also includes an important earmark, which I want to highlight: $75 million in economic assistance to Indonesia. I do not think that most Americans appreciate the strategic and economic significance of Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world. Indonesia's status as the political and economic anchor of Southeast Asia make the economic and political crisis there that much more serious. The assistance that will be provided by this act--as directed by policy language in the bill which I authored--will help alleviate the most severe suffering and food shortages in Indonesia, while helping to ease the transition to a more democratic form of government and the reform of the Indonesian economy.  An important component of restoring social and economic stability to Indonesia is ensuring that all Indonesians, including minority ethnic groups, are protected and able to participate fully in the society. For that reason, I am pleased that the bill includes a provision I offered directing the President to assist the Indonesian government and appropriate non-governmental organizations in their investigation of the brutal violence and rapes against Indonesian Chinese in May of this year. In six months we will receive a report from the Administration on the findings of these investigations, and the steps taken by the Indonesian government to punish the perpetrators of the violence and protect Indonesian Chinese from its repetition.                     state department authorization  Let me say a word about the State Department Authorization portion of this bill, which contains some important progress, but also one major disappointment. I am pleased that after nearly four years of back-and-forth haggling, the State Department reorganization plan--now agreed to by the Administration and the Congress--can proceed. It should help to streamline our foreign affairs agencies and reduce unnecessary duplication of effort. In addition, I am pleased that the bill includes a provision I authored which will allow us to increase pressure on alien parents who abduct American citizen children from an American parent with legal custody by allowing us to deny visas to those who support the abducting parent.  But something very important is missing from this section of the bill: authorization to pay off our arrears to the United Nations. Unbelievably, the Republican leadership has acceded to the wishes of a tiny minority of their caucus, which has insisted on perpetuating an artificial link between paying U.N. arrears and international family planning assistance. Despite broad agreement on a three year plan to pay off our U.N. arrears while the U.N. conducted significant reforms a group of hardline House members have chosen to hold these arrears hostage to their agenda on a wholly unrelated, essentially domestic issue: abortion.  Under the false impression that by weakening our international family planning programs with Mexico City restrictions, they could prevent abortions--in fact, they would do the opposite, depriving many women of contraceptives and thereby leading to more abortions--these Members have insisted on weakening the United States' international reputation and the United Nations, causing great harm to our foreign policy interests.  This tactic is utterly irresponsible, and yet, the Republican leadership has gone along with it. They will send this bill without U.N. arrears, and the President will sign it. Then they will send the free standing bill which contains U.N. arrears, but also contains Mexico City restrictions, and, as we all know, the President will veto it. And although the United States will, by the skin of our teeth, avoid losing our vote in the U.N. General Assembly for non-payment of arrears--postponing the crisis for one year--we will have to begin this effort all over again next year. Our foreign policy interests will be placed at further risk, all for the sake of a political point about abortion. And though I will vote for this bill, I am deeply distressed by the failure to include authorization to pay our U.N. arrears. It is a mistake that I believe we will regret.
