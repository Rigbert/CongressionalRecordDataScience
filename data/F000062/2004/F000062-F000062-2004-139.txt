 President, I thank my colleagues for the discussion. The discussion shows how rapidly we are doing something about all the ramifications we may not know. This concerns me greatly.  This amendment is a simple amendment. It simply extends the grandfather clause and secures the telecommunications areas for those cities and States that have been using this methodology for revenue raising for years. In California, in 1999, the amount was $802 million that came from this area. For Los Angeles, in 1 year it is $40 million.  I hope Members of this body would be willing to move the 2-year grandfather clause to 4 years. This gives an opportunity for this to be sorted out. There is a Ninth Circuit Court opinion affecting DSL and cable. No one knows how that will sort itself out because it just came out a few weeks ago. The legislation may well be affected by it.  All I am asking is, make the grandfather clauses in both areas even. Raise the 2-year in this one--which affects the local exchange of telecommunications--to 4 years.  I yield the floor.
