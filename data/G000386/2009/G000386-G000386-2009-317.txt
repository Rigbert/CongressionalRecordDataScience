 President, I wish to visit with you about voluntarism. I wish to use the example of a deceased Boy Scout as the perfect example.  Today is the day we Iowans honor the life and legacy of a young Boy Scout--a compassionate teenager who lived his life in passionate service to others. Mr. President, 14-year-old Aaron Eilerts from Eagle Grove, IA, tragically lost his own life last summer when a deadly tornado swept through Camp Little Sioux on January 11, 2008. One Iowan, Aaron, and three Nebraska boys lost their lives that evening.  Fifteen years ago today, Bob and Carol Eilerts experienced the overwhelming joy and elation that parents treasure the day their child is born. The Eilerts undoubtedly took pride in shouldering the responsibilities and sacrifices that parenthood brings. It was not long before his parents would realize their beloved son spread joy in service to others, in ways big and small, with family, friends, neighbors, the elderly, and even total strangers.  As a Boy Scout, Aaron took to heart the tenets of his organization. Through words and deeds, he upheld the Boy Scout Law, which prescribed a Scout as ``trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.'' Every Boy Scout knows those words.  By all accounts, Aaron Eilerts lived and breathed the objectives of an honorable Boy Scout, which included character development, citizenship, and personal fitness. As a parent and grandparent, I can appreciate the demands placed on our youth to excel in academics, navigate social pressures, participate in extracurricular activities, and to just ``be.''  Similar to many young people growing up in small town Iowa, Aaron's extensive list of activities was impressive. Besides the Humboldt Boy Scout Troop 108, Aaron participated in football, cross country, track, band, choir, theater, and art. Aaron also was an agent of the CIA; that is, ``Character in Action,'' a youth leadership character-building organization at Robert Blue Middle School. With so many irons in the fire, it is even more remarkable to consider the time and energy Aaron devoted in service to others.  Consider a few of the community service projects this industrious 14-year-old organized: hand-sewing pillowcases for pediatric patients, teachers, and others in need; making blankets for animals at the Humane Society; volunteering at the local senior center and nursing home; performing the National Anthem at local high school events; and making it a habit to do great deeds and simple acts of kindness just to make his community a better place to live.  We can honor his legacy of service by following in the footsteps of this local teenage legend. The Governor of Iowa, Chet Culver, has proclaimed today, February 24, as the first annual Aaron Eilerts Day of Service and Giving. Scores of schools and service organizations across the State of Iowa have made plans to participate. Inspired by this young man's spirit of service, thousands of school students across Iowa will seize this opportunity to make their community a better place.  Just a few of the service projects underway today include shoveling snow; sewing pillowcases to donate to hospitals, veterans facilities, and nursing homes; creating fleece tie blankets for shelters; packaging meals in a box for local food pantries; conducting food and diaper services and drives that are connected with that; and pumping gas and cleaning windshields at local service stations.  The Bible tells us in Acts 20:35:       It is more blessed to give than receive.  Many of us who contribute time, talents, and treasure in service to others often find we are the ones who are blessed by giving. If I may suggest, I believe Aaron Eilerts, if he were alive today, would agree.  Although he did not share the world stage of Mother Teresa, who devoted her life to poverty in service to others, Aaron showed his compassion for others on the stages of his hometown, from the senior centers, to hospitals, school and community events. Mother Teresa is attributed with an observation that applies so well to this young man from Eagle Grove. Mother Teresa said:       Do not wait for leaders. Do it alone, person to person.  Aaron Eilerts was a product of small-town Iowa--a small town that took pride in its community, and he took pride in his community. Eagle Grove takes pride in this young man, Aaron Eilerts, who was killed last June.  I would like to extend, again, my sincerest condolences to the family and loved ones Aaron Eilerts has preceded into God's Kingdom. I also would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation to my fellow citizens from the other 49 States. I welcome you to join the State of Iowa, and Iowans generally, next year on February 24 to participate in the annual Aaron Eilerts Day of Service and Giving, as declared by Governor Culver of my State of Iowa.  Tragic circumstances abbreviated the life of this young Iowan with no warning and with no opportunity for second chances.  Let Aaron's life and legacy of service inspire each of us to respond in our own neighborhoods and communities to the call of service of giving.                          ____________________
