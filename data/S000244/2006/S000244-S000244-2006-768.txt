Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Senate 2271, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006. On December 14 of last year, the House passed the conference report on H.R. 3199, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, by a strong bipartisan vote of 251-174. Last Thursday, the other body followed the bipartisan lead of this House and approved the conference report by an overwhelming vote of 89-10.  When the House Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the PATRIOT Act a month after the 9/11 attacks, I pledged to vigorously examine its implementation to ensure that enhanced law enforcement authority is required to reduce America's vulnerability that terrorism did not erode our constitutional or civil liberties.  As the historical record makes amply clear, it was the House, led by former majority leader Dick Armey and me, that forcefully insisted that much of the PATRIOT Act's expansion of law enforcement authority sunset without affirmative congressional reauthorization.  These sunsets helped complement aggressive Congressional oversight of the implementation of the PATRIOT Act. The conference report now passed by both houses represents the product of comprehensive bipartisan consideration consisting of legislative and oversight hearings, briefings, and inspector general reports and committee correspondence. This extensive record, a chronology of which I will submit for the Record, has demonstrated that the PATRIOT Act has been an effective tool against terrorists and other criminals.  At the same time, intense congressional and public scrutiny has not produced a single substantiated claim that the PATRIOT Act has been misused to violate American civil liberties. However, the conference report contained over 30 important civil liberties amendments and revisions revised to further mitigate the potential for misuse of the PATRIOT Act.  This bill includes three additional clarifications of the conference report to address concerns raised by some Members of the other body.  First, current law does not expressly provide a recipient of a section 215 order or a national security letter theright to challenge it. The conference report clearly delineated judicial review for such challenges, including the ability of NSL recipients to challenge an accompanying nondisclosure order. S. 2271 would extend the section 215 recipients similar access to judicial review, to challenge and attach the nondisclosure order.  Second, because of national security concerns, the conference report contained language that would allow the government to ask a recipient of one of these national security orders to identify the persons to whom disclosure will be or was made. The Director of National Intelligence expressed concern that without this safeguard, a recipient could disclose the government's investigative efforts to a person with ties to hostile foreign governments or entities.  The conference report permitted the government to determine whether a request is warranted, and if the defendant has made such a request to determine whether the disclosure affected an ongoing investigation. An exception was included for information that might interfere with attorney-client relations, specifically barring the disclosure of the identity of an attorney to whom a recipient planned to disclose. This bill extends the exception to prevent the government from requesting the name of counsels with whom the recipient had already consulted.  Finally, S. 2271 clarifies current law that a library may only be subject to an NSL request if it falls under 18 U.S.C. 2516(15), which defines an electronic communications service provider as any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communication. This change addresses the potential for misuse alleged by critics of the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, over the last 5 years, the PATRIOT Act has been the focus of virtually unprecedented congressional and public scrutiny. Opponents of this legislation have relied upon exaggeration and hyperbole to distort a demonstrated record of accomplishment and success.  The Justice Department and other agencies have properly used the PATRIOT Act to detect, disrupt and dismantle sales in New York, Virginia and Oregon before they struck. The PATRIOT Act helped tear down the pre-9/11 wall that prevented law enforcement intelligence agencies from sharing critical information necessary to avert terrorist attacks on American soil.  It has become a critical tool of America's law enforcement arsenal and a vital deterrent against terrorist subversion. It upheld our constitutional values, and none of the provisions authorized by the conference report have been held unconstitutional.  Simply stated, the PATRIOT Act has made America safer while safeguarding our civil liberties. The conference report contained provisions to address claims that the PATRIOT Act might be misused to violate civil liberties, and Senate 2271 contains additional provisions to further allay these concerns. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and look forward to the eminent enactment of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 into law.

Additional Civil Liberties Protections Contained in the Conference  Report on H.R. 3199, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization                               Act of 2005       The conference report contains the following additional      safeguards:       Requires a description of a specific target in both the      application and the court order for ``roving wiretaps,'' and      specific facts in the application that show that the target's      actions may thwart surveillance efforts--if the target's true      identity is unknown.       Requires that the FBI must notify the court within 10 days      after beginning surveillance of any new phone for all      ``roving wiretaps.'' The notice must include the total number      of electronic surveillances conducted under the court's      multipoint order.       Includes new reporting requirements to Congress, including      new details about the use of ``roving'' authority.       Requires that for delayed notice search warrants that      notice of the search be given within 30 days of its      execution, unless the facts justify a later date, eliminating      the open-ended period of delay permissible under current law.       Allows for extensions of the delay period in giving notice      of a search, but only upon an updated showing of the need for      further delay. Also, it limits any extension to 90 days or      less, unless the facts of the case justify a longer delay.       Adds new reporting requirements to Congress on the use of      delayed notice search warrants.       Requires for section 215 orders, relating to investigator's      access to business records, a statement of facts showing      reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other      things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation to      protect against international terrorism or espionage. This      provides additional safeguards to the original USA PATRIOT      Act, which required the government only to certify that the      records at issue were sought for an authorized      investigation--without any factual showing.       Requires a three part test for section 215 orders that      ensures the records are sought for: a foreign power or an      agent of a foreign power; the activities of a suspected agent      of a foreign power who is the subject of an authorized      investigation; or an individual in contact with, or known to,      a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of an      authorized investigation. This test combined with the newly      required statement of facts should mitigate concerns of      government ``fishing expeditions,'' while maintaining the      flexibility for legitimate terrorism investigations.       Explicitly guarantees the right for recipients of section      215 orders to consult legal counsel and seek judicial review.       Requires high level approval by either the FBI Director,      Deputy Director, or Executive Assistant Director for requests      for certain records, including library records, medical      records, educational records, and tax return records.       Limits the scope of section 215 orders to materials that      could be obtained via grand jury subpoena or a similar court      order for the production of records.       Limits retention, and prohibits dissemination, of      information concerning U.S. persons.       Requires that the DOJ Inspector General conduct two      separate audits of the FBI's use of section 215 orders that      will examine: any noteworthy facts or circumstances relating      to 215 orders, including any improper or illegal use of the      authority; the manner in which such information is collected,      retained, analyzed, and disseminated by the FBI; and an      assessment of whether the minimization procedures protect the      constitutional rights of United States persons.       Requires enhanced reporting to Congress of section 215      orders, including a breakdown of its use to obtain library      records, medical records, educational records, and other      sensitive types of records.       Requires public reporting of the aggregate use of section      215 orders.       Allows recipients of National Security Letters (NSLs) to      consult with legal counsel.       Creates an explicit right to judicial review of NSL      requests.       Permits a reviewing court to modify or set aside an NSL if      compliance would be unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise      unlawful--this is the same standard used to modify or quash a      subpoena in a criminal case.       Provides for judicial review of the nondisclosure      requirements.       Adds a ``knowing and willfully'' standard that must be      proven before someone who discloses an NSL can be subject to      a 1-year misdemeanor offense.       Requires the DOJ IG to conduct two comprehensive audits of      the FBI's use of NSLs.       Requires the Attorney General and the Director of National      Intelligence to submit to Congress a report on the      feasibility of applying minimization procedures to NSLs to      ensure the protection of constitutional rights of U.S.      persons.       Adds a new ``sunshine'' provision that requires annual      public reporting on NSLs.       Provides for expanded congressional access to significant      FISA reporting currently provided to the Intelligence      Committees.       Includes a provision requiring the FISA Court to submit its      rules & procedures to Congress.       Creates new reporting requirements for the use of emergency      authorities under FISA.       Requires new reporting on the use of emergency disclosures      of communications information made under section 212 of the      USA PATRIOT Act.       Requires the Department of Justice to submit a report to      Congress on the Department's data-mining activities.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
