President, I have a number of things to address. I have been listening with great interest to my very good friend from North Dakota. I bow to his superior knowledge in economics. I was not aware that he was a professor of economics, or taught economics. They say confession is good for the soul. I will say to my friend from North Dakota, I went to nine different colleges and universities, all of them night school where I was stationed when I was in the military. I remember once I got out I backed a truck up to the University of Tulsa and shoved off all my transcripts, and they looked at it and said: You are an economist. So that is where I got my background in economics.
