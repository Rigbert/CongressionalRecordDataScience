Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2116, the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act of 1996. As a conferee on this legislation, I am grateful the Senate accepted one particular provision, my proposal to add bronchiolo alveolar carcinoma to the Department of Veterans Affairs presumption list for radiogenic cancers.  For the last ten years, I have worked to add this lung cancer to the VA's presumption list for service-connected veterans. During the 104th and 105th Congresses, the House passed my legislation to add this cancer to the VA's presumption list. This year, we have convinced our Senate colleagues of the need to put this provision into law because of the VA's continual denial of most claims by atomic veterans and their survivors.  Bronchiolo alveolar carcinoma is not considered a smoker`s cancer. During a recent class action lawsuit in the state of Florida, the jury specifically excluded bronchiolo alveolar carcinoma from the list of lung cancers compensable due to smoking. Furthermore, the National Research Council cited Department of Energy studies in the BEIR V report stating that ``bronchiolo alveolar carcinoma is the most common cause of delayed death from inhaled plutonium 239.''  I know of this firsthand because I have been working with Joan McCarthy, a New Jersey resident, who lost her husband, Tom, to bronchiolo alveolar carcinoma in 1981. Tom had served as the navigator on the U.S.S. McKinley which participated in Operation Wigwam, an underwater atomic test in the Pacific that produced a surge of mist which Tom inhaled. Twenty-five years later, Tom died of lung cancer, a father and husband who was only in his early forties. Passage of the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act today will add this cancer to the VA's presumption list and thus ensure that Joan McCarthy and other veterans and their widows receive the compensation which they need and deserve.  I am also proud of this bill's long-term care provisions for our nation's veterans. It reflects the months of heavy lifting that the House Veterans' Affairs Committee has done on this issue as America's veterans community gets older and consequently needs quality health care.  Another provision which I authored as free standing legislation and is now in the conference report is a respite care provision. For the first time, we are giving the VA the ability to contract out for respite care services. Until now, if a veteran's care giver, be it his spouse or adult child, needed a short break, their only recourse was to wait for a bed to be made available at either a VA or state nursing home. The extra burden of transporting the veterans almost makes this self-defeating and it is witnessed by the fact that only 232 cases of respite care were provided by the VA during the 1998 fiscal year.  The need for respite care cannot be underestimated. A few years ago, my wife, Marie,was the primary care giver for my mother who was dying of brain cancer. We chose to take care of her in our home and my wife was the one who saw to her needs. Consequently, I know how important it is for the care giver, as well as the veteran, to be provided with the occasional day off so that they might attend to their own lives for a few hours or a few days. In the long run, this will significantly improve the quality of life and care of our veterans and unquestionably save the VA money in the long run. Most Americans want to remain in their own homes or with their families for as long as possible.  The benefits of respite care cannot be understated. According to the Caregiver Assistance Network, family and volunteer caregivers provide 85% of all home care given in the United States. However, our veterans' caregivers need our help. In a California statewide survey taken by the Family Caregiver Alliance, 58% of the caregivers showed signs of clinical depression. When asked, they responded that their two greatest needs were emotional support and respite care. On average, they are providing 10.5 hours of care per day. Providing the VA with the ability to contract with the nearest nursing home, adult day care center or sending someone to the veterans' home will make a real difference in the day to day quality of life for a veteran and his or her family.  The Veterans Millennium Health Care Act also requires the VA to provide needed nursing home care for veterans who are 70% service-connected or in need of such care for a service-connected condition. It also lifts the VA's six month limit on adult day health care and it allows the VA to expand the scope of the state home program to encompass all extended care services such as respite care, adult day health care, domiciliary care, and other alternatives to institutional care. It also guarantees emergency care for uninsured veterans and reinstates preferential eligibility for recipients of the Purple Heart. It also requires the VA to establish a policy regarding chiropractic treatment, a provision which I first introduced as legislation during my first term in Congress. And finally, it authorizes payments to the surviving spouses of former POWs who were rated totally disabled due to any service-connected cause for a period of one or more years immediately prior to death.  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act.                          ____________________
