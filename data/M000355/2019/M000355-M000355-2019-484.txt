Res. 368       Whereas, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of      the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs      conducted an investigation into China's impact on the U.S.      education system;       Whereas, the Subcommittee has received a request from the      U.S. Department of Education for access to records of the      Subcommittee's investigation;       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United      States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate      can, by administrative or judicial process, be taken from      such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or      in the possession of the Senate is needed for the promotion      of justice, the Senate will take such action as will promote      the ends of justice consistent with the privileges of the      Senate: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of      the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee      on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, acting      jointly, are authorized to provide to the U.S. Department of      Education and other regulatory agencies, law enforcement      officials, and entities or individuals duly authorized by      Federal or State governments, records of the Subcommittee's      investigation into China's impact on the U.S. education      system.    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution on documentary production by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. President, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs recently conducted an investigation into China's impact on the U.S. education system. The Subcommittee has now received a request from the U.S. Department of Education seeking access to records that the Subcommittee obtained during the investigation.  In keeping with the Senate's practice under its rules, this resolution would authorize the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, acting jointly, to provide records, obtained by the Subcommittee in the course of its investigation, in response to this request and requests from other Federal or State government entities and officials with a legitimate need for the records.                          ____________________
