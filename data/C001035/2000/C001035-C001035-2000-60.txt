President, it is my understanding that Senator Enzi is speaking in favor of PNTR. I just agreed to have Senator Sarbanes precede my speaking on PNTR despite the fact that it was a far more lengthy statement, although a very well-reasoned one, and Senator Kyl has been waiting for several hours to speak.  I renew my unanimous-consent request.
