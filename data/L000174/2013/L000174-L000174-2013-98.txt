President, today, we will vote on two of the      district court nominations pending before the Senate. While I      am glad we are considering these important nominations today,      I hope that this needless government shutdown soon comes to      an end so the Senate can tend to the business of the country,      including ensuring that our courts have the judges they need.       Colin Bruce is nominated to serve on the U.S. District      Court for the Central District of Illinois. Mr. Bruce is a      lifelong Federal prosecutor who has served in the U.S.      Attorney's Office for the Central District of Illinois for      nearly 25 years. He has served as the first assistant U.S.      attorney since 2010. He has extensive experience in Federal      court and has handled over 600 cases, including 60 jury      trials, 3 bench trials, and 80 appeals involving a broad      range of issues such as drugs, fraud, national security, and      cyber crime.       Sara Ellis is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court      for the Northern District of Illinois. Ms. Ellis works in      private practice in Chicago and also serves as an adjunct      professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. She has      substantial experience litigating in the civil and criminal      context, having previously worked as a staff attorney for the      Federal Defender Program and as an attorney for the city of      Chicago Department of Law. Over her 18-year legal career, she      has tried 11 cases to verdict.       Both of the nominees have the bipartisan support of their      home State Senators, Mr. Durbin and Mr. Kirk. They were      reported by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote more than 2      months ago. While I am pleased that we are finally getting to      vote on these nominees, voting on just 2 of the 13 judicial      nominees currently pending on the floor is not enough to make      real progress in reducing the vacancies on our Federal      courts. Our Federal judicial vacancies currently number more      than 90, including 39 that have been designated as emergency      vacancies due to high caseloads by the nonpartisan      Administrative Office of the Courts. There is no good reason      for us to not get back to what used to be the regular order      in the Senate of taking up and confirming consensus nominees      within days of being reported out of committee. We need to      get these talented men and women off the Senate calendar and      into the courtroom so they can get to work on behalf of the      American people.                          Government Shutdown
