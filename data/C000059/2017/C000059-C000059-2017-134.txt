Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to Riverside County, California, are exceptional. Last month, Daryl Busch completed his service on the Board of Directors of the Southern California Regional Rail Authority (``Metrolink''). He began his service on the Board in January of 2005 and served as Vice Chair between the years of 2015 and 2016.  Daryl Busch brought valuable expertise to the Board through his service as Mayor of the City of Perris and commissioner of the Riverside County Transportation Commission. Daryl ushered in a new era of service that included a fourteen percent service expansion, the introduction of express trains, bike cars, quiet cars, service to sporting events throughout the region, and increased coordination with other regional transit providers including airports. During Daryl's service at Metrolink, major capital projects were pursued including the procurement of the Guardian Fleet, the new Tier 4 locomotives, development of the Ground Power Plug-In program, Positive Train Control and Perris Valley Line Expansion.  Daryl brought a tremendous amount of passion and enthusiasm to the agency, as he helped increase ridership on Metrolink, resulting in reductions in traffic congestion and air emissions, and providing Southern California commuters with a safe, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective means to travel. Daryl also helped institute an enhanced safety culture at Metrolink; he was essential to the implementation of lifesaving equipment onboard Metrolink trains such as crash energy management technology and inward and outward facing cameras.  I have had the privilege of knowing Daryl Busch for many years. Daryl's contributions to the Metrolink system have generated an admirable legacy as well as many friends and colleagues that will miss him. I applaud Daryl's service and I will truly miss working with him. His service and his achievements will have a longstanding and truly positive impact on our community.                          ____________________
