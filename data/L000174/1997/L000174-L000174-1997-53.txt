President, I rise today to comment on a bill which will amend the act of incorporation of the American Legion. I have introduced this bill with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.  Last year, Congress expanded the dates of the Vietnam war for purposes of veterans benefits by shifting the official start of the war from December 22, 1961, to February 28, 1961. The bill before the Senate makes a similar change in the Legion's charter. When we pass this into law the Legion will be able to extend membership to those men and women who served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces during the early years of the Vietnam war. I am hopeful that we can pass it by unanimous consent today, and have it signed into law by the President before we adjourn for the year.  Mr. President, this modest change will mean a lot to the veterans from that period who wanted the opportunity to join the American Legion but never could. They have waited for more than 35 years to have the privilege of becoming Legionnaires. We should not make them wait one day longer.  I yield the floor.
