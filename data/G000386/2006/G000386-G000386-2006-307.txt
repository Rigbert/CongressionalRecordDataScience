 President, I am here today to speak about a brave and heroic American who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom. SGT Daniel L. Sesker died on April 6, 2006 near Bayji, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sergeant Sesker was assigned to C Troop, 1st Squadron, 113th Calvary Regiment, 34th Infantry Division, Army National Guard based out of Le Mars, IA. I extend my deepest sympathies to his mother and stepfather, Mysty and Marvin Stumbo, his father, Dennis Sesker, his brother and sister, and his fiancee Angie.  Daniel Sesker was born in Boone, IA, and graduated from Ogden High School in 2001, where he participated in wrestling. He studied criminal law at Iowa Central Community College before enlisting in the Army National Guard. He served as part of Kosovo Force in Operation Joint Garden and had served a previous tour in Iraq. Between his two tours, Daniel worked as a counselor at the Woodward Academy and as a part-time police officer in Gowrie, IA. Sergeant Sesker received several decorations for his exemplary service, including the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, National Defense Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, and Combat Action Badge.  Sergeant Sesker is remembered as having a great sense of humor. His love for his family and friends as well as his love for life will be missed by all who knew him. He was the kind of person who could light up a room with his personality and positive attitude. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. We all owe Sergeant Sesker our eternal gratitude for his service and sacrifice.                          ____________________[Page S3797]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                       Sergeant Daniel L.
