Mr. Speaker, I rise today to note the passing of a fine man, long-time Alaskan Max Lyon. Max was from Fairbanks, where he was the Director of Transportation for the Fairbanks North Star Borough. In this job, Max managed transportation and environmental issues for the Borough. He loved his job and did it well; he will be badly missed by his many friends and coworkers in Fairbanks.  Max was born in 1947 in Owosso, Michigan, but he grew up in DeKalb, Illinois. He was an avid sportsman. He enjoyed hunting, fishing, and flying, and was a life member and Board President of the Tanana Valley Sportsmen's Association. He was a devoted husband and father, a community leader, and a good friend to many long-time Fairbanksians.  Before becoming an Alaskan, Max served his nation honorably in Vietnam. Immediately after graduation from high school, Max enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was trained as a jet-engine mechanic. He was sent to Viet Nam where he was stationed at DaNang Air Base. During his tour in Viet Nam, Max volunteered his time to teach English to Vietnamese students and was known as ``Teacher'' to many of them. He received an honorable discharge in 1969.  That year, Max went to work in Sycamore, Illinois, where he met his future wife, Diane Leonhard. They married on May 16, 1970. In 1973, Max went to work for American Transit, which in 1977 sent him on a temporary assignment to Fairbanks to establish their first city transit system. That was the company's big mistake. Max and Diane fell in love with Alaska, and at the end of the 18-month assignment, Max resigned from American Transit and stayed in his adopted home for the rest of his life.  Over the next several years, Max worked as a mechanic and service manager on heavy duty trucks and then went to work for Dixon's Gun Shop. In 1982, Max bought the gun shop and owned it until 1985, when he sold it to build his dream house, a log home overlooking Fairbanks.  The Borough hired Max as Assistant Transportation Director in 1989, and he soon was promoted to Transportation Director, a job he held under several Borough Mayors until his untimely death this past weekend. Max was a member of the Elks, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and was a life member of the National Rifle Association.  Max loved the outdoors. It was what drew him to Alaska and kept him here. He loved his hunting and fishing camp near Kobuk, in interior Alaska; he spent as much time there in the Spring and Fall as he could. He also loved Baja California, where he planned to spend the winter months during a richly deserved retirement. He had just broken ground on a new house there.  Most of all, Max loved his family--his wife, Diane; his children Kristine and Andrew; his grandchildren Jordan and Jack; his mother Marlene; and his siblings Terry, Tim, Peggy, Cheryl, Robin, and Melissa. Lu and I send our deepest sympathies to them in their hour of loss. We hope they are comforted by the memory of Max's very full life, and of his many friends and admirers. I consider myself one of them.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E997]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   MAX LYON--DIRECTOR OF TRANSPORTATION FOR THE FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR                                 BOROUGH                                 ______                                                              HON.
