President, I ask unanimous consent that cloture on Calendar No. 63 be withdrawn and that the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
