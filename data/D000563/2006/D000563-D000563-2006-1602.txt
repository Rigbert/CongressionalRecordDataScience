I would accept my characterization as challenging the Senator from Pennsylvania to accept the obvious. If this list has been created by some private company and cannot be shared with the people of America in the midst of the debate on this important bill, there is a serious flaw in this legislation, a flaw that cannot be overcome, even with the good feelings I have for the chairman of this committee.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
