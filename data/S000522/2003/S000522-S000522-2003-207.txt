Mr. Speaker, on March 18 the Cuban Government began a massive crackdown on the best, the brightest, and the most courageous in Cuba. Some 75 journalists and human rights activists were arrested and subjected to kangaroo trials and now have gotten prison terms from 6 to 28 years.  Last week Amnesty International called it the most severe crackdown on dissents since the year following the Cuban revolution.  Sadly, these brave Cubans join 400 other political prisoners who are languishing in Castro's gulags. Their only crime is their love of freedom.  Among those unjustly imprisoned, is Dr. Oscar Biscet, a pro-life Afro-Cuban who has been a leader in the human rights movement for years. Although he was recently released, Mr. Speaker, from a 3-year term, he was rearrested, and now has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for organizing a human rights meeting.  His wife, Elsa Morejon, reports that Dr. Biscet is kept in a 6 by 3 punishment cell. They have been refused any visits and any kind of parcels of food or medicines. On May 28 Dr. Biscet wrote, ``I am innocent of the charges of which I have been condemned. A true man cannot betray himself, so I only appeal to the living God and pray to our Lord, as He is not neutral and never abandons his flock.''  According to his wife, Dr. Biscet's only crime is trying to observe and uphold the universal declaration onhuman rights, his opposition to abortion, his opposition to the death penalty, and for organizing civil rights movement through nonviolent civil disobedience.  We join this man and his wife and all of those who are suffering. We have got to speak out and not give up until they are free.                          ____________________
