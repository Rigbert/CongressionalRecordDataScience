Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I recognize the Holy Trinity Hungarian Church in East Chicago, Indiana, as its members celebrate the church's 100th anniversary. The festivities began on Sunday, October 22, 2006, with Holy Mass, and were followed by a jubilee dinner at Casa Maria Banquet Hall in Dyer, Indiana, to celebrate this exceptional milestone.  Around the turn of the 20th century, the Hungarian neighborhood in East Chicago, Indiana, was centered around family, religion, and a yearning for a church of their own. On July 4, 1904, a group met in the home of Stephen Farkas on Alexander Avenue to share ideas for beginning what is now the Holy Trinity Hungarian Church. On November 11, 1906, the cornerstone was laid for the first church building, which was followed by its dedication on the feast of the Holy Trinity in 1907. On Christmas Eve 1907, the first resident pastor arrived, Father Oscar Szilagyi. Though his tenure was short-lived due to the regulations of the Religious Order, Father Szilagyi has the distinction of performing Holy Trinity's first marriage, baptism, and funeral. Though this church, as well as Holy Trinity's second church building, was eventually destroyed by fire, the parishioners and their spiritual leaders forged on. Through their faith, hard work, and dedication, the cornerstone of the third and present church was laid on May 30, 1920, and dedicated on May 22, 1921. Following the rebuilding of the church, Holy Trinity went on to open a school in 1922, and by 1927, Holy Trinity, continuing to expand, saw the development of several organizations, including: Holy Rosary Circle, Altar Society, Holy Name Society, Knights of Holy Trinity, Children of Mary, and Young Ladies Sodality.  The parishioners at Holy Trinity continued to share their faith in communion with one another, surely not without their share of continued struggles. In February 1957, the newly formed Diocese of Gary was established, and Holy Trinity joined the neighboring Catholic parishes in welcoming the Most Reverend Andrew G. Grutka as its first Bishop. Throughout the years, Holy Trinity and its leaders have achieved many milestones and accolades. None, however, was seen as more prestigious than that which occurred on July 10, 2004, when Holy Trinity was honored with a visit from Peter Cardinal Erdo, Primate of Hungary.  Another outstanding milestone in the parish's history took place on May 1, 2005, when the present pastor, Father Alphonse Skerl, celebrated his 50th anniversary of ordination to the priesthood. Through all of the support, generosity, and leadership of Father Skerl for nearly 35 years, along with the dedication of the parish council, staff, parishioners, and organizations, Holy Trinity has reached their most momentous celebration with the 100th anniversary.  Holy Trinity Hungarian Church has been a mainstay in the city of East Chicago and is worthy of this recognition as it celebrated its 100th anniversary on Sunday, October 22, 2006. The church offers an invaluable service to its parishioners and community, providing numerous opportunities for all to join together to experience its rich heritage.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Holy Trinity Hungarian Church on their 100th anniversary. Throughout the years, the clergy and members of Holy Trinity have dedicated themselves to providing spirituality and guidance through the protection of the Hungarian traditions and faith. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of our admiration.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1998]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                TRIBUTE TO HOLY TRINITY HUNGARIAN CHURCH                                 ______                                                         HON.
