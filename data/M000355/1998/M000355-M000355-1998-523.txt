 LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my good friend and leader how much I appreciate his leadership on this issue. Yourspeech was, of course, right on point. We have many important things to accomplish for the people of the United States that they care about deeply. I think the leader was right on point when he made the observation that the last thing we want to do is to diminish the ability of Americans to participate in the political process. So I thank my good friend and leader for his outstanding work on this subject.
