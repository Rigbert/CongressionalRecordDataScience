President, on Friday, July 24, I introduced legislation along with Senators Ashcroft, Burns, and Abraham to repeal the legal mandate for personal identification codes for each patient that would be part of a national medical records system.  Our legislation, S. 2352, the Patient Privacy Rights Act, would repeal the unique medical identifiers requirement of the Health Insurance Portability Law of 1996 (HIPAA). This law directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a system to use personal identifying codes as part of a system for electronically transmitting health information to aid implementation of the health insurance portability law. The unique health identifiers would be codes, numbers or other methods of uniquely identifying each patient that his or her doctors would be required to use throughout that person's lifetime. Hearings on the emerging system were launched in Chicago this week by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics.  I believe it is irresponsible to expose patients to this massive new erosion oftheir privacy. The impetus to computerize medical records for the sake of efficiency cannot be allowed to overrun our basic privacy. People deserve the assurance that their medical histories will not be the subject of public curiosity, commercial advantage or harmful disclosure. This computerization of medical information has raised the stakes in privacy protection. Congress created this threat. Now Congress needs to just say no to the idea of a cradle-to-grave medical dossier.  Health care computerization not only is inevitable, it can be a useful tool to improve health care. But trusting our medical records to this rapidly developing technology will only be supported by the American people if they are assured that their medical privacy is protected. Privacy is not the only victim here. Without privacy protections, many will be discouraged from seeking help or taking advantage of the access we are working so hard to protect in this very same law.  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  The text of the bill follows:                                S. 2352       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Privacy Rights Act      of 1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) individuals have a right to confidentiality with      respect to their personal health information and records;       (2) with respect to information about medical care and      health status, the traditional right of confidentiality is at      risk;       (3) an erosion of the right of confidentiality will reduce      the willingness of patients to confide in physicians and      other practitioners, thus jeopardizing quality health care;       (4) fear that confidentiality is being compromised will      deter individuals from seeking medical treatment and stifle      technological or medical research and development; and       (5) advancing technology should not lead to a loss of      personal privacy.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       It is the purpose of this Act--       (1) to repeal the implementation of a ``standard unique      health identifier for each individual'' as required under      section 1173(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d-     2(b)) as added by the amendment made by section 262(a) of the      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996      (Public Law 104-191); and       (2) to guarantee that medical privacy protections are not      undermined by federal law.     SEC. 4. REPEAL OF FEDERAL UNIQUE HEALTH IDENTIFIER.       Sections 1173(b) and 1177(a)(1) of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2(b); 42 U.S.C. 1320d-6(a)(1)) are      repealed.                          ____________________
