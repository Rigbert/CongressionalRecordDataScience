Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from West Virginia will be postponed.                   Amendment Offered by Mr. McKinley  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the      following:       Sec. 508.  None of the funds made available by this Act may      be used to transform the National Energy Technology      Laboratory into a government-owned, contractor-operated      laboratory, or to consolidate or close the National Energy      Technology Laboratory.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 641, the gentleman from West Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, because there has been efforts, I suppose, to privatize and consolidate the National Energy Technology Laboratory, also known as NETL, this amendment is offered to eliminate that uncertainty and to continue the present public-private partnership.  NETL is our Nation's premier energy laboratory for fossil energy, using 600 government scientists, technicians, and employees, but they couple that with nearly 1,200 private sector contractors.  Through this partnership, NETL has developed breakthrough research, carbon capture, enhanced natural gas exploration and production, emission control for our power plants, and steam and gas turbine efficiency.  Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is that no other national laboratory has the expertise and the capabilities in fossil fuel energy to develop what NETL already has.  This public-private model has also been used by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control.  Mr. Chairman, if our government research laboratories were privatized, what assurance would Members of Congress have that that research would be done in America?  Just pick up a newspaper on any day and you will read about another corporation moving its research and development work offshore. People looking to privatize and consolidate these laboratories seem to be searching for a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).  The amendment was agreed to.                Amendment Offered by Mr. Weber of Texas
