President, another giant has fallen. I rise today to recognize the passing of James William Ratzlaff.  As a conservationist, an avid outdoorsman, a philanthropist, and, most of all, a dear friend, Jim was one of Oregon's great civic leaders. He passed away on August 26 at home on his beloved ranch surrounded by love. Jim is survived by Jane, his loving wife of 54 years, and their children, Jim, Jr., and Susan, as well as Jim, Jr.'s wife Leinani and her sons, Lowell and Larkin, and Susan's son, Marcus James.  For decades, Jim and Jane have exemplified and renewed our sense of what it means to be outstanding community leaders: patiently listening and learning, actively seeking equitable solutions, and, above all, leading by example.  Jim's legacy of good deeds extends far beyond mere philanthropy. He threw himself headlong into the complex challenges facing communities in and well beyond his home in Roseburg, OR. His abiding love for nature and healthy watersheds always went hand-in-hand with his deep concern for the well-being of our communities. Jim always believed and worked to prove that community health, ecology, and economy are inseparable and that, together, we can strengthen all three.  Jim's notable success in business served merely as a means to an end much bigger than himself. Those that knew him well would agree that he saw his good fortune as a blessing allowing him to expand his ability to do good in the world. Always with humility, always with deference, always true to his core values, Jim taught us once again how to lead by example.  Jim and Jane moved to Oregon, to the beauty of Crane Creek Ranch, and exercised their good fortune to make the world a better place. Through his work with the Oregon Community Foundation and service on boards across the Pacific Northwest--including Pacific Rivers Council, Wild Salmon Center, the North Umpqua Foundation, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and Mercy Medical Center--Jim was tireless in his efforts to maintain healthy forests and rivers and to elevate the lives of those around him.  Jim's great love of his family and the land stood as an inspiration to everyone around him. While, yes, a giant has fallen, a forest will rise in his place, growing from all those whose lives he has touched with his love, friendship, generosity, wisdom, and lifelong commitment to building a better future.                          ____________________
