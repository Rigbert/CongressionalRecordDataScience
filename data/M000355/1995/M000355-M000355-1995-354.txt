 President, I rise today to mourn the death of a close friend, Mr. Dick Combs. Dick died last Wednesday from complications after heart surgery.  Over the years, he touched the lives of many people in northern Kentucky. Dick was a very special man, but one thing in particular made him one of a kind. It was his trademark green comb. Everytime he introduced himself to someone he would hand them a green pocket comb with his name on it. There's probably not a person in northern Kentucky that hasn't combed his or her hair with a comb from Dick. But this wasn't his only trademark, he was also seen nearly everyday driving around town in his 1968 red convertible Ford Mustang, smiling and waving to everyone he passed. And who could forget his old fishing hat, an item he would never leave the house without.  The World War II veteran was elected Kenton County commissioner in 1984, a victory that is in the record books and the subject of political trivia questions across the Bluegrass State. Dick was the first Republican in 75 years to win a seat on the fiscal court. He also served as a member of the Kenton County GOP executive committee, the Northern Kentucky Area Planning Commission, the Boone-Kenton Cable TV Board, and he was a founding member of the Northern Kentucky Salvation Army Advisory Board.  With all his political activities you would think that Dick wouldn't have time for anything else. But that wasn't the case, he always found time for his true loves: his family and his community.  He kept busy in the community by getting involved in the Fort Mitchell Kiwanis and Optimist clubs, the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, and the American Animal Association. His care and support for stray animals was even recognized by the animal rights community, who endorsed his candidacy. Dick would go out of his way to help his animal friends. He would even go as far as leaving his garage door open at night so any stray animal could have a safe haven from the elements.  Dick was also a deacon at Fort Mitchell Baptist Church for more than 35 years. There wasn't a Sunday that went by that Dick wasn't standing outside the church greeting every parishioner that walked through the doors. To some it may have seemed like a small gesture, but to churchgoers it wasn't a Sunday without seeing his smiling face. His absence at church last Sunday was felt by members young and old, including a young boy who cried when he didn't see Dick at the church's door.  Mr. President, I ask you to join me in extending my heartfelt sympathy and prayers to his family and to all those whose lives he touched. Dick, will be missed.                          ____________________
