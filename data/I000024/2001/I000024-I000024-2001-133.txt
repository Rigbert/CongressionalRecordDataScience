Parkinson's law is: Government expands to consume the resources allocated to it, plus 10 percent. This has proven to be true over and over again.  I can argue as to the fairness of where this cut takes place. I could talk about the fact that the top 5 percent of the income makers in this country actually pay 54 percent of the taxes; the bottom 50 percent only pay 4.2 percent of the taxes. That begs the question. There is no reason to talk about the fairness of this because it is too logical. Obviously, what we are going through now is an overpayment. We have taxed the American people, and anyone out there right now--and there are millions of people who have paid any type of taxes--is entitled to a refund. To redistribute that wealth would be as unfair as it would be if you went down to an auto dealership, bought a new car, paid the sticker price, got home and said: Wait, I paid $2,000 too much. And you get in the car and drive to the auto dealer and say: You overcharged me $2,000, and he says: I just gave it to my mother-in-law.  This is an overpayment of taxes we have made and I think people are entitled to have the overpayment back. If you do that, it will have the effect of increasing revenue, and stimulating the economy, which we desperately need. We are on the brink right now of a recession.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 29, 2001]                      Where Do We Put the Surplus?               (By Kevin A. Hassett and R. Glenn Hubbard)       When historians look back on Alan Greenspan's tenure as      chairman of the Federal Reserve and attempt to identify the      source of his enormous success, last Thursday's Congressional      testimony--in which he advanced the course of tax reform--     will likely provide one answer. Mr. Greenspan raised a      pressing public-policy question that has been overlooked by      most, a question that will likely become the focal point of      political and economic debate during President Bush's first      four-year term.       If the U.S. government starts accumulating big surpluses,      where should it put the money?       That might not seem so tricky. After all, the government      already occasionally places deposits in private banks. But      this time we aren't talking nickels and dimes. Current      surplus estimates are so large that the government's passbook      savings account, if nothing changes, will soon become the      Mount Everest of cash hoards.       Let's look at the numbers. The latest Office of Management      and Budget forecast is for the surplus to reach about $5.5      trillion over the next 10 years. Rumor has it that the soon-     to-be-released Congressional Budget Office forecast will peg      it at $6 trillion, with almost $1 trillion arriving in 2011      alone. (Note: actual CBO numbers are $5.61 trillion, of which      $3.12 trillion will be the non-Social Security surplus)       Why not just pay down the debt? Put simply, there's not      that much debt to pay. According to the Treasury Department,      total government debt held by the public is only about $3      trillion. With no change in tax policy, projected surpluses      would pay down the debt by around 2008. Government will      subsequently have to decide in what it will invest the      massive surpluses.       But that is far in the future. Many opponents of tax      reduction have suggested that we wait until the uncertain      surpluses arrive, and the $3 trillion of existing government      debt is retired, before considering tax cuts. Mr. Greenspan      had an answer for that as well: ``Private asset accumulation      may be forced upon us well short of reaching zero debt.''       Indeed, by some estimates, as much as half of existing      government debt will be almost impossible to retire, since      savings bonds and state and local government series bonds      often aren't redeemed until maturity, and because many      holders of long-term treasury bills will be unwilling to sell      them back to the government. Factor in that surplus estimates      keep getting revised upward, and government may well be      forced to invest in private assets in just three or four      years.       How big could the hoard get? Investing that much public      money would likely mean the government purchase of stocks,      because only equity markets are large enough to absorb such      inflows and still remain liquid. Assuming the Treasury begins      to invest surpluses in the stock market as soon as it has      retired all the debt that it can, and that these investments      earn a 10 percent annual return, our government will be      sitting on a stock-market portfolio worth $20 trillion by      2020. To put that in perspective, the current market value of      all equities in the U.S. is about $17 trillion, according to      the Federal Reserve. Projecting forward, the U.S. government      could own about one-fifth of all domestic equities by 2020.       Allowing the government to own that much of the      private economy is an invitation to unbounded mischief.      Firms will lobby to be put on the list of acceptable      investments; those firms or assets left off will suffer      hardship. Calls to sell firms that aren't ``green'' or      that fail to pass litmus tests will become the latest in      political lobbying. Which is why Mr. Greenspan stated      flatly: ``The federal government should eschew private      asset accumulation because it would be exceptionally      difficult to insulate the government's investment      decisions from political pressures.'' The risks are just      too great.       His argument on Thursday caught Democrats flat-footed. Sen.      Ernest Hollings of South Carolina told Mr. Greenspan that      ``in all candor, you shock me with your statement.'' An      apoplectic Sen. Charles Schumer     of New York dubbed Mr. Greenspan's analysis a mistake.'' Such      venom is reserved for truly decisive arguments. Indeed, word      is out that economists at President Clinton's Council of      Economic Advisers prepared an analysis of this issue that      wasn't allowed to see the light of day.       Perhaps the Democratic senators had not previously      recognized that their opposition to tax cuts would require      the government to buy a massive share of private America. Mr.      Hollings later warned Mr. Greenspan that he was ``going to      start a stampede.'' It is not a stampede we will observe, but      a wholesale retreat by poll-conscious opponents of tax      reform, who will have little stomach to defend such a massive      government intrusion into private life. A large tax cut is      virtually a sure thing.       Which doesn't mean we've seen the last of this important      question. First, if supply-side arguments are correct, then      the marginal-rate reductions proposed by Mr. Bush will      eventually increase tax revenues and surpluses, presenting us      once again with the quandary of what to buy. Second, Social      Security continues to be on very weak footing in the long      run, and something must be done to stave off fiscal disaster.      This puts Democrats in a tough position. For if they reject      the option of allowing the government to hoard private assets      in anticipation of retiring baby boomers, there is--as Mr.      Greenspan highlighted elsewhere in his remarks--one      inevitable alternative: individual accounts.       In taking a stand on such important issues in such a public      forum, Mr. Greenspan has fundamentally altered the debate on      the surplus, taxes and government investment. From now on,      opponents of privatization will have to reveal just where it      is they intend to put our money, and convince us that those      investments will be economically benign.
