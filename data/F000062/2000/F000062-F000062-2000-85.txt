 President, yesterday the Senate reauthorized a very important piece of legislation: the Ryan White CARE Act. I want to thank Senators Kennedy and Jeffords for their work and commitment to reauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act.  The CARE Act provides access to health care for tens of thousands of low-income people living with HIV and AIDS. This vital Act is set to expire on September 30, 2000. We must move quickly to ensure that it is reauthorized. Without the CARE Act, access to important health-related services could be jeopardized for hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS.  Since 1990, the CARE Act has helped establish a comprehensive, community-based continuum of care for uninsured and under-insured people living with HIV and AIDS, including access to primary medical care, pharmaceuticals, and support services. The CARE Act provides services to people who would not otherwise have access to care.  The CARE Act is particularly important to communities of color. The HIV epidemic is devastating communities of color. Currently, AIDS is the leading cause of death among African American men and the second leading cause of death among African American women between the ages of 25 and 44. Comparably, AIDS is the fifth leading cause of death among all Americans in this age group. A disproportionate number of African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos are also living with AIDS. Whereas African Americans represent only 13 percent of the total U.S. population, they represent 36 percent of reported AIDS cases. Likewise, Latinos represent 9 percent of the population but 17 percent all of AIDS cases.  The Ryan White CARE Act is important to thousands of Californians. Two of California's largest cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco, are among the top four metropolitan cites with the highest number of AIDS cases in the United States. California has the second highest number of AIDS cases, with over 40,000 Californians currently living with AIDS. Through the CARE Act, Los Angeles has provided services to over 43,160 clients since 1996. San Francisco has provided services to 47,440 since 1996. These numbers alone demonstrate the significant impact the CARE Act has had on California.  A majority of newly diagnosed AIDS cases in California are among people of color. Through 1998, over half of all AIDS cases are reported among racial and ethnic minorities in California. In Los Angeles, and Oakland that number rises to over 60 percent, according to the Ryan White CARE Act state profiles.  Los Angeles County and San Francisco County were among the first sixteen eligible metropolitan areas to receive Title I emergency Ryan White CARE Act funds in 1991. California has been significantly impacted by the HIV/AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and has greatly benefitted from the Ryan White CARE Act since 1990.  The CARE Act has been very successful in the past decade. Over the last several years, the CARE Act has:       Helped to reduce AIDS mortality by 70 percent. Due to      combination anti-retroviral therapies being made more widely      available through the CARE Act, the AIDS death rate in 1997      was the lowest in nearly a decade.       Helped to reduce mother-to-child transmission by 75      percent.       Helped to reduce the number and length of expensive      hospitalizations by 30 percent. It has also helped decrease      the use of medical speciality care.       Helped 97,000 individuals access drugs through the AIDS      Drug Assistance Program in 1997.       Helped 315,234 people receive HIV testing and counseling      services in 1997.       Helped 66,000 people access dental care in 1998.       Promoted health and well-being which has enabled many      people living with HIV to return to work and remain healthy,      and actively participate in society.  The CARE Act is more important now than ever. HIV/AIDS remains a health emergency in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 40,000 new cases are reported annually. According to the Centers for Disease Control, between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans are currently infected with HIV while the number of AIDS cases has nearly doubled over the past five years. According to Dr. Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, the worse is yet to come in the 21st century. The state of the epidemic points to the need for an increase, rather than a decrease, in health care and drug treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS. Communities of color and women will continue to be the most heavily impacted in the 21st century.  We have made many advances in testing, treatment, and research since the early days of the disease and the beginnings of the Ryan White CARE Act. Drugs now exist that can prolong and improve the quality of life. These drugs are not a cure, but they enablemany people to lead a more ``normal'' life. Our job is not done, however, until we have made certain that all people have access to these life-prolonging medications.  The work we were able to accomplish in San Francisco for people living with HIV/AIDS is one of my proudest achievements as Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco. In 1981, when there were only 76 diagnosed cases, we provided $180,000 for prevention and social services for people living with HIV/AIDS. These were some of the first public funds allocated for AIDS in the United States. In 1987, during my last full year as mayor, 20,000 AIDS deaths were reported in San Francisco and we increased funding to $20 million. There was no federal Ryan White program then; I struggled to find this money in the city budget. Fortunately, for cities and States across the country, we now have the Ryan White CARE Act.  I pledge to do all I can to eliminate AIDS. As I have said time and time again: I was there in the beginning and I plan to be there in the end. In the meantime, we must make certain that the uninsured and under-insured have access to life-prolonging HIV treatments. The Ryan White CARE Act has proven to be an essential and effective Federal program for the uninsured and under-insured. We must ensure the continuation of the Ryan White CARE Act.                          ____________________
