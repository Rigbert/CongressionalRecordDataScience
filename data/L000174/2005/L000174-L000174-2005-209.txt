President, while we have the distinguished senior Senator from Missouri and the distinguished senior Senator from Washington and the distinguished Senator from Minnesota on the floor, let me propose this: We could spend the next several hours on our bipartisan amendment to restore funding to the Community Development Block Grants, Section 8 Housing Vouchers, and Public Housing Capital and Operating Funds, and there are enough of our 40 bipartisan cosponsors willing to speak that it would take several hours to do it. We would then end up on a 60-vote point of order, which may or may not go through. I know from nearly 30 years on the Appropriations Committee how it works. I have watched for decades the work of the distinguished Senator from Missouri and the distinguished Senator from Washington State. I know how hard both of them have worked to accommodate the needs of Senators from both sides of the aisle, and certainly in this case, when the key cosponsors are both Republican and Democrat. I see my friend from Minnesota on the floor. I have truly appreciated all the work Senator Coleman, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Graham and Senator Reed have put into crafting this amendment with me. I also thank our 35 other cosponsors, who strike a broad swath of the political spectrum. Might I suggest this, though: That we withhold our amendment and work to ensure that in conference we increase funds for these important community development and housing programs. I am on Appropriations.
