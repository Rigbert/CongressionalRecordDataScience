 President, I rise today to draw continued attention to our important narcotic interdiction efforts throughout the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, commonly referred to as the ``Transit Zone,'' and the aging condition of the aircraft and vessels in both the U.S. Customs Service and U.S. Coast Guard fleet inventories.  Earlier this year, the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control held a hearing on the Transit Zone. Intelligence sources estimate that the annual cocaine flow through the six million square-mile Transit Zone is in excess of 500 metric tons. Non-commercial maritime conveyances account for more than 80 percent of this Transit Zone flow, and unfortunately, the estimated success rate for smugglers ``go-fast'' deliveries is close to 90 percent.  The U.S. Coast Guard operates numerous ships and aircraft that are aging and now require excessive maintenance to keep them in operation. Because these assets lack current technology, they are extremely manpower intensive, and require constant maintenance, which detracts from readiness and increases life cycle costs. All of the Coast Guard's 210-foot and 378-foot ships are at least 30 years old, and the Coast Guard even operates 3 ``Mature class'' cutters, WWII-era vessels inherited from the U.S. Navy. The Coast Guard's fleet of medium and high endurance cutters is older than 37 of the world's 39 similar naval fleets, and the majority of major Coast Guard ships and aircraft will reach the end of their predicted service lives by the year 2008.  The Customs Service operates a wide range of aircraft at 11 air branches and 10 air units throughout the country, as well as at 3 overseas forward operating locations (FOLs) and 2 sites in Mexico. The Customs Service has 142 aircraft and 196 vessels, and many are in need of modernization or replacement. The average age of their C-12 aircraft is 22 years old and all 16 of their UH-60 Blackhawks are ``A'' models (first production series) on loan from the U.S. Army. As their P-3 aircraft fleet has aged, numerous corrosion and cracking problems have been discovered. It is the P-3 aircraft that has become the backbone of our detection and monitoring system. But, the U.S. Customs Service Air and Maritime Interdiction (AMID) January 2001 Strategic Assessment reported, the level of aviation operations is insufficient to meet the current agency requirements of Presidential Decision Directive (PDD-14), the National Drug Control Strategy, and Plan Colombia.  While both services begin to feel the debilitating effects of these aging assets, demands for both the Customs Service and Coast Guard's unique services are simultaneously increasing. A doubling world population, the continued decline in marine fisheries, the end of the Cold War, the doubling of commercial passenger enplanements by 2009, the continuing scourge of illegal drugs and human smuggling, and the tripling of international commerce are all expected to increase the nation's reliance on these agencies. The Customs Service will continue to be on the front lines on trade and economic growth, border security, counter terrorism, narcotics interdiction, financial crimes and money laundering, pornography, and Internet cybercrime cases. The Coast Guard will continue as the lead federal agency in the maritime environment with respect to drugs, illegalimmigration, and fisheries law enforcement. We are increasing our demands, we are expanding our expectations, but we are not investing in our capability. We cannot continue to live off our principal and expect to achieve results.  The recent record maritime seizure of 13 tons of cocaine on a vessel in the Eastern Pacific only serves to highlight the significant Transit Zone threat and reinforces the urgent need for modernization of the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Coast Guard fleets. I urge my colleagues to continue to support our Nation's counterdrug efforts, including those in the Transit Zone and at our borders, and in support of these two important U.S. agencies.                          ____________________
