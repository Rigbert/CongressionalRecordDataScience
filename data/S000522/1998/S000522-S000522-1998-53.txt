Madam Speaker, first of all I want to thank and congratulate the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for introducing H. Con. Res. 185 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a magnificent document. I am very proud to be one of the cosponsors of the resolution. I do hope it will get the full support of our colleagues today.                              {time}  1415  Madam Speaker, I believe that rights come from God, not from governments, not from international organizations. Nevertheless, it was a great step forward when, without a dissenting vote, the United Nations General Assembly recognized the existence of the rights to life, liberty, freedom of religion and expression, self-government through elections, and other important rights that are inherent in our nature as human beings and children of God.  I am very proud to join my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), and I want to thank him again for bringing this important resolution before the body today.
