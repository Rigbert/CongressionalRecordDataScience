 President, I am extremely disappointed that we have to be here today debating the FSC/ETI bill. The fact is, with America's economic health at risk, the bipartisan JOBS bill should have been debated and voted out of this body last month. Instead, attempts to move this jobs in manufacturing bill has been stymied. As a result, American manufacturing is not only being deprived of a competitive boost that it deserves at a time of no job creation in manufacturing but, in addition to that, U.S. exporters are stuck with a 6-percent European tax on our products going there.  This situation has festered for much too long. It has been several years since the World Trade Organization has ruled that the FSC/ETI regime did not meet our World Trade Organization obligations that this Senate and the other body agreed to a long time ago. Since then, we have known that. It is a fact. We have all known that unless we changed our current tax system, tariffs against our exports were looming.  To try to avoid these sanctions, Senator Baucus and I came together over a year ago and formed a bipartisan, bicameral working group to find a real, permanent solution to this problem.  The result is bipartisan. Remember that nothing gets done in the Senate that is not bipartisan. We have a jobs in manufacturing act before the Senate, and we will be voting on that today. This bill was passed out of my committee by a vote of 19 to 2. That means all Democrats voted for it. It provided a real and permanent solution to our FSC/ETI problems in a way which complies with our WTO obligations.  The bipartisan jobs in manufacturing act helps America's manufacturing sector. It helps us compete by giving an across-the-board 3-percentage point tax cut to all companies, large or small, that manufacture in the United States.  At a time when manufacturing is flat, this 3-percent tax cut can make a real difference to a company's bottom line perhaps bringing up enough capital and creating enough manufacturing growth to enable it or any company to hire in the manufacturing sector.  That is something every Senator would like to see. But because of political games and dilatory tactics by some in the Senate, this relief is not forthcoming.  I want Americans to understand that Senators on my side of the aisle are ready, willing, and able to provide a real shot in the arm to America's manufacturing sector. But after working so long in a bipartisan way, we are being blocked. We are blocked from providing the relief that American manufacturing deserves and needs.  In effect, this bill and the American manufacturing sector are being held hostage to Democratic demands to load this bipartisan legislation with a bunch of unrelated nongermane amendments. While some of these amendments are legitimate, others amount to nothing more than a wish list of political message amendments that have nothing to do with this very major piece of legislation. I, for one, am tired of watching us bide our time contemplating a wish list. American manufacturing needs solutions. It does not need a political wish list.  We have a good bipartisan bill before the Senate, a package that works for America's workers. But our plea for progress is met with nothing but demands for including one more item on some political wish list. You would think adults would make up their minds about what they want and that would be it.  It would be one thing if a political wish list did no harm, if it really didn't matter, or if the JOBS bill moved or not. But for manufacturing it does matter. Delay deprives American manufacturing of a much needed economic boost. Delay also inflicts real economic harm on innocent workers across the country.  The World Trade Organization has authorized the European Union to impose as much as $4 billion in tariffs in retaliation for our failure to bring our tax laws into compliance with international trade agreements that this body has already accepted--and accepted years ago.  Last month, on March 1, the European Union began implementing these sanctions by imposing an additional 5-percent tax on selected U.S. exports. This 5-percent Euro tax automatically increases by 1 percent for each month in which the United States of America remains out of compliance. Thus, when Members voted against stopping debate last month, the last time this bill was before this body, they contributed to a 20-percent increase in these tariffs because that additional 1 percent went into effect on April 1. Because of delay, then we have a 6-percent sales tax on our exports to Europe, making a lot of our businesses uncompetitive.  As you can see from this chart, these sanctions will continue to climb unless we act and act fast. In May, they rise another 1-percentage point to 7 percent and continue increasing until they reach a maximum of 17 percent in March of 2005. After that, then who knows what is going to happen. But by then we will have a lot of layoffs and people will wake up to the fact that harm is being done.  The European Union is not bound to cap retaliation at 17 percent. That is why I said: Who knows? In fact, they are scheduled to review the effectiveness of these retaliatory taxes at the end of 1 year. If the Europeans conclude that we are not in compliance, retaliation can escalate even further to a maximum of $4 billion a year.  If this sounds one sided, America wins more disputes in the World Trade Organization than we lose. We have won some major disputes against Europe. One time we won one about American beef being kept out of Europe. Europe still doesn't like to get some American beef. So we have imposed a tax on European exports coming into our country because that is the legal way of handling these disputes after it has been decided. I use that as an example. Europe has learned a lesson from the United States and they are doing to us what we have done to them. Why? Because in one case Europe did not want to abide by a decision, and in another case, we, up to now, have not abided by a decision. That is why we have the tax. It is quite obvious in most cases countries abide by these decisions. If they did not abide by these decisions, we would have chaos in international trade. We do not.  I make clear to the Members of this body: The effect of voting against stopping debate last month contributed strongly to raising tariffs on our exports by 2 percent. If cloture is not invoked this week, it is certain sanctions will escalate another percentage point, rising an overall level of 7 percent on selected U.S. exports. The core legislation should be very clear: A vote against stopping debate is a vote for higher taxes on our exports.  Which exporters will be hurt? All of them. No, not all of them, because the European Union was very careful in drawing up the sanctions list. In many cases, they chose to impose sanctions on U.S. exports that would most significantly feel the pain of the higher tax tariffs.  They are smart. Thus, highly competitive products with high profit margins are likely to find themselves on the list.  A press release from the American Forest and Paper Association dated March 2 of this year says this about European Union tariffs on wood product exports:       This is a devastating development for an industry that has      already closed more than 220 mills and laid off 120,000      workers since 1997.       Our industry works on such tight profit margins that even a      5 percent tariff will likely price many U.S. wood and paper      products out of our vital European markets. To have this      happen just as United States wood and paper products are      beginning to recover from a decade-long stump does      irreparable harm to our industry.  The European Union has chosen products they could get from other countries, hoping that the higher tariffs on U.S. exports will price our products out of the European market, to be replaced by similar products from other foreign competitors. It is important for Members of the Senate to understand the effect of pricing U.S. exports out of the European market is not just temporary. Longstanding business relationships can be permanently disrupted as European buyers scramble to replace cost-prohibited U.S. products. Even if our price may go down, those relationships that are made because of this uncompetitive atmosphere for American exporters may go on and we never gain back that market. Once a replacement from another country is found, there is no guarantee the European buyer will ever buy from the U.S. producer again. In the end, the lost European export market can be lost forever. If the Senate votes down this motion to stop debate this month, the cancer of sanctions will not only continue, it will spread.  On May 1 of this year the European Union will take in 10 more member countries. These countries will be bound by the same import-export regime as France and other European Union countries. Thus U.S. exports to those 10 countries will also face higher tariffs as they try to compete in these markets.  Now we will look at another chart that shows the list of countries that will be become part of the European Union starting May 1, 2004: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia. I hope Senators who vote against stopping debate today appreciate they are voting not only to raise the Euro tax on sensitive U.S. exports but are also voting to have that tax applied to an even broader array of countries.  Some people might argue these sanctions only hurt big companies. Do not be fooled. They are big, people might argue, and they can absorb a hit of higher tariffs. The fact is, approximately 90 percent of U.S. exporters in 2001 were small businesses with 100 employees or less. These small exporters can ill afford the sting of sanctions on their bottom line. Products impacted include jewelry, horses, dairy, fruit and vegetables, toys and games, glass and glassware, animal feed, leather goods and handbags, textile products, carpets, footwear, soap and candles, woodproducts, and electric machinery. That is just a small list of 500 different products being hit. The American people are starting to take notice.  I read in part from a letter I received from the Carpet Rug Institute headquartered in Dalton, GA, stating:       The United States carpet industry produces 45 percent of      the world's carpet and is a $12 billion per year presence at      the mill.       The carpet industry is extremely competitive, both      domestically and worldwide, with profit margins cut razor      thin.       The potential of an increased duty in the form of a      punitive sanction may make the export of carpet and rug      products by any United States manufacturer in the European      Union market an economic impossibility. For the sake of the      collection of an excess tariff an entire industry may be made      to suffer.  And we are hearing:       Voices from across the country are asking relief from the      escalating Euro tax on our exports.  I will take a look at another letter signed by over 80 businesses and trade associations. These organizations that signed the letter want to emphasize the urgency of resolving the FSC/ETI export tax issue as soon as possible. Quick action on legislation is necessary to both comply with our WTO obligations and avoid or minimize retaliation against U.S. products.     . . . the European Union has increased the retaliatory      tariffs from 5 to 6 percent on as much as $4 billion per year      of American products.       These retaliatory tariffs are hurting the U.S. exports to      Europe at a time when they are just beginning to rebound in      the global economy and showing signs of renewed growth.      Moreover, the tariffs negatively impact American workers.  The letter continues:       We urge the Senate and House to pass FSC/ETI legislation      immediately and proceed to conference as soon as possible      thereafter.       Thank you . . . for doing your part to send FSC/ETI bill to      the President's desk without delay, thus minimizing the      economically devastating trade sanctions on U.S. products and      its impact on American workers who produce them.  These organizations span the entire Nation. This is not regional. Almost every State is going to be impacted by this vote this afternoon.  So let's go to the Northeast: the Virginia Forestry Association, the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the Coalition of New England Companies for Trade, and the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce.  From our part of the country, the Upper Midwest--the Presiding Officer is from Minnesota; I am from Iowa--we have the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Minnesota Timber Producers Association, the Minnesota Agri-Growth Council, the Missouri Forest Products Association, and the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce.  In the Pacific Northwest, we have the Pacific Coast Council of Custom Brokers and Freight Forwarders and the Softwood Export Council in the Pacific Northwest.  From the West, we have the Utah Manufacturers Association, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, and the California Chamber of Commerce.  From the Plains States and the South, we have the Arkansas Forestry Association, the Louisiana Forestry Association, the Mississippi Forestry Association, and the Texas Forestry Association.  From the Southeast, we have the Alabama Forestry Association, the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association, the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the North Carolina Forestry Association.  So as you can see, the entire country is impacted by this European tax on our exports to that part of the world. Some of the nationally impacted associations include the Agriculture Retailers Association, the American Architectural Manufacturers Association, the American Cotton Shippers Council, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Iron and Steel Institute, the American Peanut Council, the American Soybean Association, the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the Manufacturing Jewelers and Suppliers of America, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Corn Growers Association, and the National Cotton Council. And that is just a partial list.  What communication to Members of Congress is all about is businesses crying out for relief--not for the delay that we have already had for 1 month.  Let's be clear about what is at stake. American jobs are at stake because American competitiveness is at stake.  A vote against stopping debate is a vote against tax relief for America's beleaguered manufacturing sector--tax relief that goes beyond nullifying this European tax.  A vote against stopping debate is a vote to prolong the pain across America. A vote against stopping debate is a vote to increase the European tax on American exporters yet more than the 6 percent already there. A vote against stopping debate is a vote to deprive America's small exporters--because 90 percent of our exporters are small businesses of 100 employees or less--continued access to the European market, and access they may never regain.  If my colleagues vote against stopping debate, they might as well be telling American manufacturing that the United States is closed for business; that if you want access to the European export markets, you might as well go overseas and do your business because Members of this Congress have refused to give these manufacturers the tools they need to compete.  There is an answer. Stop--stop playing political games; stop pushing political wish lists; stop jeopardizing economic recovery. Instead, start supporting the ending of debate; start bringing this bill to finality; support stopping debate and start enhancing the economic recovery that is just around the corner in America's manufacturing sector if we do not snuff it out; support stopping debate and start the process that eliminates the European tax on our exports.  The choice is clear: Vote no, and you might make a few political points but I think just for a short period of time. As this Euro-tax goes up, people are laid off and you lose political points. Vote yes to stop debate and you are guaranteed to get economic progress.  So let's put aside our political games. Stop this debate. Move to finality. Consider legitimate amendments. That is what this place is all about--legitimate amendments, not just making political comment.  I summarize this way: This is like moving the goalposts. We have heard a lot from the Democratic leadership which claims they support this bipartisan bill. That is what we are hearing. I know that is what they are telling their constituents as well. I am afraid the actions of the Democratic leadership speak louder than their words. My sense is that there is a political priority to deny President Bush an opportunity to sign a bipartisan bill either this summer or this fall. It seems that the objective is to prevent that Rose Garden signing ceremony from occurring.  Of course, the victims of this strategy happen to be those companies and those workers who are hit by this Euro-tax as it ratchets up. I hope I am wrong. But the record gives me pause. I would hope that those on the other side would put the interests of firms and workers in their States above that of partisan Presidential campaign strategy. If you look at the record, you will see dramatic movements in terms of the demands of people on the other side of the aisle to promote their political message amendments, most often nongermane.  This chart draws from a favorite activity that we have in the Midwest, for example, every time Iowa plays Minnesota, and I am talking, obviously, about football. This jobs in manufacturing bill is near the Senate goal line. Unfortunately, it seems politics is driving the other side to move the goalposts.  When we came into session in January, Senator Frist was criticized by the Democratic leadership for not moving right away this very bill, the jobs in manufacturing bill. At that time, the goalpost was clear--just 5 yards away. Then, after we were finished with the highway bill and a couple other bills, Senator Frist attempted to go to this jobs in manufacturing bill.  Much to my surprise, we were ambushed by the leadership of the other side with unrelated amendments. I thought I had an understanding with the floor manager we were going to do amendments first that were related to the bill and then move to other amendments. That agreement was not carried out. That event caught me off guard. So a second goalpost appeared. It was the overtime amendment of my colleague from Iowa.  Now, it did not matter that we had voted on it previously. It did not matter that the amendment dealt with a proposed--not final but a proposed--Department of Labor regulation. None of that seemed to matter. That amendment was, and is still, a show-stopper to this bipartisan bill. So we are at the second goalpost, as it has been moved.  The demand of the leadership of the other side keeps changing. We were talking about just a single-digit list of amendments and, for the most part, hopefully germane amendments. We are not talking about that anymore. Now, since it looks like an overtime pay vote may be in the picture, there is a goalpost yet further away.  For the first time we are hearing of other amendments--not Finance Committee jurisdiction amendments--such as an increase in the minimum wage, that are new showstoppers.  You can't finish this bill, we are told, even though we are told the substance is great. Nobody seems to disagree on the substance of this. So why can't we get a bill to the President? Even though we don't disagree on the substance, there is still a new goalpost. Heaven help us how all that turns out.  There is a final goalpost way out there; that is, getting to conference. We may move through all the goalposts, but then we may be blocked on whether we get to conference. I hope I am proven wrong in a few minutes as we vote on this measure.  If we can't get cooperation from the other side, we have a couple alternatives: One, to go on with other business; two, to look at reconciliation in late spring. I don't want to go with either of those options because we can finish this bill now. There is always a time when the Senate has goodwill between the two parties represented. That goodwill hopefully will surface just as cream surfaces on milk.  Now it is time to get the job done. I hope we can pass this FSC/ETI legislation. It is bipartisan. That is the only way you get things done in the Senate. Consequently, because it is bipartisan, we ought to get it done. And because it is bipartisan, it deserves better treatment than it has received thus far.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
