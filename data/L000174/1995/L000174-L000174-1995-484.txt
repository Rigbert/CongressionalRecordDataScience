President, let me conclude with this: No Member disagrees that we want to keep smut out of the hands of our children. I would remind everybody that the Internet has become the tremendous success it is because it did not have Big Brother, the Federal Government, trying to micromanage what it does and trying to tell users what it could do.  If the Government had been in charge of figuring out how to expand the Internet or make it more available and so on, I guarantee it would not be one-tenth the success it is today.  In our appropriate zeal to go after child pornographers, let the Senate not kill the Internet or smother it for the 99.9 percent of the people who use it legitimately, the scholars who use it legitimately, the people who use it for legitimate on-line discussion groups, the people who gather information from it, the constituents who use it to contact my office and other offices, and those who find a way to access information that they have never had before in their lives.  That is why, Mr. President, earlier I printed in the Record a list of everybody from librarians to publishers to newspaper editors to civil liberties groups who support my alternative approach in my amendment.  I am perfectly willing, if the managers are here and they want to move forward, to yield back the remaining time.
