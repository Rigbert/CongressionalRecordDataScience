Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona and Riverside County at large are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Greg Irvine is one of these individuals. On April 15, 2015, Greg will be honored for his dedicated service as he ends his tenure as the Assistant City Manager for the City of Corona.  Greg's work with the City of Corona began in 1996 when he first served as the Assistant City Treasurer. Greg was then promoted to Interim City Treasurer and would later be promoted again to serve as Assistant General Manager for the Department of Water and Power. Greg was then moved to be the Assistant to the City Manager and in August of 2004, he was appointed to Assistant City Manager. It was in this capacity that he oversaw public policy for the City of Corona which encompassed legislative advocacy and city communications as well as marketing efforts. Given his depth of experience through his service as Assistant and Interim City Treasurer, he also had the executive responsibility for the Finance Department. His knowledge was helpful for Corona in steering through the recession and has been commended by several City Council Members. Additionally, Greg's involvement in the community goes far beyond the doors of City Hall. He has been an active participant in numerous community service organizations throughout Corona.  In light of all Greg Irvine has done for the community of Corona, I wish him the best as he embarks on his retirement. Greg's tireless passion for the community has contributed immensely to the betterment of Corona, California. I am proud to call Greg a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he ends his time as Assistant City Manager for the City of Corona.                          ____________________
