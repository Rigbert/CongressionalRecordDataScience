 President, let us set the record straight. This is not a tax increase. This is a loophole closure for people who live overseas. Taxpayer dollars should, in fact, not be subsidizing an employer's cost of sending an employee overseas. This subsidy equals $98,000 of taxes for each employee each year. Repeal will not cause people to be double taxed because of the fact that the foreign tax credit can be used against American taxes owed. A vote for the Breaux amendment will in fact gut the dividend exclusion we just passed.
