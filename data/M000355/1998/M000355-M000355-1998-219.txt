 President, I send to the desk two amendments modifying language included on global climate change. Senators Byrd and Hagel have been very involved in this issue and have recommended these changes so that programs can go forward, but Congress will have an opportunity to determine details on the planned activities.  It has been very difficult to pin down just what the administration plans to do in the area of global climate change. I think these amendments strike the appropriate balance and meet the concerns raised by colleagues who want to maintain a U.S. leadership role on environmental issues, yet at the same time preserve the congressional oversight of these activities.  So I send, Mr. President, both of these amendments to the desk.
