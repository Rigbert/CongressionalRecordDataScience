Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of the great state of Alaska and all Americans, I extend heartfelt thanks to Master Sergeant Randolph J. Saunders, who gave more than twenty years of dedicated service in the United States Air Force. He entered active duty on 11 July 1978 and, after less than four years as an administrative specialist, Randy became an enlisted historian. Even before his formal retraining, he demonstrated noteworthy capability as a researcher and writer. Consistently outstanding histories became his hallmark, and these provided senior leaders with the data and analysis they needed to make informed, well reasoned decisions. The recipient of numerous command and Air Force-level awards over the next sixteen years, Sergeant Saunders earned a reputation as one who could quickly rebuild faltering unit history programs. He did this from Alaska to Texas, Idaho, Korea, California, and Colorado. Ultimately, Randy was hand picked to become the first-ever senior enlisted historian at Headquarters, Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In a matter of months, Randy's unparalled leadership rendered that command's field history program the best in the entire Air Force. We deeply appreciate Sergeant Saunder's contribution to the preservation of the United States Air Force history. I personally wish him and his entire family all the best as they return to civilian life.                          ____________________
