Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago today, December 5, 1955, the Montgomery bus boycott began after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus. It marked the beginning of a long and difficult struggle toward equal rights and civil rights in this Nation.  Forty years later, those signs that I saw growing up in the rural south, those signs that said colored men, white men, colored women, white women, colored waiting, white waiting, are gone.  We have witnessed what I like to call a nonviolent revolution in America. It is a time and a period that we will never go back to, but we must never forget.  On the occasion of this important anniversary, I want to pay tribute to the leaders of that struggle, to Rosa Parks and to my late great mentor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  We have come a long way toward achieving what Dr. King called the ``beloved community'', but we still have a long way to go. Let us, on this anniversary, rededicate ourselves to building a truly inter-racial democracy in America. For in truth, we are one nation, one people, one house, the American House.                          ____________________
