President, this amendment allows several States to go forward with some of the most innovative work being done in health care in America--in Senator McCain's State and my own, several others. This amendment is budget neutral, but in our home State of Oregon, through the Oregon Health Plan, we have been able to serve upwards of 100,000 low-income families with an innovative approach. The administration supports these efforts. It is a chance to go forward in innovative health care, a critically important issue at this time.  I hope my colleagues will support this budget-neutral measure. I yield the floor.
