 President, I would like take a moment today to recognize Mary McBride for her years of service to the U.S. Senate and the people of Washington State. Mary served on my staff for the last 9 years of her distinguished public career. Prior to her service in my office, Mary served as the Washington State Director of USDA Rural Development during the Clinton administration. As of March 1, 2010, Mary is assuming yet another role in the Federal Government as Region X Administrator for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  Mary is a thoughtful and dedicated public servant. She covered three diverse regions in Washington State on my behalf: central Washington, the Olympic Peninsula, and South Puget Sound. The issues facing each of these regions differ greatly, and Mary was able to immerse herself in the concerns facing my constituents and build lasting relationships in each community. Whether working on farm worker housing, economic development or gang violence, Mary approached each topic with an outstanding knowledge of the Federal process and resources and with a strong commitment to solving problems and creating opportunity.  I would like to thank Mary for her years of service to me and the people of Washington State. Her career is a tremendous example of public service, and her dedication to her work is truly appreciated. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors and know that her many talents will continue to serve the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration.                          ____________________
