 The Supreme Court addresses issue advocacy; that is, the way others are able to criticize our records.  What the Senator from Massachusetts is saying, I think, is that he would like that criticism to be less effective. In other words, do not use something really effective like television, just go out and go door to door. There isn't any chance the Supreme Court is going to say, ``Deny to an aggrieved group the opportunity to use the most effective way to criticize our records,'' which we all know requires: (a) The expenditure of money, and (b) the use of television. That is the easiest way for that criticism to have an impact.  The good news is--the good news is--there is virtually no chance that any court in America would uphold the kinds of restrictions on issue advocacy by groups that are contained not only in the original McCain-Feingold bill but in the substitute that in all likelihood will be offered Monday. That is the good news.  I thank my friend from Utah.
