President, it is my pleasure today to bring to the attention of the Senate the important work the members and staff of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board have accomplished during their first 20 years of service to protect Vermont's working landscape and to help ensure that Vermonters have safe and affordable places to call home.  Since 1987, VHCB, its board members and staff have invested in 427 farms, resulting in the conservation of 118,500 acres of farmland; protected 250,000 acres of recreational and natural areas; and constructed or rehabilitated 8500 units of affordable housing. This has been a conscious investment of $200 million in our Green Mountains, leveraging an additional $750 million from public and private sources. Few organizations can boast the stimulus of $1 billion in two short decades.  For centuries, Vermonters have made their livings working the land. As land use patterns drastically change across the country, including in the valleys of Vermont, VHCB has helped many farmers and communities conserve the rural working landscape that has come to define Vermont and the way of life in our State's communities. VHCB has become a national leader in farmland protection practices--educating family farmers how they can make money protecting working farmland and rural landscape for generations to come. Theprotections VHCB has been able to offer Vermont's farmers have resulted in hundreds of farms remaining active and contributing members of their communities, allowing them to remain Vermont's ultimate environmental stewards. VHCB's expertise also allowed me to work with them to implement a farm preservation pilot program in Vermont that has since become known as the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, a national farmland protection program. Today, this program has protected nearly a half million acres of farmland in 42 States nationwide.  For centuries, the very same farmers who have lived off the land have become well known for their love of fishing, hunting, hiking and snowmobiling across Vermont's forests and open spaces. With encroaching urban sprawl and changing demographics, these lands, too, have been dwindling. VHCB has made it a priority to preserve these natural lands and access to these lands, conserving a quarter of a million acres of these green spaces.  As a dual mission organization, VHCB has also led the country in developing and administering steady private, State and Federal funding sources for the preservation, development and rehabilitation of quality affordable housing in all corners of Vermont. These homes, like the great pieces of granite my grandfather once cut out of the mountainsides of Vermont, are the foundations for the future of Vermont. Additionally, many of these homes are designated perpetually affordable, ensuring that generations of Vermonters will have places to call home. Recently the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development named Vermont's federally funded HOME program, administered by VHCB, as the most effective program among 51 participating jurisdictions in the country for the fourth quarter in a row.  Like so many Vermonters, I live in a rather old house in the Green Mountains. At least half of Vermont's housing stock is estimated to be more than 50 years old, and many are more than a century old. With this Yankee character comes a great danger that VHCB has identified and tackled with great skill: lead poisoning. The most common cause of lead poisoning is exposure to dust from deteriorated lead-based paint in a child's home or daycare. The Vermont Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Program, administered by VHCB, has provided technical and financial assistance to eligible landlords and homeowners to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in Vermont's buildings and homes.  Since the very beginning, my good friend Gus Seelig has steered this organization through both calm and stormy weather. Like any good leader, I am certain that Gus would say this organization owes a great deal of its success to its many past and present board members and staff. On behalf of the people of Vermont, I thank and applaud everyone who has worked to make the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board a success. Congratulations on 20 great years preserving the character and affordability of Vermont.                          ____________________
