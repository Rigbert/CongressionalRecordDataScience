President, I rise today to introduce the Lubec Safe Harbor Act of 2001.  Small communities up and down the coast of Maine literally depend upon the sea for their survival. From the rich fishing grounds that supply Maine's great fishing industry to the beautiful coastlines that draw tourist by both land and water, the sea provides Maine's coastal communities with their livelihoods.  But while the sea provides life and income to Maine's coastal communities, it can also take back what it gives.  One small community in Maine that has been particularly hard hit by the sea's fury is Lubec. In 1997, a winter storm took the lives of two Lubec fishermen.  Earlier this year, storms destabilized the existing wave attenuation system in Lubec and consequently caused extensive damage to the Lubec marina. The destruction has been very difficult for this small town, whose existence, like many coastal Maine communities, is largely dependent on fishing and tourists who arrive by boat. Without the attenuator, the marina, the pier, and the harbor will cease to function effectively. Without a harbor, Lubec can neither support its fishing industry nor provide landing capacity for tour boats. Without a safe berth for their boats, the lives of Lubec's fishermen are further at risk.  Today, I am introducing legislation that directs the Army Corps of Engineers to construct a wave attenuation system for the Town of Lubec. For the sake of the safety of the fishermen of Lubec and the well being of the community, this legislation directs the Army Corps to begin work immediately. My legislation authorizes $2.2 million dollars for the Army Corps to complete this project.  I call upon my colleagues to recognize the urgency of this situation. The longer Lubec goes without a safe harbor, the greater the risk to the lives of Lubec's fishermen, and the greater the threat to the economic well-being of this coastal community. I ask my colleagues to help me pass this legislation as soon as possible.  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. I know she will also work very hard on behalf of the people of Lubec to see this legislation enacted.                                 ______                                       By
