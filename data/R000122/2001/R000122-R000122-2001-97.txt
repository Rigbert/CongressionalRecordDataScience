President, I rise today to join Cambodian-Americans in celebration of the traditional Cambodian New Year, Chaul Chhnam, one of the major celebrations of the Cambodian culture. For three days this month, there will be gatherings across the United States to celebrate the beginning of the year. I take this opportunity to wish all Cambodian Americans a very happy New Year.  New Year celebrations are about the passing of time and the rejuvenation of optimism for the future. The Cambodian New Year is this and more. It represents a traditional end of the harvest and a celebration of faith. Traditionally, it was a time for farmers to enjoy the fruits of their harvest and relax before the rainy season began. The start of the New Year is marked by the sounding of a bell. With the sounding, it is believed that the New Angel arrives. Throughout the day people participate in ceremonies and bring food to the Buddhist monks and religious leaders. The second day of celebration, or Vana Bat, is a time to show consideration for others. Gifts are given to parents, grandparents and teachers as a show of respect and charity is offered to the less fortunate. The third day, or Loeng Sak, includes more religious ceremonies and rituals to bring good luck and happiness to families.  In my home state of Rhode Island there are numerous businesses owned by Cambodian-American families, most of them in the capital city Providence. These families enrich Rhode Island with their diversity and culture, and their hard work contributes much to the local economy. I would like to wish each one of them a happy New Year.  The Cambodian New Year is an appropriate time to remind all Americans why we must support the political and economic stabilization of Cambodia. As Cambodia continues to recover from three decades of civil conflict, including the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge, it is critical that the United States and international community aid the Cambodian people in their efforts to build a lasting democracy.  As we approach the beginning of Chaul Chhnam, I encourage all U.S.citizens to join in the spirit of this special holiday.                          ____________________
