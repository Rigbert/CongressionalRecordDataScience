If it is good enough for us, it is good enough for America. Some 250 private insurance companies across America sell insurance to Federal employees and to Members of Congress. What we want to do is make that insurance available to small businesses. The $8 billion in this bill could be used to help small businesses pay for the health insurance premiums of lower income employees. Instead of focusing on the healthy and wealthy, we would be focusing on businesses that want to do the right thing and need a helping hand from the Tax Code.  I ask the Senator from Michigan, if we are going to invest money to try to deal with 48 million uninsured and underinsured Americans, wouldn't it be better to expand opportunities for small business than to focus on those among us who are already pretty well off?
