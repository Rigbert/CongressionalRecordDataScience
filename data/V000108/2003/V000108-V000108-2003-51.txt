Hank Stram on his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Hank Stram's path to football greatness began many years ago when he was an athletic standout at Lew Wallace High School in Gary, Indiana earning all-state honors as halfback. On Sunday, August 3, 2003, Hank Stram received the ultimate honor with his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.  After graduating from Lew Wallace High School, Stram attended Purdue University on a football scholarship. He earned four letters in baseball and three in football for the Boilermakers. His collegiate career was interrupted for three years of military service in World War II. During his senior year at Purdue, Stram received the coveted Big Ten Medal that is awarded to the conference athlete who best combines athletics with academics.  Immediately upon graduation in 1948, Stram joined Purdue's football coaching staff. He served 12 years as an assistant on the collegiate level, with stops at Southern Methodist, Notre Dame and Miami (Florida).  In 1960 he was named head coach of the Dallas Texans in the new American Football League. The rest is history. Stram guided the Texans to the AFL championship in 1962 and the team then moved to Kansas City and became the Chiefs. In Kansas City, Stram led the Chiefs to the 1966 and 1969 AFL Championships.  His 1966 Kansas City team played in the first Super Bowl, losing to the Green BayPackers. The highlight of Stram's illustrious coaching career came on January 11, 1970, when the Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 23-7, in Super Bowl IV. He also led the Chiefs to playoff appearances in 1968 and 1971.  Strarn coached 17 years in professional football and had a career won-lost-tied record of 136-100-10. His victory total is 11th on the all-time NFL coaches list. He finished his career with 2 seasons, 1976 and 1977, as head coach of the New Orleans Saints.  Hank Stram was known by his players and colleagues as being a truly innovative coach with ideas that inspired and motivated his players and all those who had the opportunity to work with him throughout his career. At the age of 80, Stram continues to provide motivation for area athletes. Every year, the Silver Bell Club, Lodge 2365 of the Polish National Alliance of the United Slates, hosts its Hank Stram--Tony Zale Sports Award Banquet to honor young athletes in Northwest Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending and applauding Hank Stram, a true sports hero who has achieved greatness. His lifetime of devotion to his players, fans, and family will truly be celebrated and remembered.                          ____________________
