 President, let me say to my friend from Nevada, we fully understand the minority or, for that matter, any Member of the Senate has a right to offer a nongermane amendment to an underlying piece of legislation, but we had an unfortunate experience earlier this very week in which the offering and the adoption of amendments unrelated to the underlying bill ended up killing the bill that both the Senator from Nevada and myself had hoped would pass.  We already had one vote on the overtime issue late last year. I do not know how many times the minority would like for us to repeat that vote.  It is the belief of this Senator that on a bipartisan basis Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus would like to pass the FSC/ETI bill without any unrelated amendments on it. There is some resistance on this side of the aisle to repeatedly voting over and over again on amendments upon which we have already had a vote.  That having been said, I fully understand what the Senator is saying, that they would like to have a vote on the overtime issue. I don't think that is necessarily the view of everyone on that side of the aisle but may well be the view of the majority on that side of the aisle.                          ____________________
