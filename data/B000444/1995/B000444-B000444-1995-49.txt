 President, we are being asked to vote on the antitrust provisions of this conference report. As I understand it, these provisions would allow doctors to form Medicare provider networks--similar to existing managed care networks that are run by insurance companies--without running afoul of the per se standards of anti-trust law.  This provision violates the Byrd law. It is extraneous. It has no effect on the deficit, and therefore it does not belong in the budget reconciliation bill.  Furthermore, Madam President, this issue has just now been brought before the Senate. There was no similar provision in the Senate version of the reconciliation bill. There have not been hearings before the Judiciary Committee. And, we have not had a chance to examine the effects of this change in anti-trust law.  But, let me say that as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I would be happy to give this matter full consideration. We should find out whether the change proposed here would really create more competition in the health care sector of the economy--and we should examine whether this would be a benefit to rural areas of the country.  And, frankly, in this new health care climate, with the emphasis on big insurance companies running managed care plans like HMO's, doctors need some protection. I have told physicians in Delaware that I am willing to help find ways to ensure that doctors can be doctors. I think that if doctors ran the managed care networks, we might all be better off. If that means that we must provide anti-trust relief, then I am willing to look closely at it.  But, I cannot support doing it here--doing it now--on a bill that is supposed to reduce the deficit. Therefore, I will support stripping this provision from the bill, and I will vote against the motion to waive the rules for physician anti-trust relief.  I hope, however, that we will look at this more closely, in a more rational way, on another day.
