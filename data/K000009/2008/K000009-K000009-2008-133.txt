I rise to recognize the sesquicentennial celebration of Davis College in Northwest Ohio. The Toledo, Ohio college has offered post-secondary business education to generations of students for 150 years and continues to grow.   Toledo Business College was established in 1858. It came into its own in 1881, when ``Matthew H. Davis left his chairmanship in the mathematics department and his position as director of the business department at Albert College, Belleville, Ontario, to accept the management of Toledo Business College.'' Under his tutelage the school grew tenfold, from 35 students to 350.   The college's history recounts that under Davis' direction, four other schools were absorbed and the school was renamed Davis Business College. ``The curriculum was gradually changed from Latin, German, Greek, calculus, and epistolary writing to banking, mercantile trades, shorthand, and typing.   ``After Davis' death in 1904, his son, Thurber P. Davis, left the University of Michigan to take over the management of Davis Business College. Under the leadership of the younger Davis, electric typewriters were added, making the College one of the best equipped in the United States. Stenotype and data processing augmented the expanding curriculum.   ``In 1948, when Thurber became ill, his daughter, Ruth L. Davis, became the third generation of the Davis family to lead the school. In 1953, Davis Business College was among the first to be accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Business Schools. In 1964, it met commission requirements for a junior college of business. Office management, payroll accounting, and the Automation Institute were added to meet the growing needs of business and technology.   ``In 1983, John Lambert became President of Davis College. President Lambert expanded the Davis curriculum to include allied health, aviation, computer, and graphic design programs, which doubled the College's enrollment. In 1986, Davis met the requirements for accreditation by the American Association of Medical Assistants. In 1991, Davis College was granted accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association.   ``In 1993, Diane Brunner became the fifth President of Davis College. At the time of her appointment, she was the youngest female college president in Ohio. In 2002, Davis College hosted its first student conference, bringing nationally renowned authors to the institution. As was true of all past Davis College leadership, President Brunner is dedicated to the promotion of higher educational standards and continuing the College's service to the community.''   This family owned century business in Toledo, Ohio remains a standard of business education in our region, all the while expanding into other fields of study. In the present day, the college was named as one of the 2008 Ohio's best employers by the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. This year as well, Davis College earned the Better Business Bureau's Torch Award for marketplace ethics. As Davis College grows into its third century in the business of educating people, it remains true to its founders' dedication to preparing its students for success while adhering to the highest standards and latest technologies in the fields of study. Standing on the shoulders of those who built its foundation, Davis College honors the vision of its past leaders while looking forward to a bright future.                          ____________________
