 I would just say that I can't believe that I hurried back from Chicago this morning to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to actually engage my friend and fellow Senator from West Virginia in any debate about the Constitution. I plead nolo contendere. I am not able to join you in that. And I can't even reach back in Greek or Roman history for any kind of solace or defense.  I am not sure who the author was, it could have been a Greek or Roman, maybe a West Virginian, or even an Illinoisan, who once said the profound statement, ``What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,'' and that is what I am attempting to argue here. That is, if we are going to impose on the executive branch a requirement to produce the nominee in 150 days, or if the time goes beyond that to suffer the possibility of not having an acting person in that slot, then we should accept the responsibility on the Senate side as well, to act in a timely manner on these nominees.
