I understand I am to be given some 40 minutes after the vote at the conclusion of the remarks by Senator Brown of Ohio. I have a subject that is very significant, and it is one I cannot do while being interrupted. So I appreciate starting this period off after the recess being able to express my concern over what I refer to as President Obama's war on fossil fuels and specifically today on coal. I look forward to that sometime around the 6 o'clock hour.  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
