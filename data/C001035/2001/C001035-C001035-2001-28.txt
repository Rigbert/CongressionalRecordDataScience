Katie worked as an intern in my office during this past summer and she is so like her mother--bright, cheerful, strong, and hard working. Mary's legacy is reflected in those terrific daughters, as well as in her professional career. I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to have been her friend.                             Exhibit No. 1     Eulogy by William S. Cohen of Mary Gerwin, September 22, 2001       We have all been overwhelmed and immobilized by grief in      the days since the terrorist attacks last week. Grief has had      the power to silence us, to bring us together, to rouse us to      action. As we have gathered around television sets since      September 11, staring mutely at the incomprehensible carnage      and horror, we may have had some acquaintance with the      victims or we have simply grieved for our nation and our      fellow citizens.       Today is different. Today, we are truly taking note of a      death in the family. A death in Mary's immediate family, of      course, but also in the family of unique individuals I have      been privileged to assemble and work with during years in      Congress, the Pentagon, and beyond. This is a team of      talented men and women who are bound together by many      invisible threads, who have worked together, played together,      sometimes fought together, and looked after each other for      more than 25 years.       Mary's death has brought us here today, and we grieve and      we are angry. Angry that she was so sick for so long, angry      that she left us at such a ridiculously young age. But even      in our anger and our grief, we celebrate her. Everyone in      this room knew Mary as a colleague, an employee, a boss, a      mother, a daughter, a sister, a wife, or a friend. I'd like      to talk about the Mary I knew, the Mary all of us knew.       My friendship with Mary started 20 years age. I was a      freshman senator, and she was a kid from Portland who had      just gotten out of law school. She came to work for me and,      unbeknownst to either of us, we started an adventure together      that led to writing and changing major laws in this country,      led to her visiting and working with US troops in Korea,      Bosnia and Saudi Arabia, led to her working with refugee      camps in Kosovo, and led to a friendship as well.       But it started for both of us in Maine. Mary didn't come      from a well-to-do family. Neither did I. Mary lost her dad      when she was just a baby, and her Mother worked at the      railroad and raised four terrific kids on her own. Mary knew      how real people in Maine worked and loved and struggled, and      that knowledge made her very effective when she helped to      write and rewrite the laws that affected their lives.       Mary and I had something else in common. We both started      out as practicing lawyers. But not for long. We were both      drawn to the greater possibilities of public service. Mary      graduated cum laude from Georgetown Law and spent a very      short and uninspiring few months at a law firm, which      prompted her to look for work on the Hill. It was one of the      luckiest things that could have happened to me.       It seemed there was nothing Mary couldn't do. She worked      closely with a great team that included another remarkable      young woman named Susan Collins, whose service as a United      States Senator today makes us     all very proud. Together, this group ran a subcommittee that      oversaw how government programs are run and tried to improve      them. Later, Mary ran the staff of the Senate Aging Committee      as well, working to improve the lives of older Americans.       Once I got to know Mary and her work habits, I used to joke      with her that the Nuns must have really gotten to her in      Catholic school--I had never seen anyone who would stay so      late, work so hard, or be so easily made to feel guilty about      leaving anything undone. A simple raised eyebrow could send      her back to her desk until midnight.       A truly dedicated mother, Mary understood deeply the      difficult balance between being a good parent and being a      professional. But instead of complaining about it, she took      action--helping to create the Senate Child Care Center so      that her children and others could get the highest quality      child care and pre-school education.       Because of Mary Gerwin and her energy and innate sense of      fairness and compassion, here are some of the ways our      country is different, and better:       --Disabled Americans live in greater dignity,       --
