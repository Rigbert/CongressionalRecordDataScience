Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  Since 1989, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act has required that each Federal dollar spent on the conservation project be matched by private, non-governmental money. However, due to the irreplaceable nature of the breeding waterfowl habitat in Canada, a decision was made not to require matching funds for Canadian projects from private Canadian sources.  As a result of the economic downturn, however, it has become increasingly difficult to meet the 100 percent matching requirement here in the United States. According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, there will be some $70 million worth of projects in Canada during the current 5-year funding cycle which began in 2007. Under the current law, this means that $70 million in private matching money must be provided.  Under H.R. 3433, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act would be amended to require at least 50 percent of non-Federal share of projects in Canada be paid for by Canadian non-governmental entities. There was unanimous support for this measure during our committee markup, and this is an appropriate change in our Federal law.  I would also like to compliment the author of this bill, Congressman Wittman of Virginia, for his outstanding leadership and for his service on the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission.  I urge an ``aye'' vote.
