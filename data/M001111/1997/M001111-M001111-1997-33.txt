 President, today I am introducing legislation to amend a controversial provision in last year's illegal immigration legislation that threatens to stifle legal travel and commerce between the United States and Canada.  Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Reform Act requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop an automated entry and exit system for the purpose of documenting the entry and departure of every alien entering and leaving the United States. The legislation I am introducing today, will amend the illegal immigration legislation to clarify that records of entry and departure are not required for Canadians. This is consistent with long-standing U.S. policy toward Canadian citizens traveling to the United States.  My constituents are extremely concerned about the onerous implications of section 110. As a frequent visitor to Bellingham and Whatcom County, I hear again and again from the local community about the importance of unimpeded travel between the United States and Canada. I've visited the border crossings at Blaine, WA. At certain times, travel between the United States and Canada is already subject to lengthy delays and traffic back-ups that sometimes exceed 1 mile in length. Section 110 will further complicate border crossings if it is ever instituted on our northern border.  I have been a long proponent of strengthening and promoting the partnership between Washington State and British Columbia, Canada. British Columbia is a billion dollar neighbor for my State, generating jobs and economic activity important to all of Washington. Canadian tourism and commerce is particularly important to Bellingham and northwest Washington where border trade thrives to the benefit of both Americans and Canadians.  This legislative initiative follows up on a late 1996 letter I sent to Attorney General Janet Reno inquiring about section 110. The letter expressed my strong opposition to a border fee or other interpretation of section 110 which would inhibit legal tourism and trade between the United States and Canada. I continue to vigorously oppose nuisance measures that will unduly delay legal border crossings. A border tax is the most obvious nuisance measure, however, section 110 if fully implemented will have a potentially disastrous impact on communities in my state.  I do not expect section 110 to ever be applied to Canadians. To do so, would be a phenomenal waste of limited resources. We can't neglect our northern Border, but we can certainly be a lot smarter. Exempting Canadians from section 110 is the smart thing, the right thing to do.  I encourage my colleagues to review this important legislation and to join me in supporting the passage of this legislative exemption at the earliest opportunity.                                 ______                                       By
