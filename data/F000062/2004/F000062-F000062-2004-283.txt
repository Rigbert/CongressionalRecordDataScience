 President, I briefly engage the distinguished majority leader in a colloquy about an issue of great importance to me State. I am pleased that the legislation before us provides $225 million in badly needed assistance to help the State of California recover from last autumn's devastating wildfires and to prevent asimilar tragedy in the future. Of this total made available, $25 million is provided to compensate California's farmers who suffered losses in the fires.  The package of aid that I drafted contained language that would have deemed losses suffered in those fires to be the result of a natural disaster, raised the cap on payments for those losses under the Tree Assistance Program to $200,000, and would have provided upfront payments under that program instead of reimbursements for replacement costs.  It it my understanding that a portion of the language was inadvertently left out of the final conference agreement that I had discussed with the majority leader and his staff. Is that the majority leader's understanding?
