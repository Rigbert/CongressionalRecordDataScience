 President, last year, I cosponsored the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2013. The sponsor of the bill is reintroducing the bill with some modifications. While I am again cosponsoring this new bill, I wanted to remind my colleagues of my concerns related to the visa waiver section of the bill. The Visa Waiver Program is a benefit to other countries, and they are allowed to participate after meeting certain conditions, which are laid out in statute. A section in the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act provides authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive the requirements and allow Israel to participate in the program. Specifically, under the legislation, Israel would not have to abide by the low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate standard. As I stated previously, I am concerned about this section of the bill because it sets a precedent for other countries not to have to abide by all the terms of the program. Neither Congress or the executive branch should be making exceptions to the rules. I support the bill because it reaffirms the United States' partnership with Israel, however, we need to be cautious in relaxing the rules regarding the Visa Waiver Program.                          ____________________
