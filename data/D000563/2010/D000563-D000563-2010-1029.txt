President, last night a number of Senators stayed on the floor until almost midnight--I thank the staff and pages for their endurance and patience.  This was over an issue that was critically important to our Nation. It is an issue which relates to this recession we are in and the fact that literally millions of Americans in every State across America are out of work and doing their very best to find jobs. It is not easy.
