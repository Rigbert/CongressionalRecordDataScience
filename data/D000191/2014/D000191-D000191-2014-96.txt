Speaker, I commend Representative Carney for proposing fixes to the Affordable Care Act. Since the law was passed, I have said that parts of the Affordable Care Act need to be improved or changed. As Representative Carney has identified, there is no question that Congress needs to clarify how the law is applied to expatriate plans. The Administration has correctly exempted these plans from some ACA requirements that do not make sense for plans used primarily overseas, but the Administration is only able to provide temporary exemptions without congressional action. I am confident that the Senate will be able to make the needed targeted changes to H.R. 4414 so that it can pass both houses of Congress and gain the support of the Administration. I look forward to working with Representative Carney to make sure that legislation providing proper clarity to expatriate plans is signed in to law.
