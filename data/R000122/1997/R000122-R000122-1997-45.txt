It would provide for strict codification of the Beck decision, not circumscribe and prevent labor from participating in elections, but codify the Supreme Court decision, allowing the notification of the use of funds for political purposes by unions and also reduction for those individual members who object to such uses. Also, it will put limits on party assistance of wealthy candidates and the ban of foreign money into American campaigns. This is fundamental, necessary reform of our campaign system. I argue in fact that as worthy as these reforms are, we would have to go further. But today at least let us take the step forward for this sensible, moderate balanced reform, which the American people are demanding.  There are States in this country that have taken the step, have gone much further and passed expenditure caps on campaigns, that are experimenting with other ways in which they want the issues to be decided by candidates based upon their positions, not by campaign committees based on their balances in their checking accounts. We should take the step forward today. We should in fact resist the Lott amendment, which would derail meaningful campaign finance reform. We should rather urge that we, as the Senate of this great country, proudly step forth and endorse meaningful campaign finance reform. Many years ago, in 1914, the New England poet Robert Frost wrote: ``Good fences make good neighbors.''  Well, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to campaign finance reform, all our fences are down. They have been demolished by a flood of cash running into elections. Unless we build good, strong fences, we can't be good neighbors or good candidates or indeed good citizens. We need to reform our campaign finance system, we need to begin today by defeating the Lott amendment and moving forward to pass the McCain-Feingold legislation.  I yield the balance of my time.
