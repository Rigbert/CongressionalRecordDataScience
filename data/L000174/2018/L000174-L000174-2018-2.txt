Preident, you wouldn't guess it, but North Dakota and Vermont are more alike than they are different. Both depend on agriculture and small businesses to support rural communities. Likewise, Senator Heitkamp and I are not all that different: We are both natives of our States, and we both are committed to working across the aisle to get things done.  Before running for the Senate, Senator Heitkamp served as North Dakota's attorney general, where she worked to keep communities safe, much as I did as State's attorney in Vermont before I first ran for the Senate. One of her biggest achievements as State attorney general was forcing the tobacco industry to tell the public the truth about the health risks of smoking, and securing a settlement of $336 million in damages for North Dakota taxpayers.  Senator Heitkamp was a strong cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. We worked together closely to include provisions to protect Native American victims of domestic violence, human trafficking, and sexual assault. These protections were sorely needed, and it was an honor to fight with her for their inclusion. She also introduced and helped usher into law the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children Act, which works to ensure that Native children and families have access to critical economic and educational resources.  North Dakota, like Vermont, struggles with affordable housing and a rural housing shortage. As a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator Heitkamp worked to help families achieve stable housing. She sought housing finance reform and relief for community banks and credit unions, giving more rural families access to the economic tools they need to thrive.  Senator Heitkamp and I have served together on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, working most recently to pass a comprehensive and bipartisan farm bill to support the hard work of our farmers, who are the backbone of our rural communities, and to address nutrition and food insecurity challenges across the country and abroad. Senator Heitkamp has been committed to ensuring we invest in our rural infrastructure and business development, and North Dakota is stronger for that.  Senator Heidi Heitkamp has been a tireless champion for the people of North Dakota for longer than just her term in the Senate, and although I will miss her, I know she will continue to serve her State in other ways for years to come. Marcelle and I wish her and Darwin the very best.                          ____________________
