President, this past Sunday marked the start of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year to refocus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims.  This year, the Senate had been scheduled to mark the occasion by taking up S.J. Res. 1, a proposed constitutional amendment. Once again, we were going to devote days or weeks debating that proposal, even though the Republican leadership knew it had no real chance of garnering the two-thirds super-majority needed to pass. We went through a similar process four years ago, in April 2000, when the Senate debated an earlier version of the amendment during the last presidential election year.  I noted then, during that earlier debate, the fact that I have long worked to protect and advance crime victims' rights. As a prosecutor, I worked day to day and year to year alongside victims, seeking justice on their behalf. I have worked on and led many legislative efforts on behalf of victims throughout my service in the Senate. One of the most recent of those efforts was the creation of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, and I am grateful to have been able to take part in something that has brought some relief to so many victims.  I will never forget the victims I worked with as a prosecutor or the needs of the new victims minted each day through the crimes committed against them. I believe that victims should be notified when the defendant is in court or when he is about to be released. I believe that victims should be heard at critical stages of the prosecution. I believe that victims are entitled to restitution from offenders. In recent years, the debate was never about whether victims should be protected--of course they should. Rather, the debate was about how they should be protected, and whether the proposed constitutional amendment was the best way to do that.  I did not think the proposed amendment was the best way forward. The one thing about which every witness who testified on this issue agreed was that every right provided by the Victims Rights Amendment can be, or already is, protected by State or federal statutory law.  We have long had it in our power to enhance victims' rights through regular legislation legislation that could pass with a simple majority and make an immediate difference in the lives of crime victims. Legislative enhancements are more easily enacted, more directly applied and implemented, and more able to provide specific, effective remedies. In addition, as Chief Justice Rehnquist and others have pointed out, statutes are more easily corrected if we find, in hindsight, that they need correction, clarification or improvement.  I am delighted to be here today with the principal sponsors of S.J. Res. 1, the distinguished Senators from California and Arizona, and with others, both supporters and opponents of the constitutional amendment, to join together in our support of this crime victims' rights statute. I commend and admire Senator Feinstein and Senator Kyl for their dedication to this issue. They are deeply committed to the cause of victims' rights as are all of us who have joined together to offer this bill. It is my hope that this statute will establish more effective and enforceable rights for crime victims in the federal system, and that it can do so without delay, by a majority vote.  First, unlike S.J. Res. 1, which is limited to victims of violent crime, our statute establishes enhanced rights and protections for all victims of crime. Therefore, the elderly woman who is defrauded out of her life savings will have the same rights of notice and participation as other crime victims.  Second, our statute spells out how these rights are to be enforced, using language that Senator Kennedy and I developed in S. 805, the Crime Victims Assistance Act. In addition to providing victims with standing to assert their rights in mandamus actions, our statute would establish an administrative authority in the Department of Justice to receive and investigate victims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate action on the part of criminal justice and victims' service providers. Department of Justice employees who fail to comply with the law pertaining to the treatment of crime victims could face disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or termination of employment.  Third, our statute incorporates additional proposals from S. 805 to help States implement and enforce their own victims' rights laws. In this way, instead of replacing programs that have already been implemented by a majority of States, our statute enables States to retain their full power to protect victims in the ways most appropriate to local concerns and local needs.  Fourth, our statute calls for two annual reports, one by the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the other by the General Accounting Office. These reports will provide Congress with feedback on how the rights and procedures established by the statute are working in practice. Over time, we will be able to modify and fine-tune the statute so that it provides an appropriate degree of protection for the rights of crime victims.  I emphasize that passage of this bill will necessitate careful oversight of its implementation by Congress. If, as I hope, Federal judges and prosecutors take victims' rights seriously, there should be little need for victims to bring mandamus actions to enforce their rights. But if, for whatever reason, victims feel that they are not being treated fairly, we may see a wave of new litigation in the Federal courts, with victims and their lawyers having to insert themselves into criminal cases. We will need to monitor the situation closely.  I am committed to giving victims real and enforceable rights. But I am convinced that prosecutors should be capable of protecting those rights, once we make them clear. In my experience, prosecutors have victims' interests at heart.  Senator Kennedy and I proposed in the Crime Victims Assistance Act a limited-standing provision, which applied with respect to the victim's right to attend and observe the trial, and under which a victim could assert her right if the prosecutor refused to do so. Passing such a provision would have allowed us to observe over a period of time whether direct participation of victims in criminal proceedings has any unanticipated consequences for the administration of justice.  This Victims' Rights Act proposes a bolder experiment, entitling victims to assert a panoply of rights, regardless of whether the prosecution is already asserting the same rights on their behalf. For example, at the insistence of other sponsors, this bill will enable victims to bring mandamus actions alleging the denial of their statutory right ``to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy,'' which may be difficult claims to adjudicate.  I note with some regret that our statute picks up language from S.J. Res. 1 denying victims a civil cause of action for damages in the event that their rights are violated. Allowing victims to vindicate their rights through separate civil proceedings instead of through mandamus actions in the criminal case could well be a more efficient as well as a more effective way of ensuring that victims' rights are honored. Certainly the prospect of being sued would provide a powerful incentive to take victims' rights seriously. But the Republican sponsors of the bill did not want to provide for damages.  Similarly, some Republican Senators did not want to allow courts to appoint attorneys to help crime victims. It is my hope and belief that victims will seldom need representation, since they already have powerful advocates in our public prosecutors. Still, it is possible that a judge would want to appoint an attorney for a victim in an extraordinary case, as for example if there is a material conflict between the victim's interests and the interests of the prosecution. By failing to provide for this possibility, our new bill may perpetuate a system of unequal justice for victims, where the wealthy have the benefit of counsel, and the poor do not.  Finally, I want to comment on the unusual genesis of this bill, and the extraordinary procedure that I expect it will follow in the Senate. As I mentioned earlier, the Senate was scheduled to begin work this week on the proposed constitutional amendment, S.J. Res. 1. On Wednesday, the Republican leadership moved to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. I would not have opposed this motion. I voted to proceed to an earlier iteration of this constitutional amendment 4 years ago, and I would have been prepared to proceed to it again this week. Given the time this would take and the expected outcome, it could be argued that the Senate already has many pressing matters on its agenda, but I would not have opposed a debate on the constitutional amendment.  Given the Republican leadership's insistence on proceeding to the constitutional amendment this week, there has not been as much time as I would have liked to craft the statutory alternative that we introduce today. And because this bill will come to a vote almost immediately, we will not get to hold hearings on it and polish the text in Committee. I would have liked to get the views of the Office for Victims of Crime. Many victims' groups and domestic violence organizations opposed the constitutional amendment, as did many law professors, judges, and prosecutors. I would have liked to hear their views on this statute. I am concerned that the statute may not adequately address the special problems raised in domestic violence and abuse situations. Fortunately, however, this is a statute, not a constitutional amendment, and it can be modified with relative ease if the need arises.  I commend my good friend, Senator Feinstein, for mediating this consensus legislation. I know that she would have preferred to pass a constitutional amendment--she has made that clear. Nevertheless, she worked hard to produce a bill that we all can support, showing once again that she is first and foremost a legislator who wants to get things done. Due in large part to Senator Feinstein's efforts, we now have an opportunity to advance the cause of victims' rights with strong, practical, bipartisan legislation. I have never doubted Senator Feinstein or Senator Kyl's commitment to victims' rights. I am delighted that we have come together to advance that common cause.  Over more than 20 years I have sponsored and championed legislation to help victims. I have mentioned the recent September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, and I am also proud of such other advancements on behalf of victims as a law to provide assistance to victims of international terrorism, and bills to raise the cap on victims' assistance and compensation programs and to protect the rights of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. The legislation that we introduce today should provide us the opportunity to make progress on yet another important measure to address the needs of victims, and I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By
