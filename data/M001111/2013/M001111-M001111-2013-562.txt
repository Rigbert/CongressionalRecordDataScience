  I wish to especially thank our dean of women, Senator Mikulski, who has made this a lifetime passion to ensure the women who come after her have the strength and ability to participate in the economy in any way they wish. I thank her and the other Senators for their leadership.  Senator Klobuchar will continue this discussion.
