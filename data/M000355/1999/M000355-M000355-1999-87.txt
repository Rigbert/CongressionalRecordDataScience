 The Senator is correct.  Mr. McCONNELL. With this record now made by the Chair, I regret that our Democratic colleagues are blocking amendment consideration during this campaign finance reform bill. What we are trying to do is to give Republican Senators an opportunity to offer amendments. If I understand the Chair correctly, where we are is that without consent, either from the assistant Democratic leader or the Senator from Arizona, my Republican colleagues are not going to be able to offer an amendment.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?  Mr. McCONNELL. I will yield for a question.  Mr. McCAIN. I want to tell the Senator that the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Utah and I and the Senator from Wisconsin are in agreement that an amendment by Senator Bennett and Senator Conrad would be in order, unless the Senator from Wisconsin has additional comments about the pending amendment, but that it is also proper and appropriate to continue the debate until finished on the pending amendment and that, of course, we would like to make sure that any unanimous consent agreement we are in agreement with. I hope the Democratic leader would also agree with that approach to the pending business because I am not in any way in disagreement with the view of the Senator from Kentucky that we need to move forward with the process.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Arizona. Maybe I should make the consent request again.  I ask unanimous consent that the pending two amendments be laid aside in order for Senator Bennett and Senator Burns to offer an amendment regarding Internet free speech and that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote in relation to the amendment. I further ask consent that the vote occur on or in relation to the amendment at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, and that there be 5 minutes equally divided for closing remarks just prior to the vote and, following the debate today, the amendment be laid aside until that time.
