  I wanted to ask a question and share a story with him, because I think what we are talking about in terms of the dropout prevention is so important today.  I am sure the question that the Senator from Nevada hears so often, and the Senator from Illinois hears so often in these debates today is, What role does the Federal Government have in this? Should this be a local decision? Should we just hand the dollars down to our local districts?  What I want to share with you is that I met with a number of students last week in Washington State who had fallen through the cracks. I come from a State where the constitution says it is the paramount duty of the State to provide funding for education, and we do a good job. But we are struggling like everyone else with our budgets at home. This school happened to be in a district that has well-founded schools. This was a young student who had fallen through every single crack and dropped out of school. What brought him back was the Federally funded School-to-Work Program. When I asked the student if the Federal Government had a role, he said, ``Absolutely yes. You need to be there when everybody else fails.''  I am wondering if the Senator from Nevada has heard that as well.
