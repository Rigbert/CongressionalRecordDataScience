 487, the Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization, TEACH, Act. This Act expands the distance learning exemption in our copyright law, acknowledging that changes in technology sometimes require changes in the law. In making this change, the TEACH Act places new limits on the rights of copyright owners. These limits, however, are established in such a way that they will benefit non-profit educational institutions and their students, but hopefully without exposing copyrighted works to any further unauthorized use.  The drafters of the Constitution acknowledged the importance of creative works--and recognized the property rights of the creators of those works--in the very text of the Constitution itself. The Copyright Clause of the Constitution, in protecting the rights of American creators everywhere, has directly translated into the most innovative environment for the creation of creative works we've ever seen. This creativity benefits consumers and our economy as a whole.  Never in our history have we seen such a plethora of choices in books, movies, television, software, and music. One look at the statistics demonstrates the staggering importancecopyrighted works have to the well-being of not only my home state of California, but also the economy of the entire Nation.  It has been reported that the copyright industries are creating jobs at three times the rate of the rest of the economy. These industries have a surplus balance of trade with every single country in the world, and that last year they accounted for 5 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. Few other industries can boast of such a successful record, and the protection we grant to copyrighted works is directly responsible for that success.  The message is clear. Striking the appropriate balance in copyright protection is vital to maintaining consumer choice, and in maintaining this vibrant part of the American economy. Sufficient protection means the continue investment in the production of creative works, which results in greater choices for consumers.  Insufficient protection of copyrighted works, on the other hand, will negatively affect the ability and desire of creators and lawful distributors of such works to make the necessary investment of time, money and other resources to continue to create and offer quality works to the public.  That is why we must carefully consider any degradation of that protection, even when proposed limitations would benefit other important segments of our society, such as the educational community.  I believe that this legislation strikes the appropriate balance by allowing accredited, nonprofit educational institutions to make certain uses of copyrighted works, but requiring them to technologically protect those works to prevent unauthorized uses by others.  The application of appropriate technological protection to copyrighted works is increasingly important as we move from the analog to the digital world Technological protection will facilitate the availability of copyrighted works in high-quality, digital formats and in global, networked environments.  That is why the provisions of this legislation directing the Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property to look at what protective technologies are out there will be of great importance to this Committee in the near future as the online environment and the world of e-commerce develops.  Questions such as whether unilateral protection applied to works by copyright owners will provide a sufficiently secure environment or whether bilateral technologies--which invoke a ``handshake'' of sorts between the work and the machine used to access the work--should be examined more closely have yet to be answered.  This study should help us give us an invaluable resource with regard to renewable, ungradeable, and robust forms of protection that will allow valuable copyrighted works to move freely and securely through the digital environment.                           Amendment No. 793
