President, today, I am introducing the Consular Notification Compliance Act. This legislation will help bring the United States into compliance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, VCCR, and is critical to ensuring the protection of Americans traveling overseas.  Each year, thousands of Americans are arrested and imprisoned when they are in foreign countries studying, working, serving the military, or traveling. From the moment they are detained, their safety and well-being depends, often entirely, on the ability of United States consular officials to meet with them, monitor their treatment, help them obtain legal assistance, and connect them to family back home. That access is protected by the consular notification provisions of the VCCR, but it only functions effectively if every country meets its obligations under the treaty--including the United States.  Unfortunately, in some instances, the United States has not been meeting those obligations. There are currently more than 100 foreign nationals on death row in the United States, most of whom were never told of their right to contact their consulate and their consulate was never notified of their arrest, trial, conviction, or sentence. There are many other foreigners in U.S. prisons awaiting trial for non-capital crimes, some facing life sentences, who were similarly denied consular access. This failure to comply with our treaty obligations undercuts our ability to protect Americans abroad and deeply damages our image as a country that abides by its promises and the rule of law. It would also be completely unacceptable to us if our citizens were treated in this manner.  The Consular Notification Compliance Act seeks to bring the United States one step closer to compliance with the convention. It is not perfect. It focuses only on the most serious cases--those involving the death penalty--but it is a significant step in the right direction and we need to work together to pass it quickly. Texas is poised to execute the next foreign national affected by this failure to comply with the treaty on July 7, 2011. He was not notified of his right to consular assistance, and the Government of Mexico has expressed grave concerns about the case. We do not want this execution to be interpreted as a sign that the United States does not take its treaty obligations seriously. That message puts American lives at risk. The Government of Great Britain has expressed similar concerns about a case involving a British citizen facing the death penalty here, who was denied consular access.  The bill I am introducing would allow foreign nationals who have been convicted and sentenced to death to ask a court to review their cases and determine if the failure to provide consular notification led to an unfair conviction or sentence.  The bill also recognizes that law enforcement and the courts must do a better job in the future to promptly notify individuals of their right to consular assistance so the United States does not find itself in this precarious position again. To that end, the bill reaffirms that the obligations under the treaty are Federal law and apply to all foreign nationals arrested or detained in the United States. For individuals arrested on charges that carry a possible punishment of death, the bill ensures adequate opportunity for consular assistance before a trial begins.  This bill offers very limited remedies to a very limited number of people. I am troubled that it has to be so narrow, as we demand far broader protection for American citizens abroad every day. However, carrying out a death sentence is an irreversible action, and I believe that we must act quickly. I understand that a limited bill has the best chance of achieving the bipartisan support needed to move forward on such an important issue at this time.  Compliance with our consular notification obligations is not a question of partisan interest. There should be unanimous support for this bill. The VCCR was negotiated under President Kennedy, ratified during the Nixon administration, and it has been fully supported by every President since. President George W. Bush understood the critical need to honor our obligations under this treaty. Although he was ultimately unsuccessful, he vigorously worked to bring the United States into compliance, and he supported action along the lines of what I propose today. He understood the implications of non-compliance for our citizens, our businesses, and our military. I have no doubt President Obama shares the same commitment to resolving this issue.  I saw the need to resolve this issue first-hand this spring when a young, innocent Vermont college student was detained by Syrian police simply for taking photos of a demonstration. I worked hard with the U.S. consulate in Syria to obtain access to him. His safety depended on the ability of our consular officers to see him, provide assistance, and monitor his condition.  Similarly, the United States invoked the VCCR to seek access to the three American hikers detained in Iran after accidently crossing an unmarked border in 2009. In 2001, when a U.S. Navy surveillance plane made an emergency landing in Chinese territory, the State Department cited the VCCR in demanding immediate access to the plane's crew.  I doubt there are many Members of Congress who have not sought similar help from our consulates when their constituents have been arrested overseas. We know how critically important this access is, and we expect other governments to provide it. Those governments expect no less of us.  This bill has the support of the Obama administration, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of State. I have heard from retired members of the military urging passage of the bill to protect service men and women and their families overseas, and from former diplomats of both political parties who know that compliance with our treaty obligations is critical for America's national security and commercial interests.  Given the long history of bipartisan support for the VCCR, there should be unanimous support for this legislation to uphold our treaty obligations. A failure to act places Americans at risk.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1194       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

In this Act--       (1) the term ``national of the United States'' has the      meaning given that term in section 101(a)(22) of the      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22)); and       (2) the term ``State'' means any State of the United      States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto      Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States.                                  ____                                                    June 14, 2011.     Re The Consular Notification Compliance Act.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write      to urge you to support prompt passage of the Consular      Notification Compliance Act, legislation that would give      domestic legal effect to U.S. obligations under the Vienna      Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention) to      provide consular access to foreign nationals in U.S. law      enforcement custody by providing for judicial review of      certain claims that this obligation has not been satisfied.      International consular notification and access obligations      are essential to ensuring humane, non-discriminatory      treatment for both non-citizens in U.S. custody and U.S.      citizens in the custody of foreign governments. As retired      military leaders, we understand that the preservation of      consular access protections is especially important for U.S.      military personnel, who when serving our country overseas are      at greater risk of being arrested by a foreign government.       U.S. military personnel are at risk for being taken into      foreign custody after accidental incursions into foreign      territories, while on leave or furlough, or while stationed      abroad pursuant to, or in absence of a Status of Forces      Agreement (SOFA). When American military personnel or their      family members find themselves in foreign custody, consular      access is indispensable in allowing the U.S. government to      fulfill its duty to ensure fair and humane treatment for such      individuals.       For example, in 2001 when a U.S. Navy surveillance plane      made an emergency landing in Chinese territory after      colliding with a Chinese jet, the State Department cited the      Vienna Convention and other consular treaties in demanding      immediate access to the plane's crew. Chinese authorities      responded by granting consular visits to the crew members,      who were detained in China for 11 days. Moreover, military      regulations implementing SOFA requirements anticipate that      consular officers will assist the designated commanding      officer in key areas such as protesting inhumane treatment      and ensuring that the individual has access to an adequate      defense.       The strength of consular access protections for U.S.      military personnel abroad is dependent on the United States'      reciprocal commitment to fulfill its obligations at home. But      given the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in Medellin v. Texas,      the executive branch is unable, without further action by      Congress, to enforce certain consular protections under the      Vienna Convention with regards to U.S. state law enforcement      personnel. In light of the Medellin decision, additional      legislation is needed to ensure the integrity of the consular      notification and access rights upon which U.S. service      members rely.       Legislation to ensure review and appropriate relief if      needed when a foreign national faces or is sentenced to      death, while relatively limited in scope, would improve      foreign governments' confidence in the United States' ability      to uphold its consular access obligations, making it more      likely that such governments will giant this access to      Americans in their custody.       Improving U.S. enforcement of its consular notification and      access legal obligations will help protect American citizens      detained abroad, including U.S. military personnel and their      families stationed overseas. We urge you to support those who      are serving our country overseas by ensuring swift passage of      the Consular Notification Compliance Act to meet our      international responsibilities.           Sincerely,       Rear Admiral Don Guter, USN (Ret.).       Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, USN (Ret.).       Brigadier General James P. Cullen, USA (Ret.).       Brigadier General David R. Irvine, USA (Ret.).       Brigadier General Murray G. Sagsveen, USA (Ret.).       Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, USA (Ret.).                                  ____                                                    June 14, 2011.     Re The Consular Notification Compliance Act.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As former      U.S. diplomats and State Department officials, we write to      urge your support for the Consular Notification Compliance      Act, legislation that we believe is vitally important to      meeting the United States' foreign policy objectives and to      protecting the interests of its citizens abroad. We urge you      to act promptly to enact this legislation that would secure      compliance with the United States' binding treaty obligations      by providing a review mechanism for the cases of foreign      nationals who--without the benefit of timely consular      notification and access--were convicted and received death      sentences.       Each year, thousands of Americans are detained abroad.      Prompt knowledge of and access to our fellow-citizens held in      foreign jails ensures that U.S. consular officers can help      them obtain legal assistance, monitor their treatment, and      connect them to family and friends back home. This crucial      lifeline of consular support can only function effectively if      the detaining authorities comply with their obligations under      Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,      which grants all foreigners in custody the right to consular      notification, communication and access ``without delay.''      Insisting on compliance with and protesting violations of      Article 36 provisions has thus long been an integral element      of the U.S. policy of providing protective consular services      to detained Americans overseas.       For instance, when three Americans were detained after      accidentally crossing an unmarked border into Iran in 2009, a      State Department spokesperson insisted that ``Iran has      obligations under the Vienna Convention, and we demand      consular access at the first opportunity.'' The Secretary of      State later called on the Iranian government ``to live up to      its obligations under the Vienna Convention by granting      consular access and releasing these three young Americans      without further delay.'' Once consular access was finally      granted, the State Department ``welcome[d] the fact that Iran      is meeting up to its obligations under the Vienna      Convention''.       Unfortunately, the United States has sometimes violated      Article 36 requirements even as we call on foreign      governments to comply with its terms. In 2004, the      International Court of Justice (ICJ) determined that some      fifty Mexican nationals were entitled to judicial hearings to      determine if Article 36 breaches, which were proven to have      occurred, affected the fairness of their capital murder      convictions and/or sentences.     The United States is required by the U.N. Charter to comply      with decisions of the ICJ. President George W. Bush attempted      to enforce this decision at the state court level, but the      U.S. Supreme Court later ruled in Medellin v. Texas that only      Congress could ensure compliance by adopting legislation      providing for the compulsory review and reconsideration      mandated by the ICJ. The Supreme Court also observed that the      ICJ decision undeniably bound the United States under      international law and that ``plainly compelling'' reasons      existed for its domestic implementation. ``In this case,''      the Medellin Court noted, ``the President seeks to vindicate      United States interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance      of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign      governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of      international law.''       Clearly, the safety and well-being of Americans abroad is      endangered by the United States maintaining the double      standard of protesting denials of consular notification and      access to its own citizens while simultaneously failing to      comply with its obligation to remedy identical violations. We      cannot realistically expect other nations to continue to      comply with consular treaty commitments that we refuse to      uphold. For that reason alone, it is essential that Congress      act swiftly to provide the limited procedural remedy that      both our Executive and Judicial Branches have so clearly      indicated is in the national interest.       As the Supreme Court pointed out, however, the United      States' interest in implementing these international      obligations goes beyond protecting the reciprocal rights and      safety of its overseas citizens. Our national security,      effective commercial and trade relations relating to our      prosperity and almost every matter of national interest,      large and small, is covered by reciprocal treaty obligations.      We risk jeopardizing these interests if we practice an      indifference to these obligations in this or other arenas. We      believe that continued non-compliance will surely alienate      this nation from its allies. We also believe that any further      failure to provide the modest remedy of ``review and      reconsideration'' required in these cases will undermine      America's credibility as a global champion of the rule of      law, thereby seriously hindering our foreign policy      objectives. It is worth noting the United States agreed to be      bound by the ICJ's decision both before and after the case      was heard and has consistently advised multiple international      and domestic courts that it is doing everything within its      power to comply with this decision. Passing legislation to      ensure our nation's compliance needs to be accomplished in      order to make good on this representation.       The ability of the United States to secure future      international agreements vital to our commercial interests      and national security depends largely on whether this nation      is perceived as honoring its international obligations. It is      vitally important for Congress to mandate judicial      enforcement of America's treaty obligations. Anything less      jeopardizes our global reputation as a dependable treaty      partner. We therefore urge you to support the rapid passage      of the Consular Notification Compliance Act to accomplish      this end, and thank you for your attention to this important      matter.           Sincerely,       Harry Barnes, Jr., U.S. Ambassador to Chile, 1985-1988;      U.S. Ambassador to India, 1981-1985; Director General of the      Foreign Service 1977-1981; U.S. Ambassador to Romania, 1974-     1977.

Governor Rick Perry,     Office of the Governor, Austin, Texas.     Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles,     Austin, Texas.       Dear Governor Perry and Members of the Texas Board of      Pardons and Paroles: As former prosecutors and judges, we are      strong supporters of a robust and accurate criminal justice      system. We are well aware that international consular      notification and access, as required under the Vienna      Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), is      essential to such a system, and to ensuring non-     discriminatory treatment for both non-citizens in U.S.      custody and U.S. citizens in the custody of foreign      governments; and is also critical to the efficient,      effective, and fair operations of criminal justice systems      throughout the United States. In light of these important      considerations and out of concern for the domestic and      international implications of an execution without proper      compliance with U.S. international obligations, we are      writing to urge you to grant a reprieve in the case of      Humberto Leal Garcia. We take no position on the merits of      his petition, but believe that a reprieve should take place      pending congressional enactment of legislation that would      allow foreign nationals who were denied consular access while      in law enforcement custody and face the death penalty to      receive appropriate review of that failure.       It is appropriate to ensure that our country complies with      the laws to which it has obligated itself, and to ensure that      those laws apply to our own citizens as well. At all stages      of the proceedings, foreign nationals--whether our own      citizens in other countries or those from other countries in      the United States--face unique disadvantages and challenges      when confronted with prosecution and imprisonment under the      legal system of another nation. Prompt consular access      ensures that they have the means necessary to be advised of      their rights and to prepare an adequate defense.       Ensuring prompt consular access to foreigners arrested in      the United States also enhances the truth-seeking function      that lies at the heart of American justice. Much in the same      way as the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment,      consular notification is essential to enabling fair access      for those who are unfamiliar with our legal system. As Chief      Judge Juan Torruella of the United States Court of Appeals      for the First Circuit observed, ``Without [consular access],      I think that we presume too much to think that an alien can      present his defense with even a minimum of effectiveness. The      result is injury not only to the individual alien, but also      to the equity and efficacy of our criminal justice system.''      U.S. v. Li, 206 F.3d 56, 78 (1st Cir. 2000) (Torruella, C.J.,      concurring in part and dissenting in part).       Consular assistance provides a unique and indispensable      protection for foreign nationals who are unfamiliar with the      U.S. criminal justice system. This is true with regard to our      own citizens abroad as well. As many domestic courts have      recognized, consulates can provide essential resources that      are simply not available through other means, particularly in      identifying and explaining the ways in which the U.S.      criminal justice system differs from their native systems.      Early consular access can prevent misunderstandings and      missteps by a foreign national that might otherwise prejudice      their ability to obtain a fair trial. Consulates can assist      defense counsel in locating crucial documents, witnesses, and      exonerating evidence available only in their native country      and can assist in translations that in too many cases have      been demonstrated to be erroneous, thus jeopardizing the      accuracy of the proceedings. This can mean the difference      between conviction and acquittal, or between life and death.       We want to emphasize that demonstrating our nation's      commitment to complying with Vienna Convention obligations is      also critical to ensuring the safety of Americans traveling,      living and working abroad. The United States expects      countries to grant consular notification and access to      Americans in law enforcement custody. In return, we pledge to      accord the same right to foreign nationals within our      borders. In addition, particularly in states bordering Mexico      and Canada, cooperation between law enforcement agencies is      critical to ensuring the safety of citizens on all sides of      the border. These accords are threatened when the United      States erects procedural hurdles that prevent foreign      nationals from obtaining meaningful judicial review when      denied consular notification and access and may well mean      that our own citizens' rights will be jeopardized in      countries whose citizens' rights have not been respected by      the United States.       Providing meaningful enforcement of the Vienna Convention's      consular notification and access requirements will increase      the efficient, effective, and fair operations of our criminal      justice system and protect U.S. citizens abroad. Delaying the      execution of Humberto Leal Garcia to ensure full opportunity      for congressional action and appropriate review of the case      will demonstrate to foreign governments the United States'      good faith in upholding its consular access obligations,      increasing the likelihood that foreign governments will grant      access to Americans in their custody. For these reasons, we      strongly urge you to support a reprieve in this case pending      congressional action on these matters.           Sincerely,       Hon. Charles F.
