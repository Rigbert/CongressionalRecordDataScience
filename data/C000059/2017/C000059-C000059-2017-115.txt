Chairman, I would say we have a duty to taxpayers to perform the best we can, to give the best product to our warfighters at the best price. I urge a ``no'' on this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
