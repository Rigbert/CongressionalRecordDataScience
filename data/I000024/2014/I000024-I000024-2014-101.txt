President, a year ago this month I stood before you during the Senate's debate on immigration to offer an amendment that would prevent convicted criminal aliens from being released back into our communities. Unfortunately, my amendment never came up for a vote despite the fact that this is an issue that should concern us all.  This problem arises from a couple of Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2005, which held that immigrants who have been ordered removed cannot be detained for more than 6 months. Even though an alien is an aggravated felon or has committed a crime of violence, they must be released back into society if no other country will accept them.  By releasing these criminals back into our communities we are allowingthem to commit even more crimes against Americans. For example, a Vietnamese immigrant, Binh Thai Luc, was ordered deported after serving time in prison for armed robbery and assault. Due to the Supreme Court decision in Zadvydas v. Davis, Luc was released from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, custody when Vietnam refused to admit him. He is now facing charges for the murder of 5 people in San Francisco in March of 2012. Five people would be alive today if our law enforcement officials had not been handcuffed by the Supreme Court.  From 2008-2012, nearly 17,000 immigrants with orders of removal were released back into our communities. Just last month, we learned that this number has more than doubled in one year. In 2013 alone, more than 36,000 criminally convicted aliens were released by ICE because their home countries had yet to take them back.  That is an astonishing number, especially when you look at what crimes these offenders have committed. These 36,000 criminals have been convicted of more than 87,000 crimes, including: 193 homicide convictions; 426 sexual assault convictions; 1,075 aggravated assault convictions; and 16,070 DUI convictions.  These are convictions, not allegations. Convicted murderers, sex offenders, and other violent felons that have been ordered removed from our country are now free to live among us.  Today, in light of these revelations, I am reintroducing my amendment as a standalone bill along with Senators Grassley, Vitter, Cruz, and Sessions. S. 2463, the Keep Our Communities Safe Act of 2014, amends the Immigration and Naturalization Act to allow the Department of Homeland Security to detain non-removable immigrants beyond 6 months in specific situations. These situations include circumstances when an alien's release would threaten national security, have serious adverse foreign policy consequences, or would threaten the safety of the community and the alien either is an aggravated felon or has committed a crime of violence.  Some organizations, such as the ACLU, believe this bill amounts to indefinite detention in violation of a criminal's due process rights. However, in addition to the specified circumstances of continued detention mentioned earlier, this bill requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to recertify that a person is a threat every 6 months. Furthermore, an alien can submit evidence for a review of his detention and aliens will still have access to our federal courts, giving judges a say in the process.  I would like to commend my friend, Congressman Lamar Smith from Texas, for his good work on this in the House and I ask that both the Senate and the House take up consideration of the Keep Our Communities Safe Act to protect our fellow Americans from these violent offenders.                          ____________________
