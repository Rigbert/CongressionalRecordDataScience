Speaker, reclaiming my time, will the majority leader tell me when I voted to shut down the government? Does he have a cite there?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Once I finish this, I will give my friend the date.  Tuesday, on the gentleman's Twitter account--I like how my friend uses it more often, maybe the President inspired [emailÂ protected], Dreamers can still apply to renew DACA protections. Learn more about the requirement for applying for renewal.  I don't know which one is right. If on his Twitter account he says that it is okay because no DACA students or kids are being removed, he says in his Twitter account you can apply right now. But I am going to vote against the omni that we negotiated with because I am really worried about the rescissions that go against maybe some money that has been wasted.                              {time}  1145  But when I look at this, Mr. Speaker, I know for a fact the President made another offer to not only solve DACA, but to solve Dreamers. All he requested was could we have the border secure. He wasn't asking for an astronomical number.  When you think back, many times, Mr. Speaker, I get an argument from the other side about the Gang of Eight bill. They spent twice as much on border security than the President is asking for.  I know for a fact the President talked to the leader on the other side, of his party. I know for a fact they came back and said no. I know the President actually put it out on his Twitter account. The President wants to solve this problem, but he wants to make sure the border is secure.  Mr. Speaker, as we speak right now, there are people who are marching from other countries because they think they can just march directly across our border.  I think our border needs to be secure. I would hope everybody would feel that same way. I know the President wants to solve this problem. He offered. As a fact, Mr. Speaker, the President said it from inside these Chambers for the whole Nation to hear.  Sometimes I begin to wonder: Do words and action actually do the exact same thing? Could it be possible, Mr. Speaker, that sometimes people play politics with issues? Could it be possible that sometimes people could use that for an excuse? Could it be possible that people would say they want to solve a problem, but when they have the offer of a solution, they say no so they can keep it to try to make a political argument out of it?  I don't know. Maybe. But I will tell the American public this: We want to solve that problem.  Now, Mr. Speaker, my friend on the other side of the aisle is worried about the debt. I am, too. He voted for a budget that would increase it by more than $6 trillion, but he wants to raise your taxes and take more of your money by another $3 trillion. It still increases it much more than what he takes in taxes.  He said he heard those arguments all before that the Republicans, they won't do well if they let people keep more of their own money. Well, I just looked at the latest numbers. In the first 3 months with the new tax bill, do you know what? More revenue came in. Millions of people got to keep more of what they earned.  What is interesting is so many Americans got a pay raise simply because government said you could do better with your own. That, I think, is true. And if my friend, Mr. Speaker, agrees with that, I know he will be there for the recision.  Where can we stand up for the taxpayer? If there is money wasted here, why wouldn't we go line by line? It won't be just the omni. It will be all those other accounts that have been sitting there. I don't think that is a Republican or Democratic idea. I truly believe that is an American idea, and I think that is the responsibility that we all have.  I know these colloquies go long. I like my friend across the aisle, Mr. Speaker. I consider him a friend. But just as anybody has friends, we have different philosophical opinions, and that is healthy. But at the end of the day, we can't make excuses. At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, there is a bill on the floor.  And, yes, I want it 100 percent my way, but, unfortunately, that is not the way our government is created. It is supposed to find compromise. I can always find an excuse: Do you know what? Someone didn't look right at me, or someone said something I disagreed with.  But as we know today, no DACA child is getting deported. As we know today, the President wants to solve this. As we know today, the Presidenthas made many offers. So, I think, Mr. Speaker, there is no more time for excuses. It is time for solving.
