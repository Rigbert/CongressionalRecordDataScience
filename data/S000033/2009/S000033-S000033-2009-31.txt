 President, I thank the chairman for yielding. Before I get into the subject I wish to talk about, which is prescription drug reimportation and the absolute necessity of lowering the cost of prescription drugs in this country, I wish to say a word in general.  I find it interesting that my Republican friends are spending a whole lot of time down here on the floor attacking the health care legislation. I suppose it is at least a positive thing that they are beginning to talk about health care.
