He also deserves credit. We worked very closely together on this schedule and everything else to make sure all people were heard, as the Senate completes its work on this historic legislation, I want to recognize Senators and staff members who were instrumental to our effort.  Senator Durbin, who has championed the DREAM Act for many years, deserves special recognition. I commend him as the Senate approves his hard-fought effort that is included in this bill. Senator Durbin has helped to bring these compelling stories out of the shadows. He has been dedicated to the young people who will be helped by his legislation, like Gaby Pacheco.
