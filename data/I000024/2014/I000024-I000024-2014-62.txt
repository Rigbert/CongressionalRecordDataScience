President, I wish to pay tribute Army PVT John P. Dion. Private Dion and two other soldiers died January 3, 2010 when insurgents attacked their unit with improvised explosive devices and small arms fire in Ashoque, Afghanistan.  John was born February 4, 1990 in Tarzana, CA and moved to Oklahoma during his sophomore year in high school. He joined the Army in June 2009 after graduating from high school in Shattuck, OK where he was on the baseball and football teams.  Upon graduating from basic training at Fort Benning, GA, John was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, CO. He was deployed to Afghanistan in November 2009.  He is survived by his parents Mark and Patricia Elsner, of Reynolds, GA, two sisters: Kelsey Dion, Reynolds, GA, and Jackie Boals of Cedar Grove, TN, two brothers: Justin Werve of Shattuck, OK, and Mark Elsner of Paris, TN, grandmothers: Jane Elsner of Reynolds, GA and Carol Willoughby of Las Vegas, NV.  Dion's half-brother, Justin Werve, who was deployed to Iraq twice with the Air Force, said he tried talking Dion out of joining the Army, but he couldn't be dissuaded. ``He wanted to serve his country,'' Werve said. ``He did it for the same reason I did it: to make sure his family stayed safe.''  The family held a funeral service for Private Dion on January 16, 2010 and he was laid to rest with full military honors in Andersonville National Cemetery, Andersonville, GA.  Today we remember Army PVT John P. Dion, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                   Staff Sergeant Jack M. Martin III  Mr. President, I also would like to honor Army SSG Jack M. Martin III. Sergeant Martin and another soldier died September 29, 2009 when a bomb buried beneath a road detonated while they were helping to resupply a school construction project in the Jolo Islands, Philippines.  Jack, the youngest of five children, was born April 5, 1983 in Maquoketa, IA and later moved to Oklahoma where he played football and was an honors student at Bethany High School, graduating in 2001.  He started out in the Army Reserve where he volunteered to go to Iraq, but when that deployment was canceled he met with a recruiter looking for special forces volunteers. After enlisting and completing the special forces qualification course in 2004, Jack earned his Green Beret and was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group, Fort Lewis, WA.  ``Both of his grandfathers served in the Army during World War II. My father was a medic in World War II. I think that influenced him. Jack wanted to serve his country,'' his father said.  He is survived by his wife Ashley, his parents Jack and Cheryl Martin, his brother Abe, and three sisters: Mandi, Amber and Abi.  Today we remember Army SSG Jack M. Martin III, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                  First Lieutenant David T. Wright II  Mr. President, I would also like to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Army 1LT David T. Wright II. First Lieutenant Wright and another soldier died September 14, 2009 of wounds sustained after enemy forces attacked their vehicle with improvised explosive devices in southern Afghanistan.  Born July 7, 1983 in Norman, OK, David did not let his football and track talent go to waste after graduating from Moore High School in 2002. He went to the University of Oklahoma on a track scholarship and earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice in 2006.  After completing basic training and officer training, he was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis, WA. On July 21, 2009 he was deployed to Afghanistan as part of II Platoon Bravo Company, 5th Brigade, II Infantry Division; Striker Brigade/Combat Team.  While deployed he wrote home about the honor he felt for his country and his fellow soldiers as they protected a village. He said he had no hard feelings toward the villagers, although some were angry with the soldiers.  ``These people deserve a better existence,'' he wrote, ``and hopefully my efforts will help, in a small way, provide that to them.''  That letter was waiting for his parents Tim and Michele, when they returned to Oklahoma after receiving his body.  The family held a funeral service on September 22, 2009, in Norman, OK. He was laid to rest with full military honors in I.O.O.F. Cemetery.  ``It was 9/11 that did it for David,'' the Rev. Randy Nail said at his memorial. ``He wanted to do something about it, and he did.''  David is survived by his parents Michele and Tim, of Moore, OK, his uncle Mitchell Scott, and his wife Angie, of Farmington, MN, and cousins, Hunter and Hailey Scott. He is preceded in death by his grandparents Betty and Junior Scott, and his uncle Michael Scott.  Today we remember Army 1LT David T. Wright II, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                          ____________________
