Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Chairman, this is not a new issue for anybody on this floor. I join in supporting and, as a matter of fact, I cosponsored the amendment of the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro). I would just take a brief time to reiterate why.  Some very close friends of mine have a view different than mine, and I respect their view and I hope they respect mine, with respect to the termination of a pregnancy, for important reasons.  It is my view, however, Mr. Chairman, that this issue does not deal with that directly; and the reason is this: It is my belief that a Federal employee covered by the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan has, as a part of their compensation package, three things.  They, first of all, have their salary, the money they are paid directly. No one would get up on this floor, it seems to me, and say that we ought to take a portion of that salary and ensure that they do not spend it for x, y, or z. Surely those who say that they want to have tax cuts because they want to leave more money in the pockets of those Americans so that they can choose how to spend their money would not support that effort.  Secondly, a Federal employee has their retirement benefit. Obviously, that is a valuable part of their compensation package. It will in retirement provide them with the, in effect, income in retirement that they earned during their working years.  Thirdly, they have the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. We should not tell them how to spend that portion of their compensation. We ought to allow them the option to purchase such policy as they choose because it is part of their compensation and is their money, not ours. We made a deal with them. We said, if they work for us, this is what we will pay them. They ought to have the option to spend it as they see fit.  I support the amendment of the gentlewoman.
