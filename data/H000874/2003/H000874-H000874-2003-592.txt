Speaker, on March 26, 2003, Ms. Deborah A. Yow, who is currently serving in her ninth year as director of athletics at the University of Maryland, will be inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame.  The Maryland Women's Hall of Fame was established to honor Maryland women whohave made unique and lasting contributions to the economic, political, cultural and social life of the State and to provide visible models of achievement for tomorrow's female leaders. Ms. Yow's contribution to Maryland and her role as a prominent female leader in an area traditionally dominated by males more than qualifies her for this honor.  Throughout her distinguished career in collegiate athletics, Ms. Yow has been known for her unrivalled energy and dedication. She has demonstrated a long-standing commitment not only to athletic success but also to the academic excellence of the students. A focused manager, fund-raiser, and promoter, she is known as a ``coach's AD'' with an impressive sense of management and knowledge of fiscal operations. Over the course of her career she has emerged as a leader in all facets of collegiate athletics.  After playing basketball herself at Elon College in North Carolina, Ms. Yow excelled for nearly a decade in coaching women's basketball. She began coaching at the University of Kentucky in 1976, and in 1980, Ms. Yow moved to Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma, posting an impressive 26-1 record in 1983. She then served as the women's basketball coach at the University of Florida from 1983 to 1987. Ms. Yow retired from coaching after her tenure at the University of Florida with a winning percentage of .700 and a career average of 20 victories per season.  Ms. Yow moved her career into the administrative field by serving as an associate athletic director at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro from 1987 to 1990, where she increased alumni support by more than 128 percent. In 1990, Ms. Yow assumed the position of athletic director at St. Louis University, becoming the fourth female athletic director of an NCAA Division I program and the only one active at the time. She was credited with revitalizing the men's basketball program and achieved an impressive 92 percent graduate rate for its athletes, ranking I0th among the 300 Division I schools.  In 1994, Ms. Yow began her new role as athletic director at the University of Maryland, the first woman to hold such a position in Atlantic Coast Conference history. She was faced with the challenge of a program ranked last competitively and last in fund-raising in the ACC, and a staggering operating deficit of $6.7 million. She took this position with a pledge to pay off the debt and improve both the athletic and academic standards in the Maryland athletic program. Under her leadership, every budget in the department has been balanced, and the debts she inherited from past administrations have been paid off. The Maryland Terrapins have streaked up the all-sports ranking to be in the top 15 percent of all NCAA Division I institutions. The graduation rate of athletes has risen to an impressive 85 percent, and improvements have been made in a variety of areas such as management, facilities and customer care.  Last year, 2002, demonstrated unprecedented successes for Ms. Yow's efforts in Maryland athletics. U.S. News and World Report selected the University of Maryland as one of the top 20 athletic programs in the Nation for overall quality and competitive excellence. The football team won the ACC championship and played in the Orange Bowl. The men's basketball team won the ACC regular season and topped that off with the NCAA national championship. These successes made Maryland one of a handful of schools to have achieved such high-level successes in both football and men's basketball in the same year. And success was not limited to just these two sports; the women's lacrosse team won their 7th consecutive national championship, the field hockey team played for the national championship, and a total of 10 teams competed in post-season play.  Ms. Yow's success has been honored by a variety of awards and leadership positions in college athletics. In 1998, she was elected the second vice president of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, the second woman to serve as an officer of the NACDA. By 2000, she was the president of that organization. Also in 2000, Street and Smith's Sports Business Journal, a leading industry publication, named her female sport executive of the year. More recently, she has been an important voice on the Commission on Opportunity in Athletics, a group assembled by U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige to review Title IX.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to extend congratulations to Ms. Yow for her well-deserved inauguration into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame. Mr. Speaker, I know the Members of the House join me in thanking Ms. Yow for her contribution to the University of Maryland, its fans and the citizens of the great State of Maryland, as well as for her wider contribution to collegiate athletics.                          ____________________
