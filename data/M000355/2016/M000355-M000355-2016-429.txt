 President, I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 592; that there be 15 minutes of debate only on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate.
