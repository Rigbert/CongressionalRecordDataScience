 Mr. President, international terrorism is a serious issue, and every Member of this body has pledged to protect the American people, and we will do that. But we will and must do it within the context of the Constitution of the United States and the law of the land. No individual, no President, is above the law. This President, perhaps more than any other in history, has abdicated the Constitution of the United States. The time is now to stand up and say: No more.  Let's defeat this legislation. Let's assure the American people that in fact we are a nation of laws, not individuals.  Thank you.
