 President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator Graham, to introduce bipartisan pension reform legislation. This legislation, the Pension Coverage and Portability Act, will go a long way toward improving the pension system in this country.  Ideally, pension benefits should compromise about a third of a retired worker's income. But pension benefits make up only about one-fifth of the income in elderly households. Obviously, workers are reaching retirement with too little income from an employer pension. Workers who are planning for their retirement will need more pension income to make up for a lower Social Security benefit and to fit with longer life expectancies. While we have seen a small increase in the number of workers who are expected to receive a pension in retirement, only one half of our workforce is covered by a pension plan.
