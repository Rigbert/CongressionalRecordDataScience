Speaker, it is with deep respect and admiration that I rise to commend five exceptional leaders from Indiana who were recently honored as the Northwest Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame's Class of 2013. Created by The Times and BusINess magazine, induction into the Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame is determined by a panel of local civic and business leaders. While there were many deserving nominees, the individuals selected as the 2013 Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame inductees include: former Senator Richard Lugar, Tom Collins Sr., Danita Johnson Hughes, Tom Sourlis, and Steve Teibel. For their many contributions to the enhancement of Northwest Indiana, these honorees will be recognized at a ceremony at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana, on Friday, March 22, 2013.   Former Senator Richard Lugar, from Indianapolis, is the Lifetime Achievement Award recipient for 2013. Richard Lugar's first elected office was on the Indianapolis Public Schools Board of Commissioners, where he served from 1964 until 1967. He was then elected mayor of Indianapolis in 1967, and under his leadership the city and Marion County governments merged through Unigov. After serving two terms as mayor, Richard Lugar was elected to the United States Senate in 1976. During his 36 years in office, Senator Lugar proved to be a noteworthy leader, extending a positive influence upon urban policy, American agricultural policy, and foreign policy. He is an activist for American energy independence, strong national security, U.S. leadership in the world, and economic growth. Senator Richard Lugar and Senator Sam Nunn were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which reduced the nuclear threat created by the breakup of the former Soviet Union. Currently, Richard Lugar is working with Indiana University as a distinguished scholar and professor of practice in the university's new School of Global and International Studies. He also co-chairs the new Indiana University International Advisory Committee with former U.S. Representative Lee Hamilton. Senator Lugar is worthy of the honors bestowed upon him and we are truly blessed as a nation for his extraordinary career in American government.   Tom Collins Sr., of Valparaiso, is the chief executive officer of Luke Oil, a family owned and operated business that was founded in 1967 by Tom's father-in-law, Ralph Luke, in Hobart, Indiana. Currently, the company distributes more than 300 million gallons of fuel annually in the Midwest. Luke Oil's sales reached the $1 billion mark last year and their volume has grown 20 percent each year for the past five years. In 2005, the company bought County Line Orchard, in Hobart, where they have held numerous fundraisers to benefit charities including the Food Bank of Northwest Indiana and various veterans' organizations. For his exemplary leadership skills, and his dedication to supporting charitable organizations, Tom Collins is to be commended.   Danita Johnson Hughes is the president and chief executive officer of Edgewater Systems for Balanced Living in Gary. Edgewater is an organization that provides behavioral healthcare services to individuals and families in the community of Gary and throughout the region. Under Danita's remarkable leadership, the organization has become a respected resource for those in need, and through its services, Edgewater touches the lives of more than 100,000 people each year. Danita continues to give back to the community and dedicates much of her time to the One Region, One Vision initiative and the Northwest Indiana Forum.   Tom Sourlis is the founder and chairman of Mortar Net Solutions, in Burns Harbor. Mortar Net, a product invented by Tom, prevents mortar droppings from clogging weepholes designed to allow water to exit a building wall. Mortar Net is a hugely successful product and is currently used on cavity wall construction throughout North America. In addition to his successful business, Tom devotes much of his time, efforts, and support to charitable organizations throughout Northwest Indiana, including Tradewinds, the Crisis Center, Parents as Teachers, and the Porter County Community Foundation. For his passionate devotion to such causes, Tom is worthy of the highest praise.   Steven Teibel is the third generation of his family to own and operate Teibel's Family Restaurant, in Schererville, which originally opened in 1929. Due to Steven's tremendous leadership skills and excellent customer service, Teibel's continues to succeed and remains a staple in Northwest Indiana. Steven also dedicates much of his time and efforts to serving those in need and is very active in numerous community organizations, including Meals on Wheels, the Hammond YMCA, the American Heart Association, and the Shrine of Christ's Passion. For his commitment to community service, Steven is to be commended.   Mr. Speaker, the lives of every citizen living in Northwest Indiana has been enriched because of the selfless good work of these five extraordinary individuals. I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding leaders on their induction into the Northwest Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame. These individuals are most deserving of this honor, and for their leadership and commitment to the Northwest Indiana community, each of them is worthy of our respect and admiration.                          ____________________
