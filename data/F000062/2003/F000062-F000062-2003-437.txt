 President, I rise to oppose this amendment. I very much respect the distinguished Senator from Nevada. However, I think this amendment is enormously destructive. If America is going to become an arrogant nation, do things only our way, this is a good way to begin. I believe it would be a tragic and a terrible mistake.  The amendment is couched in such words that no one would know exactly what it means. It reads:       No funds made available in this Act for purposes of      reconstruction in Iraq may be provided, to a person who is a      citizen of or is organized under the laws of France or      Germany, unless such person is a resident of or organized      under the laws of the United States.  Just to know how this would affect an employee of a given company, an officer of a given company, or anyone else, I think creates a whole miasma of very real problems. I think to use the word ``despicable'' perhaps is hyperbole. I think there is a legitimate point of difference between European nations and the United States with respect to how to handle Iraq. Culturally there are differences. Diplomatically there are differences. But to pass a piece of legislation that puts America's No. 1 allies in a position of being an absolute enemy of this country, I think is a terrible thing to do. I would hope we would vote down this amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator from Nevada.
