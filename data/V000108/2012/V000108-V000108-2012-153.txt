Speaker, it is with great sadness and profound respect that I take this time to remember one of Northwest Indiana's most valued citizens, and a true champion of workers' rights, Mr. Leon Lynch. Mr. Lynch dedicated his life to serving the needs of the United Steelworkers (USW), and he was tremendously successful in his efforts to improve the quality of life for workers in Northwest Indiana and across the nation. Mr. Lynch passed away on Friday, May 4, 2012, but his legacy will forever be remembered in the hearts and minds of the many people whose lives he touched.  Throughout his extraordinary career, Leon Lynch accomplished many visionary goals. In 1956, he joined USW Local 1011 while working at the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company mill in East Chicago, Indiana. Over the years, Mr. Lynch served in many capacities, and because of his strong leadership skills and willingness to take initiative, his career continued to flourish. In 1968, he was named a USW staff representative and later became an international representative. In 1976, Leon was appointed the International Vice President of Human Affairs for the USW, making him the first African American to serve as a vice president for a major labor union, and he was re-elected to this position a remarkable six times. Recognizing the impact he had on behalf of his union membership, Leon was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation in 1994 and to the Air Traffic Service Board of the Federal Aviation Administration in 2000. In 1995, Mr. Lynch was elected to serve as a member of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL CIO) Executive Council.  Mr. Lynch retired from his position as the International Vice President of Human Affairs for the USW in 2006. He is remembered as a great leader who will leave a lasting impact on generations of union workers to come. In 2005, having recognized the tremendous contributions he made to its members, USW Local 1011 dedicated its career development facility, the Leon Lynch Learning Center, in his honor. This outstanding facility offers guidance for steelworkers to prepare for employment opportunities.  Mr. Lynch also gave much of his time to many organizations and committees throughout his life. Leon was a member of the Democratic National Committee, the Labor Roundtable of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, the A. Philip Randolph Institute, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the Workers Defense League.  Leon leaves behind a loving family. He is survived by his wife, Doris Tindal-Lynch; his adoring daughters: Tina, Tammy, Sheila, and Maxine; and five beloved grandchildren. He also leaves to cherish his memory many dear friends and family members, as well as a saddened but grateful community and nation.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in remembering the great life of Mr. Leon Lynch. His remarkable contributions to the Labor Movement, both locally and across the nation,are most worthy of our admiration. His life of service is to be commended, and his legacy serves as an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
