President, today's final passage of this Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act marks the culmination of a decades-long struggle to make health insurance affordable to hard working Americans. This has been an arduous process, but it has proven that change truly is possible. America again has risen to meet one of its foremost challenges.  Still, there is more work to be done to introduce competition into the health insurance industry. Today, health insurers do not play by the same rules of competition as do other industries. Benefiting from a 60-year-old special interest exemption, the business of insurance is not subject to the Nation's antitrust laws.
