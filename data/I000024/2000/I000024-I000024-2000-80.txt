President, yesterday a delayed flight due to weather and the closing of flights through Chicago caused me to miss votes on the Murray Amendment (No. 3252), the Hatch Amendment (No. 3473) and the Kennedy Amendment (No. 3473) to S. 2549 the Department of Defense Authorization Bill. I would like to state for the record what my votes would have been had I been able to make those votes.                       murray amendment no. 3252  Had I been present, I would have voted to table the Murray amendment. I do not believe we should turn our military medical facilities into abortion clinics. The Senate rejected this amendment last year, and I see no reason why the Senate should change its position.  Though military facility abortion advocates try to present the situation as otherwise, it is not the case that women in the military are deprived of the option of getting an abortion, if they chose to have one. They are simply not able to obtain an abortion in a military facility as an elective procedure.  Furthermore, as Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, I know our military medical resources are spread too thin as things are. Not only is allowing abortions in military medical facilities an insult to many of the taxpayers who have paid for those facilities, it forces the hospitals to divert resources that could have been used for preserving life to do the opposite. This amendment does nothing but support an agenda that promotes abortion. To that I am opposed.                        hatch amendment no. 3474  I realize that many in the Senate viewed the Hatch Amendment as a viable alternative to the Kennedy Amendment on hate crimes.  As with the Kennedy Amendment, the Hatch Amendment gives statutory credence to creating a special class of protections for crimes committed against a behavior driven lifestyle. To place sexual orientation on par with race, color, gender, religion, and national origin is simply a terrible precedent for the Senate to be setting.  Before anyone accuses me of supporting violence directed against any particular person or group of persons, let me say clearly, I unequivocally oppose violence against anyone. Any crime of violence is a hate crime and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.  I appreciate the Senator from Utah's efforts to provide what he sees as an alternative to what I think we would both agree is a worse piece of legislation. However, had I been present, I would have opposed his amendment.  While some may say that my NAY vote on the Hatch Amendment would have changed the outcome, the fact is this issue will be rewritten during conference.                       kennedy amendment no. 3473  I would have voted against the Kennedy amendment on hate crimes because I do not believe it is Constitutional, nor do I think it is good policy.  As with the Hatch Amendment, to place sexual orientation on an equal level with race, color, gender, religion, and national origin is wrong.  Again, I unequivocally oppose violence against anyone. Any crime of violence is a hate crime and must be punished to the fullest extent of the law.  As a conferee on the Department of Defense Authorization bill, I will work vigorously to drop this language from the bill.                          ____________________
