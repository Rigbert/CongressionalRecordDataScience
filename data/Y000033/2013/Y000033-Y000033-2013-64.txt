Madam Chair, again I urge a ``yes'' vote. This amendment does solve some problems.  And I'd like to address the issue of training. We've been very fortunate in Alaska. We've used these dollars in training for our Alaskan Natives very successfully. We have aircraft training programs. We have carpenter training programs. We're training a group of Alaskan Natives to do the jobs that they can do not only in their tribal areas, but in the State itself. It makes for a sound economy.  On the reservation Mr. Cole mentioned, we still have that high rate. I hope we understand that I'm going to seek a new empowerment act for the American Indians to make sure that they don't have that high rate through training, availability, utilization of their land for the benefit of themselves so, in fact, we can continue to raise their standard instead of keeping 80 percent unemployment.  Again I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).  The amendment was agreed to.                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mrs. Black  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 113-16.
