President, I am pleased that today the Senate is going to pass an important piece of legislation, the Trademark Dilution Revision Act, HR 683. The principal purpose of this law is to clarify Congress's intentions when it first passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act over a decade ago.  In 2003, the Supreme Court decided the case of Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc. The Court held that trademark holders had to show actual harm, not the likelihood of harm, from dilution before they could seek injunctions. As an original author and sponsor of the act, I know firsthand that this is contrary to what Congress intended when it passed the dilution statue. What we did intend was to stop diluting before actual harm could be realized and the value of any reputable trademark debased.  H. R. 683 makes clear Congress's intent and corrects the law to provide that owners of famous trademarks can seek injunctions against anyone who attempts to use a mark that is likely to cause dilution. It also affords the court the ability to consider ``all relevant factors'' when determining whether a mark is ``famous.'' However, this legislation not intended to provide for injunctive or other relief against legitimate, third party trade in products manufactured under authority of the U.S. trademark owner of the distinctive, famous mark.  Furthermore, Senator Hatch and I were successful in including language that definitively shelters important constitutionally protected first amendment freedoms from being caught up in the liability net.  I thank Senators Hatch and Specter for their support in creating and passing this important bipartisan legislation.
