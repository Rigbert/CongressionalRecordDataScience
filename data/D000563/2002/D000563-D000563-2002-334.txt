This tradition continues today.  This year the Girl Scouts are celebrating their 90th birthday. I commendtheir work in shaping society. The Girl Scouts serves to teach our future leaders and creates a refuge where young women can find themselves.  Their mission is to help all girls to grow strong. They stress the development of a woman's whole being, while fostering physical, mental, and spiritual growth. Girl Scouts enables women to reach their full potential. Not only do the Girl Scouts empower women to strive for their goals, but it teaches them responsibility, values, and decision making skills that are the basic foundations for success.  Since its founding, Girl Scouts across the Nation have been serving our communities. During World War I Girl Scouts learned about food preservation, sold war bonds, and collected peach pits to use in gas mask filters. In the 1950s Girl Scouts were working to break racial discrimination. And today Girl Scouts are on the cusp of technological insight, working hard to end hunger, save the planet, and help support those less fortunate then themselves.  The simplest things that Girl Scouts do impacts everyday people. In the wake of September 11, Girl Scouts across the Nation sent thank-you cards to the rescuers, and contributed $1 a piece to send to the orphans of Afghanistan. Throughout its long history, Girl Scouts has led efforts to tackle important societal issues and has remained proactive in its commitment to inclusiveness. Today we look to the future and our young people for reassurance. We look to the youth and see promise. We know that girls growing up today will need to take on challenges involving health, economics, politics, and social change. Our future leaders will have to be value conscious, globally aware, technologically skilled, and able to act with self-confidence. These are the very skills the Girl Scouts work to encourage in every girl.  Being a Girl Scout is important to the girls. Only a Girl Scout can explain what it truly means to be part of the organization. A Girl Scout from Illinois put it best:       Being a Girl Scout is really fun. You can learn about      growing up in a fun, roundabout kinda way. You can go on a      six-day canoe trip or go on a two-hour hike. You can help      with the Special Olympics or help someone with their      homework. You can make a quilt or make a get-well card. Being      a Girl Scout is being what you want to be.  Girl Scouts is about being well-rounded and being yourself.                          ____________________
