Speaker, tomorrow I intend to bring to the floor the photos of two American families that have been instrumental in helping bring over 100,000 Americans who fought in World War II to our Nation's Capitol for Honor Flight.  I had the great opportunity this week, during a special gathering on this Veterans Day week of the friends of the World War II Memorial Committee, to meet these phenomenal Americans. Earl Morse and Jeff Miller have devoted so much of their private lives to bringing great joy to Americans across this country. We should recognize them. We should thank them. We should remember.  Those of us who have relatives that have fought in the military, those of us who appreciate those who have--on this Veterans Day week, let us give due credit to what brings us together as a people, our great sense of patriotism, our great sense of valor, and the appreciation we could give to those Americans who help to make the lives of others complete.  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for giving me this moment to highlight what I will bring to the floor tomorrow. Thank you to Honor Flight. Thank you to the Morse and Miller families. Thank you to the Friends of the World War II Memorial, and thank you to all of our World War II veterans, their families, and descendants.                          ____________________
