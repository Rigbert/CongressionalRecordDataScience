 President, I wish to recognize and pay tribute to Letitia--Tish--A. Long, who will retire on October 3, 2014, as Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or NGA.  It gives me great pleasure to speak publicly about Director Long, who has not only had an exemplary and distinguished career spanning 36 years in the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense, but who is someone I have gotten to know on a personal level.  As the Director of the NGA, Ms. Long was the first woman to head a major U.S. intelligence agency, and she will therefore always have a place in history as one of the Nation's most important figures in military and national intelligence. She is also a leading figure among women engineers.  I am grateful that in retirement, Tish will continue to advocate and find ways to encourage young women to go into the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  After studying electrical engineering as an undergraduate at Virginia Tech, and then earning a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Catholic University, Tish began her government service as a civilian electrical engineer at the Office of Naval Intelligence, where she was often the only woman in a room full of male engineers.  In 1994, she was promoted to the ranks of the Senior Executive Service, where she eventually served in a dual role at the Naval Intelligence Staff as director for Requirements, Plans, Policy and Programs; and director of Resource Management.  Looking back at her career, it should come as no surprise that Ms. Long reached great heights within the Intelligence Community. In 1995, she participated in the planning for the creation of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the predecessor agency of NGA, which she would later lead as Director. From 1998 to 2000, Tish served on the staff of the Director of Central Intelligence as the executive director for Intelligence Community Affairs on the community management staff, the predecessor organization to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Director Long's previous positions included service as Director of the Military Intelligence Staff at DIA and Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence. Tish was instrumental in the creation of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, where she served as the first Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence for Policy, Requirements and Resources. In 2006, she returned to the DIA as its Deputy Director.  Then, in August of 2010, Ms. Long became the fifth Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. As its director, Tish expertly managed the multibillion-dollar NGA budget and a workforce of nearly 10,000 government employees during a challenging period that included two wars, budget sequestration, and a government shutdown.  Under Director Long's skillful leadership, NGA provided extensive support to our Nation's highest priority security concerns, from counterterrorism missions across the globe--including critical support to the raid that killed Usama bin Laden--to monitoring and providing advanced warning on crises in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.  I have appreciated Director Long's candor with the Senate Intelligence Committee and her willingness to address the committee's concerns. Ms. Long's leadership on intelligence integration, advanced analytic tradecraft, and technology initiatives significantly improved intelligence production for the Defense Department, the Intelligence Community, and our allied partners. These efforts also provided greater insight into national security issues for policymakers in both the executive branch and Congress.  Let me close by saying that those of us who are fortunate enough to know Tish personally can attest to her dedication to the mission, personal integrity, and unwavering loyalty to our Nation.  As she leaves government service, Tish will have more time to spend with her husband John Skibinski, stepdaughters Jordan, Lindsay, and Katherine, and granddaughter Hanna.  It is with great pride and honor that I personally recognize Director Tish Long as an innovator, leader, and friend.  We wish Tish all the best in the future. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
