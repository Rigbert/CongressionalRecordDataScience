 President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia, because I believe this is a very important amendment.  Let me quickly sum up how my amendment, I believe, improves the underlying bill. In the Dole bill, 31 States have their funding frozen at fiscal year 1994 levels for the next 5 years. Funding is frozen despite very tough mandates to States which require a minimum work participation rate, which CBO says, as late as last night, only 10 to 15 States will be able to meet. Those States that cannot meet the minimum work participation rate will have a penalty of 5 percent with another 5 percent from the State, or a 10-percent cut in funds, and all but 19 States are locked out of the so-called growth formula.  So this is major. What I would like to say to my colleagues who represent the 31 States that are frozen out of the Dole bill is this: Not only will your State be required to meet that mandate, not only will your State receive no additional funding for child care or job training to meet the mandate, and even though your State will almost definitely experience an increase in poor population, your funding is frozen.  This bill, my amendment, takes the language of the House which says that the poor population of the State, as reflected by the census, will be used to determine the growth allocation. And, in fact, 27 States increase their funding under my amendment over the Dole bill.  Those charts have been distributed to you, and I urge, if you are one of those 27 States, that you vote for this amendment. The amendment is fair. It is as the House does it. It simply says the census determines the numbers and the money for growth is accommodated in that way.  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.
