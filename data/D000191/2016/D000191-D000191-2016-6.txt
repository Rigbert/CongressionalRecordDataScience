Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank all of the staff who worked so hard on this legislation, particularly the majority and minority staff of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. We would not be here today without the hard work of Ryan Seiger and Mike Brain on my staff and of others on the other side of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).
