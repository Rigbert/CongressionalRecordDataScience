President, today I am pleased again to join my friend and colleague Senator Kit Bond of Missouri in bringing to the Senate another matter of importance to the missions of the National Guard and to the dedicated men and women of the Guard who perform these missions.  Today we are introducing the National Guard Empowerment and State-National Defense Integration Act of 2008. We introduce this legislation on behalf of the 91-member U.S. Senate National Guard Caucus, which we co-chair. The military is still not structured properly to respond to the domestic emergencies that we know will come again. This legislation would take us tangible steps forward in correcting that. Our bill would sharpen the Defense Department's focus on helping the National Guard respond to domestic emergencies.  This legislation is a new phase in our bipartisan and bicameral drive to empower the Guard for successfully meeting the challenges that our States and the Nation are asking the Guard to meet. It would clear away bureaucratic cobwebs in the Defense Department's organizational structure to improve decision making on homeland defense issues that involve the Guard. This bill builds on some of the strong provisions enacted from the previous version of the Guard Empowerment Bill in the recently enacted fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill. By empowering the National Guard through more responsibilities, authorities, and new lines of control, this bill focuses the Defense Department's attention on this critical realm of domestic defense. The bill structures potential military operations within the U.S. in a way outlined by the Constitution, ensuring local and State control--not Federal control--in these emergencies.  We know that the military--the active duty force, the National Guard, and the Reserves--has an important role in responding to emergencies at home, events like natural disasters. The events of Hurricane Katrina and so many other situations have amply underscored that reality. Our civilian authorities will continue to want to tap into the resources, personnel, and expertise, and there is no question that we need a system that permits that. The debate taking place, mostly behind the scenes and within the walls of the Pentagon, has been about how we structure that response. The goal must be an effective response in line with the Constitution. Our national charter protects our basic liberties and places sovereignty in the hands of the people through government with adequate checks and balances, splitting administration among Federal, State, and local levels.  This Empowerment Bill would be effective because it drives to enhance the National Guard, our first military responders. This force has stepped up during dire situations time and time again. The National Guard takes its responsibility to carry out relief missions at home as seriously as it takes its missions abroad as the nation's primary military reserve. The National Guard is a locally based force, spread out in armories and readiness centers across the country. The Guard can flow forces among States through the Emergency Management Assistance Compacts process, which helped make the force one of the few shining lights in the darkness of the response to Hurricane Katrina. The National Guard has units that specialize in civil support, including highly trained, full-time teams located in every one of our States. The bottom line is that the Guard has shown that it can do this mission and do it superbly.  The approach of the Empowerment Bill is constitutional because it properly involves every layer of Government. It is our mayors, our public safety chiefs, and our Governors who are responsible for the security of their communities. Under our governmental system, they are the ones that should be in control of emergency situations and any Federal assets that come in should be strictly in support of them--certainly not the other way around. The Guard is a State force that works closely with these civilian authorities all the time. The Guard, which serves under the command of the Governors, is part and parcel of the community. The Guard knows that it is civilians, including their elected leaders and the populace, who are the ultimate decision-makers in these situations.  Our bill includes several key provisions. To improve the quality of advice at the highest levels, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau would gain a full seat on the Joint Chief of Staff, a key advisory body where insufficient attention is paid to homeland defense matters. The bill would ensure that U.S. Northern Command remains a Federal military headquarters that truly supports the Governors and the initial Guard response in an emergency, providing for the Governors to have tactical control over any active duty and Reserve assets that might be operating in their home State during an emergency. The National Guard Bureau is enhanced in another section which specifically gives the National Guard a separate budget to purchase domestic defense-oriented items. The Bureau would carry out its responsibilities in close cooperation with a newlyestablished planning committee and council that integrally involves the States' Adjutants General. And the bill assigns several key command and deputy command positions to National Guard officers who have experience in homeland defense and domestic emergency response matters.  This fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill ushered in several improvements to the National Guard, including an elevation of the Bureau Chief to the rank of four-star general. The National Guard Bureau is now more a joint agency than a sub-branch of the Army and the Air Force, though the Guard remains a key part of the Army and Air Force's Total Force. The Deputy Commander or Commander of U.S. Northern Command now must come from the ranks of the National Guard. These are far-reaching steps, though I remain concerned that the Department has yet to implement these provisions, not even filling the four-star position yet.  Together, last year's enacted organizational changes and those put forth in this bill will fundamentally improve our preparations for an emergency, and ensure an effective, swift, and constitutional response when another emergency occurs.  Our National Guard has never let our country down, and--once again--we cannot let our Guard down. I urge prompt attention and action on this vital legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and supporting material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2760       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Northern Command and Pacific Command must complete a      Memorandum of Understanding with the National Guard Bureau on      their operational relationship within 180 days of enactment.     Section 7: Governor's Tactical Control       Direction to the Department of Defense to establish      procedures for the nation's Governors to have tactical      control over the military forces, including Title 10 active      forces, operating in their state during an emergency. Such      tactical control will be exercised by the Governor through      the Joint Forces Headquarters of the National Guard of the      State. According to Department of Defense standard terms,      Tactical Control is ``Command authority over assigned or      attached forces or commands ... that is limited to the      detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers      within the operational area necessary to accomplish missions      or tasks assigned.''     Section 8: National Guard Command Positions       A National Guard officer will remain Commander of Air Force      North, while Guard officers shall become the Commander Army      North, and Commander or Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force      Alaska, Joint Task Force Civil Support, and Joint Task Force      North.                                  ____                                        National Guard Association                                   of the United States, Inc.,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2008.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Guard Association of the      United States applauds your introduction of the ``National      Guard Empowerment and State-National Defense Integration Act      of 2008.'' Your legislation is the logical next step in fully      codifying the initiatives that had their birth two years ago      in the National Guard Empowerment Act.       With the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act      for 2008, many of the substantive elements of ``empowerment''      for the National Guard have been presented to the Department      of Defense for immediate implementation in accordance with      the wishes of the Congress. We are eagerly awaiting their      timely response.       Meanwhile, we support the additional well-reasoned      legislative remedies contained in your new bill that will      knit together the missing pieces of the empowerment concept.      In our view, empowerment for the National Guard is simply a      restatement, in contemporary language, of the reliance placed      on the National Guard by the framers of the United States      Constitution in Article 1, Section 8.       Thank you for leading this effort for the American people.           Sincerely,                                             Stephen M. Koper,                                    Brigadier General, USAF (ret),     President.                                  ____                                     Adjutants General Association                                         of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2008.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The Adjutants General Association of      the United States commends you, your colleagues and your      staff on your foresight in introducing the ''National Guard      Empowerment and State-National Defense Integration Act of      2008.'' This legislation will take the next logical step in      advancing the gains of the National Guard Empowerment Act and      ensuring the intent of that legislation is met.       We understand and appreciate just how hard you and the      entire Guard Caucus worked to gain passage of the National      Defense Authorization Act for 2008, which gave birth to      ``empowerment'' for the National Guard. However, the      realization of empowerment has been slow to materialize. With      the introduction of this legislation, we are hopeful that the      Department of Defense will act in accordance with the wishes      of the Congress.       Again, we thank you for your new bill which will serve to      complete the vision of the empowerment concept, which had its      genesis two years ago with the original National Guard      Empowerment Act. It is clear that empowerment for the      National Guard remains a priority of the Congress.       We thank you for your continuing efforts on the National      Guard's behalf.           Sincerely,                                            Francis D. Vavala,                                            Major General, DEARNG,     President AGAUS.                                  ____         Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United            States,                                   Alexandria, VA, March 13, 2008.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.     Hon. Kit Bond,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the      United States, EANGUS is pleased to express our strongest      possible support, on behalf of the Enlisted men and women of      the Army and Air National Guard, in your efforts to amend      Title 10 of the United States Code to enhance the      responsibilities of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau      and the functions of the National Guard Bureau.       Although some historic changes were made in Public Law 110-     181, signed by the President on January 28,2008, many of the      original provisions of the National Guard Empowerment Act      of2007 were ``left on the cutting table'' and not enacted      into law. These valuable and necessary provisions must be      addressed and are addressed in your legislation.       Our association stands firm in support of your action to      remedy this error of omission. The lack of respect of the      leadership of the National Guard by service secretaries and      leaders, the consistent under-funding of National Guard      appropriations accounts, and the intentional lack of      communication and coordination all have the possibility of      being rectified by this legislation by making the Chief a      full partner in the decision-making and appropriations      process.       Thank you for taking legislative action that is not only      timely, but unfortunately necessary, and long overdue. We      look forward to working with your staff as this legislation      works its way into law.       Working for America's Best!                                             Michael P. Cline,                                       Master Sergeant, USA (Ret),                                               Executive Director.                                 ______                                       By
