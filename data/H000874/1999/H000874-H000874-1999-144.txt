Chairman, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Barcia) has great concern about a case I have been working with him on. I apologize. He wanted to offer the amendment, and I suggested that he offer it and then withdraw it, which he has agreed to. But he wants to raise the issue. It deals with a Customs matter in which his constituents, he believes, were mistreated. He simply wants to make that point. I have assured him that we will then work on the issue.
