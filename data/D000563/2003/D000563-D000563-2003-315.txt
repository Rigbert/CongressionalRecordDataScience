President, I just listened to the passionate commitment of the Senator from New Hampshire to No Child Left Behind, and it is no surprise. When he made the same speech on the floor on behalf of the legislation, it was so compelling, I joined him and voted for it. But I wonder, where was that passionate commitment to No Child Left Behind when Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia offered an amendment yesterday to pay for it?  Here is the rollcall. With the exception of my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, those who were giving these passionate speeches about No Child Left Behind had a chance yesterday to pay for it and refused to do so. They refused to put the money down to pay for this great, new idea, this new Federal mandate.  Lest you believe this is just an issue in Chicago, IL, in a place called Concord, NH, on August 18 they released the State budget. They have a problem.The budget contains $1 in each--$1 in each--of the next 2 years for State assessment tests. If the money is not found, and soon, to pay for the next round of tests, the schools that are on the failing schools list cannot get off it.  It tells me that New Hampshire and Nebraska, like Illinois, like Massachusetts, and every State, are struggling to come up with resources for education.
