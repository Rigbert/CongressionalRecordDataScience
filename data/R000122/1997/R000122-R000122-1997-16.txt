Recognize that the major international environmental issues which we face--not alone, but collectively as a world community--are significant: global climate change, which we were talking about recently; ozone depleting substances, which have affected all of us around the world; reduction in ship pollution of the ocean; international ocean dumping; transboundary movement of hazardous waste materials and disposal. What happens to all of this waste in countries where it is being produced? How does it move from one country to another?  All of these are critical issues. Yet, within a context and scope of this fast track agreement, they would be relegated, as the Senator from Maryland said, to side agreements at best. Our experience has been such that these side agreements are ineffectual in most cases, if not all cases. If we put them in the center of our concerns as a negotiating objective, not only will we make progress on these issues, but we will send a strong signal to all of our potential trading partners that they have to be prepared to come to the table and talk turkey about the environment and about how they will improve their environmental quality. That will result not only in a cleaner environment, which is an extremely noble objective and one that has very practical ramifications, but it will also help level that competitive playing field between those small businesspeople up in Rhode Island and Baltimore who are doing it already. All they ask us is to ensure, as we enter the world of international trade, that we try our best to bring up the standards of their competitors because they are their competitors. If we do that, then we leave it to them, their ingenuity, their imagination, and their skill to win the trade battle.  But essentially what we are doing today by taking those off the table is we are effectively dooming thousands of small businesses across this country to extinction.
