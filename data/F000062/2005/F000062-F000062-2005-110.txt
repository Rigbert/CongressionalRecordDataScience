 President, I rise today in support of Senator Cantwell's motion to strike the provision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, for drilling from the Budget Reconciliation Act.  Let me be clear: I am opposed to drilling in the Arctic. I am also opposed to attaching this provision to the budget reconciliation bill. ANWR is a prominent national issue, arousing the deep passions of people on both sides. Regardless of one's view on the issue, the question of whether to open the refuge to drilling warrants an independent debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
