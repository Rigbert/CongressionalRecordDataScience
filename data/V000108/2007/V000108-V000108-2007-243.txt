As we recall the many struggles and reflect on the immense impact African-Americans have had on this country, we are reminded that, though we have made great strides, we must continue the fight for a society that is truly equal.  The theme for this year's Black History Month, From Slavery to Freedom: Africans in the Americas, is a reminder that in striving for equality, we must examine the past. We remember those brought to America against their will, forced into slavery, working under the most inhumane conditions. From this, however, we are reminded of those who recognized this atrocity and made the decision to fight for their freedom. We pay special tribute to those who were persecuted, and in many cases murdered, for their impassioned struggle for what was right. From the earliest men and women forced into slavery to the brave soldiers, both free and enslaved, who joined forces to eventually defeat the Confederacy, thus establishing their own freedom, all are to be commended with the highest admiration and praise. Without these struggles, President Abraham Lincoln's reminder of our founding fathers' goal, the establishment of a new Nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, would not be possible.  It is the efforts of these brave individuals that would inspire the great leaders of the civil rights movement, like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks, to persevere and make great strides toward this goal. Some of these leaders, like many before them, would face similar persecution. Some, like Dr. King, would pay the ultimate price in hopes that one day all Americans would be seen as equals. We are aware, however, that as a united society, we must continue to make strides like those generations who came before us. From the days of slavery to the days of segregation, we must continue to work toward a society that is truly equal, a society with equal rights, equal justice, and equal opportunities.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the brave men and women who have led us in the ongoing fight for justice and equality. Let us take this opportunity to honor the sacrifices and contributions of all Americans who have fought for their freedom and the freedom of others. This commitment to equality, opportunity, and an end to discrimination is to be admired.                          ____________________
