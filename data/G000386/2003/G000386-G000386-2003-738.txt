 President, I would like to have a word with the Chairman concerning funding for the war on methamphetamine production and trafficking. I appreciate your accepting my amendment to allocate $10 million for the continuance of methamphetamine reduction efforts. I understand that these funds will come from the $50 million in the bill designated for policing initiatives to combat methamphetamine production and trafficking and to enhance policing initiatives in drug hot spots. It is also my understanding that this $10 million will be used to combat meth production and distribution in the State of Iowa. This money will go to the Iowa Office of Drug Control Policy to fund programs that I consider essential to treating and controlling the drug problem in the State of Iowa. These programs would include a Drug-Free Workplace Coordinator to help educate employees to deter and detect use, and put procedures in place to take corrective action if there is a workplace-related substance abuse problem; various community prevention, intervention, and treatment programs; and for a Meth Safe House in Iowa to provide a safe and drug-free environment for recovering meth addicts, and help push them away from the negative influences that previously fed their addiction.
