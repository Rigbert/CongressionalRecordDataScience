 President, the amendment I sent forward is simply a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I believe most of my colleagues will support. I hope it can be accepted by voice vote later today or next week.  This amendment simply directs the General Services Administration to facilitate the process of getting excess Government computers to schools or nonprofit school organizations. This amendment is following a Presidential Executive order that was to make modern computer technology an integral part of every classroom, provide teachers with professional development that they need to use new technologies effectively, and connects classrooms to the national information infrastructure and encourages the creation of educational software. I have heard many of my colleagues talk about the need to put computers and technologies into the classroom, but the reality is that many school districts cannot afford this expensive equipment.  The President's Executive order now has all Federal agencies documenting their excess computer equipment. My amendment will direct GSA to facilitate this process so the excess computers that are in Government service can be gotten into the schools where they are needed.  I urge my colleagues to support this. Again, I hope it can be done quickly and efficiently on a voice vote.  I thank my colleagues and yield back my time.
