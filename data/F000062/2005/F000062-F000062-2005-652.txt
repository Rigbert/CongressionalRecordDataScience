 President, I thank the ranking member.  I rise today to explain why I deeply regret I cannot vote to confirm Alberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney General.  I believe as a general rule the President is entitled to the Cabinet of his choice. But one Department, the Department of Justice, always deserves special attention from Congress because it does not exist solely to extend the President's policies.  Though the Attorney General serves under the President, he must independently interpret the laws as written by Congress and be truly the country's chief law enforcement officer.  I cannot emphasize this enough. The Department of Justice must be independent from the White House. The FBI must be independent. The U.S. attorneys must be independent. The Criminal Law Division, the Environmental Law Division, the Civil Law Division must all be independent. The Solicitor General's Office, which argues before the Supreme Court, must be independent. The Office of Legal Counsel, which is charged with interpreting the law of the executive branch, must be independent. The Civil Rights Division must be independent.  These departments are charged with nothing less than following, interpreting, and implementing the law of the United States of America. The Department of Justice is in charge of defending the Nation in court. It is in charge of advising the rest of the Government about what the law means. It is in charge of overseeing the investigations of the FBI, and it is in charge of deciding when to prosecute criminals and send them to prison. This is obviously a big portfolio.  The head of the Department of Justice is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. As such, the Attorney General is in charge of 59 separate divisions within the Department of Justice, which cover more than 110,000 employees. In my view, before we vote to confirm to put someone in charge of all this awesome power--and it truly is awesome--it is important for us to know what that individual thinks about the major policies the Department will be implementing. And that is where I have been disappointed by the confirmation process for Judge Gonzales.  When President Bush nominated Judge Gonzales, I think many of us were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. But the hearings crystallized how little we knew about his own policy views, how little we knew about his qualities for leadership, his policy views, his management style, his strength of character, and his personal beliefs in those areas where he sets the tone and the policy. I think this was a great missed opportunity.  John Ashcroft served 6 years in the Senate. We knew his service on the Judiciary Committee. We knew about his views. One could decide about his personal views, yes or no. Judge Gonzales has spent so many years serving President George Bush. If confirmed, this will be the fifth job George Bush appointed Judge Gonzales to over the past decade. The hearings were his first real opportunity to show his own views. I think this is why the hearing process became so important in many of our views.  This was a crucial opportunity for Judge Gonzales. Many of us were prepared to vote for him. If there is a single issue that defines this confirmation process, it is what Judge Gonzales thinks about torture and brutal interrogation practices.  He reminded us again and again that both he and the President condemn torture. But as we know from the Bybee memo of August 2002, for at least 2 years, the Federal Government followed a definition of torture that was excessively narrow. In fact, it was considered so incorrect that the Department of Justice revoked it on the eve of Judge Gonzales' hearing.  That memo defined torture as:       Equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious      physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily      function, or even death.  For me, in addition to its clear legal and moral importance, the issue of torture became the main way for assessing this next Attorney General. And it was very important for him to state in unambiguous terms what he thought. It was as important a way for us to assess how he approaches a problem as any.  In his opening statement, Judge Gonzales offered a clear, absolute condemnation of torture. He said flatly:       Torture and abuse will not be tolerated by this      administration.  At this point, at the beginning of his testimony, there were no ifs, ands, or buts. But after that, his testimony, both verbal and in writing, was full of ambiguities. It seemed intended not to make his views clear, but to shield his views, and it seemed to narrow the definition of what counts as torture.  For instance, at the hearing, at one point, Judge Gonzales told Senator Leahy, our ranking member, ``I reject that opinion,'' referring to the Bybee opinion. But at another point in the hearing, he told the same Senator, Senator Leahy:       I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then      reached by the department.  Those statements are clearly in conflict, and leave me with no idea what he thinks about the Bybee memo.  I also note that Judge Gonzales clearly did not do everything he might have done to try to answer the questions put to him.  In his written testimony, especially to Senator Kennedy, Judge Gonzales refused to provide the answers or the documents requested. He even refused to conduct a search that would have refreshed his memory.  Let me quote the multiple times Judge Gonzales refused to answer Senator Kennedy's questions, and these are all quotes:       I do not know what notes, memoranda, e-mails or other      documents others may have about these meetings, nor have I      conducted a search.  Point 2:       I have no such notes, and I have no present knowledge of      such notes, memoranda, e-mail, or other documents and I have      not conducted a search.  Point 3:       I have no present knowledge of any non-public documents      that meet that description. However, I have conducted no      search.  Point 4:       I have no present knowledge that there are any documents of      the sort requested in the question, although I have not      conducted an independent search for such documents.  Point 5:       I have no present knowledge of any such documents or      materials, although I have not conducted a search.  Point 6:       I have no present knowledge of any such records, although I      have not conducted a search.  The last formulation he repeated in two additional instances.  These are not adequate answers to satisfy the nomination process for the confirmation of a person to be the next Attorney General, nor do they bode well for the Judiciary Committee's and this Congress's oversight responsibilities for the Department of Justice.  Judge Gonzales also refused to provide many documents that we requested. In specific, I asked him to provide me with a copy of the final version of his January 2002 memo to the President. That is very important because earlier memos that he had written were different. It was important, if this was his final opinion, that we have an opportunity to look at it, because that opinion was definitive and dispositive.  The January memo is a well known one, where he wrote that the war on terror ``renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners.'' If that was only a draft, as he said, as he had emphasized, then I believe it is imperative for us to see the final version, and he refused me that opportunity. He wouldn't provide the memo, saying the White House had declined to allow it.  To tell you the truth, because of the prior history, that simply is not good enough for me.  Also of importance in the questions that he did answer, he seemed to continually narrow, again, the definition of torture. I saw this as a retreat from his original condemnation of torture and abuse and I thought it showed that he was trying more to defend the President's policies than to demonstrate his own views.  That, in my view, is the nub of the problem. Here he was no longer the President's man, he was going to be thechief law enforcement officer, independent, head of 110,000 people, with all kinds of major departmental responsibilities--environmental law, civil rights law, the Solicitor General, as I stated earlier in my remarks. I saw this narrowing as a retreat from his original condemnation of torture and abuse, and I thought it showed that he was trying, again, more to defend the President than to talk for himself. Let me give an example.  At the hearing he told Senator Durbin that even under the laws implementing the Convention Against Torture:     aliens interrogated by the United States outside the United      States enjoy no substantive rights under the 5th, 8th, and      14th Amendments.  If this is Judge Gonzales's view, it is a significant gap in the prohibition against abuse.  I gave him the opportunity to clarify this issue. In written testimony he confirmed the thrust of the answer, stating to me:       There is no legal prohibition under the Convention Against      Torture on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment with respect      to aliens overseas.  In another written question, I asked Judge Gonzales to specify his own views again on specific harsh interrogation methods. I wrote to him:       Putting aside legal interpretations, in your own personal      opinion, should the United States use forced nudity, the      threatening of detainees with dogs, or ``water-boarding''      when interrogating detainees?  That was my question in writing. He began his answer by stating:       I feel that the United States should avoid the use of such      harsh methods of questioning if possible.  I was asking for a statement by the man. ``If possible'' is a major loophole, and I truthfully don't know what it means. I don't know how big that loophole is intended to be.  As I was reviewing the correspondence, I was struck, in particular, by a letter that the committee received from a group of 12 esteemed former military leaders--generals, admirals, even a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  This letter was signed by Brigadier General David M. Brahms, Retired, U.S. Marine Corps; Brigadier General James Cullen, Retired, U.S. Army; Brigadier General Evelyn P. Foote, Retired, U.S. Army; Lieutenant General Robert Gard, Retired, U.S. Army; Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn, Retired, U.S. Navy; Rear Admiral, Retired, U.S. Navy; General Joseph Hoar, Retired, U.S. Marine Corps; Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, Retired, U.S. Navy; Lieutenant Claudia Kennedy, Retired, U.S. Army; General Merrill McPeak, Retired, U.S. Air Force; Major General Melvyn Montano, Retired, U.S. Air Force National Guard; and General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Let me paraphrase the letter. They write as retired military professionals in the U.S. Armed Forces to express their deep concern about the nomination of Alberto Gonzales and they urge us in the hearing to detail his views concerning the role of the Geneva Conventions in U.S. detention and interrogation policy and practice. They go on to say:       Mr. Gonzales appears to have played a significant role in      shaping U.S. detention operations. . . . It is clear that      these operations have fostered greater animosity toward the      United States, undermined our intelligence gathering efforts,      and added to the risks facing our troops around the world.  They then talk about the memo Judge Gonzales wrote to the President on January 25, 2002, advising him the Geneva Conventions don't apply to the conflict then underway in Afghanistan. They say more broadly that he wrote the war on terrorism presents a new paradigm that renders obsolete the Geneva protections.  Then they go on to say, and I think this is important:       The reasoning Mr. Gonzales advanced in this memo was      rejected by many military leaders at the time, including      Secretary of State Colin Powell who argued that abandoning      the Geneva Conventions would put our soldiers at greater      risk, would ``reverse over a century of U.S. policy and      practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions,'' and would      ``undermine the protections of the rule of law for our      troops, both in this specific conflict [Afghanistan] and in      general.''  That is a huge problem out there because at best, these hearings and the written questions and answers which are voluminous are really unable to clarify any of the positions of Alberto Gonzales, the man, Alberto Gonzales, head of one of the largest and most powerful agencies of the American Government, the U.S. Department of Justice.  We look at the Department of Justice one way, but most Americans look at it as being a major citadel of power in the United States. And on occasion, we have seen that power exercised. If you are going to set the policy, if you are going to set the tone, if you are going to be the head of this Department, I want to know what you as a man, or as a woman, think, and particularly at this time.  Yes, it is clear that the problems we will face in the future are most likely to be with respect to non-state actors, and with respect to torture, which I am speaking about now. Therefore, it is extraordinarily important to know what this man thinks. If you ask me today, despite the hearings, despite 200 pages of questions and answers, I cannot really tell you. I cannot really be sure that if the White House says one thing, the head of the Department of Justice would be willing to stand up and say another. I just do not know, based on the past jobs he has had and his past performance, if he is prepared to be independent.  I have to say to this body that is important. Every one of us knows that Janet Reno was an independent Attorney General. I do not know that Alberto Gonzales will be. I don't know his management style. I don't know the vision he has for this Department. I don't know the goals he would set.  I know he is an extension of the President. I know that he can legally enable the President. I know he gives the President advice, and I think much of that advice has brought us into a terrible place where our military could well in the future be jeopardized.  I am one, frankly, who believes the Military Code of Justice has stood the U.S. military in good stead. I am one who believes the Geneva Convention--the Convention Against Torture--is the right thing. I am one who believes we should follow those, even in this non-state war.  I want to comment on one other issue, and then I will yield the floor.  I think Judge Gonzales is going to be confirmed. He is a talented lawyer and has a compelling life story. I certainly want to work with him.  I want to say one thing about some who may say this is a qualified Hispanic, and indeed he is. Nobody should think that the Hispanic community is unified on this nomination. I will put into the Record, if I may, letters from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, certain editorials from newspapers, the statement of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, a statement of the Mexican-American Political Association, a letter from Major General Melvyn Montano, and other letters.  I ask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Albuquerque, MN,                                                 January 25, 2005.     Hon. Members of the Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: I am writing to urge that you reject the      nomination of Alberto Gonzales for Attorney General. I      understand that some Hispanic groups support Judge Gonzales'      nomination and have urged you to confirm him. I write, as a      Hispanic and as a military officer and veteran, to offer a      different perspective.       I know what it feels like to be the first Hispanic named to      an important leadership position in this country. I was the      first Hispanic Air National Guard officer appointed as an      adjutant general in the United States. I am a Vietnam veteran      and served 45 years in the military, including 18 years in a      command position. I welcome the prospect of more Hispanics      serving in leadership positions in the government, and I      respect Judge Gonzales' inspiring personal story. But I      reject the notion that Hispanics should loyally support the      nomination of a man who sat quietly by while administration      officials discussed using torture against people in American      custody, simply because he is one of our own.       I was among 12 retired Admirals and Generals, including      former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John      Shalikashvili (Ret. USA). who wrote to you urging that you      closely examine Judge Gonzales' role in setting U.S. policy      on torture during his confirmation hearing.       At that hearing, Judge Gonzales did not allay concerns      about his record. To the contrary, his evasiveness and memory      lapses raised even more concerns. Judge Gonzales continues to      maintain he can't remember how the infamous torture memo was      generated. He has refused to explain the language in his own      memo which implied that rejecting the applicability of the      Geneva Conventions would insulate U.S. personnel from      prosecution for war crimes they might ``need'' to commit. And      he asserts that the Convention Against Torture's prohibition      on cruel and inhuman treatment doesn't apply to aliens      overseas.       In my view, these positions put our service men and women--     already facing enormous danger--at even greater risk. In my      capacity as Major General of the National Guard, I oversaw      4,800 National Guard personnel. When I think about how many      of our troops fighting in Iraq today are drawn from the      National Guard, it angers me that the danger they face has      been increased as a result of the policies Judge Gonzales has      endorsed. I wonder, if Judge Gonzales' children grow up to      serve in the military, would he be so cavalier in dismissing      the Geneva Conventions as obsolete?       Some have cynically suggested that Americans who question      Judge Gonzales' record on these issues do so because they are      anti-Hispanic. I reject this view. My own concerns about      Judge Gonzales' fitness to serve as Attorney General grow      from a deep respect for American values and the rule of law.      Judge Gonzales should be evaluated on his record, not his      ethnicity. On the basis of that record, I urge you to reject      his nomination.           Sincerely,                                               Melvyn Montano,                                             Major General (Ret.),     Air National Guard.                                  ____            An Open Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee     Hon. Members of the Senate Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned, are retired professional      military leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces. We write to      express our deep concern about the nomination of Alberto R.      Gonzales to be Attorney General, and to urge you to explore      in detail his views concerning the role of the Geneva      Conventions in U.S. detention and interrogation policy and      practice.       During his tenure as White House Counsel, Mr. Gonzales      appears to have played a significant role in shaping U.S.      detention and interrogation operations in Afghanistan, Iraq,      Guantanamo Bay, and elsewhere. Today, it is clear that these      operations have fostered greater animosity toward the United      States, undermined our intelligence gathering efforts, and      added to the risks facing our troops serving around the      world. Before Mr. Gonzales assumes the position of Attorney      General, it is critical to understand whether he intends to      adhere to the positions he adopted as White House Counsel, or      chart a revised course more consistent with fulfilling our      nation's complex security interests, and maintaining a      military that operates within the rule of law.       Among his past actions that concern us most, Mr. Gonzales      wrote to the President on January 25, 2002, advising him that      the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the conflict then      underway in Afghanistan. More broadly, he wrote that the      ``war on terrorism'' presents a ``new paradigm [that] renders      obsolete Geneva's'' protections.       The reasoning Mr. Gonzales advanced in this memo was      rejected by many military leaders at the time, including      Secretary of State Colin Powell who argued that abandoning      the Geneva Conventions would put our soldiers at greater      risk, would ``reverse over a century of U.S. policy and      practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions,'' and would      ``undermine the protections of the rule of law for our      troops, both in this specific conflict [Afghanistan] and in      general.'' State Department adviser William H. Taft IV agreed      that this decision ``deprives our troops [in Afghanistan] of      any claim to the protection of the Conventions in the event      they are captured and weakens the protections afforded by the      Conventions to our troops in future conflicts.'' Mr.      Gonzales's recommendation also ran counter to the wisdom of      former U.S. prisoners of war. As Senator John McCain has      observed: ``I am certain we all would have been a lot worse      off if there had not been the Geneva Conventions around which      an international consensus formed about some very basic      standards of decency that should apply even amid the cruel      excesses of war.''       Mr. Gonzales's reasoning was also on the wrong side of      history. Repeatedly in our past, the United States has      confronted foes that, at the time they emerged, posed threats      of a scope or nature unlike any we had previously faced. But      we have been far more steadfast in the past in keeping faith      with our national commitment to the rule of law. During the      Second World War, General Dwight D. Eisenhower explained that      the allies adhered to the law of war in their treatment of      prisoners because ``the Germans had some thousands of      American and British prisoners and I did not want to give      Hitler the excuse or justification for treating our prisoners      more harshly than he already was doing.'' In Vietnam, U.S.      policy required that the Geneva Conventions be observed for      all enemy prisoners of war--both North Vietnamese regulars      and Viet Cong--even though the Viet Cong denied our own      prisoners of war the same protections. And in the 1991      Persian Gulf War, the United States afforded Geneva      Convention protections to more than 86,000 Iraqi prisoners of      war held in U.S. custody. The threats we face today--while      grave and complex--no more warrant abandoning these basic      principles than did the threats of enemies past.       Perhaps most troubling of all, the White House decision to      depart from the Geneva Conventions in Afghanistan went hand      in hand with the decision to relax the definition of torture      and to alter interrogation doctrine accordingIy. Mr.      Gonzales's January 2002 memo itself warned that the decision      not to apply Geneva Convention standards ``could undermine      U.S. military culture which emphasizes maintaining the      highest standards of conduct in combat, and could introduce      an element of uncertainty in the status of adversaries.'' Yet      Mr. Gonzales then made that very recommendation with      reference to Afghanistan, a policy later extended piece by      piece to Iraq. Sadly, the uncertainty Mr. Gonzales warned      about came to fruition. As James R. Schlesinger's panel      reviewing Defense Department detention operations concluded      earlier this year, these changes in doctrine have led to      uncertainty and confusion in the field, contributing to the      abuses of detainees at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, and      undermining the mission and morale of our troops.       The full extent of Mr. Gonzales's role in endorsing or      implementing the interrogation practices the world has now      seen remains unclear. A series of memos that were prepared at      his direction in 2002 recommended official authorization of      harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding, feigned      suffocation, and sleep deprivation. As with the      recommendations on the Geneva Conventions, these memos      ignored established U.S. military policy, including doctrine      prohibiting ``threats, insults, or exposure to inhumane      treatment as a means of or aid to interrogation.'' Indeed,      the August 1, 2002 Justice Department memo analyzing the law      on interrogation references health care administration law      more than five times, but never once cites the U.S. Army      Field Manual on interrogation. The Army Field Manual was the      product of decades of experience--experience that had shown,      among other things that such interrogation methods produce      unreliable results and often impede further intelligence      collection. Discounting the Manual's wisdom on this central      point shows a disturbing disregard for the decades of hard-     won knowledge of the professional American military.       The United States' commitment to the Geneva Conventions--     the laws of war--flows not only from field experience, but      also from the moral principles on which this country was      founded, and by which we all continue to be guided. We have      learned first hand the value of adhering to the Geneva      Conventions and practicing what we preach on the      international stage. With this in mind, we urge you to ask of      Mr. Gonzales the following:       (1) Do you believe the Geneva Conventions apply to all      those captured by U.S. authorities in Afghanistan and Iraq?       (2) Do you support affording the International Committee of      the Red Cross access to all detainees in U.S. custody?       (3) What rights under U.S. or international law do      suspected members of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or members of      similar organizations have when brought into the care or      custody of U.S. military, law enforcement, or intelligence      forces?       (4) Do you believe that torture or other forms of cruel,      inhuman and degrading treatment--such as dietary      manipulation, forced nudity, prolonged solitary confinement,      or threats of harm--may lawfully be used by U.S. authorities      so long as the detainee is an ``unlawful combatant'' as you      have defined it?       (5) Do you believe that CIA and other government      intelligence agencies are bound by the same laws and      restrictions that constrain the operations of the U.S. Armed      Forces engaged in detention and interrogation operations      abroad?           Signed,       Brigadier General David M. Brahms (Ret. USMC).       Brigadier General James Cullen (Ret. USA).       Brigadier General Evelyn P. Foote (Ret. USA).       Lieutenant General Robert Gard (Ret. USA).       Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn (Ret. USN).       Admiral Don Guter (Ret. USN).       General Joseph Hoar (Ret. USMC).       Rear Admiral John D. Hutson (Ret. USN).       Lieutenant General Claudia Kennedy (Ret. USA).       General Merrill McPeak (Ret. USAF).       Major General Melvyn Montano (Ret. USAF Nat. Guard).       General John Shalikashvili (Ret. USA).Resolution Opposing The Appointment of Alberto Gonzales To Be Attorney General of the United States by the Mexican American Bar Association of                              Ventura County       Whereas, the Mexican American Bar Association of Ventura      County was formed in 1980 and is composed of attorney members      and auxiliary members who for the past 25 years have promoted      access to justice for all, respect for the rule of law, equal      protection and due process of law.       Whereas, under other circumstances, the Mexican American      Bar Association of Ventura County would have been proud to      endorse and applaud the nomination of a fellow     Mexican American attorney to the highest law enforcement      position in our country; and so it is with sadness and      regret, that our organization finds itself in strong      opposition to the nomination of Mr. Alberto Gonzales, White      House Counsel for United States Attorney General.       Whereas, Alberto Gonzales, has rendered opinions proposing      that the United States of America and our sitting president      George W. Bush, can disregard the Geneva Convention; to wit,      Mr. Gonzales advised the President in a January 2002      memorandum that the Geneva Convention did not apply to      detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This opinion has been      roundly criticized and been condemned in our country and      around the world, including by members of the State and      Defense Departments, as well as U.S. Military lawyers,      fearing that this policy would undermine respect for U.S. Law      and International law, exposing the United States' own      military service members to torture and abuse.       Whereas, it is now well known that at various military      detention centers at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in Afghanistan, in      Iraq, including Abu Ghraib prison, detainees were subjected      to cruel, humiliating, degrading treatment and torture,      leading to the injury and even death of detainees, by U.S.      Military officers and civilian contractors operating under      the auspices of the United States Department of Defense.       Whereas, Mr. Gonzales authored memos that condoned the Use      of Torture, by relaxing the definition of torture, describing      the prohibition contained in the Geneva Convention as      ``quaint'' and ``obsolete'', permitting and thereby causing      our nation to be shamed and disrespected, and these      ``opinions'' have contributed to the our country's loss of      the good will and the respect of a significant segment of the      people and countries of the world.       Whereas, Mr. Gonzales, advised the President that he was      empowered to order the detention of anyone, citizen or non-     citizen for indefinite periods of time, without charges being      presented, without access to counsel or to an impartial      tribunal, thus violating the most sacred requirements of due      process of law enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. This      position was later rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in the      case of Rasul vs. Bush, in July of 2004, upholding the      principle that no one is beyond the reach of the law and      judicial scrutiny.       Whereas, it is documented that Mr. Alberto Gonzales, as      Counsel to Governor George W. Bush of Texas, also failed to      provide Governor Bush with adequate information to properly      review clemency requests by prisoners on death row, that      might have compelled commutation of the death penalty or      further judicial review, and thus failed in his duty to act      as competent counsel to his client and to the People of the      State of Texas.       Whereas, Mr. Alberto Gonzales by his actions and legal      opinions rendered throughout his career in public positions      and in his current position as White House Counsel, has      violated his obligation to support the stated mission of      lawyers in the United States and specifically the mission of      the State Bar of Texas, his home state, which is to ``support      the administration of the legal system, assure to all the      equal access to justice, foster high standards of ethical      conduct for lawyers, ``and educate the public about the rule      of law,'' be it therefore       Resolved, That the Mexican American Bar Association of      Ventura County strongly opposes the confirmation of Alberto      Gonzales to the position of United States Attorney General,      and furthermore, strongly urges California's Senators Diane      Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as all other members of      the United States Senate to vote against the confirmation of      Mr. Gonzales based upon his demonstrated poor judgment in      legal matters and his lack of commitment to the rule of law      and the Constitution of the United States of America.                                  ____  MALDEF Statement on the Likely Confirmation of White House Counsel    Alberto Gonzales to the Position of United States Attorney General       MALDEF, the nation's premier Latino civil rights      organization, released a statement today regarding the likely      confirmation of White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to the      Cabinet post of Attorney General. Below is the statement      released today by Ann Marie Tallman, MALDEF President and      General Counsel.       ``The United States Attorney General upholds the laws that      define the very democracy of our Nation. The Attorney General      enforces all federal criminal and civil laws. The office      holder has the responsibility to determine how to use Federal      resources to prosecute violations of individual civil      liberties and civil rights--such protective laws have      profound impact on the daily lives of American citizens and      those living in the United States. Finally, the Attorney      General has the authority to appoint a special counsel to      investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute matters when the      Attorney General concludes that extraordinary circumstances      exist such that the public interest would be best served by      removing the matter from the Justice Department.       MALDEF acknowledges that Judge Alberto Gonzales can fulfill      his duties as Attorney General as defined by the United      States Constitution, the U.S. Code and various federal      Statutes. Judge Gonzales' personal history is compelling. He      has overcome significant obstacles to achieve his success.      His past professional experience speaks to his capabilities.      MALDEF remains encouraged that President Bush would make an      historic appointment of such a diligent individual.       MALDEF acknowledges Judge Gonzales' adherence to precedent      in the area of individual privacy rights as defined by the      constitutional right to privacy. We also recognize his      perspectives on diversity and equal opportunity in higher      education and employment.       MALDEF is America's premier Latino civil rights      Organization, and from this unique position, we have serious      questions and concerns about Judge Gonzales' record in three      important areas of the law. First, Judge Gonzales' public      statements and past record demonstrate support and deference      to our Federal Government's Executive branch. It will be      imperative for the Attorney General to question and challenge      unilateral exercise of executive authority when matters of      constitutional concern and violations of our federal laws      demand that the Attorney General protect individual civil      liberties or civil rights. In addition, there remains a      concern about Judge Gonzales' unique position and      transition--from Counsel to the President of the United      States to the United States Attorney General--and his ability      to determine when to appoint a special counsel. There is a      question whether Judge Gonzales can fairly and independently      determine in a matter he previously gave advice to the      President as the President's attorney, if a special counsel      should be appointed. A possible inherent conflict of interest      based upon his on-going attorney-client duties to the      President may impede his ability to be independent.       Second, due process under the law is an important      Constitutional protection. Judge Gonzales's past record in      the Texas Death Penalty cases and his association with      memoranda setting aside the application of international war      conventions as applied to enemy combatants raises concerns      about whether he may set aside constitutionally guaranteed      due process protections in various domestic circumstances.       Third, the federal government has sole authority and      responsibility to uphold our nation's immigration policies      while working to keep our homeland safe and secure. MALDEF is      concerned that Judge Gonzales, as Attorney General, may      delegate such important federal civil and criminal      immigration authority to state and local law enforcement      already overburdened with responsibilities to protect and      serve at the local level without the appropriate due process      protections that must remain guaranteed at the federal level.       We acknowledge that Judge Gonzales is likely to be      Confirmed as the next Attorney General of the United States      and the first Latino to hold this important post. MALDEF      stands ready to work with Judge Gonzales as he carries out      his duties and continues his public service. However, because      of our specific concerns regarding apparent primacy of      executive authority; a potential conflict of interest in the      transition from Counsel to the President to Attorney General      in enforcing the special counsel law; setting aside due      process protections; and, uncertainty about whether inherent      authority exists at the state and local level to enforce      federal immigration policy, MALDEF cannot support his      confirmation.                                  ____                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2005.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate          Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy, As the Senate considers the nomination      of Alberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of the      United States, we, on behalf of the Congressional Hispanic      Caucus (CHC), wish to inform you that the CHC has not      endorsed Mr. Gonzales.       Since its inception almost three decades ago, the CHC has      served to advance the interests of the Hispanic community,      which includes promoting the advancement of Latinos into high      levels of public office. We have taken this responsibility      seriously, and have accordingly developed a process to      evaluate candidates for positions in the executive branch of      the federal government. Such a process is critical to      determining which candidates seek to hold office to serve the      public interest rather than to promote their own personal      interest. Our process has enabled us to endorse many      exceptional Hispanic candidates. During the past four years,      the CHC has proudly endorsed many judicial and executive      branch nominees selected by President George W. Bush.       One simple step in our process is a meeting with the      nominee. Upon hearing of Mr. Gonzales' nomination for      Attorney General, we invited him to meet with the CHC to      provide him with the opportunity to meet our Members, discuss      issues important to the Latino community, and to seek our      endorsement. We were informed that he wanted our support and      for the past two months, we made every attempt to accommodate      his schedule. However, Mr. Gonzales ultimately chose not to      avail himself of the courtesies we extended to him. We were      last advised that Mr. Gonzales was simply too occupied with      responding to written questions from the Senate Judiciary      Committee and that we would instead have to wait to until      after he was confirmed as Attorney General before being      granted a meeting.       Let us be clear, our concern is not about whether the CHC      is granted a meeting--it is     about Mr. Gonzales' unwillingness to discuss important issues      facing the Latino community. His answers to these questions      would give our community the information needed to form an      informed opinion of his nomination. With so little time left      before a Senate vote on Mr. Gonzales' nomination, the Latino      community continues to lack clear information about how the      nominee, as Attorney General, would influence policies on      such important topics as the Voting Rights Act, affirmative      action, protections for persons with limited English      proficiency, due process rights of immigrants, and the role      of local police in enforcing federal immigration laws.       We are disappointed and surprised that Mr. Gonzales has      refused to meet with the CHC during the confirmation process.      Much has been said about the historic nature of Mr. Gonzales'      nomination, as the first Hispanic to serve as U.S. Attorney      General. However, the historic nature of this nomination is      rendered meaningless for the Hispanic community when the      nominee declines an opportunity to meet with the group of      Hispanic Members of Congress who have worked for so many      years to open the door of opportunity to fellow Hispanics. If      he is not willing to meet with the CHC, how responsive can we      expect him to be to the needs of the Hispanic community?       We provide you this information as the reason for our lack      of endorsement of Mr. Gonzales.           Sincerely,     Grace Flores Napolitano,       Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus.     Robert Menendez,       Chair, CHC Nominations Task Force.     Charles A. Gonzalez,       Chair, CHC Civil Rights Task Force.
