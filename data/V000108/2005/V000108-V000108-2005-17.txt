Speaker, it is my privilege to introduce our guest chaplain, Reverend Bruce Bigelow, pastor of the Lake Hills Baptist Church in Schererville, Indiana.  Reverend Bigelow was born on the South Side of Chicago and was raised in Gary, Indiana. Reverend Bigelow began his life of service in 1967. For the past 32 years, he has served as the senior pastor of the Lake Hills Baptist Church and will be retiring this coming April.  In his time as pastor, Lake Hills Baptist Church has grown from less than 100 members to over 450 today. The church now includes a modern family life center. In addition, it joyfully gives 30 percent of all donations it receives to help support missionary projects in the community and around the world. The congregation also provides practical help to children, teenage and college age youths, young mothers, and senior adults. Through his actions and those of the members of the church, Reverend Bigelow has brightened and made meaningful so many lives.  Throughout his time in the ministry, Reverend Bigelow has been supported by his wife Janice, his dear wife of 40 years, who has joined him today. They have three grown daughters and seven grandchildren, all who reside in Indiana.  Let us hope the words of his inspiring prayer will remain with us and his dedication to the ministry will always be appreciated.                          ____________________[Page H9475]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  WELCOMING THE REVEREND BRUCE BIGELOW  (
