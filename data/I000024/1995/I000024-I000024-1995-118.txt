President, in further demonstration of our resolve to downsize Government and eliminate needless departments, agencies, commissions, boards, and councils, I offer this amendment along with Senator Abraham to terminate the National Driver Registration Advisory Committee and the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Regulatory Review Panel.  The National Highway Safety Advisory Committee was established under the Highway Safety Act of 1986 to advise the Secretary on matters relating to highway safety. Moneys have not been appropriated for this committee since 1986.  The commercial motor vehicle safety regulatory review panel. The purpose of this panel is to conduct a study to evaluate the need for the Federal assistance to the States to enforce specific regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation. The panel was created by the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 and is not currently funded.  Although these cuts are merely symbolic, they are illustrative of the type of needless activity that have outlived their usefulness. These types of programs drain the Government of its efficiency and clutter its structure with organizational deadwood.  This amendment promotes the type of reform which is supported by the GAO, the CBO, and in some cases, the President. It terminates two committees whose jobs are finished. While it may not achieve savings in the millions of dollars, it is an important step in complying with the demands of the American people who told us on November 8, 1994, to balance the budget, and cut the size of Government. It is important that we demonstrate that resolve by reviewing even the most insignificant or inexpensive programs as well as the more prominent ones. Let us show the public we are serious and eliminate these useless panels.
