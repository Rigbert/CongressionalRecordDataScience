 McConnell):  S. 2256. A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to provide standards and procedures to guide both State and local law enforcement agencies and law enforcement officers during internal investigations, interrogation of law enforcement officers, and administrative disciplinary hearings, to ensure accountability of law enforcement officers, to guarantee the due process rights of law enforcement officers, and to require States to enact law enforcement discipline, accountability, and due process laws; to the Committee on the Judiciary.THE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DISCIPLINE, ACCOUNTABILITY AND DUE                           PROCESS ACT OF 2000  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator Biden to introduce the State and Local Law Enforcement Discipline, Accountability and Due Process Act of 2000. American families can turn on the news every night and see the reality of the war against crime and drugs. No one understands the dangers of this battle better than the men and women on the front lines. I'm talking about our nation's police officers.  We have entrusted the difficult work of protecting society to police officers. They know the stress and the strain of walking the daily beat, of being caught in the crossfire in a world of gangs and drugs. They do a very difficult job, and with few exceptions, they do it with honor and skill.  We should always remember that the vast majority of police officers work responsibly and risk their lives for all of us. In the words of one officer, `the ultimate sacrifice could occur at any time. * * * [The] gangs and criminals have rewritten the rule book.'  To make matters worse, the pressure of crime and drugs--of gangs and thugs--is multiplied by the fear of unjust disciplinary actions. Our law enforcement officers face intrusive investigations into their professional and personal lives--oftentimes at the behest of some recently arrested criminal looking for a payback.  Unfortunately, many police officers are denied the same basic procedural and due process rights that the rest of us enjoy and take for granted. As a result, our officers live in the fear of: being investigated without notice; being interrogated without an attorney; and, being dismissed without a hearing.  We insist that police officers respect the constitutional rights of the citizens they serve. We insist that they adhere to the letter and spirit of our laws. We insist that they respect due process in their work. It is past time for us to give them the same kind of legal rights that every other citizen has come to enjoy. That is why Senator Biden and I have introduced this bill.  This bill strikes an important balance: it makes sure every police officer has basic fundamental procedural rights, while at the same time ensuring that citizens have the opportunity to raise legitimate complaints and concerns about police officer accountability.  For example, the bill guarantees due process rights to every police officer subject to investigation for noncriminal disciplinary action. Some of these rights include: the right to be informed of the administrative charges prior to being questioned; the right to be advised of the results of an investigation; the right to a hearing and an opportunity to respond; and the right to be represented by counsel or other representative.  At the same time the bill ensures that legitimate citizen complaints against police officers will be actively investigated, and that citizens will be informed of the progress and outcome of those investigations.  Finally, I must conclude by explaining that this bill is a product of years of input from the men and women who have experienced the daily pressures of police service, and continue to endure them. This legislation has benefitted from the thoughtful ideas and past support of many law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers.  In particular, I am grateful to the contribution made by the Fraternal Order of Police. Over the past 8 years, I have worked closely with the Kentucky FOP to develop and promote this legislation.  The time has come to protect those who protect us. We must give our law enforcement officers the basic and fundamental rights that they desperately need and richly deserve.                                 ______                                       By
