 President, I ask to have printed in the Record finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Fifth Annual ``What is the State of the Union'' Essay contest conducted by my office. These 20 finalists were selected from over 400 entries.  The essays follow.              Liam Gibbons, Milton High School (Finalist)       We learn in school and from our parents that America is the      land of opportunity. Yet that is not the case. When the      wealth gap is steadily increasing, as women earn 70 cents for      each dollar a man makes, as the U.S. government spends more      on defense than on its disenfranchised, the land of      opportunity seems no longer under boot, but instead a distant      reality. Equal protection under the laws for every citizen,      promoting the general welfare, rights to life, liberty, and      the pursuit of happiness. All of these things are printed on      our country's most sacred documents, these things which need      to be an attainable reality for every American.       Perhaps one of the most egregiously neglected groups in the      U.S. is women. Wage inequality combined with the control of      their own bodies in the hands of the government all add to      the fact that women are among the most disparaged people      within the U.S. Throughout America, women are denied the      right to a safe and constitutional abortion. Some of the      biggest contenders for the presidency have voiced their      belief that women shouldn't have this constitutional right      even in the context of rape or incest. Because of Roe v.      Wade, because of its constitutionality, a safe abortion      should be as accessible to the women in Texas as much as the      women in Vermont.       A law needs to standardize how abortion clinics are made      and run, and if there is an issue regarding states' rights      and federalism, then an amendment must be made. Because not      only are women not currently in control of their own bodies,      they also lack the ability to earn equal wages as men. In      1977, the Equal rights amendment lost by the votes of three      states. Who in their right minds would vote against equal      rights in 2015. In order to ensure true equality and civil      rights bring back the ERA, and this time ratify it.       Another group of people who lack this promised opportunity      is the poor. Most Americans are employed, but many of them      aren't earning livable wages. An American shouldn't have to      work three jobs to support their family. An American      shouldn't have to ride a bus three hours a day in order to      work for privatized welfare. An American should be able to      work for 40 hours a week, and be able to live comfortably.      And this is possible if we raise the minimum wage so that it      equates to a livable wage. However, no American should not      have to strive for the minimum, each citizen should have a      chance at exceeding, each American should be able to go to      college.       In Germany, in Sweden, in Norway college is free. In Syria,      a week of bombing by the U.S. costs the same as the tuition      of 40,000 American students. If we were to take a fraction of      our defense budget and give it to the impoverished for higher      education, if we were to reallocate the budget, we would be      seeing a lot more opportunity.              Eli Hulse, Vermont Commons School (Finalist)       As the United States moves into 2015, we have achieved many      things that have furthered the nation, and improved the      security of the people economically, socially, and      militarily. Some of these advancements include electing Janet      Yellen as the first female Chair of the Federal Reserve,      reducing the unemployment rate from 6.7 percent to 5.8      percent; the lowest it has been since 2008, and helping      foreign forces fight against the militant group ISIS.      However, there are many problems that the United States faces      and needs to address over the next year.       The single most important issue that the United States      needs to recognize and correct is the disparity of income.      Although it is true that the gap in income causes problems      with equality between the social classes, there are concerns      that the percentage of income that the upper class has is      causing instability in the United States economy as a whole.      People who have more money do not spend as much of percentage      of it as poorer people, which means that that money sits in      savings accounts, and is not paid to businesses in return for      products. As the income gap widens, less money will be      introduced into the economy, and it will leave the economy in      a precarious position.       Another serious issue that the United States needs to      address is the spread of Ebola in Africa. Although domestic      cases of Ebola have been isolated and treated, an unstable      Africa would allow Ebola to potentially spread to the United      States and other countries, and could be catastrophic. It is      important that the United States government continues its      support of Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and other countries      that are struggling to create the infrastructure to treat      this deadly disease.       Finally, it is key that the United States continues its      resistance to terror threats both domestically and      internationally. Although currently not a direct threat to      the United States or to the general populous, ISIS has the      potential to cause great damage to the European Union and      eventually to the United States. A military force this size      has not been seen in a long time, and the influence that it      has in the countries it overtakes is alarming and needs to be      kept in check. The United States needs to keep this in mind      when making international policy decisions, and needs to      continue supporting countries that are actively fighting      ISIS.       The United States continues to be one of the largest      influencers on the international playing field. However,      policy makers need to keep in mind many domestic problems,      and begin working across the aisle in order to keep the      government of the United States secure and capable. 2014 has      seen a whole array of new policies, and these policies have      ensured the security of the American people. In 2015, new      policies will be created, that will hopefully fix some of the      problems in our society. God bless the United States of      America.      Kathy Joseph, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)       America has undoubtedly grown in the past year, but the      many problems plaguing our nation continue to persist. The      United States economy is stronger. We added 300 thousand jobs      in November, the best in nearly three years. The unemployment      rate is at 5.8%, a post-recession low point. President Obama      struck a climate change deal with China--the two countries      with the largest energy consumptions agreed to curb their      carbon emissions by 2030. The war on terror in Afghanistan      officially ended. Relations with Cuba have been reopened,      which will make educational travel to Cuba easier and is a      new approach to dealing with the oppressive regime that is      currently leading Cuba.       All of these are steps America has taken in the past year      in the right direction. However, we still face many      challenges. The US has a growing income gap--the rich are      getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. This is      highlighted in the spending bill passed in December to      prevent the government shutdown. In it there were several      provisions to cut welfare spending, such as Medicare and      spending on the Women and Children support while there was      another provision essentially written by the banks to reverse      the Dodd Frank act. That act was written after the recession,      but now things will go back to the way they were. Lobbyists      for banks and for the wealthy have louder voices in      Washington. Over 50% of Congress people are millionaires,      while millionaires make up only 5% of the US population. This      helps explain why income inequality is only getting worse,      and is something that the American people must change.       It is harder for students to afford college. Student loans      are not of importance in Washington, which is something that      needs to be changed. More people are afraid of the debt they      will be in after getting their degree, and would rather start      working out of high school. This is not the path we should be      going on, and it is time for Congress to start listening to      the students and prioritizing education.       The media have recently brought the nation's attention to      police brutality, racial discrimination, and our broken      criminal justice system. President Obama allocated $263      million for police body cameras and training, which is an      acknowledgement of the need for reform but does not solve the      root problem. Although there was footage available for the      strangling of Eric Garner, the officer had no charges filed      against him. These injustices seem to be occurring only more      frequently, and Congress should focus its attention on real      solutions that will lead to demilitarization of the police      and a stop to the criminal     justice system disproportionately affecting minority groups.       We are still moving forward as a nation, but in 2015 we      must work to reverse trends such as the growing income gap,      increased police brutality, and losing sight of our      priorities. There is still hope for a brighter future if we      remember what values America really stands for.   Emily (Emery) Mead, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist)       As a young Vermonter, just getting ready to begin my      college journey, there are some concerns that trouble me most      about the future of our country. Please consider my advice as      you prepare your address on the state of our union. My main      concern is about how the transgender community is treated in      America. Things have gotten better for them, but there's      still quite a bit of discrimination against transgender      people. Many people don't think trans folk deserve rights,      but they're still just humans. I am a part of this community      so I know about its difficulties personally. I am physically      female but I identify as male.       One of the difficulties I have is the bathrooms and I'm not      the only one, it's one of the biggest problems for us. I am      literally terrified to go to the bathroom at school and in      other public places because I use the men's bathroom and      every time I do I'm afraid I will be ridiculed or kicked out      and have been confronted by kids telling me to stay out of      the guys bathroom at school. No one should be afraid to pee.       I don't have it that bad, for some people it's a lot worse.      A friend of mine came out as transgender to his family and      they kicked him out and disowned him. Luckily he has a very      supporting girlfriend who he's currently living with and good      friends who helped him with his struggles. Some people don't      have that kind of support. Some are kicked out of their      houses or run away from abusive families to live on the dirty      streets and beg for money to pay for food or to buy a blanket      to keep them warm on cold nights. An article about gay and      transgender youth homelessness on americanprogress.org gives      these stats which I have paraphrased; There is an estimated      1.6 million to 2.8 million homeless youth in the United      States; 20 to 40 percent of that are gay or transgender kids;      an estimated 320,000 to 400,000 gay and transgender youth are      facing homelessness each year. Some are lucky enough to find      a shelter or housing for transgender people, but not everyone      lives near one or knows about one near them. It's not right      for these kids to have no place to sleep.       These problems are very serious and need to be addressed      and fixed. A possible solution for the bathroom problem is to      fund more unisex bathrooms in more public places; I strongly      believe this will help reduce the awkwardness and fear of      going to the bathroom; even for those who are just      uncomfortable with using public bathrooms. As for the shelter      problem, putting more of these shelters around the country      and making them more advertised and well known these kids      won't be forced to live on the streets anymore.       Thank you for your consideration.               Alicia Muir, Milton High School (Finalist)       As a global powerhouse, the United States is bestowed with      a responsibility. This country stands upon its obligation and      ability to be innovative, to provide opportunity and to      maintain a respectable quality of living for every citizen. I      would like to take this moment to address where we stand on      these principles and how far we still have to go.       In our current state, economic problems are most apparent.      While the economy rests in a steady stage of recovery, many      of our neighbors struggle to obtain and secure an adequate      standard of living. We can try to justify yearly improvement      by pointing out that unemployment rates and gas prices are      down. But despite such progress, the standard of living is      always increasing. Paired with this fact is the abundant      number of citizens who struggle to survive on a wage that is      not livable. The obvious action to take is to raise the      federal minimum wage, which has been set at $7.25 since 2009.      For a single person working 40 hours a week, the basic costs      of food, housing, medical care, utilities, and other      necessary expenses should be attainable with the lowest      margin of pay. As of now, it is not. Starting in 2015, many      states have already decided to raise their minimum wage. If      we increase the pay benchmark on the federal level, every      state will have to do the same.       When high school graduates are launched into adulthood,      college is the promising route that comes with a discouraging      debt sentence. Higher education is needed to be competitive      in the job market. Rather than pouring mass amounts of money      into defense spending and other well budgeted programs,      legislators should create a larger budget for student loans      and grants. I urge the United States to make college more      accessible. In addition to the budget, the federal government      can offer incentives for universities that will encourage      them to administer greater financial aid packages and cut      tuition costs. Specific criteria can even be established to      provide free education to certain financial groups based on      their low incomes.       Transitioning to a problem that is often neglected, I      believe that as a country we must address the gender wage      gap. To this day, a vast majority of women make on average      only 75% of what men make. First, the United States has to      establish a paid pregnancy leave at the standard of other      industrialized nations. This will allow women to balance      earning a sustainable income and raising a family. We can      also regulate companies that retaliate against workers who      discuss their wages, as well as increase the limitations on      gender based pay discrimination. It's time to finally stop      employers from paying less for equal work. Let us break down      the glass ceiling.       To affirm that these programs will take place, and that      these solutions will triumph, it is vital that the Congress      disregards the party polarization that has crippled the      government for so long. With collaboration and determination,      the United States can prosper and prevail.            Curtis Richardson, Milton High School (Finalist)       My country, our country, is something I love and wish that      everyone within its borders receives the highest amount of      happiness possible and lives a life well fed and secure.       With that said an issue not talked about as much as it      should. Homelessness. People spend their nights in cold dark      alleyways covered only by the warmth of the Sunday paper.      Shelters are full, stomachs empty. There are children who are      homeless. There should never be a child without a warm place      to sleep. By enacting programs which employ the homeless, and      renovating buildings that serve no purpose, transforming them      into shelters and low income housing we can find a solution      to this problem and make sure that every American does not      have to worry where they are going to sleep.       The poverty level in the United States is at 14.5 percent      42,000,000 Americans. A percentage that is entirely too high.      A percentage of those Americans may work well over 40 hours a      week, put in overtime and are yet still unable to rise above      the poverty level. This is because the national minimum wage      is at $7.25. The minimum wage is not a livable wage. By      raising the national minimum wage to over $10 we can make      sure that those hard working Americans are not living below      the poverty line.       There is always a need for jobs in America. Many jobs are      being outsourced for big business to make more money. By      federally regulating how much a company can outsource jobs      from America we can make companies open more factories in      America and by doing so will open the way for more jobs      spread throughout these United States.       While there are many domestic issues that are very      important there are international ones as well. With the      terrorist group Isis still at large we must ensure the      security of citizens in the United States and places      overseas. That is why we will have troops ready to be      deployed. As long as there is a terrorist presence we will      protect the people of the United States and its allies.       Bees are needed in order to pollinate flowers and grow many      of the foods we eat. The bees are dying off and without them      many of the foods we eat will increase in price and will      deplete. Opening bee farms in America and increasing the bee      population we can save many crops and flowers that the bees      greatly assist with, and the federal government would also be      assisting those small bee farmers who may be running low on      business and this will be supporting the hard working      Americans and not big business.       This cannot be accomplished alone. It will take the country      as a whole cooperating with one another to make everything      here into a reality. Working past party lines and finding an      answer that's the best solution will ensure that these      problems are solved.      Friedemann Schmidt, Brattleboro Union High School (Finalist)       Under the presidency of Ronald Reagan the United States      turned within four years from the biggest creditor nation in      the world in 1981 to the world's largest debtor in 1985.      Supported by numerous foreign assignments of the U.S. Armed      forces, the public debt increased constantly, reaching a      figure of $18 trillion in recent years. This is a very      serious issue for the United States not only because it      deepens the dependence on creditor nations like China or      Saudi Arabia which neglect values like freedom and equality,      but also it directly affects everyone.       In 2013 the interest payments of the U.S. public debt made      up 6% of the federal budget excluding an actual debt      reduction. With a steadily growing budget deficit, primarily      due to outrageous defense spending, that figure will even      form a larger part of the annual budget plan. Presumably that      will lead to cuts in secondary areas like education,      transportation and social as well as scientific endeavors.      This symbolizes a threat to the belief of the founding      fathers in equality and perhaps makes a myth of the United      States offering fair chances for everyone, regardless of      status.       By decreasing the governmental funding of social programs,      like the free/reduced meal program offering meals to 20% of      food insecure students in Vermont, the living status of      numerous hard-working middle and lower class would drop. A      declining federal funding of universities and colleges      throughout the country would further increase the college      tuition for individuals, creating an unaffordable higher      education for hundreds of thousands of young, talented      Americans--a problem America already faces.       The social injustice created by enlarging the gap between      rich and poor, would weaken the unity of the United States as      much as decreasing the funding of America's world-     leading role in science and innovation, the key to economic      success and human progress itself. Former Secretary of Labor      Robert Reich states that due to the fact that ``Inequality      has become worse, the danger to the economy and democracy had      become worse.''       The public debt will be one of the major challenges for      United States politics in the near future. Facing it will      have to lead to changes of American policies and its lead in      world policy. Priorities have to be set and compromises have      to be made. Martin Luther King Jr. once said: ``A nation that      continues year after year to spend more money on military      defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching      spiritual death.'' It is the responsibility of every U.S.      citizen to prevent that in order to maintain the prosperity      and values for which America stands.               Sophia Seman, Essex High School (Finalist)       As our nation ages and evolves, the problems it faces      become more complex. Some of the greatest challenges we face      today are those of police brutality, a flawed naturalization      process, and the daunting cost of higher education.       In the past few months, cities in the US have erupted in      protests over police brutality. Starting in Ferguson,      marching feet have spread to New York and California. One      solution to the spreading mistrust in law enforcement is the      use of body cameras that would provide an account of each      interaction. While many speculate that this would be an      invasion of privacy, the departments that have tested these      devices decided the benefits outweigh the risks. Rialto, CA      has seen a ``60 percent reduction in officer use of force      incidents following camera deployment'' and an ``88 percent      reduction in number of citizen complaints''. The federal      government should issue categorical grants to any department      that opts to implement the use of this technology. The cost      to supply all the law enforcers with cameras may seem too      high, but eventually, the money saved in lawsuits would      counter the initial pay out.       This year, college students returned to school with      considerably lighter pockets, as state tuition climbed      another 2.9 percent. While many politicians realize the need      for a highly educated work force for the future economy, few      are willing to throw their weight behind the necessary      reforms to make it more affordable. If young adults are      expected to pay their way through college, they must have      viable options in student loans. Unfortunately, ``private      college loans are much cheaper than federal student loans      now''. It is the responsibility of our government to help      budding adults pay for higher education and mold themselves      into conscientious citizens by lowering federal interest      rates on loans.       The US has always been a nation of immigrants. However it      is the unfortunate American tradition that the newest wave of      immigrants is detested by those who have formed roots. Today      it is the Latinos who face a wave of prejudice. As much as it      pains some lawmakers to admit, we need the fresh faces and      new ideas as much as these prospective citizens need refuge      from the turmoil of their home country. It is time for a      renovation of the naturalization process. Because the US does      not have an official language and many new citizens site      English as ``one of the biggest obstacles'', the English      portion of the test should be eliminated. Questions      pertaining to civil rights should be emphasized on the Civics      Test, rather than superfluous ones about history, as citizens      should be more aware of their rights and responsibilities      than the War of 1812.       The most pressing issues facing the Union today are those      of police brutality, rising college and university costs and      the labyrinthine naturalization process. They demand quick,      effective solutions, such as police-worn cameras, lowered      interest rates on student loans, and a revised naturalization      test.                          ____________________
