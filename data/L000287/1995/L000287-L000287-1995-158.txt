Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from New York [Mr. LaFalce].  [[Page H70]] Mr. LaFALCE. Mr. Speaker, I beseech you, think what you are doing today. It may be the most important vote of your congressional career.  208 years ago this same fundamental debate took place. You have the opportunity to side with James Madison, with Alexander Hamilton, and continue the principles of the Constitution, or you have the opportunity, by your vote today, to side with those who wanted to retain the Articles of Confederation.  This amendment does violence to the principles established by our forefathers and by each and every one of our descendants in this House of Representatives. It is inherently unfair; it is inherently undemocratic; it is inherently unconstitutional.
