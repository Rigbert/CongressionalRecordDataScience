 It says.       (B) if directed by the parent of an eligible child,      provided by the school or local educational agency through a      school-based program . . . that a parent directs that the      services be provided through a tutorial assistance provided.  It is not directed by the school but directed by the parent.  I think that is one of the underlying flaws and concerns we have. As aformer school board member, I do not know how a school district is going to manage this when parents come to the school indicating they have the right to this money, and you figure, as a school, how you do your accounting, how you determine whether that child actually gets the money, how you hire teachers. And, frankly, the parent is in control. It is very clear in the language of this bill.  The Senator from New Hampshire made a very specific case that he thought it was the school. If the language reflected that, I would believe it. But the language says very clearly that the parent can take their title I money and take it to another school. We interpret that, and everyone else will, as private or public because it is not defined as public.  I yield the floor.
