 President, first of all, the Senator from Michigan wants us to believe that the sense-of-the-Senate resolution is going to bind every regulator who is working under the constitutional authority of the President--that they will not perform their responsibilities; that a sense-of-the-Senate resolution will somehow amend the Constitution, take away statutory authority of the bureaucrat. No sense-of-the-Senate amendment can or will do that or ever has done that.  The other point is that Congress does not turn anything over to the Congressional Budget Office through this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. This is our decision to make. There is no regulation that in any way can be stalled by either part of my amendment. It is not intended to do that. For the Senator from Michigan, it is not intended to take, nor will it take away any statutory responsibilities or constitutional responsibilities of any employee or officer of the executive branch.  I am always willing to work something out, but I think we have reached a point where yesterday and today we have tried to work out things in this area. One of the very concerns that the Senator from Michigan had previously with my amendment, in some of the discussions before, was the extent to which CBO could do this within their budget. From that standpoint, the Senator from Michigan just got an amendment adopted by this body that, within the same budget limitation of the CBO, asked them to do exactly what I am doing with my amendment.  So I think it is a little bit wrong for the Senator from Michigan to come here and say that I am asking too much of the Congressional Budget Office, or that a sense-of-the-Senate resolution will reduce the statutory responsibilities or the congressional responsibilities of any person within the executive branch.  How much time do I have left?
