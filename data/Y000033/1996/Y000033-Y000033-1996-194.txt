I want to suggest respectfully that whatever happens, the gentleman will be in on the conference. It is my intention to see that the Presidio bill becomes a reality, but I cannot say that we will not add a few more straws to this wagonload that I hope the gentleman might see the wisdom of accepting, and where we disagree, I am confident that with the Senate side, we may not reach that point where they will be added, but I cannot say what will and will not be added to this wagonload, and it is a wagonload.  Most of those parts of hay have already been voted on in this House. There are a couple on the Senate side that were not, but have great interest to House Members on this side, and we have been reviewing each one of those that have been added. There may be a couple of others that we would like to solve a problem with on this side which I am sure the gentleman will support. Some he may not be too happy with.                              {time}  1830  But we are going to talk about that.
