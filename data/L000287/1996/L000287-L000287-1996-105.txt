Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call to the attention of my colleagues a very constructive public education campaign that has been undertaken by the American Jewish Committee [AJC], an organization with which I have had the pleasure to work with for many years.  As part of its mandate to promote tolerance and safeguard the essential ideal of pluralism, the AJC has run full-page advertisements in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other publications enunciating the theme, ``It Takes All Kinds.'' The AJC statement proudly commends our country for having achieved, to an extent nowhere else on Earth, a common dream of freedom. But, at the same time, the statement acknowledges that this dream has been subject to challenge. From the recent series of church burnings, to the increasingly loud voices that promote division along racial, ethnic, and religious lines, and with the threat of domestic and international terrorism within our borders, America's common dream is threatened by the haters and the dividers.  I applaud the American Jewish Committee for the service it has performed in raising public consciousness of the danger posed to all of us by those few who espouse words--and carry out actions--of hate and divisiveness, and in inviting us to partake in the daily enterprise of ensuring that America fulfills its promise of freedom, justice, and mutual respect for all.  I ask that the text of the American Jewish Committee's ad ``It Takes All Kinds'' be included in the Congressional Record.                           It Takes All Kinds       The tired. The poor. The huddled masses yearning to breathe      free.       From every corner of the world, from every race, faith,      culture and creed, we have come or been brought to America.      Separately and together, we have dreamed of freedom. And in      America, as nowhere else on earth, we have made the dream of      freedom real.       But today, that common dream of freedom, that common      pursuit by a diverse people of a stronger and fairer America,      is challenged. In communities across the land, suspicious      fires lay waste to African-American and other churches,      sowing fear and outrage. In the media, in the halls of      Congress, on the campaign trail and in the streets, angry      voices echo distressingly familiar calls to divide America      into ``us'' and ``them'' along ethnic, racial, religious and      other lines. The well-being of American democratic      pluralism--in which each of us holds an equal stake in our      nation's future--is in question.       At the American Jewish Committee, we have worked for 90      years to safeguard that essential ideal of pluralism. The      task is critical. Too easily and too often, the delicate      cords of law and civility that bind society have frayed,      setting group against group. When those cords snap, all are      threatened, indeed, the essence of America is imperiled.       Join us in the cause of keeping America safe from the      haters and dividers. Join us in the vital, daily enterprise      of ensuring America fulfills its promise of freedom, justice      and mutual respect for all.                          ____________________
