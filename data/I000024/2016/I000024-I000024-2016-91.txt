``For example, if the Administrator finds that disposal of a chemical substance may pose risks that could be prevented or reduced under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Administrator should ensure that the relevant office of the EPA receives that information.''  Likewise, the House Report on section 9 of TSCA states: ``For example, if the Administrator determines that a risk to health or the environment associated with disposal of a chemical substance could be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Administrator should use those authorities to protect against the risk.''  This act states in new section 9(a)(5) of TSCA that the Administrator shall not be relieved of any obligation to take appropriate action to address risks from a chemical substance under sections 6(a) and 7, including risks posed by disposal of the chemical substance or mixture. Consistent with the Senate and House reports, this provision means that the Administrator should use authorities under the other laws such as the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prevent or reduce the risks associated with disposal of a chemical substance or mixture.  Senator Vitter, I know another section that is very important to you is the language around sound science and we all know you have worked to ensure that this bill fixes the scientific concerns of the National Academy of Science and other scientific bodies who have raised concerns with the way EPA has reviewed chemicals in the past. Could you please discuss the Congressional intent of the bills science provisions?
