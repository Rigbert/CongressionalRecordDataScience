 President, while the Senator from Connecticut is on the floor, I will just say one thing. In this case, I think he underestimates what he has undertaken here and the impact of it. This is more than merely a resolution. It calls for a very specific action. The truth of the matter is that, according to my information, every single time we have responded to Milosevic's thuggery, every single time we have threatened action and/or taken action, he has backed down. I happen to think that the one thing that can alter his conduct in Kosovo--because it will reoccur again--the one thing that he pays most attention to is his own naked personal self-interest. He has been playing on this Serbian nationalism as communism has collapsed in the former Yugoslavia like a harp. But even his people are beginning to tire of what he is doing. He has been spreading lies and has been on Belgrade television talking about the awful things that are happening to Serbs--orthodox Serbs--in Kosovo, which are not true. He has been fomenting this kind of awful conduct for some time.  I think, in addition to what we have here in the resolution, that ultimately we are going to have to face up to the fact that he is a war criminal. We should have him tried as one. I think that will change his conduct more than anything else.  But I compliment the Senator from Connecticut for his initiative. In this case, words count. I am confident that if we are able to take this action, in the sense that the administration follows through on the essence of the resolution here, that we can impact upon the circumstances of Kosovo. We are not asking for independence. We are not dictating an outcome. We are dictating an end to the conduct. I think the answer lies in autonomy, which he revoked in 1989. But that is to be negotiated.  But I compliment the Senator on his initiative. Words count here.  I yield the floor.  Is my friend seeking recognition?
