 President, I rise today to pay tribute to four brave individuals who lost their lives last week in a tragic helicopter crash in Breathitt County, Kentucky. Sheila Zellers, Brian Harden, Ernie Jones, and Don Green, were crew members on a helicopter providing emergency medical service to rural Eastern Kentucky. On Monday June 14, 1999, these dedicated care-givers were returning to the University of Kentucky's Chandler Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky, from Breathitt County Airport. Tragically, they did not make it.  Mrs. Sheila Zellers, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, served as the flight nurse on the helicopter and had worked with the University of Kentucky's hospital for more than twenty years. She served in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit and emergency room before becoming a flight nurse in 1991. More importantly, she was a loving wife and mother. Our hearts and prayers go out to her husband Jeffrey and their four sons.  Mr. Brian Harden, from Richmond, Kentucky, was the paramedic on Monday's flight crew. While only 33, he had already had a distinguished career providing emergency medical services in Kentucky as a paramedic. Flight paramedics, such as Mr. Harden, are critical in providing emergency care from the time they leave the scene until they reach the hospital. I would like to extend the Senate's deepest sympathies to his wife Patricia, and their two young daughters.  The helicopter's two pilots, Ernie Jones and Don Green, were both well-known among their colleagues as experienced, highly-skilled pilots. Frequently, the pilots who fly these emergency helicopters are called upon to land their helicopters in small parking lots, highways, pastures, and gorges, in order to safely evacuate their patients. Their families and friends will be in our prayers.  It is important that we recognize the impact these individuals and their colleagues have on the citizens of Eastern Kentucky. Like so much of rural America, the residents of Eastern Kentucky lack easy access to the advanced medical resources and trauma centers available in more metropolitan areas. In order to provide this much needed care to Eastern Kentucky, the University of Kentucky Medical Center began helicopter flights to the region in 1987. For 12 years, these emergency medical crews have ferried accident victims, critically ill children, cardiac patients, and infants too ill to travel by ambulance to the UK Medical Center. It is not unusual for these dedicated caregivers to work twelve hour shifts and fly up to seven missions a day, each time making a difference in the lives of their patients. It is with this in mind that we recognize the sacrifices of these dedicated care-givers and note that they will be forever missed by their families, friends, colleagues, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                          ____________________
