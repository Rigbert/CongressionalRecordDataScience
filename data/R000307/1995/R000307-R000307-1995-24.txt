Chairman, I have a letter from our Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Dan Glickman. You know who is into market promotion big time under GATT, under free trade? Not the United States, not McDonald's, not Gallo. It is the European Union. As has been stated, they are spending more for wine export promotion than we invest in all of our products.  The gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Zimmer], the gentleman from New York [Mr. Schumer], and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hoke] should introduce their bills in the British Parliament and the French Assembly and the German Bundestag.  It is easy to say the check goes to McDonald's. It does not. It goes to the United States Poultry, Egg and Potato Council, and McDonald's matches that contribution so that that customer in McDonald's in Bangkok will eat American French fries and American Egg McMuffins, representing 2,000 jobs in New Jersey, 10,000 jobs in New York, and I would tell the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hoke], 30,000 jobs in Ohio, not Chinese products.                              {time}  1500
