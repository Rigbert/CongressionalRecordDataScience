 Now, the gentleman mentioned that the border wall was going to be fully paid for. The Homeland Security bill is not a part of the package that includes four bills. Madam Speaker, can the gentleman tell me what bill that will be included in?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, the President campaigned across America to the American public about making sure our borders are secure. Many Members on both sides of the aisle know the challenges we have along the border. The President requested and this fully funds the President's request.  As I look back in history along this line about border security, there aremany times in history it shows, just a short history ago, of those who have voted for it. Hillary Clinton has voted for border security as well on the wall, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Chuck Schumer.  This will be an amendment made in Rules for the bill.
