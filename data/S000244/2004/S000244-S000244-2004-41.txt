Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Speaker, lest anyone be confused as a result of the previous speaker that this is a wide-ranging, overall immigration bill that deals with amnesty and guest workers and all of those very contentious issues, let me lay that impression to rest. This bill does not do that, and I fear that the previous speaker's statement ends up hurting the support for this bill that is broad and bipartisan.  All this bill does is allow a foreign national who is a graduate of an American medical school and who has completed his residency in an American hospital to practice in a medically-underserved area, somewhere in the United States, and the request would have to be made by a State Department of Public Health and limited to no more than 50 doctors per State.  Now, this is not what the gentlewoman from Texas is talking about. We will deal with that in due course, but let us make sure that this bill is not confused with the other more broad and contentious bills.  This bill has to pass because it extends a program that expired in June of this year, and if we vote this legislation down, then we are not going to have those doctors in the medically-underserved areas.  We should keep the discussion and bills like this confined to what is in the bill, rather than a wide-ranging overall debate on immigration policy.
