Speaker, I am pleased that SCHIP is on the committee's agenda for next week. Hopefully, that can be brought to the floor before we leave in this work period, perhaps just before or just after the Dream Act is brought to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, it is our understanding that today could be the very last time that Margarida Curtis provides a message to us on this floor.  We would like to thank Margarida Curtis. From a very grateful nation, thank you for your service. Many times the American people see your voice, but also the power of what you bring back and forth to make this democracy work. We want to thank you for your service, and we wish you all the happiness in retirement.
