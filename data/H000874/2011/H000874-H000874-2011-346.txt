Speaker, I would like to put this important piece on early-childhood education into the Congressional Record. Its author is Jack Bailer, an outstanding Maryland educator and President of the Judith P. Hoyer Foundation, which promotes early-childhood education for Maryland's at-risk children.                     We Must Not Leave Them Wanting                             By Jack Bailer       ``For Want of a Nail'' is a proverbial verse showing that      actions--or inactions--which may seem insignificant can often      have significant consequences:       For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.       For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.       For want of a horse, the rider was lost.       For want of a rider, the battle was lost.       For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost.       And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.       I suggest we could draw a strong parallel between the nail      in the verse and a young child's having (or not having) the      benefit of one or two years' participation in an early      childhood (pre-kindergarten) education program.       Two examples of such programs would be ``Head Start'' and      Maryland's 25 ``Judy Hoyer Family Education Centers,'' aka      ``Judy Centers.'' The Judy Centers offer early education for      children from birth through five years of age. They also      arrange for many other services to be provided to these      children and their families--either located on site year-     round, or brought in on a visiting basis as needed.       The primary candidates for these programs are three- and      four-year-old children who are in home environments often      referred to as ``economically and/or culturally      disadvantaged.'' This includes those who get little or no      exposure to learning about the world around them, as well as      those families where little or no English is spoken.       Lacking experience in an early learning program, these      children will enter kindergarten with a very low level of      ``readiness to learn.''       You may ask, what is the difference between ``readiness to      learn'' and actual learning? Sesame Street provides many      examples throughout its episodes. Here are just two:       When Grover gets out of breath repeatedly running back and      forth from off in the distance yelling ``This is far,'' to      face-in-the-camera panting ``This is NEAR,'' the child viewer      learns the concept of Near vs. Far.       When we see one of their spots with the song, ``One of      these things is not like the others; three of these things      are kind of the same,'' the child learns the concept of Same      vs. Different.       If you'd like more examples, ask any early childhood      education professional and they'll give you many, all falling      under one or more of seven domains: Social Personal;      Language; Mathematical Thinking; Physical Development;      Scientific Thinking; Social Studies; The Arts.       For a child who has not had the pre-kindergarten      opportunity to achieve a ``readiness to learn'' so essential      for a successful K-12 experience, the sequence of      consequences could look something like this:       Grades K-3: For want of having acquired few if any      readiness-to-learn experiences prior to kindergarten, a child      doesn't get the full value of what the teacher is saying. And      often neither the child nor the teacher realizes that a point      made by the teacher is missed because the child is lacking      the benefit of an earlier learning experience.       Grades 4-6: For want of the cumulative effects of full      value of instruction because of a weaker K-3 foundation,      student progress during this period is further diminished--     especially in reading comprehension.       Grades 7-8: For want of reading skills which even approach      grade level, in the face of an increased need to be able to      read to learn, the student slips further behind.       Grades 9-10: For want of reading and learning skills which      would make school interesting and satisfying, the student      becomes increasingly disconnected from class work and school      in general. The student shows up less and less frequently,      and even then it is more to be around their friends than to      go to class.       Grades 11-12: For want of any further interest in or hope      of ever catching up, the student drops out, drifts for a      while, maybe works at a menial job, and/or ends up in the      criminal justice system.       This discouraging sequence is not an exaggeration.      Longitudinal studies have been done--the most notable being      the Chicago school system study. That study tracked two      groups of students for over 20 years. One group had a strong      beginning with the benefit of a pre-kindergarten readiness-     to-learn experience. The other group did not.       By the time both groups were well beyond high school age,      nearly all of those in the group with early childhood      education were clearly on their way to living successful,      productive lives. Sadly, most of those in the other group      were not.       As for societal and budgetary impacts, one study showed      that, for every one dollar spent on pre-kindergarten      preparation for learning, seven dollars are saved on      government spending for public safety, the justice system,      and the prison system.       In the years ahead we will continue to face tough choices      among priorities competing for limited public funds. I      believe that over-arching all of these is the critical need      to give every young child a preparation for learning upon      which to grow intellectually for the rest of their lives.      Among the benefits we get are: A more highly skilled work     force; A highly employable work force; An increase in workers      contributing to the tax base; A decreasing percentage of our      population who fall into the justice system; A higher quality      of life for all.       What can you do to make a difference?       Contact your local school board members and superintendent      and urge them to fully fund early childhood (pre-     kindergarten) education for all children in your jurisdiction      who need it.       Insist that the system determine how many children in your      district currently need to be in a readiness-to-learn      environment--but are not.       Continue following up to see that, using these data, the      school system creates and implements an action plan to      reallocate funds as necessary, and to deal with staffing,      space, and other issues to get all those children into the      system by opening of school next year, or the following year      at the latest.       Clearly the increased funding for this will be a challenge.      Nevertheless, if our nation is to survive and thrive, we      simply must do this. We must not leave behind a single child      who may have succeeded in life, but for want of an early      childhood education which got them ready to learn. We must      not risk the loss of our nation, for want of giving this our      most urgent attention.                          ____________________
