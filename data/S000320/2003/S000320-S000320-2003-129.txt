 President, I rise today to once again introduce my flat tax bill, S. 1040. Although I fully support the President's plan for economic growth, I believe that we can do even better. Like the President's plan, my bill eliminates the double taxation of dividends. However, instead of retaining the current progressive tax rates that impede economic growth, S. 1040 creates a single rate for all taxpayers--seventeen percent when the tax is fully implemented--and gives tax-free treatment to all savings and investment, not just dividends.  A major reason why I support the flat tax is because it will place more money into the hands of hardworking Americans and will allow individuals--not the government--to decide how to best spend their money. Lowering taxes gives Americans more money for a large number of things such as monthly bills, insurance coverage, educational costs, prescription drugs, and family getaways. Lowering taxes also makes it easier for Americans to plan for their future through private savings. Although I strongly believe in the importance of private savings, my bill leaves the Social Security system intact and, in fact, provides seniors with more money by repealing the current tax on Social Security benefits.  I have said many times before that our current progressive tax system is unfair in that it punishes success. The only way to ensure true fairness is to adopt a single tax rate for all taxpayers. Transitioning to such a tax will not only increase the fairness of the tax code, but it will also increase the incentives to work and thus boost economic growth.  The flat tax is not only fairer than the current income tax, but it's also undeniably less complex. Under a flat tax, taxpayers would be able to fit their return on a form the size of a post card. Rather than spending hours pouring over convoluted IRS forms, or resorting to professional tax assistance, the flat tax allows taxpayers to determine their taxes quickly and easily. Paying taxes may never be a pleasant experience, but at least under a flat tax it wouldn't be mind-boggling.  I fully realize that the bill I am introducing today is a monumental shift from the current tax code. However, we must not allow the enormity of the task to deter us from enacting better, more efficient tax laws. I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
