Speaker, I tell the gentlewoman from Washington State, nobody wants this investigation to go away or to end. In fact, the gentlewoman from Washington may not know, there is a district attorney of Orange County investigating this case. That investigation is before the grand jury and ought to continue. The Secretary of State has a responsibility to ensure voter integrity on the rolls. He is continuing his investigation.  The judge from Ohio said this always happens. It never happens.  Mr. Dornan has said his case is over. He has rested in effect. The jury is never allowed to get additional evidence, never. What kind of law do you practice on that side where the jury can say, well, I know the two parties have rested but we are going to get additional evidence? It never happens, my friends, never. They can ask to review existing evidence; that is true. But they cannot go out and seek new evidence.  Mr. Dornan says this case is through. It is time for the parties to decide. The fact of the matter is, these figures put forth by the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Ehlers], nobody knows. The gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Ehlers] put up some figures, 979, that is the most important figure. That is the majority by which Loretta Sanchez was elected to this House.  He then gets down to other figures, 6000. That has less, I tell you, than 500 who possibly could be considered in the 46th district. I do not even know why that 6000 was on that board, because they are not involved in the 46th district, all of them, some are.  The fact of the matter is, however, as the gentleman from Connecticut pointed out, nobody knows or will know for whom those folks voted. We do know this: that over a third of those people are Republicans, about 15 percent are other independents, not affiliated. Only half are Democrats. It is time to end this case.
