Speaker, I come to the floor in sadness today to pay tribute to a good friend and a man of exceptional political insight, Bill Morgan of Baton Rouge, LA. Bill died this week at the age of 53.  Bill Morgan served the Congress as majority counsel to the Joint Economic Committee from 1977 to 1980. Subsequently, the worked as a media consultant on numerous campaigns throughout the south and midwest, including some of mine.  I knew Bill as a knowledgeable, intelligent, and wise counselor. A person whose advice could be relied upon. He began his working life as a reporter. He went on to earn a masters degree in political science and a law degree from LSU. And he transformed his varied experience into his own political media consulting firm in 1983. A Vietnam veteran, he always distinguished himself by his love of country, his deep dedication, and his infectious sense of humor.  Bill Morgan will be missed. We thank his family for sharing him with us and wish them Godspeed.                          ____________________
