President, I would like to remark briefly on a matter of critical importance to me, related to one of the bills included in this omnibus, VA-HUD. The Senate Committee on Appropriations' Report on VA-HUD contains language directing the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry--ATSDR--to assess the lead levels at the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma, and to submit a report to Congress on this assessment no later than July 31, 2004. As a Senator from Oklahoma, and as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this endeavor to more fully understand the elevated lead levels we're seeing in this community, particularly in children. As the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over both Superfund and ATSDR, I would like to take this opportunity to elaborate on my expectations of ATSDR in connection with this directive: I am urging ATSDR, in collaboration with the Oklahoma State Health Department, to work to identify significant sources and pathways of exposure to lead that may be contributing to elevated blood lead levels in children at the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma.
