 President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the English translation of remarks made this morning by Pope Francis, who addressed the new nonresident ambassadors to the Holy See.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: english language translation of pope francis' address for the new non-resident ambassadors to the holy see: kyrgyzstan, antigua and barbuda,                  luxembourg and botswana (16 May 2013)       Your Excellencies,       I am pleased to receive you for the presentation of the      Letters accrediting you as Ambassadors Extraordinary and      Plenipotentiary to the Holy See on the part of your      respective countries: Kytgyzstan, Antigua and Barbuda, the      Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and Botswana. The gracious words      which you have addressed to me, for which I thank you      heartily, have testified that the Heads of State of your      countries are concerned to develop relations of respect and      cooperation with the Holy See. I would ask you kindly to      convey to them my sentiments of gratitude and esteem,      together with the assurance of my prayers for them and their      fellow citizens.       Ladies and Gentlemen, our human family is presently      experiencing something of a turning point in its own history,      if we consider the advances made in various areas. We can      only praise the positive achievements which contribute to the      authentic welfare of mankind, in fields such as those of      health, education and communications. At the same time, we      must also acknowledge that the majority of the men and women      of our time continue to live daily in situations of      insecurity, with dire consequences. Certain pathologies are      increasing, with their psychological consequences; fear and      desperation grip the hearts of many people, even in the so-     called rich countries; the joy of life is diminishing;      indecency and violence are on the rise; poverty is becoming      more and more evident. People have to struggle to live and,      frequently, to live in an undignified way. One cause of this      situation, in my opinion, is in our relationship with money,      and our acceptance of its power over ourselves and our      society. Consequently the financial crisis which we are      experiencing makes us forget that its ultimate origin is to      be found in a profound human crisis. In the denial of the      primacy of human beings! We have created new idols. The      worship of the golden calf of old (cf. Ex 32:15-34) has found      a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the      dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any      truly humane goal.       The worldwide financial and economic crisis seems to      highlight their distortions and above all the gravely      deficient human perspective, which reduces man to one of his      needs alone, namely, consumption. Worse yet, human beings      themselves are nowadays considered as consumer goods which      can be used and thrown away. We have begun a throw away      culture. This tendency is seen on the level of individuals      and whole societies; and it is being promoted! In      circumstances like these, solidarity, which is the treasure      of the poor, is often considered counterproductive, opposed      to the logic of finance and the economy. While the income of      a minority is increasing exponentially, that of the majority      is crumbling. This imbalance results from ideologies which      uphold the absolute autonomy of markets and financial      speculation, and thus deny the right of control to States,      which are themselves charged with providing for the common      good. A new, invisible and at times virtual, tyranny is      established, one which unilaterally and irremediably imposes      its own laws and rules. Moreover, indebtedness and credit      distance countries from their real economy and citizens from      their real buying power. Added to this, as if it were needed,      is widespread corruption and selfish fiscal evasion which      have taken on worldwide dimensions. The will to power and of      possession has become limitless.       Concealed behind this attitude is a rejection of ethics, a      rejection of God. Ethics, like solidarity, is a nuisance! It      is regarded as counterproductive: as something too human,      because it relativizes money and power; as a threat, because      it rejects manipulation and subjection of people: because      ethics leads to God, who is situated outside the categories      of the market. These financiers, economists and politicians      consider God to be unmanageable, unmanageable even dangerous,      because he calls man to his full realization and to      independence from any kind of slavery. Ethics--naturally, not      the ethics of ideology--makes it possible, in my view, to      create a balanced social order that is more humane. In this      sense, I encourage the financial experts and the political      leaders of your countries to consider the words of Saint     John Chrysostom: ``Not to share one's goods with the poor is      to rob them and to deprive them of life. It is not our goods      that we possess, but theirs'' (Homily on Lazarus, 1:6-PG 48,      992D),       Dear Ambassadors, there is a need for financial reform      along ethical lines that would produce in its turn an      economic reform to benefit everyone. This would nevertheless      require a courageous change of attitude on the part of      political leaders. I urge them to face this challenge with      determination and farsightedness, taking account, naturally,      of their particular situations. Money has to serve, not to      rule! The Pope loves everyone, rich and poor alike, but the      Pope has the duty, in Christ's name, to remind the rich to      help the poor, to respect them, to promote them. The Pope      appeals for disinterested solidarity and for a return to      person-centred ethics in the world of finance and economics.       For her part, the Church always works for the integral      development of every person, In this sense, she reiterates      that the common good should not be simply an extra, simply a      conceptual scheme of inferior quality tacked onto political      programmes. The Church encourages those in power to be truly      at the service of the common good of their peoples. She urges      financial leaders to take account of ethics and solidarity.      And why should they not turn to God to draw inspiration from      his designs? in this way, a new political and economic      mindset would arise that would help to transform the absolute      dichotomy between the economic and social spheres into a      healthy symbiosis.       Finally, through you, I greet with affection the Pastors      and the faithful of the Catholic communities present in your      countries. I urge them to continue their courageous and      joyful witness of faith and fraternal love in accordance with      Christ's teaching. Let them not be afraid to offer their      contribution to the development of their countries, through      initiatives and attitudes inspired by the Sacred Scriptures!      And as you inaugurate your mission, I extend to you, dear      Ambassadors, my very best wishes, assuring you of the      assistance of the Roman Curia for the fulfilment of you      duties. To this end, upon you and your families, and also      upon your Embassy staff, I willingly invoke abundant divine      blessings.
