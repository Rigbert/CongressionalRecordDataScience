Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I come before the House today to urge its support for H.R. 1184, the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1999.  Mr. Chairman, it is a common complaint that we cannot control the weather, neither can we control earthquakes, nor after years of effort can we even forecast them with any confidence. But we can prepare for them, and that is the main purpose of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program, known as NEHRP.  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, 39 States are subject to serious earthquake risk, and 75 million people live in urban areas with moderate to high earthquake risk. The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates the annual loss resulting from earthquakes is $4.4 billion. The Northridge earthquake of 1994 alone resulted in damages of $40 billion.  Still, to date we have been fortunate that an earthquake with the destructive force of the Tangshan, China event of 1976 or the Kobe, Japan event of 1995 has not struck a large U.S. city. But if history is any guide, the U.S. will be hit by violent shocks sometime in the not too distant future. Indeed, major earthquakes have been recorded throughout our Nation's history: in southern Missouri in 1811 and 1812, southern California in 1857, Hawaii in 1868, South Carolina in 1886, Alaska in 1899, and northern California in 1906.  The same geologic processes that led to these cataclysmic events are still at work today. That we know. What we do not know is when and where these forces will be unleashed.  Earthquakes may be inevitable, but catastrophic losses of life and property need not be if we use science to help communities prepare. The provisions in H.R. 1184 do just that.  Four agencies participate in NEHRP: the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  For fiscal year 2000, H.R. 1184 authorizes $99.6 million for the base activities in these agencies, including specific authorizations for the U.S. Geological Survey for the Global Seismic Network, the Real-Time Seismic Warning System pilot program, external research, and an advisory committee. For fiscal year 2001, the bill authorizes $102.6 million for these base earthquake programs, an increase of 3 percent.  In addition, H.R. 1184 includes multiyear authorizations for two new projects, each of which grew out of congressional direction in the last NEHRP bill. The Advanced National Seismic Research and Monitoring System will update the Nation's existing seismic monitoring network, which is based on 30-year-old technology.  The bill authorizes $170.8 million over 5 years for the U.S. Geological Survey for equipment, and a further $14.8 million over 2 years for the incremental costs of system operation.  The Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation will link more than 30 earthquake engineering research facilities and upgrade and expand major earthquake testing facilities. H.R. 1184 provides the National Science Foundation with a 5-year authorization totaling $81.8 million for this program.  Finally, the bill authorizes a Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee at the U.S. Geological Survey, requires greater interagency coordination in formulating the Program's budget, requests a report on how the Program meets the needs of at-risk populations, and repeals obsolete provisions of the statute.  With earthquakes, it is not a question of if, but when the next one willstrike. Through its emphasis on monitoring, research, and mitigation, H.R. 1184 will help the Nation prepare for the inevitable and save lives and property.  I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Basic Research, for drafting such a fine bill; the gentleman from California (Mr. Brown), the minority ranking member of the Committee on Science, for his continued support of the program; and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for her valued input in the consideration of this bill.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1184 represents the sensible, long-term investment that will pay for itself many times over and save lives and reduce property costs. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Chairman, I insert the following for the Record:                                         House of Representatives,                                         Committee on Science,                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1999.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of April 16,      regarding H.R. 1184, the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of      1999.       I understand that your waiver of Resources Committee      jurisdiction should not be construed to affect any future      referrals of bills dealing with the same subject matter. I      also will support the Resources Committee request to be      represented on any conference on H.R. 1184 or related bill.       H.R. 1184 is scheduled for Floor consideration on April 21      and I will include this letter as part of the floor      proceedings.       I, as well as my staff, look forward to working with you if      H.R. 1184 should go to conference and also, collaborating      with you on any legislation on which we may share      jurisdiction in the future.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
