President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator Peter Fitzgerald, to submit a resolution in support of the establishment of the National Railroad Hall of Fame in Galesburg, Illinois.  The state of Illinois has played a pioneering role in the growth of the railroad industry. In 1849, the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad was organized. The city of Galesburg joined Chicago by rail six years later in 1854. In addition, the Carl Sandburg College of Galesburg was one of the first colleges to establish an educational curriculum in railroading.  This privately-funded museum will help promote and encourage a better understanding of the origins and growth of the railroad industry. It will also highlight the efforts of men and women whose hard work and resourcefulness helped build one of the nation's best modes of transportation.  Already, the Illinois General Assembly, with the unqualified support of our state's new governor, George Ryan, has passed a resolution similar to the one I am introducing today. This resolution is also supported by major railways, railroad organizations, and rail employee organizations. Nineteen members of the House of Representatives have cosponsored an identical measure in the House. Approval by the Senate will be one more step toward establishing this museum.  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass this resolution in a timely fashion so that we can properly honor the railroad industry and its many pioneers.                          ____________________
