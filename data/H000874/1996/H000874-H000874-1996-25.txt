Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time.  In October of 1995 a demented person or persons, because of an alleged grievance, killed 168 innocent human beings. Terrorism is a problem and terrorism must be dealt with, met and defeated.  Like every other Member of this body, I presume I will vote for this legislation.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania says if it goes one centimeter forward to make us more secure it is perhaps worth voting for, and in my perception it does not harm and therefore is worth voting for.  But it is a shame, my colleagues, that we did not, as the distinguished gentleman from Illinois said so correctly back in March and repeats today, that we did not take definitive, effective action to enhance our ability to determine who is likely to commit a terrorist act so that we are not responding to that act to determine who killed one or a hundred or a thousand innocent people.  I would urge the individuals in the majority party who have the control and who have presented this to us, frankly, on very short notice, to work in a bipartisan fashion under the leadership of the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, the distinguished gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] to respond effectively and confront those who are demented and who would attack and kill and make less secure this great land.  In closing, let me say as an aside that I would hope we would also focus in the airport security with the dogs, on the ATF's current capability, and make sure that that is fully utilized now and in the future.
