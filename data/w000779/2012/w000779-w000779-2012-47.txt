President, I rise today to discuss the critical need in today's health care workforce for additional training related to palliative care. Palliative care is an interdisciplinary model of care focused on relieving the pain, stress and other debilitating symptoms of serious illness, such as cancer, cardiac disease, respiratory disease, kidney failure, Alzheimer's, AIDS, ALS, and MS. Its goal is to relieve suffering and provide the best possible quality of life for patients and their families.  Many people mistakenly believe that palliative care is only beneficial when a cure is not possible. Actually, palliative care is not dependent on a life-limiting prognosis and may actually help individuals recover by relieving symptoms--such as pain, anxiety or loss of appetite--while they are undergoing sometimes difficult medical treatments or procedures, such as surgery or chemotherapy. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other specialists who work with a patient's other health care providers to provide an extra layer of support, including assistance with difficult medical decision-making and coordination of care among specialists. Palliative care is appropriate for people of any age and at any stage in an illness, whether that illness is curable, chronic or life-threatening.  There is a specific type of palliative care, called hospice, for people for whom a cure is no longer possible and who likely have 6 months or less to live. Hospice care can be provided at one's home, a hospice facility, a hospital or a nursing home. Hospice care is about giving patients control, dignity and comfort so they have the best possible quality of life during the time they have. Hospice care also provides support and grief therapy for loved ones whose struggles are often cast aside or forgotten during treatment.  A growing evidence base has demonstrated that palliative care, including hospice, improves quality, controls cost and enhances patient and family satisfaction for the rapidly expanding population of individuals with serious or life-threatening illness. Palliative care may also prolong the lives of some seriously ill patients.  Over the last 10 years, the number of hospital-based palliative care programs has more than doubled due to the increasing number of Americans living with serious, complex and chronic illnesses and the realities of the care responsibilities faced by their families. Studies suggest that in states with more hospital-based palliative care programs, patients are less likely to die in the hospital, are likely to spend fewer days in the ICU, have better pain management and higher satisfaction with their health care.  As usual, Oregon is ahead of the curve and I am proud to say that in a 2011 report ranking states on their citizens' access to hospital-based palliative care programs, Oregon was among the seven states who earned an ``A'' rating, with 88 percent of Oregon hospitals offering palliative care.  Unfortunately, many seriously ill patients and their families lack the access available to Oregonians. Palliative care is a relatively new medical specialty and more must be done to ensure an adequate, well-trained palliative care workforce is available to provide comprehensive symptom management, intensive communication and a level of care coordination that addresses the episodic and long-term nature of serious, chronic illness. I believe that, with Federal support, we can help address the workforce gap between those currently practicing in palliative care and hospice and the number of health care professionals required to care for this expanding patient population That is why today I am introducing the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act or PCHETA. This authorizing legislation focuses on three key areas to grow the palliative care and hospice workforce.  Education centers to expand interdisciplinary training in palliative and hospice care.  Training of physicians who plan to teach palliative medicine and fellowships to encourage re-training for mid-career physicians, and academic career awards and career incentive awards to support physicians and other health care providers who provide palliative and hospice care training.  With this legislation, patients and families who are facing serious or life-threatening illness will have access to the high-quality palliative care and hospice services that can maximize their quality of life. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3407       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Palliative Care and Hospice      Education and Training Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Health care providers need better education about pain      management and palliative care. Students graduating from      medical school have very little, if any, training in the core      precepts of pain and symptom management, advance care      planning, communication skills, and care coordination for      patients with serious, life-threatening, or terminal illness.       (2) Palliative care is interdisciplinary, patient- and      family-centered health care for people with serious      illnesses. This type of care is focused on providing patients      with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious      illness, whatever the diagnosis. The goal of palliative care      is to relieve suffering and improve quality of life for both      patients and their families. Palliative care is provided by a      team of doctors, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and other      specialists who work with a patient's other health care      providers to provide an extra layer of support, including      assistance with difficult medical decisionmaking and      coordination of care among specialists. Palliative care is      appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness,      and can be provided together with curative treatment.      Palliative care is not dependent on a life-limiting prognosis      and may actually help an individual recover from illness by      relieving symptoms, such as pain, anxiety, or loss of      appetite, while undergoing sometimes difficult medical      treatments or procedures, such as surgery or chemotherapy.      There were 1,623 hospitals with palliative care programs in      2012.       (3) Hospice is palliative care for patients in their last      year of life. Considered the model for quality compassionate      care for individuals facing a life-limiting illness, hospice      provides expert medical care, pain management, and emotional      and spiritual support expressly tailored to the patient's      needs and wishes. In most cases, care is provided in the      patient's home but may also be provided in freestanding      hospice centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and other long-     term care facilities. In 2010, an estimated 1,580,000      patients received services from hospice or approximately 41.9      percent of all United States deaths. Hospice is a covered      benefit under the Medicare program. There were 3,509      Medicare-certified hospices in 2010.       (4) A 2005 study at Michigan State University found that      the formal training of United States doctors in palliative      care is ``grossly inadequate''. When the American Society of      Clinical Oncology surveyed their members, 65 percent said      they had received inadequate education in controlling      symptoms associated with cancer, and 81 percent felt they had      inadequate mentoring in discussing a poor prognosis with      their patients and families. Training in pediatric palliative      care is also seriously lacking according to physicians,      residents, and medical students responding to a survey      presented at a meeting of American Federation for Medical      Research.       (5) The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and      the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education      (ACGME) provided formal subspecialty status for hospice and      palliative medicine (HPM) in 2006, and the Centers for      Medicare & Medicaid Services recognized hospice and      palliative medicine as a medical subspecialty in October of      2008.       (6) As of June 2012, there were a total of 86 hospice and      palliative medicine training programs. Seventy-eight programs      have been accredited by the Accreditation Council for      Graduate Medical Education and seven programs have been      accredited by the American Osteopathic Association. For the      2011-2012 academic year, these programs were training 176      physicians in hospice and palliative medicine. Some programs      include an additional track in research, geriatrics, or      public health.       (7) There is a large gap between those practicing in the      palliative medicine field and the number of physicians      needed. A mid-range estimate by the American Academy of      Hospice and Palliative Medicine's Workforce Task Force calls      for 6,000 or more full time equivalents to serve current      needs in hospice and palliative care programs. At maximum      capacity, the current system would produce roughly 4,600 new      hospice and palliative medicine certified physicians over the      next 20 years, during which time some 70,000,000 new Medicare      beneficiaries will enter the Medicare program. At the same      time, there is expected to be increasing acceptance of the      hospice and palliative approach to care among the general      population and health care providers.     SEC. 3.
