Speaker, what strange version of democracy is this? We have a program that affects the lives, directly, of 40 million Americans, affects the lives of their children or their parents or their grandparents, a tremendously important program, and without any hearings on the final version of this legislation, this House is going to be forced to move forward with 3 hours of debate.  Mr. Speaker, we spent about 10 times as much on the Waco hearings as we are going to spend on Medicare for every American.  Medicare has problems. Yes. Does this bill address those problems? No. Is it a thoughtful approach? No. Is it something that will stabilize Medicare into the next century and anticipate the retirement of the baby boom? Absolutely not.  Mr. Speaker, it is purely budget- and politics-driven. Medicare does have a problem. It has a $90 billion shortfall over a 7-year period. They are taking $273 billion to fix a $90 billion problem.
