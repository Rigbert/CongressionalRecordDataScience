President, a baseball star died this week. Bill Tuttle, centerfielder for the Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Athletics, and Minnesota Twins over a period of 11 years, succumbed to oral cancer after a five-year battle. Among baseball fans, Mr. Tuttle's baseball card picture, with a bulging cheek full of chewing tobacco, is well-known. Unfortunately, that ever-present wad of tobacco was his undoing. Over the past five years, it cost him part of his jaw, his cheek, a number of teeth, his taste buds, and ultimately his life.  To his credit, when Mr. Tuttle realized what spit tobacco, as he accurately called it, had begun to do to him, he devoted the last years of his life to warning other ballplayers about what might happen to them if they too use spit tobacco. But he did more than reach out to his fellow ballplayers. He spent many hours and days working to prevent young people from starting to use this addictive product.  I ask that a letter be printed in the Record that I received from Bill Tuttle during the debate on the tobacco bill earlier this year. It describes his firsthand experience of the ravages of spit tobacco and his efforts to educate children, as well as Major League players, about the dangers of spit tobacco use.  Spit tobacco is addictive, causes cancer and other serious illnesses, and leaves a trail of devastation among its victims and their families. It is essential that we listen to the words of Bill Tuttle and others like him, and continue to fight to prevent the use of smokeless tobacco by our Nation's kids.  The letter follows:                                                     May 18, 1998.       The Honorable Members of the United States Senate: My name      is Bill Tuttle. I hope that some of you remember me as a      former Major League Baseball player who played with the      Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, and Kansas City Athletics.      But, I hope more of you know me as a staunch anti-spit      tobacco fighter who, at this very moment, is literally      fighting for his life. Little did I know when I started      experimenting with spit tobacco some forty years ago at the      invitation of a fellow ballplayer, that spit tobacco would      become such a major part of my life and death. I chewed every      day for many years, right up until the time I was diagnosed      with oral cancer five years ago. I have undergone numerous      operations to remove cancerous growths in my head and neck. I      have endured unimaginable pain and disfigurement from the      surgeries and treatments and I have been literally cut apart      and patched back together. My family has suffered with me      every step of the way. Life has been a living hell for      several years now.       I have been blessed, however, with the opportunity to talk      to others about the dangers of spit tobacco, particularly      young people. I know that the temptation to try new things,      especially forbidden things, can be tough for young people.      In my message to the thousands of youngsters that I have      talked to, I have emphasized that they just should not start      using any form of tobacco. If you don't start, you'll never      need to stop. But once started, tobacco use can literally      addict you to a substance that stands a good chance of      killing you. Even after enduring several surgeries and having      half of my face cut away, I hate to admit that I still have a      craving to try spit tobacco. That's how addicting spit      tobacco can be.       I have had some excellent partners in the fight against      spit tobacco. Joe Garagiola, Oral Health America, The Robert      Wood Johnson Foundation, Major League Baseball, the Major      League Baseball Player Association, the Professional Baseball      Athletic Trainers Society, and others have supported me in      many ways. But my most ardent supporter and best friend is my      wife Gloria. She has accompanied me on my visits to schools,      community meetings, and spring training. She has become an      expert on spit tobacco, particularly what it can do to      destroy lives and families.       I am sorry that I can not meet you in person to talk about      his matter as my physical condition just won't permit it. But      I wish to implore you to become a partner in the fight      against spit tobacco. So many of you have already done so      much to move badly needed tobacco legislation forward that we      must not stop short of the goal--that is to make tobacco      products, including spit tobacco, as unavailable and      unattractive to young people as possible. I urge you to take      the necessary action that will address spit tobacco as      aggressively as you will smoking. We need taxes that make all      tobacco equally unattractive for young people. We need to      monitor not just highly addicted daily users, but also      experimenters, if we are to practice prevention and be able      to measure progress. And we need to tell people the truth      about the addictive nature of spit tobacco, including putting      the nicotine content on labels. None of us wishes to see spit      tobacco become the bargain basement pathway for young people      into a lifetime of tobacco addiction.       On May 19, 1998, my wife Gloria and I will be honored at      the Metrodome in Minneapolis as the first recipients of the      Bill Tuttle Award. This recognition of our efforts to try to      save American children from hazards of tobacco use is greatly      appreciated. At the same time, however, this is a very sad      occasion for us. We both know that my remaining time in this      fight and our remaining time together is limited. It would      honor us greatly if you, as the distinguished elected leaders      of our country, would commit to an aggressive course of      action against spit tobacco. That would be a big league      accomplishment and one for which you would never be      forgotten.           Sincerely,     Bill Tuttle.                          ____________________
