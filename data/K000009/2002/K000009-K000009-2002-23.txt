Speaker, I join my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), to place on the record this evening information important to the American people.  One of the questions I have on this resolution that President Bush has sent up to the Congress, the joint resolution to authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against Iraq, is the first question of why now, 7 weeks before an election?  Just about a week ago, the President properly appeared before the United Nations, and he talked about the grave and gathering danger of what was occurring inside Iraq relative to Iraq's development of nuclear weapons and biological and chemical weapons. But the President did not say an imminent danger. In other words, 7 weeks before an election in this country, why does a grave and gathering danger require us to take precipitous action against another nation state? I would ask the President if action is not imminent, why now? Why now are we faced with this resolution, 7 weeks before congressional elections? It is very, very curious timing.  One of the other questions I would ask the President is who is the enemy? Now, we know who caused the carnage over New York and Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon, and we know al Qaeda is a Middle Eastern-based terrorist network, but their base is not Iraq. So I would say, what is the connection between al Qaeda, where our attention should be focused, and Iraq?  I have gone to every single briefing here in the Capitol this week trying to get the evidence from the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, former ambassadors from that region, weapons inspectors that have gone into Iraq in prior years. They have established no connection between al Qaeda and Iraq. So, who is the enemy? Who is the enemy, Mr. President, and why are you trying to pass this resolution at this point?  Our forces are engaged in many places on the globe, certainly keeping order in the Balkans. But now we have the Afghanistan situation facing us with terrible, terrible disruption inside that country, with terrorists coming back, the Taliban, the leftovers, creating difficulties in that region of the world. And I think it is very important to recognize that moving into Iraq will be a significant military undertaking.  Who is the enemy? Who is the enemy? We are not saying that Saddam Hussein and that despotic regime functions in a way that we consider acceptable on the face of the Earth. But what is the justification for now?  Let me mention also, is it just a coincidence that in Iraq, which holds the second largest supply of the world's oil reserves, is there any possibility that in the resolution the President has sent us where he talks about defending the national security interests of the United States and restoring international peace and security in the region, that it might have anything to do with the oil that sits underground in that particular country?  We know that about 2 years ago in October one of our destroyers, the U.S.S. Cole, was suicide-bombed in Yemen Harbor, and we know that we are extended in that part of the world to protect the oil lanes that are supplying this country every day.  I say to myself when I look at the President's plan for energy that he sent up here earlier this year, what a disappointment to me as an American, a 21st-century American, that he has us wed to oil as the future, a diminishing resource.  We should be moving to a carbohydrate future, not a hydrocarbon future in this country. We should be moving toward a hydrogen future, not a petroleum future. We should be moving to a photovoltaic future, to a fuel cell future, not a petroleum future. So both domestic policy and the flawed energy document released and our foreign policy are totally tied together in this wedding of oil and politics that has been the heritage of this country for the last 70 years.  It is time to change. America wants to move on. In fact, if we removed oil as a proxy for our foreign policy, what a different world this would be.  I think it is important to remind the American people that the current recession that we are in, causing significant damage across this country, including in districts like mine, was triggered by rising oil prices. Lots has happened since that occurred; but nonetheless, look at what you spend at the gas pump and watch international events and how they are tied to oil.  I would just say that it is time for America to change. I look forward to future debates on this resolution and the future direction for this country that is domestically independent and at peace in the world.                          ____________________
