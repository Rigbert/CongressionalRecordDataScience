 Mr. Chairman, the price of gas and the unemployment rate both remain way too high, and American families are struggling as a result. That's why I support H.R. 4480, the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. This bill is truly a win-win for steps that it takes to expand supplies of domestic affordable energy that will create many jobs in the process.  It's no secret that I don't see eye-to-eye with President Obama on energy policy, but perhaps the most inexplicable energy policy move the administration has made was the June 2011 decision to withdraw 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with no plan to replace it. It is hard to understand why the President would take oil from the Nation's emergency stockpile while at the same time keeping off limits the far greater amounts beneath federally controlled lands and offshore areas. It's like a couple pawning their wedding rings for cash while ignoring a major gold discovery in their own backyard.  The amount of untapped oil in areas kept out of reach by this administration is estimated to exceed the entire Strategic Petroleum Reserve dozens of times over. And these estimates are not mere speculation. Indeed, the recent increases in oil production on State and privately owned lands demonstrate the tremendous energy development on Federal lands. But that potential will only be realized if the administration's roadblocks are removed.  Title I of this bill does that. It requires that the next time the President withdraws oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he must also commit to more oil leasing on Federal lands in offshore areas. The result will be greater supplies of domestic oil and lower prices, not to mention thousands of new energy industry jobs.  Gaining access to untapped oil reserves is part of the equation; but before that oil can reach consumers at the pump, it has to be refined into gasoline and diesel fuel. Title II of this bill will help American refiners so they can keep fueling our economy and fueling the country, because what refiners really need is a little common sense, a little regulatory certainty. It would be an understatement to say that this administration's regulators have not been friendly to domestic oil production, and the truth is they have been no better to the refiners who produce the fuels that we use. In fact, EPA is moving ahead with a number of new regs affecting refineries and other facilities--regs that are likely to drive up the price at the pump and jeopardize refining sector jobs.  Title II requires that we learn about the consequences before imposing additional red tape. It sets up an interagency committee that will analyze the cumulative effects of several upcoming EPA regs on fuel prices as well as jobs. It also defers the finalization of three measures until after the analysis is completed.  The good news is that a future of chronically high gas prices is not inevitable. These policies that I have discussed and numerous other provisions in the legislation will in fact move us toward more secure, more affordable American energy and the jobs that go with it. The Nation can increase domestic energy supplies, lower future prices at the pump, and create many more jobs. This legislation takes the steps to usher in this brighter future. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting it, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      our mutual understanding with respect to H.R. 4480, and would      ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be      inserted into the Congressional Record during consideration      on the House floor.       Thank you for your courtesy and I look forward to continued      cooperation between our respective committees.           Sincerely,                                                   Frank D.

Dear Chairman Lucas: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 4480, the ``Strategic Energy Production Act of 2012.''      As you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall      within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on      Agriculture.       I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on H.R. 4480,      and I agree that your decision should not prejudice the      Committee on Agriculture with respect to the appointment of      conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or      similar legislation.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 4480 on      the House floor.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2012.                                  Committee on Armed Services,     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of          Representatives, 2125 Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing to you concerning the      bill H.R. 4480, the Strategic Energy Production Act of 2012,      as amended. This legislation includes a provision that deals      with military readiness and training activities, which fall      within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed      Services.       Our committee recognizes the importance of H.R. 4480, and      the need for the legislation to move expeditiously.      Therefore, while we have a valid claim to jurisdiction over      this legislation, the Committee on Armed Services will waive      further consideration of H.R. 4480. I do so with the      understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the      Committee on Armed Services does not waive any future      jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in      the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request      that you urge the Speaker to name members of this committee      to any conference committee which is named to consider this      provision.       Please place this letter and your committee's response into      the Congressional Record during consideration of the Measure      on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in      which you have worked regarding this matter and others      between our respective committees.           Sincerely,                                        Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon,     Chairman.                                  ____                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2012.     Hon. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, Rayburn House Office          Building, Washington, DC.
