Chairman, I rise in agreement with the gentlewoman's premise that the $1.7 million ought to be included and frankly ought to be included without restriction. Unfortunately, of course, the Committee on Rules, as I understand the rules, by adoption of the rule struck that as the gentlewoman has observed, but in fact the FEC does in fact need additional resources in order to check what everybody in this country knows is a real problem. Both sides of the aisle are talking about how campaign funds were raised, how campaign funds are spent, and of course this is the very agency that we have asked to check on this for the American public and to disclose it.  The fact of the matter is now cutting this money undercuts what frankly an awful lot of our colleagues say they want done, and that is to see how money was raised, how it was spent and was it done pursuant to law. I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her point.
