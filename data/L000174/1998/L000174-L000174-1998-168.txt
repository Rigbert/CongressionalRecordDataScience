 Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join my colleague in expressing my support for the work the Appropriations Committee has done this year. It is important that we maintain our strong support for Northern Ireland and the Republic, and the funds made available to the IFI in the upcoming fiscal year are a critical step. In the wake of the passage of the Good Friday Accords, I have been working with Senator Torricelli over the past several months to determine a method that will best express the United States' support for peace in Northern Ireland. At this point in time, I would like to request your support for consideration of additional funding to the IFI, should it become available in the future.  Mr. McCONNELL. I join Mr. Leahy in assuring you that we will consider adding funds to the IFI, should they become available at a later date, so that we may bolster peace in the region.
