 President, I pay tribute to a dear friend, Garry Drummond, of Birmingham, AL. Garry Drummond was recently named to the Alabama Business Hall of Fame.  Garry is the chairman and chief executive officer of Drummond Company, Inc., one of Alabama's largest coal producers and a major national producer of foundry coke. The company was founded in 1935 by Mr. Heman Drummond, father of five brothers who are still associated with the company today. The company's executive and administrative offices are in Birmingham, with operational headquarters in Jasper, AL.  Garry was born in Sipsey, AL, on June 8, 1938. He earned his Associate degree from Walker College in 1959. He received his bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from the University of Alabama in 1961. He also holds an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Alabama, awarded in May 1983, and served on the University's board of trustees from 1983 to 2001.  Garry has been active in the coal industry and its State, national, and international organizations. He is the longest running board member of the National Mining Association and is a former member of the board of directors of the American Coal Foundation. He is a founder of the Mining and Reclamation Council of America , MARC, a national trade organization representing primarily surface miners that later merged with the National Coal Association in 1987. Garry served as MARC's first chairman. He is a member of the board of directors and past chairman of the Alabama Coal Association and a former member of the National Coal Council, an advisory group appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Energy. He is also a member of the board of directors of the Center for Energy and Economic Development.  I offer Garry my congratulations and best wishes as he becomes a member of the Alabama Business Hall of Fame.                          ____________________
