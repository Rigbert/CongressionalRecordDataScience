President, I rise today in support of Democratic Leader Daschle's request to bring before the Senate the Economic Recovery Act of 2003, S. 414, which includes legislation I introduced last month: the First Responders Partnership Grant Act of 2003. I regret that Republicans objected to proceeding to these important matters when Senator Daschle requested we move to it yesterday.  I thank the Democratic leader for authoring this important economic stimulus package. In seeking to improve homeland security, I am proud that he saw fit to include the First Responders Partnership Grant Act--on which he, Democratic Whip Reid and Senator Breaux join me as cosponsors. This legislation will supply our Nation's first responders with the support they so desperately need to protect homeland security and prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.  I want to begin by thanking each of our Nation's brave firefighters, emergency rescurers, law enforcement officers, and other first responder personnel for the jobs they do for the American public day in and day out. Our public safety officers are often the first to respond to any crime or emergency situation. On September 11, the Nation saw that the first on the scene at the World Trade Center were the heroic firefighters, police officers and emergency personnel of New York City. These real-life heroes, many of whom gave the ultimate sacrifice, remind us of how important it is to support our State and local public safety partners.  But while we ask our Nation's first responders to defend us as never before on the front lines against the dark menace of domestic terrorism, we have failed to supply them with the Federal support they need and deserve to protect us, as we expect and need them to protect us.  Since February 7, 2003, the Federal Homeland Security Advisory System has kept State and local first responders on Orange Alert, a ``high'' condition indicating a high probability of a terrorist attack and when additional precautions by first responders are necessary at public events.  Since then, counterterrorism officials have warned that the threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil is at a higher level than in previous months due to the possibility of impending military action against Iraq. This is the second time since September 11, 2001, that the national warning level has been at Orange Alert--from September 10 to September 24 last year, Attorney General Ashcroft declared our country at Orange Threat level.  From March 12, 2002, until this month, we were at Yellow Alert, an ``elevated'' threat level declared whenthere is a significant risk of terrorist attacks, requiring increased surveillance of critical locations.  Counties, cities and towns in my home State of Vermont and across the U.S. find themselves overwhelmed by increasing homeland security costs required by the Federal Government. Indeed, the National Governors Association estimates that States incurred around $7 billion in security costs over the past year alone.  As a result, the national threat alerts and other Federal homeland security requirements have become unfunded Federal mandates on our State and local governments. Rutland County Sheriff R.J. Elrick, president of the Vermont Sheriffs' Association, recently wrote to me, ``We are in dire need of financial support to keep our personnel trained and equipped to meet the challenges here as home as we continue our vigilant commitment to fight terrorism.''  When terrorists strike, first responders are and will always be the first people we turn to for help. We place our lives and the lives of our families and friends in the hands of these officers, trusting that when called upon they will protect and save us.  Just how, without supplying them with the necessary resources, do we expect our Nation's first responders to realistically carry out their duties?  Our State and local law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency personnel are full partners in preventing, investigating and responding to terrorist acts. They need and deserve the full collaboration of the Federal Government to meet these new national responsibilities.  Washington is buzzing about the literally hundreds of billions of additional dollars the President plans to ask Congress to provide for our military services to fight the war on terrorism abroad. The same cannot be said for helping security here at home, which is shamefully overlooked.  For a year and a half I have been working hard to remedy that, with allies like our distinguished Democratic leader and assistant Democratic leader, and New York Senators Schumer and Clinton. As former chair and now ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have made it a high priority to evaluate and meet the needs of our first responders.  For these reasons, I commend the Democratic leader for including in the homeland security section of his economic stimulus package the First Responders Partnership Grant Act, which will give our Nation's law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency personnel the resources they need to do their jobs. This legislation will establish a grant program at the Department of Homeland Security to provide $5 billion nationwide for current fiscal year to support State and local public safety officers in their efforts to protect homeland security and prevent and respond to acts to terrorism.  Similar to the highly successful Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Programs, the First Responder Grants will be made directly to State and local government units for overtime, equipment, training and facility expenses to support our law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency personnel.  The First Responder Grants may be used to pay up to 90 percent of the cost of the overtime, equipment, training or facility. In cases of fiscal hardship, the Department of Homeland Security may waive the local match requirement of 10 percent to provide Federal funds for communities that cannot afford the local match.  In a world shaped by the violent events of September 11, day after day we call upon our public safety officers to remain vigilant. We not only ask them to put their lives at risk in the line of duty, but also, if need be, given their lives to protect us.  If we take time to listen to our Nation's State and local public safety partners, they will tell us that they welcome the challenge to join in our national mission to protect our homeland security. But we cannot ask our firefighters, emergency personnel, and law enforcement officers to assume these new national responsibilities without also providing new Federal support.  The First Responders Partnership Grant Act will provide the necessary Federal support for our State and public safety officers to serve as full partners in the fight to protect our homeland security. We need our first responders for the security and the life-saving help they bring to our communities. All they ask is for the tools they need to do their jobs for us. And for the sake of our own security, that is not too much to ask.  I commend Senator Daschle for his leadership, and hope that the Senate will soon consider this desperately-needed economic stimulus package.                          ____________________
