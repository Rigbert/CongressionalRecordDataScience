 President, I am not going to speak to the substance of the amendment but to the process. This bill is a bipartisan approach where a lot of different points of view were brought together to a bill that can pass this Senate. We have people on the left for whom $50 billion might not be enough money. We have people on the right for whom anything over $5 billion was too much money. We have come out at $35 billion. This is a well-balanced, well-thought-out compromise.  Compromise is the essence of getting things done. You have to bring people in the Senate to the center to get things done or nothing is going to get done. In order to get this job done, we have to defeat this amendment, regardless of the merits of it.  I yield back.
