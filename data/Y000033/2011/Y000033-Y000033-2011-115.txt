Mr. Chairman, I can only say that, to my knowledge, there's little chance of any oil drilling off the coast of Massachusetts. But there is a great possibility off the coasts of Florida, Virginia, Alaska, California, and this bill really sets out which areas should be drilled, not in large massive areas, but specifically.  I personally will tell you, if I could drill in Alaska, offshore, which we should be able to do, but this administration has delayed a permit for 5 years--5 years. Five billion dollars put into investment to develop that field. It can't be done because of this administration.  This bill tries to expedite that process for the good of this Nation and for the good of the people, not the good of the oil companies, because we need that oil.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
