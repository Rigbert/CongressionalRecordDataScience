President, I rise to honor a brave soldier who gave his life to the defense of this Nation. SSG. Jason Hendrix chose to place himself in harms way and for this service he paid the highest price.  Staff Sergeant Hendrix joined the Army right out of high school and served for 11 years. He was a squad leader in the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. This unit is usually stationed in South Korea, but was deployed to assist in Operation Iraqi Freedom. When Staff Sergeant Hendrix found out that he was heading for one of the most dangerous areas in the world, he told his family, ``You guys might not understand why we're over here, but we need to be over here, and I've got to do my job.''  Those who knew Staff Sergeant Hendrix best describe him as a ``professional soldier.'' They also speak of his compassion and care for the men in his unit. Last Christmas, Staff Sergeant Hendrix gave up his leave so that other men could go home and see their newborn children. He also bought, at his own expense, equipment for his men such as night-vision goggles, facemasks, flashlights, dozens of handcuffs and magazine couplers for their M-16s.  Staff Sergeant Hendrix fought in the rebel stronghold of Fallujah late last year and was serving in Ar Ramadi at the time of his death. On February 16, 2005, he was leading a 25-man squad when they came under a heavy artillery attack. Staff Sergeant Hendrix was hit and died from his wounds.  For this soldier from Claremore, Ok, there is no deeper honor than the memory he leaves behind. He gave of himself in life as well as in death, and stands out as an example to all of us. Today I honor a true hero, SSG. Jason Hendrix.                     Specialist Jeffrey S. Henthorn  Mr. President, I wish to rise in honor of a son of Oklahoma and an American hero. SPC Jeffery Henthorn demonstrated the type of patriotism that protects our freedom and encourages freedom in other countries. For his dedication and sacrifice I am pleased to honor him on the Senate floor today.  Specialist Henthorn was from Choctaw, OK. After earning his high school degree, Specialist Henthorn enlisted in the Army and was assigned to the 24th Transportation Company, out of Fort Riley, KS.  Specialist Henthorn was serving in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He died on February 8, 2005, while stationed in Balad, Iraq, from noncombat related injuries. He was 25 years old and leaves behind family and friends who grieve along with our grateful Nation.  Specialist Henthorn was willing to place his life on the line and paid the fullest cost for the sake of freedom. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I wish to express my profound gratitude and deepest honor for the men and women who, like Specialist Henthorn, know the true meaning of service. They continue to give so much, and as freedom spreads throughout the Middle East region we know that their sacrifice has not been in vain.  I honor the life and memory of those who have given their lives in this noble cause. I am grieved, but very proud of this young man from Oklahoma, SPC Jeffery Henthorn.                   Army Specialist. Lyle W. Rymer II  Mr. President, I wish to honor one of this country's fallen warriors, a young man that comes from my home State of Oklahoma. Army SPC Lyle Rymer II was making way for freedom in Iraq when he paid the ultimate price.  Specialist Rymer was born in Roland, OK. After graduating from high school, he joined the National Guard to help his family. ``That's what he decided to do,'' his grandmother Bobby Sue Drake said. ``He liked it. He said, `Somebody's got to defend this country. It might as well be me.' He was a great kid.'' According to his friends, he planned to make a career of the Army and was considering enrolling in Airborne school. Rymer also had a reputation for cheering up fellow soldiers.  Specialist Rymer was serving in Iraq with the 239th Engineer Company, an Arkansas-based National Guard unit. On January 28, 2005, he was guarding an area where engineers were setting up barriers in preparation for the elections. Without warning, he was shot by an enemy sniper and died from his wounds. Army Specialist Rymer is buried at Fort Smith National Cemetery, AR.  Many are left behind who are both proud and grieved at his sacrifice. Specialist Rymer is survived by his wife LaTisha, a 2-year-old son, Sean, and a 10-month-old daughter, Jasmine. He was able to see his newborn daughter during a November furlough.  The loss of Specialist Rymer is one that will continue to be felt as the years pass. He was one who gave more than was required, in life and in death. He sacrificed his own well-being and put himself in harm's way, showing courage that demands our recognition. I am honored to honor him, and hope that I somehow express gratefulness beyond these mere words.                          ____________________
