 Speaker, all over this country, working people and elderly people and those people who do not have a lot of money are wondering about what is going on in Washington with regard to the bailout of Mexico.  We have always been told that if people want to invest their money, especially making risky investments, sometimes you win but sometimes you lose.  Investors in Mexico over the last several years have received very high rates of return on their investment, and that is fine. But recently some of those investments have turned sour. It seems to me and, I believe, a majority of the Members of this House that the U.S. Congress and the taxpayers and the President and the Republican leadership should not be bailing out those investments.  Members of Congress demand the right to vote, to debate, to discuss, to learn about the bailout of Mexico. The gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor] will soon be introducing a privileged motion to begin that process.  I would urge our colleagues to support that motion.                          ____________________
