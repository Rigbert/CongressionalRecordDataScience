 President, I ask to have printed in the Record copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the sixth annual ``What is the State of the Union'' essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were selected from nearly 800 entries.  The material follows:       FARYAL AFSAR, MOUNT MANSFIELD UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       ''Whoever kills an innocent person it is as if he has      killed all humanity''--Quran 5:32.       Being a Muslim girl in the world, I hear many bad things      about my religion or my country. Sometimes when people come      to know that I'm a Muslim girl they may think that I'm a      terrorist, yet I wonder how only 0.03% extremists can      represent 1.6 billion people of the world. As a child, I grew      up in a loving Muslim family. My parents didn't even permit      us to kill a spider or an ant. I was never told to spread      violence in the world. I was never taught in my school or      house to be an extremist. In my reading of our holy book, I      only found words of wisdom and peace so then why are the      extremists labeled as Muslims? How can we say they belong to      a certain religious group if they kill innocent people?       As an exchange student from Pakistan coming to Vermont, I      was first afraid of coming to a country that may see me as a      terrorist since I am a Muslim. I thought I may be bullied or      someone would call me a terrorist in school but the love I      have received from people here is what I had never imagined.      But still when I hear negative news about Muslims or my      country on TV or the internet, it hurts me. I want to help      people understand Islam and my country. A month ago after the      ISIS attacks in Paris, this topic was raised again and      political leaders started saying that Muslims shouldn't be      allowed to enter the U.S. I ask, is this really the solution      to the terrorist problem? How is it that I have been welcomed      so warmly through this exchange program and yet there are      those who generalize and state that Muslims are not welcome      here?       Each year hundreds of exchange students from the Muslim      world come to the U.S and the students and their host      families form a special bond. These relationships form strong      connections and the memories live forever. Our country's      leaders should look at what we are doing; young people can      play just as an important role as our current leaders. We are      not spreading any violence; we are trying to know each other.      We are humans and we care about each other. It's not because      we're from the same background or religion. What matters the      most is how strongly we are bonded to each other.       The problem of terrorism is not a problem for one country      but for the whole world, and the solution to it is not      blaming each other and closing boundaries but rather knowing      and helping each other. I believe that if people open      themselves to new experiences and start knowing each other,      the world would be a good place.          MEGAN BROMLEY, MILTON SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, sometimes overlooked are the basic      human rights and needs of the people. While this may entail      many topics, I would like to focus on a major issue that has      slid under the radar for far too long. The epidemic of rape      and sexual assault runs rampant through our country and not      much has been done to change this continuing tragedy. Steps      may be taken. The first step must address the unprocessed      rape kits. Throughout our country there are over 20,000      unprocessed rape kits. Add to this the estimate that 68% of      rapes or sexual assaults that occur go unreported. Imagine      how large the number of unanalyzed kits there would then be      if even 50% more were to be reported. This is a challenging      issue and it cannot be solved overnight, however there are      steps to take in the right direction aside from moral and      ethical obligations.       One solution that could be enforced is a quota, by this I      imply that every city must meet a certain number of kits      processed in order to get the number of prosecutors facing      jail time or other capital punishment inclining. Too many      cases go without investigation even after the kit has been      used and the victim has been tested, this crime is not fading      away and must be faced head on not shied away from due to      technical complications that can be entirely avoided. The      federal government should follow through with     a funded mandate to state and city law enforcement to help      them process the kits and create additional lab facilities.       Now, as I have just said the number of people who have      committed a sexual assault crime in prison would increase due      to the processing of more rape kits, this leads into my next      point of discussion--incarceration rates and funding for      prisons. 12.7% of inmates are made up of those who are      serving time for drug violations and marijuana expenses. We      are pouring millions of dollars into our state and federal      prison systems and too much of that is going towards people      for up to twenty years for marijuana possession. However I      propose to use the funding instead to evaluate something such      as unprocessed rape kits and begin to treat minor drug use in      a proactive manner. Marijuana possession should be removed as      a state and federal crime and result in no jail time.      Instead, as a nation we should implement counseling after a      three strike policy or enter the convicted into a      rehabilitation program if the drug use worsens. Many other      countries decriminalized the use and/ or possession of      marijuana and they have some of the lowest rates regarding      drug use and misdemeanor crimes. Just by reducing      incarceration of people convicted of misdemeanor drug crimes,      there would be an inclination of money to put forth on other      issues at hand, not just processing rape kits. Taking one      step at a time towards the issues that are more manageable      such as the two I have just discussed is how America can move      forward, it doesn't need to be a leap of faith and a tackle      at a major issue, one objective at a time culminates for a      strong, prosperous country.       MIKAYLA CLARKE, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       There are many different issues that the U.S. is facing      right now, but one of the most beneficial actions the U.S.      could do right now is to legalize marijuana. By legalizing      marijuana for recreational and medical uses the country would      benefit in many different ways. The crime rate would      dramatically decrease, the use of prescription drugs would      decrease and the economy would greatly improve.       The economy is not in a great place in the U.S., as we are      $18.7 trillion in debt, and counting. In 2014 the Washington      Post wrote that Colorado made $700 million off of medical and      recreational marijuana in the first year it was legal. By      legalizing marijuana, many more job opportunities would open      and a whole new industry is created. The amount that the      whole country would make would be in the billions.       The use of prescription drugs such as painkillers and      sleeping pills is greatly increasing. Those pills become      addictive and many people use them to get high because      they're legal and easy to obtain. Children are given those      pills, and they may become addicted at a young age. While      there is the ability to overdose on those pills, marijuana is      almost impossible to overdose on and brings better relief      than prescription drugs. Overdose deaths from prescription      pills were significantly reduced in the 23 states that allow      medical marijuana. By legalizing marijuana the dispensaries      get different strains of marijuana to help people sleep or      deal with pain. If it's being used in the medical form the      THC can be extracted and the CBD's can be used for the pain.      There are many different ways to consume marijuana, such as      oils, creams, foods, and smokable. In the U.S. there are over      one million people using medical marijuana, yet, it's still      not legal in all states.       People all over the country are getting in legal trouble      for using and possessing marijuana. Young people are getting      criminal records for a non-violent civil offense, and as a      result will potentially be not allowed to gain federal      student loans or jobs. With our limited police and jail      resources, there are more important and harmful substances to      focus on. In April of 2014 MSNBC wrote an article, Study:      Marijuana Legalization Doesn't Increase Crime, ``Even after      Colorado legalized the sale of small amounts of marijuana for      recreational use on Jan. 1 of this year, violent and property      crime rates in the city are actually falling.'' Since the      government is regulating the marijuana, it will be safer.      There won't be strands that are laced with other harmful      drugs, such as heroin or cocaine. By legalizing marijuana,      less people will get arrested for the use and possession.       As a country we should legalize marijuana. First we should      start with medical, because medical patients are more      important. Then as a country it should be decriminalized.      Then, we should legalize recreational. By legalizing      marijuana not only will marijuana users benefit, even non-     users will benefit.     MADDIE COLLINS, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       The 2008 financial crisis should have paved the way for a      new era of banking, for real reform and regulation, for much      needed change. The 2008 financial crisis should have forged      the path for breaking up the nation's largest banks, but      instead the crisis has taken a back seat to other, more      heavily broadcasted issues. This back seat position has      allowed the same Wall Street bankers who are to blame for the      greatest recession since the Great Depression, to yet again      be gambling with taxpayer money. In my opinion, it is of      utmost importance to regulate our financial institutions in      order to hinder their increasing ability to damage the global      economy. We must understand that our country and the world as      a whole would be devastated if another large bank were to go      bankrupt.       In our country there are four banks that hold assets of      more than $1 trillion dollars. The largest, JP Morgan Chase      and Company, holds $1.8 trillion dollars in total assets, the      equivalent of 14% of all total assets held by U.S. commercial      banks. Comparatively, in 2001, the top asset holder was Bank      of America with $552 billion dollars. This increase is      substantial, and will only continue to rise.       The problem with these large banks is that if they were to      go unexpectedly bankrupt it would cause rippling effects on      the economy, similar to what the world witnessed in 2008 with      the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers. To give this some      perspective, the Lehman Brothers' total assets were $600      billion dollars, only one third of JP Morgan Chase and      Company's current assets. These banks pose a real threat to      the security of our financial system. As described by William      C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New      York, there are two big problems with these ``too big to      fail'' banks. First, to combat the threat that they pose, the      government intervenes and gives large banks a funding      advantage over smaller banks, thus creating an unfair playing      field. Secondly, this funding advantage creates incentives      for financial firms to become larger and more complex. As the      banking system becomes more and more complex, the risks      dramatically increase, only furthering the problem.       In a time where our government officials are advocating for      the creation of more jobs and placing greater value on small      businesses, we need to be more aware of what is best for this      type of business. We need smaller, community banks to serve      small businesses for they do a better job of fulfilling their      credit needs. Unlike with large institutions, community banks      allow businesses to receive loans based on their reputation      and reliability within the community that they serve, rather      than basing it solely on their credit scores.       With a clear perspective and a shift in focus, it is      certainly achievable to break up our nation's largest banks      and ensure that greed and selfishness are no longer the      ruling forces that drive our financial institutions.             OLIVIER ENWA, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       The country that you and I live in is fantastic and I am      really proud of the things we are doing. I would like to      address two problems, which are racism and prejudice.      Specifically, there are people who are being judged by their      skin color or their religion in the United States.       More people of color are being sent to jail than white      people. More people of color are also being killed by the      police and executed by the judicial system. Bryan Stevenson,      a social justice activist, said ``I think that every human      being falters sometime; no one is perfect. Our mistakes      require the mercy and understanding of others, which we can't      legitimately expect unless we offer the same to others''.      Innocent people are being killed for nothing. ``Why do we      want to kill all the broken people?''       The U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights protect      people's rights, and we have the right to worship any      religion. The First Amendment says that everyone in the      United States has the right to worship any god or no religion      at all. Over the years many Americans have forgotten the      First Amendment when they think about Muslims. Innocent      Muslims are blamed for things they didn't do, such as the      attack in New York on September 11, 2001.       One cause of hatred against Muslims is the growth of ISIS,      which uses Islam as an excuse to kill people and destroy      land. Many Americans think that all Muslims are the same as      ISIS, which is not true. I have friends who are Muslims and I      definitely don't think they are terrorists. Innocent Muslims      are being accused of terrorism and they are sent back to      their countries. According to CNN, presidential candidate      Donald Trump said that, ``the United States should come to a      complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.'' I      think that innocent Muslims should be left alone.       Prejudice still exists in this amazing country because I've      experienced it. One day I went to the store near my house      with my friends. When we got there the cashier told us to put      our backpacks down. As we were getting the stuff we wanted to      buy, the manager came up to us and told us to ``get out of my      store'' even though we hadn't done anything wrong. I was hurt      that he had judged me by my appearance.       Better education in poor parts of the country and the      education of police officers will help improve racism in the      U.S. The United States should improve education for poor      people. Most of the people being killed and put in jail are      undereducated people of color. Speaking as a black man from      Mozambique, I believe that if education is improved in poorer      parts of the country our country will be a better place.      Education is the key to everything.                          ____________________
