 Abercrombie] for joining me, and let me just concluded by saying two other things.  No. 1, it goes without saying that we need campaign finance reform so that big money cannot continue to buy the U.S. Congress, and we also need to reform labor law. There are millions of American workers who would like to join unions so that they could better fight for their rights on the job, so they can get a fair shake, and yet labor law today makes it almost impossible to do that. Almost all of the power rests with the employer. It is very hard for workers to organize. We need labor law reform.  Let me simply conclude by thanking my friend from Hawaii for joining me, but for also saying to the American people do not give up on the political process. Some want you to do that. If you are a low-income person or working person, what they want to say to you is hey, it is all very complicated, do not get involved, everybody in Congress is a crook, the whole thing is corrupt, you do not want to get involved.  Do not believe a minute of it. The wealth and the big money interests, they know how the political system works. They are the ones who contribute huge amounts of money to the candidates of their choice and the political parties of their choice. They are the ones who have lobbyists knocking on our doors every day so we can give more tax breaks to the rich, so we can make it easier for them to take our jobs to Mexico or China.  Mr. Speaker, if this country is going to be turned around, tens of millions of working American middle-class people, low-income people, are going to have to stand up and say this country belongs to all of us and not just the very rich. It is not utopian to say that we can create a decent standard of living for every man, woman, and child. We can do it. We do not have to have the most unequal distribution of wealth in the industrialized world.  So, let us get involved, let us vote, let us participate, let us follow what is going on here in Congress. We can turn this country around.                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to.
