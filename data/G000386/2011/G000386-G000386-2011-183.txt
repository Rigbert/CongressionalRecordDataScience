 President, I rise today to speak in opposition to Magistrate Judge Chen, the President'snominee for the Northern District of California. Before I address Judge Chen's nomination, I wish to say a few words about our progress on judicial nominations.  At the beginning of this Congress, I told the chairman that I would work with him to process consensus nominees at a fair and reasonable pace. Thus far this Congress, I have worked very hard and in good faith to do just what I promised. We have confirmed consensus nominees with a particular focus on nominees in so-called judicial emergencies. I made that commitment to the chairman, and I have kept it.
