Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I can understand the fervor of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), distinguished minority leader, in opposition to this legislation. She did not support the Defense of Marriage Act when it was passed in 1996 and signed by President Clinton. But to insinuate that this bill is an attack on the foundations of our government is just plain wrong.  The framers of the Constitution put in Article III, Section 2 relating to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, inferior Federal courts and the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to provide a check by the legislative branch of government on the judicial branch of government, and we have heard quotes from Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln expressing their fears about judicial power being unchecked.  This bill is a check on judicial power, and the question is whether we should have the elected representatives of the people, in this case the Congress today and the State legislatures in the future, determining Federal marriage policy, or whether we should have a Federal judge stating that for a State to take a different position than a divided court in Massachusetts is an unconstitutional deprivation of rights.  Now, in the last 10 years or so Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of the Federal courts on numerous occasions. Much has been mentioned here about the provision that the minority leader in the Senate, Senator Daschle, put into Public Law 107-206.                              {time}  1415  The press comments about that action, which is public law today, included headlines that said: ``Daschle seeks to exempt his State; wants logging to prevent fires,'' and ``Plan to curb forest fires wins support.''  Senator Daschle told the Congress and the country there was an emergency in his State, that action needed to be taken, and we could not have judicial review. The Congress agreed. And we did not hear the hue and cry about the Constitution being undermined because of a congressional determination that there had to be some logging to prevent forest fires in South Dakota, and I think the Congress was right in agreeing with Senator Daschle in this instance.  Now, there are a number of other instances in the past 10 years where Congress has precluded Federal judicial review in cases. In 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 was passed. That was Public Law 104-208. It precluded all judicial review over specified discretionary decisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. There you are involving the allegations of rights by people who are subject to deportation or other actions by the INS. Congress, when it passed that bill, and it was signed by President Clinton, said no judicial review. Did we hear at the time that that undermined the Constitution? No, we did not. It was a correct decision by the Congress to preclude judicial review on this.  After September 11, 2001, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, Public Law 107-297, precluding judicial review of certifications by the Secretary of the Treasury that a terrorist event had occurred. Did anybody allege that that undermined the Constitution at the time? No way.  The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act,also passed in the last Congress as Public Law 107-118, precludes judicial review of hazardous waste cleanup programs.  So this has been going on all the time.  The Judiciary Act of 1789, one of the first bills passed by the first Congress, recognized that the judicial power of the United States was not unlimited and limited that judicial power. There have been expansions and contractions in the area of diversity jurisdiction of the Federal courts. Nobody has alleged that the Constitution is being undermined; and, in fact, Federal judges have come to the Congress and asked that the jurisdictional amount in diversity cases be raised so they did not have as many cases to decide.  We have heard the Supreme Court say in asbestos that there should be some way to prevent 600,000 cases from choking the Federal court dockets. I would hope that we would be able to pass some kind of asbestos litigation reform.  The fact of the matter remains that we could go on and on and on. It does not violate the Constitution. There are over 200 years of precedents in adjusting the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.  What this bill says is that if a State decides it does not want to recognize a same-sex marriage license granted in another State, there will not be Federal judicial review to do so. This is a States rights bill, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that marriage and family law is primarily a matter of the States, and this ensures that it will be.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).
