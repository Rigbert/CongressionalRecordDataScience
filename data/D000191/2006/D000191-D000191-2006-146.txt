  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the Medicare part D plan is getting some rave reviews. You might be surprised to hear a Democrat say that; but, yes, it is: Rave reviews from the CEOs of pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies and a few political hacks downtown appointed by President Bush.  But from seniors, there is incredible confusion; and if they find their way through this myriad of confusing plans and find one that provides the drugs they need, they find now there is a new barrier. These are the most restrictive insurance products in history in terms of prior approval for needed drugs.  One company has 39 different forms, which its CEO denied until he was shown them. Then he said, Oh, yes, that is right, I guess we do. They require doctors to conduct all sorts of tests for drugs that seniors have been taking for years to prove that they really need them. And even then if you get a plan that lets you through and does give you your drugs, they can change that benefit on a weekly basis, but seniors cannot change plans on a weekly basis.  And then there is the doughnut hole. I had my first constituent call about the doughnut hole. She has exhausted her benefits. She is on Social Security disability, and she has to pay $2,850 out of pocket for drugs to stay alive. She does not have $2,850.                          ____________________[Page H277]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   MEDICARE PART D DISASTROUS PROGRAM  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
