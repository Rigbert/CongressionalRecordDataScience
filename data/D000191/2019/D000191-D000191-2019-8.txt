Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, again, I congratulate the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer) for proposing this new transparency legislation. I am certain, in the end, it is ultimately going to save the taxpayers money and lead to GSA, perhaps, performing in a more efficient manner.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
