Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to five residents of the South Haven Nursing and Rehabilitation Community, in southwest Michigan who have achieved the great milestone of 100 years of life. This grand feat is especially important today, since these very special individuals have lived for a century or more and in two different millenniums.  The vast experiences and accomplishments of these five people is awe-inspiring. I can only imagine the wonder and amazement of watching our country progress and grow through two world wars, international flight, the Internet, cell-phones, and the many other advances that have occurred over the last century.  It is my fortunate honor to extend my very best wishes to Lucious Wooten who became 107 years old on February 6, 2004, Roxie Braisher who became 100 years old on February 22, 2004, Irene Charlotte Smith who became 100 years old on June 1, 2004, Elsie Louise LaRoy who became 100 years old on June 29, 2004, and Bessie Gilmore who became 102 years old on July 16, 2004.  Along with the entire Sixth District of Michigan, it gives me great pleasure to send wishes for much love, health, and happiness to each in the years ahead.                          ____________________
