Chairman, this amendment adds inclusion of the energy transportation to the list of considerations for the energy securityvaluation report. Section 3002 requires the Secretary of Energy to establish transparent and uniform procedures and criteria to ensure that energy-related actions that significantly affect the supply, distribution, or use of energy are evaluated with respect to their potential impact on energy security, including their impact on the consumer and the economy and energy supply and diversity.  I think it is a good amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
