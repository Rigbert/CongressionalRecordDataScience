 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) Without objection, it is so ordered.                            The Fiscal Cliff  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my office submitted our latest offer to the majority leader last night at 7:10 p.m. and offered to work through the night to find common ground. The majority leader's staff informed us they would be getting back to us this morning at 10 a.m., despite the obvious time crunch we all have. It is now 2 p.m. We have yet to receive a response to our good-faith offer. I am concerned about the lack of urgency here. I think we all know we are running out of time. There is far too much at stake for political gamesmanship. We need to protect the American families and businesses from this looming tax hike.  Everyone agrees action is necessary. In order to get things moving, I have just spoken with the majority leader. I also placed a call to the Vice President to see if he could help jump-start the negotiations on his side. The Vice President and I have worked together on solutions before and I believe we can again.  I want my colleagues to know that we will keep everyone updated. The consequences of this are too high for the American people to be engaged in a political messaging campaign. I am interested in getting a result. I was here all day yesterday. As I indicated, we submitted our latest proposal at 7 p.m. last night. I am willing to work with whoever can help.  There is no single issue that remains an impossible sticking point. The sticking point appears to be a willingness, an interest, or, frankly, the courage to close the deal. I want everyone to know I am willing to get this done, but I need a dance partner.
