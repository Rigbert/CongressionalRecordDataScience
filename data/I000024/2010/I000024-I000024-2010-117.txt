I used to be in this business on some scale. The smaller contractors are the ones who do the renovation business. That means if they try to go out there and even replace one window, you can't replace the window without disturbing 6 square feet. Therefore, you would come under the provisions of this new rule, and you would be subjecting yourself to a fine of $37,500.  So my bill that would have resolved the problem was not quite as good as the Collins bill, but it would have merely said that until such time as there are adequate numbers of people who are certified to do this work, we would not enforce the law.  Well, the problem we are having right now is--and I have a list of the different States--in my State of Oklahoma, there is only one certified instructor. We have all these people wanting to take the course but they cannot get in, and they cannot do the work because of the heavy fine provisions.  So what Senator Collins has done in her amendment is say that the penalty provision--the $37,500 a day--would be waived until September 30. That would allow the EPA to get certified instructors into all the States so the people who want to become certified can become certified--in the meantime, not miss this summer's construction season. It is a very simple thing. I can assure you, this is a huge jobs bill because right now these people are not working. We are talking about thousands and thousands, in just my State of Oklahoma, of subcontractors who do this kind of work.  I strongly support the Collins-Inhofe amendment No. 4318. It is a jobs bill. It is a bill of fairness.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
