 President, Dr. James Middleton has spent nearly every day of his adult life caring for others. As a family physician in Hart County, KY, he has dedicated himself to promoting the health and well-being of his community. When he inherited the family farm and its 150-year-old history, James also made a pledge to conserve that land for all those who might enjoy it.  Recently, my friend was recognized for the exceptional care he has provided to his community with the Kentucky Leopold Conservation Award. I would like to take a moment to congratulate him on this prestigious recognition and to thank him for his years of conservation to protect our environment and benefit Kentucky communities.  Our Commonwealth is blessed with a rich ecosystem and picturesque landscapes. James' home, including the years-old tobacco farm, is near two of our most remarkable natural treasures: the Mammoth Cave system and the Green River. In an effort to help protect these magnificent features, James chose to participate in the Tobacco Buyout, which was created by legislation I introduced to free Kentucky farmers from a Depression-era tobacco quota system. He set out on a new agricultural path and focused on crops that would protect his region and one of the most bio-diverse rivers in the world.  James designed a new style of land management specifically to benefit the natural environment of his community and our country. He began growing hay, raising pasture-fed cattle, and harvesting hardwoods. By his estimation, he has planted more than a million trees, and the majority of his farm is now forestland. As a result, his 600 acres of vegetation have formed a natural barrier to protect the Green River from runoff and other threats.  I would like to congratulate my friend for his remarkable leadership in Hart County and his important conservation work that has benefited Kentucky and our environment. He is certainly deserving of this distinguished award, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. James Middleton for his passionate protection of our heritage.                          ____________________
