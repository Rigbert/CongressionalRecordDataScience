I know Members are pleased to hear about Friday, the 16th.  Mr. Leader, the pension bill to which you referred, will this bill that is brought to the floor be a product of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or will it be a joint product of the Committee on Ways and Means and that committee?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, it is my understanding that the pension bill will be a joint product from the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and the Workforce.
