SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans      Affairs Nurse Recruitment and Retention Act of 2004''.     SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM TO STUDY INNOVATIVE RECRUITMENT TOOLS                    TO ADDRESS NURSING SHORTAGES AT DEPARTMENT OF                    VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH-CARE FACILITIES.       (a) Pilot.--(1) Not later than 90 days after the date of      the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs      shall designate a health-care service region, or a section      within such a region, in which health-care facilities of the      Department of Veterans Affairs are adversely affected by a      shortage of qualified nurses.       (2) The Secretary shall conduct a pilot program in the      region or section designated under paragraph (1) to determine      the effectiveness of the use of innovative human-capital      tools and techniques in the recruitment of qualified nurses      for positions at Department health-care facilities and for      the retention of nurses at such facilities. In carrying out      the pilot program, the Secretary shall enter into a contract      with a private-sector entity for services under the pilot      program for recruitment of qualified nurses.       (b) Private-Sector Recruitment Practices.--For purposes of      the pilot program under this section, the Secretary shall      identify and use recruitment practices that have proven      effective for placing qualified individuals in positions that      are difficult to fill due to shortages of qualified      individuals or other factors. Recruitment practices to be      reviewed by the Secretary for use in the pilot program shall      include--       (1) employer branding and interactive advertising      strategies;       (2) Internet technologies and automated staffing systems;      and       (3) the use of recruitment, advertising, and communication      agencies.

If the Secretary identifies      measures to streamline and automate the hiring process that      can only be implemented if authorized by law, the Secretary      shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the      Senate and House of Representatives recommendations for such      changes in law as may be necessary to enable such measure to      be implemented.       (d) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the      Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of      Representatives a report on the extent to which the pilot      program achieved the goal of improving the recruitment and      retention of nurses in Department of Veterans Affairs health-     care facilities.
