 It is time to have that debate in the Senate, not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution about a proposal, as the Senator from Texas points out, that has been shot down today by the National Security Adviser in Iraq who, as the Senator from Texas indicated, said today:       And we will never give amnesty to those who have killed      American soldiers or who killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.  What part of ``never give amnesty'' do our colleagues not understand?
