Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6316, to authorize the extension of the Army Corps of Engineers' section 214 program.  Section 214 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 allows the Army Corps of Engineers to accept and expend funds provided by non-Federal public entities to hire additional personnel to process regulatory permits.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6316 is urgently needed since authority for this program expires on December 31 of this calendar year. If this program expires, the Corps will have to fire some regulatory personnel, reducing its ability to process permits in a timely manner.  The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has heard from Members on both sides of the aisle supporting the section 214 program. H.R. 6316 is nearly identical to section 2003 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2005, which passed the House on July 14, 2005 by a vote of 406-14. Since the authority for the section 214 program is expiring, it is necessary to move this piece separately.  I thank Representative Baird and our colleagues from the western United States for introducing this bill. I urge all Members to vote in favor of H.R. 6316.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
