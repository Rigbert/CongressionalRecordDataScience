President, the Senator from West Virginia has offered an amendment which highlights that China has enormous reserves of coal which that country will in all likelihood rely on greatly to fuel power plants as its economy continues to expand and modernize.  I commend Senator Byrd for his effort to support the transfer of clean coal technologies to China as part of our foreign assistance programs. The coal in the hills and mountains of China has high concentrations of sulfur and mercury. The United States should encourage the use of technologies that will reduce emissions of harmful substances and improve generation efficiency.  While I support the amendment offered by Senator Byrd, I strongly encourage the Administration to also promote the use of renewable energy technologies in China. Coal may be a plentiful resource in China but that country should also utilize other energy technologies to provide power for their growing economy such as wind, solar and biomass. The United States and many European countries have developed low cost power generation technologies in all of these areas of renewable energy. Our foreign policyshould vigorously promote these technologies as well as clean coal technology.
