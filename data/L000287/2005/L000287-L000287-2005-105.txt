Mr. Speaker, as the nation celebrates the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and the conflict on the Edmund Pettus bridge, the 40th anniversary of the signing of Voting Rights Act, and the 50th anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott this year, I think it is fitting and appropriate that we take a moment to acknowledge the vital role that the press played in the success of the Civil Rights Movement.  I have often said that without the media the Civil Rights Movement would have been a bird without wings. I am not certain where we would be today as a nation, if the American public had not been made to acknowledge the struggles we faced in the American South. The non-violent protests of the sixties used peaceful means to demonstrate the senseless injustice of de facto and de jure segregation, the inhumanity and indignity of the Jim Crow South, and the extraordinary persecution American citizens suffered trying to exercise their constitutional rights. Without the media's willingness to stand in harm's way and starkly portray events of the Movement as they saw them unfold, Americans may never have understood or even believed the horrors that African Americans faced in the Deep South.  That commitment to publish the truth took courage. It was incredibly dangerous to be seen with a pad, a pen, or a camera in Mississippi, Alabama or Georgia where the heart of the struggle took place. There was a violent desperation among local and State officials and the citizens to maintain the traditional order. People wanted to keep their injustice a secret. They wanted to hide from the critical eye of a disapproving world. They wanted to flee from the convictions of their own conscience. And they wanted to destroy the ugly reflection that nonviolent protestors and camera images so graphically displayed. So when the Freedom Riders climbed off the bus in Alabama in 1961, for example, there were reporters who were beaten and bloodied before any of us were.  And as they were attacked, I saw in them a resolve grow within them that was similar to what those of us in the Movement experienced. I have often said that the first time I was jailed, I felt so free. This Nation had dealt me its worst blow, and I had survived. I knew then that I was committed to the struggle for the long-haul. There were many reporters who felt that same curious strengthening when they too were attacked and beaten. Instead of scaring them away, those injustices created the opposite effect. It bonded them to the Movement, and it steeled their commitment to publish all that they saw.  There are so many moments poignantly depicted for posterity by television and newspaper camera men. It is easy to recall many of these now legendary images--Rosa Parks sitting on a bus in Montgomery in 1955; the bombing of the Greyhound bus outside Anniston, Alabama during the Freedom Rides in 1961; Gov. Ross Barnett of Mississippi and Gov. George Wallace in Alabama denying the entrance of black students to state universities in 1963 and 1964; the speeches on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington in 1964; and the seminal speech President Lyndon Johnson made before a joint session of Congress encouraging the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.  There are so many historic moments that were covered by the press, but there are two, which I count as turning points for me. The first is often heralded as the official beginning of the modern-day Civil Rights Movement, that is the photograph of a mutilated 14-year-old boy named Emmett Till who was killed in Money, Mississippi during a summer vacation.Till's mother Mamie Till Mobley decided not to have a closed casket funeral, but she wanted to leave the casket open and let people see the horrifying injustice that had been done. Jet magazine carried photographs of Till's body and Look magazine published an interview with Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam who admitted to the murder.  I will never forget the way that image affected me. Something changed inside of me and inside of many people across America when we saw the body of Emmett Till. I was only a teenager at the time, but I knew that somehow, someway the injustice of segregation had to come to an end.  Within a year of the Till murder, when I was 15 years old and the son of a sharecropper in rural Alabama, I heard the words of Martin Luther King, Jr. broadcast on an old radio. He was talking about the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and I felt somehow that he was speaking directly to me. That radio broadcast changed my life because that day I knew it was possible to strike a blow at racial segregation and discrimination in America. Those moments captured by the media changed my destiny.  The Civil Rights Movement is deeply indebted to the courage, the strength, the integrity, and the talent of print and broadcast journalists who overcame their fear and decided to tell the American story. America is deeply indebted to these moment-by-moment, modern-day griots who hold up a mirror image of our society for us to see. Without a free press, this Nation would not be, could not be a beacon of justice and equality that has inspired men, women, and children worldwide to try to build a better world.                          ____________________
