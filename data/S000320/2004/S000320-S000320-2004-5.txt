 President, I pay tribute to a great Alabamian who has made it his life's work to teach our youth about being great athletes, fair sportsmen, and strong members of their community.  Mr. Sammy Dunn, baseball coach of Vestavia Hills High School, was recently inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and named the National High School Coaches Association baseball coach of the year. He has dedicated his life to coaching young men, not just on the athletic field, but in life's lessons.  For 27 seasons, Coach Dunn served as head baseball coach at Vestavia Hills High School, where he built a nationally recognized program. He won more games than any baseball coach in the history of Alabama and has a 621-159 record, a staggering .796 winning percentage. From 1991 to 2000, he led the Vestavia Hills Rebels to 10 State titles, including a record 7 consecutive titles between 1994 and 2000. In 1998, the Rebels were voted national champions by Baseball America and the Baseball Coaches Association. In 2000, Vestavia Hills High School named its baseball field in honor of Coach Dunn.  Throughout Coach Dunn's tenure, more than 100 players signed baseball scholarships, and some went on to play professionally, including veteran Oakland Athletic's pitcher Chris Hammond, Cincinnati Red's pitcher Josh Hancock, and New York Yankee pitching prospect Colter Bean. Moreover, his leadership inspired a handful of his former players to pursue coaching careers, including his son Casey, who is the head coach at Samford University.  Coach Dunn's lifelong devotion to young people and the sport of baseball made him an outstanding coach and much deserving of these recent accolades. He is a devoted husband to Linda, dedicated father to Casey, father-in-law to Marty, and grandfather to Sam. I wish him my sincerest congratulations on all of his achievements.                          ____________________
