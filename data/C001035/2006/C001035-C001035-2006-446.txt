President, I rise today to honor the life of Robert Maxcy of Waldoboro, ME, who passed away this weekend at the age of 76. Bob served 56 years in the Waldoboro Fire Department, including the last 42 years as its chief, and I would like to recognize his lifelong devotion to public safety.  Chief Bob Maxcy was born on November 17, 1929, in Thomaston, ME, the son of the late Earl and Ruth Maxcy. At age 14 he began his service as a firefighter at the Thomaston Junior Fire Department. This was the beginning of his outstanding career in service to both Maine and the Nation.  Upon his graduation from Thomaston High School, Chief Maxcy served honorably with the U.S. Air Force from 1947 to 1950. During his service, Chief Maxcy attained the rank of gunnery sergeant.  When he returned to Maine in 1950, Chief Maxcy became a firefighter with the Waldoboro Fire Department. In that same year, he married his loving and devoted wife, Muriel. By 1964, Chief Maxcy had established himself as a leader in the department and was appointed chief of the Waldoboro Fire Department, a position in which he served for 42 years.  Beyond his dedication to his department, Chief Maxcy also was a leader in the community and the State, as evidenced through his participation in the Waldoboro Firemen's Association, Knox County Firemen's Association, Maine State Federation of Firefighters, and the Lincoln County Fire Chiefs.  Chief Maxcy was truly an honorable Maine man. In addition to his success as a community leader and firefighter, he will be remembered for his love of his family, the outdoors, and the Red Sox. Chief Maxcy is survived by five children, Deborah, Marcia, Marc, Dee, and Daryl; his brother, Harlan; his sister, Marilyn; his grandchildren, great grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.  Chief Bob Maxcy will be greatly missed. I offer my sincere condolences and prayers to Chief Maxcy's family.                          ____________________[Page S2200]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENT                                 ______                                                         TRIBUTE TO ROBERT MAXCY
