 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. today, all postcloture time on the Brownback nomination be considered expired and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.  I further ask unanimous consent that the vote on the James nomination occur at 1:45 p.m. on Thursday, January 25, with all other provisions of the previous order in effect.
