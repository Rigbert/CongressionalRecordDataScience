and Mrs. Joseph and Sandra Morrow of Schererville, Indiana. On Wednesday, May 23, 2007, Joe and Sandy will be honored by the Calumet Council, Boy Scouts of America for their many years of service and many contributions to their community. The Calumet Council will be honoring Joe and Sandra at the 2007 Distinguished Citizens Dinner, which will be held at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana.  Joseph Morrow, originally from Huntington, Indiana, has always proven himself to be a dedicated member of the Northwest Indiana community. From a very young age, Joe realized the need for community participation and joined the Boy Scouts, where he would eventually attain the rank of Life Scout. After graduating from Huntington High School in 1949, Joe continued his commitment to his community and country as he enlisted and served in the United States Air Force from 1950-1954. From there, Joe went on to further his education and decided to pursue a career in the legal profession. Upon graduating from law school in 1958, Joe entered the practice of law. From there, the law firm of Schroer, Eichhorn, and Morrow emerged, where Joe remained until 1979. At that time, Joe left the firm and was named Chairman of Mercantile National Bank of Indiana, First National Bank of Illinois, and Home State Bank of Crystal Lake, Illinois, as well as President of the Lake Commercial Group.  Throughout the years, Joe has been a constant fixture in his community. He serves or has served in various capacities on the boards for many organizations, including: Indiana Bond Bank, Hoosier Boys Town, Northern Indiana Arts Association, Trade Winds Rehabilitation Center, Calumet Council--Boy Scouts of America, Indiana University Northwest-Chancellor's Advisory Board, Indiana University-Purdue University Calumet Region Campus Advisory Board, Purdue University Calumet-Chancellor's Council, Northwest Indiana Urban League, Gary Accord, Campaign America, Hammond Bar Association, Community Foundation of Northwest Indiana, Munster Medical Research Foundation, Indiana University Foundation, Indiana University Varsity Club, First National Bank of Illinois, Home State Bank, and the Audubon Country Club Foundation.  Sandra (Murray) Morrow, a native of Hammond, Indiana, has always shared the same compassion and willingness to serve her community. As a child, Sandy was always involved in community-oriented activities, such as the Brownies and Girl Scouts, and she attended Camp Paxton for summer camp. Upon her graduation from Hammond High School, Sandy went on to Indiana University, where she earned her Bachelor of Science degree in speech and hearing therapy. In 1956, she and Joe were married, and she continued to teach, traveling between Indianapolis, Bloomington, and Hammond.  Sandy's lifelong commitment to her community is an inspiring testament to her character. Sandy, like her husband, has served in many capacities with many organizations in the Northwest Indiana community, including: President of the Service League of Hammond, the Women's Board of the Bethany Home for Girls, the Women's Board of Hoosier Boys' Town, and she served on the boards for the Northwest Indiana Symphony, Beta Gamma Upsilon Sorority, Audubon Country Club, and the South Shore Arts Board.  While they remain truly committed to the Northwest Indiana community, Joe and Sandy's greatest enjoyment is the time spent with their beautiful family. The couple has one son, Chris, and one daughter, Gale Morrow Crabtree, as well as four adoring grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. and Mrs. Joseph and Sandra Morrow as they are honored for their service and dedication to the Northwest Indiana community. Their years of service have touched and improved the lives of countless individuals. Their unselfish and lifelong dedication is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent them in Congress.                          ____________________
