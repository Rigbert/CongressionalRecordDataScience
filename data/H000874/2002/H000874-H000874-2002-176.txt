Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney). The gentleman is a delight to work with. He is open, fair, and wants to achieve the same objective that all of us do of having a system that works well, and as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Foley) said, of every American's confidence that they have the right to vote, and their vote is counted accurately.  Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good motion, and I am looking forward to going to conference as quickly as possible so we can pass this legislation, which I think will be one of the hallmarks of the 107th Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
