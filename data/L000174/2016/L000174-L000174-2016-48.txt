President, Vermont's business landscape boasts dozens of cutting-edge startups and successful small ventures. True to this entrepreneurial and independent spirit found throughout the Green Mountains, Concept2, based in Morrisville, VT, has once again put our small, rural State on the world stage.  Concept2 is a manufacturer of rowing equipment, founded in 1976 by two brothers, Dick and Pete Dreissigacker, dedicated to the sport of rowing. There, they first designed and started selling composite racing oars. Many years and many innovative models later, these Concept2 products have become an integral presence in the rowing community and have unmistakably changed an international sport.  Propelled by these lightweight, Vermont-crafted Concept2 oars and sculls, 32 Olympic rowing teams recently brought home medals in the summer 2016 Olympic Games regatta in Rio de Janeiro. Bob Beeman of Morrisville was sent to Rio as a representative and on-site technician for Concept2. As a trusted and true employee, Beeman, too, was recognized with a medal and certificate from the International Olympic Committee for Concept2's continuous and fair support of the athletes and their equipment.  With a nod to Vermont's core values of ethical business standards and giving back to our communities, the mission of Concept2 is to support the international rowing community and create equal opportunity for all. Regardless of nation or team flag, the crew has worked with rowing teams from around the world to combine Concept2 technology with human skill and training. Characterized by honesty, fairness, and integrity, these values of Concept2 embody the true Olympic spirit to level the playing field and allow the best team to win. As Vermonters, we are proud to see such a passionate and committed company rise to the global platform and helpathletes accomplish their Olympic dreams.  My grandson, Roan, and I still talk of our visit to Concept2 when he was on his high school rowing team.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the September 2, 2016, article, ``Concept2 Oars Used in Majority of Olympic Rowing Wins,'' from the Stowe Reporter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Stowe Reporter, September 2, 2016]         Concept2 Oars Used in Majority of Olympic Rowing Wins                          (By Kayla Friedrich)       With the help of Concept2 oars and sculls, 32 rowing      crews--76 percent of all medal-winning crews at the Olympic      regatta--were able to step onto the platform in Rio de      Janeiro to receive their awards this year.       Nine of those medals were gold.       Concept2 is one of the world's most prominent manufacturers      of lightweight oars. They're built by former U.S. Olympian      Dick Dreissigacker and his brother Pete in Morrisville.       The company also produces an indoor rowing machine, and all      of the athletes have trained on the Concept2 Indoor Rower to      build their fitness to Olympic caliber.       The company produces 80 to 90 percent of the world's market      of competition oars, and it sends an accredited technician--     Bob Beeman of Morrisville--to the Olympics to make any      equipment repairs the athletes need.       Sometimes oars are damaged in transit, practice or a race,      and Beeman is able to provide replacement parts and      adjustments if requested.       Thanks to his decades of work at the company, Beeman became      a five-time Olympian this year, not competing, but helping      teams--regardless of what country they represent.       ``Everything we do is free of charge,'' Beeman said. ``It's      all part of the service when using Concept2 oars.       ``Some of the athletes look at me like I'm Santa Claus.      There are 70 countries in rowing, and we try to even the      playing field. One team didn't have good oars to use at the      Olympics, so we lent some out.''       Beeman has been the on-site technician for Concept2 at the      Atlanta Olympics in 1996; Sydney, Australia, in 2000;      Beijing, China, in 2008; London in 2012; and now Rio.       As a result, he's known some of the athletes for many      years.       ``Athletes want to know that there is nothing wrong with      their equipment, and they rely on me. It makes me so proud,''      Beeman said.       U.S. rower Gevvie Stone was at the Concept2 tent every day,      not because she needed repairs, but because it gave her a      place to relax. Beeman said Stone's father thanked him      profusely. Stone took silver in the women's single sculls      using Concept2 oars.       Beeman also was able to wear a gold medal at this year's      events. The gold-medal winning team from New Zealand, Eric      Murray and Hamish Bond, returned to the tent following their      men's pair final. Murray took off his gold medal and placed      it over Beeman's head for a photo-op.       ``Just to be around this level of athlete is amazing,''      Beeman said. ``They train daily, many of them two or three      times a day at a few hours each time. They train like that      not just for months, but for years.''       For Beeman, Rio was the best of the five Olympics that he      has been to. Everything worked well logistically, there were      over 200 volunteers assisting at the rowing venue, and he had      a chance to watch some of the other events, including water      polo and table tennis.       ``It was great to be right in the middle of it all,''      Beeman said.       This was also the first Olympics at which Beeman was      officially recognized for his work. Even a senior adviser      thanked him, and ``that was a big deal,'' he said.       Before leaving Brazil, Beeman received a thank-you medal      and a certificate from the International Olympic Committee      for Concept2's support of the athletes and their equipment.       The next Summer Olympics will be in Tokyo in 2020, and      Beeman looks forward to being a rowing-equipment technician      for the sixth time.       ``I'm also super excited to go to some of the other      international regattas,'' Beeman said. ``One is in Serbia      this year, and Switzerland. The World Rowing Championships      will be in Florida.''                          ____________________
