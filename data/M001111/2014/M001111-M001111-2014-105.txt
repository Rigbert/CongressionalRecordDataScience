 President, I wish to recognize the achievements of Ms. Vivian E. ``Bo'' Smith-Tallan. During her years of service, Ms. Smith demonstrated tireless dedication to her country, and specifically to Fairchild Air Force Base and the greater Spokane area.  Ms. Smith-Tallan, who hails from Maryland, entered the Air Force in 1976 directly out of high school. She retired from the Air Force as a master sergeant after serving for 20 years on active duty. Ms. Smith-Tallan completed a degree in law enforcement and is a graduate of the Spokane County Police Academy. Prior to her present position, she was a police officer with the Medical Lake Police Department and bailiff for the Airway Heights courts system.  While on Active Duty in the law enforcement career field, Ms. Smith-Tallan served in numerous capacities including gate guard, patrolman, investigator, pass and registration noncommissioned officer in charge, and flight chief. Her talent earned her a selection as the first female motorcycle patrolman. In 1992 she was assigned as the treaty compliance superintendent and finalized Fairchild Air Force Base's role under the START Treaty in which B-52s were removed from assignment to the base. From there she was assigned as the wing protocol superintendent until her retirement from Active Duty in 1996.  Ms. Smith-Tallan then began serving at Fairchild Air Force Base as a Department of Defense civilian. Through the following 18 years she led an office of 12 airmen as the wing chief of protocol and public relations, consistently ensuring that Fairchild presented a welcoming and professional environment to visitors and the local community.  As chief of protocol she planned, evaluated, and led the arrangements,protocol and coordination for dignitaries visiting the wing. She developed and executed itineraries compatible with the scope of the visit, to include social events, ceremonies, briefings, lodging, transportation, courtesy and office calls, and tours. She planned and supervised countless renderings of honors, awards, promotions, retirements, change of command ceremonies, dining outs, airshows, intra-service competitions, parades, and other recognitions.  As chief of public relations, Ms. Smith-Tallan planned, organized and directed the activities of the 92nd Air Refueling Wing Public Affairs office to provide installation-level multimedia activities composed of media, community relations, photography and videography. She developed the community relations program and ran the Honorary Commanders and Eagles program to ensure continual outreach of installation commanders with civic leaders. Ms. Smith-Tallan also served as the wing foreign disclosure officer.  Ms. Smith-Tallan consistently goes above and beyond, as exemplified by her multiple Civilian of the Year and Civilian of the Quarter awards, an Exemplary Civilian Service Award, and many more awards she received while serving on Active Duty. Her record of achievement would not have been possible without the love and support of her husband, Robert ``Bob'' Tallan. We thank her family for sharing her with us. Mr. President, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Ms. Smith-Tallan on her 38 years of outstanding service. For her commitment to the people of Fairchild Air Force Base and the greater Spokane area, she is worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
