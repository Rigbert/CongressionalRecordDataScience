 President, last night the President of the United States said something very important about United Nations inspections in Iraq. He said:       Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections. . .will      have to be very different. . . . To ensure that we learn the      truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal      activities to be interviewed outside the country, and these      witnesses must be free to bring their families with them so      they are all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and      murder. And inspectors must have access to any site, at any      time, without pre-clearance, without delay, without      exceptions.  The President is right on the money about the inspections. This is how to get the information the world needs on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs. But how is the U.N. to do that?  Where will those weapons scientists and their families go, once they've told the truth about Saddam's weapons programs? They can't go home again. And at least in the short run, there will be no safe haven in the region for the people who reveal Saddam's most terrible secrets.  So where will those scientists go? Maybe some can go to Europe, although both al Qaeda cells and Saddam's agents have operated there. Maybe some can go to Canada, or to South America.  But if the United States wants the world to show resolve in dealing with Saddam Hussein, then we should show the way by taking the lead in admitting those Iraqis who have the courage to betray Saddam's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs.  We have a large country in which to absorb those people, and, for all our problems, we have the best law enforcement and security apparatus to guard them.  What we do not have is an immigration system that readily admits large numbers of persons who have a recent involvement with weapons of mass destruction, have recently aided a country in the so-called ``axis of evil,'' and are bringing their families.  I am introducing today, therefore, legislation to admit to our country those Iraqi scientists, engineers and technicians, and their families, who give reliable information on Saddam's programs to us, to the United Nations, or to the International Atomic Energy Agency.  My esteemed colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter of Pennsylvania, joins me in introducing this legislation, and I am very pleased to have his support. This bill is not political. Rather, it is a bipartisan effort to help the President succeed in forcing Iraq to destroy all its weapons of mass destruction capabilities.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Why? Because those Iraqis will deserve our protection. And equally important, because they will not come forward unless we offer that protection.  Charles Duelfer, former Deputy Executive Director of UNSCOM, the original U.N. inspection force in Iraq, recently wrote an article entitled, ``The Inevitable Failure of Inspections in Iraq.'' He made the following recommendations: First, inspectors should be mandated to interview the few hundred key scientists, engineers, and technicians who were involved in the previous weapons of mass destruction efforts and have them account for their activities since December 1998. The U.N. knows who these individuals are. If, as is suspected, Iraq has been continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction, some or most of these people will have been involved.  Second, the conditions for such interviews must be changed. Iraqi government observers must not be present. the previous UNSCOM agreement to the presence of such ``minders'' was a mistake. The fact that junior workers would shake with fear at the prospect of answering a question in a way inconsistent with government direction made this obvious.  Third, and most important, the U.N. should offer sanctuary or safe haven to those who find it a condition for speaking the truth. The people are key to these programs. Access to the people under conditions where they could speak freely was not something UNSCOM ever achieved except in the rare instances of defection.  Mr. Duelfer concludes: I often summarized this problem to Washington by suggesting that, if UNSCOM had 100 green cards to distribute during inspections, it could have quickly accounted for the weapons programs.  Other experts, including Dr. Khidir Hamza, a former Iraqi nuclear weaponsscientist who testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 27, have pointed out that by enticing scientists and engineers away from Iraq, we will also deprive Saddam Hussein of the very people he needs to produce those weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles.  If we do, in the end, have to go to war against Saddam, then the fewer weapons scientists he has, the better.  Current law includes several means of either paroling non-immigrants into the United States or admitting people for permanent residence, notwithstanding their normal inadmissibility under the law.  These are very limited provisions, however, and they will not suffice to accommodate hundreds of Iraqi scientists and their families.  The legislation that I am introducing, the ``Iraqi Scientists Liberation Act of 2002,'' will permit the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, acting jointly and on a case-by-case basis, to admit a foreigner and his family for permanent residence if such person: is a scientist, engineer, or technician who has worked in an Iraqi program to produce weapons of mass destruction or the means to deliver them, during the years since the inspectors left and Saddam began rebuilding those programs; is willing to supply or has supplied reliable information on that program to UNMOVIC, to the IAEA, or to an agency of the United State Government; and will be or has been placed in danger as a result of providing such information.  The Attorney General will be empowered to set the rules and regulations governing implementation of this law, in consultation with the Secretary of State and other relevant officials.  Finally, this legislation will be limited to the admission of 500 scientists, plus their families, over 3 years. If it works and we need to enlarge the program, we can do so.  The important thing for now is to give our country the initial authority, and to give United Nations inspectors the ability to call on us when one of Saddam's nuclear, chemical or biological weapons experts is willing to help the world to bring those programs down.  It is hard to predict what we will achieve by opening our doors. Iraq will surely object to giving UNMOVIC the inspection and interview powers that the President proposes. But if UNMOVIC does get into Iraq under a stronger Security Council resolution in the coming weeks, then having this law on the books could help to undermine Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs.  Even if inspectors never get in, a public offer of asylum for Iraq's scientists could lead some to defect, as Dr. Hamza did.  Last night the President called for inspections that protect the lives of those who are interviewed and their families.  We owe it to the President to do all we can to make that possible.  We owe it to the United Nations inspectors to give them every chance to succeed.  We owe to it Iraq's people and its neighbors to do everything we can to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs.  And we owe it to our own people to do all we can to achieve that end peacefully, and with international support.  This bill is a small step toward those ends, but it is a vital one. I urge my colleagues to give it their immediate attention and their considered support.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill appear following my remarks in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3079       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be known as the ``Iraqi Scientists Liberation      Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The President stated in substance the following to the      United Nations General Assembly:       (A) In 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and stop      developing all weapons of mass destruction and long-range      missiles, and to prove to the world it has done so by      complying with rigorous inspections. Iraq has broken every      aspect of this fundamental pledge.       (B) Today, Iraq continues to withhold important information      about its nuclear program: weapons design, procurement logs,      experiment data, an accounting of nuclear materials, and      documentation of foreign assistance. Iraq's state-controlled      media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam Hussein      and his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his      continued appetite for these weapons.       (C) Iraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles with      ranges greater than the 150 kilometers permitted by the      United Nations.       (2) United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) experts      concluded that Iraq's declarations on biological agents      vastly understated the extent of its program, and that Iraq      actually produced two to four times the amount of most      agents, including anthrax and botulinum toxin, than it had      declared.       (3) UNSCOM reported to the United Nations Security Council      in April 1995 that Iraq had concealed its biological weapons      program and had failed to account for 3 tons of growth      material for biological agents.       (4) Gaps identified by UNSCOM in Iraqi accounting and      current production capabilities strongly suggest that Iraq      maintains stockpiles of chemical agents, probably VX, sarin,      cyclosarin, and mustard.       (5) Iraq has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical      precursors and tens of thousands of unfilled munitions,      including Scud variant missile warheads.       (6) Iraq has not accounted for at least 15,000 artillery      rockets that in the past were its preferred vehicle for      delivering nerve agents, nor has it accounted for about 550      artillery shells filled with mustard agent.       (7) For nearly 4 years, Iraq has been able to pursue its      weapons of mass destruction programs free of inspections.       (8) Inspections will fail if United Nations and      International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors do not have      speedy and complete access to any and all sites of interest      to them.       (9) Inspections will be much less effective if those      scientists, engineers, and technicians whom the inspectors      interview are monitored and subjected to pressure by agents      of Saddam Hussein's regime.       (10) As the President made clear in his speech to the      Nation on October 7, 2002, the most effective international      inspection of Iraq would include interviews with persons who      are unmonitored by Saddam Hussein's regime and who are      protected from it in return for providing reliable      information.       (11) The emigration from Iraq of key scientists, engineers,      and technicians could substantially disable Saddam Hussein's      programs to produce weapons of mass destruction and the means      to deliver them.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) Iraq must give United Nations and International Atomic      Energy Agency inspectors speedy and complete access to any      and all sites of interest to them;       (2) United Nations and International Atomic Energy Agency      inspections in Iraq should include interviews with persons      who are unmonitored by Saddam Hussein's regime and who are      protected from it in return for providing reliable      information; and       (3) key scientists, engineers, and technicians in Saddam      Hussein's programs to produce weapons of mass destruction and      the means to deliver them should be encouraged to leave those      programs and provide information to governments and      international institutions that are committed to dismantling      those programs.     SEC. 4. ADMISSION OF CRITICAL ALIENS.       (a) Authority.--Notwithstanding the provisions of the      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      whenever the Secretary of State and the Attorney General,      acting jointly, determine that the admission into the United      States of an alien described in subsection (b) is in the      public interest, the alien, and any member of the alien's      immediate family accompanying or following to join, shall be      eligible to receive an immigrant visa and to be admitted to      the United States for permanent residence.       (b) Eligibility.--An alien described in this subsection is      an alien who--       (1) is a scientist, engineer, or technician who has worked      at any time since December 16, 1998, in an Iraqi program to      produce weapons of mass destruction or the means to deliver      them;       (2) is in possession of critical reliable information      concerning any such Iraqi program;       (3) is willing to provide, or has provided, such      information to inspectors of the United Nations, inspectors      of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or any department,      agency, or other entity of the United States Government; and       (4) will be or has been placed in danger as a result of      providing such information.       (c) Limitation.--Not more than 500 principal aliens may be      admitted to the United States under subsection (a). The      limitation in this subsection does not apply to any immediate      family member accompanying or following to join a principal      alien.       (d) Expiration of Authority.--The authority granted in this      section shall expire 36 months after the date of enactment of      this Act.     SEC. 5. RULES AND REGULATIONS.       The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of      State, is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations      as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.     SEC. 6. WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION DEFINED.       (a) In General.--In this Act, the term ``weapon of mass      destruction'' has the meaning given the term in section      1403(1) of the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction      Act of 1996 (title XIV of Public Law 104-201; 110 Stat. 2717;      50 U.S.C. 2302(1)), as amended by subsection (b).       (b) Technical Correction.--Section 1403(1)(B) of the      Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996      (title XIV of Public Law 104-201; 110 Stat. 2717; 50 U.S.C.      2302(1)(B)) is amended by striking ``a disease organism'' and      inserting ``a biological agent, toxin, or vector (as those      terms are defined in section 178 of title 18, United States      Code)''.                                 ______                                       By
