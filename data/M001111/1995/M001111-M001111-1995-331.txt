 President, I rise today to speak about a very important issue in the Pacific Northwest: inland forest health. Earlier today, my colleague form Idaho, Senator Craig, spoke about legislation to address a serious forest health problem plaguing forests throughout the inland west. He very accurately described the problems of disease, insect infestations, and drought that are prevalent in many such forests, and which can lead to serious forest fires.  I commend Senator Craig for his work on this issue. He is correct that serious forest health problems exist in many areas, and he is correct that we should try to do something about it. The reasons are very simple. Healthy forests are essential to ensuring long-term economic sustainability in rural communities; they are essential to our standard of living; and they are essential to maintaining a healthy environment.  Growing trees provide many benefits. They shade spawning streams, they stabilize soil and prevent erosion, they provide wildlife habitat, they consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. They also provide wood for our home, paper for our schools, shelter for our communities, and recreation for the people. In short, they are many things to many people. If we strengthen our forests, we strengthen our communities. Of course, the reverse is also true. If we weaken our forests, we weaken our society in many ways.  So it is important that we do what we can to keep our forests as healthy as possible.  I would like to support a forest health bill. Given the passions inflamed when Congress starts legislating forest policy, I believe it is incumbent on us to proceed cautiously if we hope to achieve any results. Above all, we must not go too far. We need a forest health bill that addresses legitimate problems and reflects the public's view regarding management of our public lands.  I have already talked about some of these problems. What about the public view? We know the public enjoys its parks and wilderness areas. We know the public appreciates aesthetic, wildlife, roadless, and old growth values. But we also know the public has a voracious appetite for wood products. So, as is so often the case, our challenge and our responsibility as legislators is to strike the right balance.  I have a few concerns I hope can be addressed as we enter the forest health debate. I have touched on a few already: We need to make sure we are taking steps to address legitimate, serious problems. We need to avoid costly, catastrophic fires. The fires we saw last summer ravaged thousands of acres, cost a billion dollars to fight, and did no one any good. We need to avoid diseases and inspect problems as well.  We also need to keep in mind what's going on downstream. People in the Pacific Northwest have spent the last few years trying to refine the concept of watershed-based management. In Tacoma last year, Representative Norm Dicks any myself convened a conference of nearly a thousand people to discuss watershed issue. Agency managers, fishers, private land owners, wildlife specialists, water users, conservationists, and citizens of all types came together to recognize the importance of watersheds as a resource management unit.  We are finding more often than not many land-use questions are becoming aquatic questions. In other words, what happens downstream is quite often affected by what happens upstream. Our entire resource-based economy is connected one way or another by the streams and rivers that criss-cross the region.  I believe there is ample room for proactive management of forest health problems and consideration of aquatic issues. The connection between these two issue sets is a concept I would like to introduce in the debate over Senator Craig's upcoming legislation.  We also need to make sure management actions are science-based. The good news is that very few people in the scientific community disagree over management prescriptions that can help improve forest health. Just the same, I think it is important to make it clear that the goal of achieving good forest health, and the steps taken to reach it, are based in sound science.  Finally, I want to say a few words about the broader issue of ecosystem management. This is a concept that has been very popular in recent years. It suggests that active resource management and usage can be reconciled with strong conservation goals. It suggests we can make decisions on a broad basis so we can avoid stumbling into problems on a case-by-case basis. These are goals that I strongly support.  But the problem remains that ecosystem management is still just loosely defined. And of course, the devil is always in the detail. Last year, Senator Hatfield introduced legislation that I cosponsored to define the concept of ecosystem management more clearly. The goal is to arrive at a set of principles or standards that can guide long-term resource management decisions.  I believe this is still the proper course of action. Until we have a clear goal in sight, it is not necessarily wise to proceed quickly with rifle-shot solutions to short- or intermediate-term problems that may not repeat themselves. So I encourage my colleagues, and people from the region, to consider some of the threshold questions that remain unanswered.  Mr. President, there are other issues that I have not touched on but which I hope can be discussed in the context of forest health. Again, I commend the Senator from Idaho for his work. I hope to work with him and other Senators from the region in a bipartisan way to come up with solutions that work for the people.           federal lands act forest health amendments of 1995
