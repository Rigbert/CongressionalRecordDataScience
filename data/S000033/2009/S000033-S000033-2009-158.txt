 President, for the past 5 months, I blocked consideration of the nomination of Gary Gensler to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the CFTC. As a strong supporter of President Obama, I took no particular pleasure in doing that. But given Mr. Gensler's history as a senior executive of Goldman Sachs for 18 years and the role Mr. Gensler played in deregulating the financial services industry as a senior Treasury Department official from 1991 to 2001, I did not believe Mr. Gensler was the right person at the right time to help lead this country out of the financial crisis we find ourselves in today. In my view, we need a new vision of what Wall Street should be--one that is notobsessed with quick profits, bubble economies, and huge compensation packages for top executives. We need financial institutions which will invest in a productive economy and which will help create millions of decent-paying jobs as we rebuild our Nation and rebuild the middle class.  I am happy to say that last week I had a productive meeting with Mr. Gensler, the second meeting I have had with him. While Mr. Gensler is clearly not the nominee I would have chosen for this position, nor were his answers all that I would have liked, there is no question in my mind that he is a stronger nominee today than he was 5 months ago when I first met him.  In preparation for the meeting last week, I outlined a number of issues I wanted Mr. Gensler to respond to, and let me highlight some of Mr. Gensler's written replies for my colleagues.  In terms of strongly regulating credit default swaps and other derivatives--something Mr. Gensler opposed in the Clinton administration--Mr. Gensler now says:       I believe we must urgently move to enact a broad regulatory      regime that covers the entire over-the-counter- derivatives      marketplace. As a key component of this reform, we should      subject all derivatives dealers to: Conservative capital      requirements; business conduct standards; recordkeeping      requirements, including an audit trail; reporting      requirements; and conservative margin requirements. I believe      that the CFTC should be provided with authority to set      position limits on all OTC derivatives to prevent      manipulation and excessive speculation. Such position limit      authority should clearly empower the CFTC to establish      aggregate position limits.  Mr. Gensler also wrote to me saying:       I will work closely with Congress to pass legislation that      will mandate registration of hedge fund advisers. In      addition, I will work with agency staff to review all      previously granted exemptions from registration.  Finally, Mr. Gensler told me in writing that he supports:       . . . actions to close the ``London loophole'' and ensure      that foreign futures exchanges with permanent trading      terminals in the U.S. comply with position limitations and      reporting and transparency requirements that are applied to      trades made on U.S. exchanges.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record all of Mr. Gensler's written responses to me dated May 14, 2009.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Gary Gensler, Nominee for CFTC Chairman              (Response to Senator Sanders, May 14, 2009)       1. The CFTC should produce quarterly reports on its website      describing the role derivatives trading activities have in      influencing prices for each major energy commodity, including      home heating oil and crude oil.       I believe that we must urgently move to enact a broad      regulatory regime that covers the entire over-the-counter      derivatives marketplace. This regime should consist of two      main components. One component is the regulation of the      derivatives dealers themselves. The other component is the      regulation of the marketplace. I believe it is best that we      implement both of these complimentary components to bring the      needed transparency, accountability and safety to the trading      of OTC derivatives.       Market efficiency and price transparency for OTC      derivatives should be significantly enhanced by:       requiring the clearing of standardized products through      regulated central counterparty clearinghouses;       moving the standardized part of these markets onto      regulated exchanges and regulated, transparent electronic      trade, executions systems;       requiring development of a system for timely reporting of      trades and prompt dissemination of prices and other trade      information;       requiring that all OTC transactions, both standardized and      customized, be reported to a regulated trade repository; and       requiring clearinghouses and trade repositories to, among      other things, make aggregate data on open positions and      trading volumes available to the public and to make data on      any individual counterparty's trades and positions available      on a confidential basis to the CFTC and other regulators.       I also believe the CFTC should promote greater transparency      by providing more useful and comprehensive data to the      public. In my opinion, the rapid growth in commodity index      funds was a contributing factor to a bubble in commodity      prices--including home heating oil and crude oil--that peaked      in mid-2008. The expanding number of hedge funds and other      investors who increased asset allocations to commodities also      put upward pressure on prices. Notably, though, no reliable      data about the size or effect of these two influential groups      has been readily accessible to market participants. I believe      the CFTC should promote greater transparency and market      integrity by regularly providing the public with better data      regarding the role of non-commercial traders in energy and      other markets.       If confirmed, I will work with the Congress to provide the      CFTC with the additional authority it needs to improve the      transparency of the OTC derivatives market. I will also work      with the CFTC staff to use the tools at the agency's disposal      to protect consumers, investors, and farmers by promoting      transparency through more sophisticated data collection and      dissemination.       2. Establish conflict of interest rules and firewalls      limiting energy infrastructure affiliates from communicating      with energy analysts and traders.       I believe we need to adopt a comprehensive plan for the      regulation of over-the-counter derivatives markets. As a key      component of this reform, we should subject all derivatives      dealers to:       conservative capital requirements;       business conduct standards;       record keeping requirements (including an audit trail);       reporting requirements; and       conservative margin requirements.       The CFTC should have the authority to protect against      fraud, manipulation, excessive speculation, and other market      abuses within the OTC derivatives markets, including all      energy derivatives, and by the derivatives dealers.       Working with the Congress, such authorities to subject      dealers to business conduct standards and to protect against      market abuses could include the establishment of rules      relating to conflicts of interest. If confirmed, I look      forward to working with other Federal agencies and the      Congress to achieve these objectives.       3. (a) Work with the Federal Reserve to prohibit bank      holding companies from trading in energy commodity      derivatives markets and owning energy infrastructure assets.       Given the recent changes in the structure and composition      of the financial and energy industries this is an important      issue. Generally, I believe the CFTC must be ever vigilant in      its oversight to protect the public against fraud,      manipulation, excessive speculation, and other market abuses      in the energy, agricultural and financial commodity markets.      As described in my answers above, we need to adopt a      comprehensive plan for the regulation of over-the-counter      derivatives--including those trading energy derivatives. This      should subject all dealers, including those held by bank      holding companies, to a robust regime of prudential      supervision and regulation. More specifically, I believe that      derivatives dealers, including those held by bank holding      companies, should be subject to business conduct standards as      described in Question 2, and speculative position limits as      described below in Question 3(b).       If confirmed, I look forward to working with the Federal      Reserve, other regulators, the Administration, and the      Congress on this important issue.       (b) The CFTC should promulgate rules to make sure that all      bank holding companies that engage in derivatives trading are      subject to speculation limits.       A transparent and consistent playing field for all physical      commodity futures should be the foundation of the CFTC's      regulations. Position limits must be applied consistently      across all markets, across all trading platforms, and      exemptions to them must be limited and well defined.       As part of the comprehensive plan described above, the CFTC      should be provided with authority to set position limits on      all OTC derivatives to prevent manipulation and excessive      speculation. Such position limit authority should clearly      empower the CFTC to establish aggregate position limits      across markets in order to ensure that traders are not able      to avoid position limits in a market by moving to a related      exchange or market.       If confirmed by the Senate, I will ask the CFTC staff to      undertake a review of all outstanding hedge exemptions, to      consider the appropriateness of these exemptions, and to      evaluate potential practices for instituting regular review      and increased reporting by exemption-holders.       4. Mr. Gensler should work to promulgate regulations within      3 months to require hedge funds that are engaged in      derivatives trading to register with the CFTC.       The Administration has proposed that all advisers to hedge      funds (and other private pools of capital, including private      equity funds and venture capital funds) whose assets under      management exceed a certain threshold should be required to      register. If confirmed, I will work closely with the Congress      to pass legislation that will mandate registration of hedge      fund advisers as part of a comprehensive package of      regulatory reform. In addition, if confirmed, I will work      with the agency staff to review all previously granted      exemptions from registration as commodity pool operators.       Furthermore, as part of the comprehensive reform of the      derivatives market, the CFTC should have the authority to      police all activities in the OTC derivatives markets--     including transactions entered into by hedge funds. If      confirmed, I look forward to working with other Federal      agencies and the Congress to achieve these objectives.       6. Mr. Gensler should support revoking all ``no-action''      letters for Foreign Boards of Trade that solicit or accept      business from the U.S.       I support actions to close the ``London Loophole'' and      ensure that foreign futures     exchanges with permanent trading terminals in the U.S. comply      with the position limitations and reporting and transparency      requirements that are applied to trades made on U.S.      exchanges. Furthermore, I believe any foreign futures      exchanges that have terminals in the United States to which      our investors have access and whose contracts are based on      the same underlying commodities should have consistent      regulation applied, including position limits.       If confirmed by the Senate, I look forward to working with      the Congress to give the CFTC unambiguous authority to      promulgate rules and standards to achieve these goals. Such      rules and standards governing treatment of Foreign Boards of      Trade should replace the issuance of ``no-action'' letters in      this regard.
