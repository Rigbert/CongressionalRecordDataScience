Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I wish to commend Army Reserve Private First Class Nathan Stahl for his bravery in the field of battle and his willingness to fight for his country. In January 2004 Private Stahl was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment fromFort Lewis, Washington. Private First Class Stahl lost his life on Tuesday, September 21, 2004 in central Iraq when his vehicle was struck by an explosive device. His sacrifice will be remembered at funeral services on Friday, October 1, 2004 by a community that has been struck hard by the devastating loss of one of its own.  A native of Highland, Indiana, Private Nathan E. Stahl graduated from Highland High School. Private Stahl loved documentary-style war movies and dreamed of becoming a United States Army Ranger. As a teen, he joined the Civil Air Patrol Air Force Academy. Private Stahl enlisted in the army before his high school graduation, and the experience he gained from the Civil Air Patrol immediately earned him the rank of Private First Class out of basic training.  It came as no surprise to those who knew Private Stahl that he would serve his country. A true patriot, his love for his country was evident from the time that he was a child. He wanted to help make a difference in the world. At the age of 13 he insisted he and his mother talk with Army recruiters. He left for basic training at 19. Private Stahl wanted to be a hero. Despite the danger, Private Stahl's mother signed her son's release papers because she knew it was what he wanted. He was initially sent to the airborne infantry for training but they found an opening for him in the United States Army Rangers and he was ecstatic. Private Stahl felt tremendous pride for his country, and he was willing to endanger his own life to protect the lives of his fellow citizens. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled. He gave his life so that the freedoms and values that he treasured could be enjoyed by those around the world.  Although he loved his unit and his country, Private Stahl treasured his family above all else. He is survived by his mother and stepfather, Towina and Rodney Nightingale, his father and stepmother, Max and Virginia Stahl, and two sisters, Nicole and Abigail. Private Stahl will also be deeply missed by his fiancee Tiffany Metzler, who is currently serving in the United States Army. These individuals were the heroes to a man that we will forever call a hero, and we should honor them in this tumultuous moment as well.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Reserve Private First Class Nathan E. Stahl. He will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country. Let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
