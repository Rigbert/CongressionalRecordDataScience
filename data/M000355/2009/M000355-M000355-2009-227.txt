 President. I would like to recognize a courageous Kentuckian, David C. Parrish, Jr., for his induction into the Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame on October 17, 2009. Sixty-five years ago this past August, Mr. Parrish undertook brave actions during his service as a fighter pilot during World War II. A native of Paris, KY, Mr. Parrish represented the very best in courage, gallantry, and self-sacrifice in defense of this Nation in the skies west of Paris, France. Like many of America's ``greatest generation,'' Mr. Parrish was willing to disregard his own safety for the safety of his fellow airmen and the protection of his country.  Valor and sacrifice are words that describe the nature of Mr. Parrish, and patience would also describe his character. Although he was recommended for the Silver Star in August 1944, lost records and bureaucratic delays meant it would take 60 years for Mr. Parrish's heroism to be officially recognized. It was my deep privilege to work with Mr. Parrish in this effort and to personally present him with his Silver Star in his hometown in 2004. I believe Mr. Parrish's story is a timely reminder of the sacrifices that so many American men and women have made in the name of freedom.  Mr. President, I would like to share with you a retelling of Mr. Parrish's actions in defense of this Nation that earned him the Silver Star and his induction into the Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame. On August 8, 1944, 1LT David C. Parrish, Jr., was flying in the area of Mortain, France. His flight was part of an eight-plane squadron that became separated from the lead flight while on patrol. Lieutenant Parrish and three others were on their way home when the controller reported 100 enemy fighters flying above him and toward American bombers. His wingman had to fly home because he was low on fuel. Lieutenant Parrish and the remaining two fighters climbed toward the enemy planes.  Lieutenant Parrish was also low on gas and would have normally returned to base, being so outnumbered by enemy fighters. However, recognizing the danger to the friendly bombers, Lieutenant Parrish dove his three fighters into the heart of the enemy formation. The enemy fighters dispersed and Lieutenant Parrish and his fellow airmen gave chase. Lieutenant Parrish pursued one enemy fighter at 4,000 feet and destroyed it. He then turned toward another enemy fighter flying at tree top level and eventually was able to force the enemy pilot to bail out. These pursuits were extremely hazardous, and even more so because Lieutenant Parrish was perilously low on fuel.  It is my great pleasure to recognize Mr. Parrish for the sacrifices and risks he has made for this country, and I would like to congratulate him on his well-deserved induction in the Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame. He has made Kentucky very proud.                          ____________________
