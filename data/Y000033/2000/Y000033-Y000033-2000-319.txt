Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to say one thing to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) and compliment him on his statement. But this is the difference between some of our agencies' attitudes than what the City of New York has done. Because we have the same problem with beetles. We have 47,000 acres of beetles in the Kenai Peninsula that kills every tree down there and we are trying to eliminate the beetle on Federal land, eliminate the beetles and harvest that timber before it burns up our community, and the Federal Government says we cannot do that. To me, that does not make a whole lot of sense.  But I compliment the people in New York for recognizing that if we do not get rid of those beetles, they will keep going and going and going and create a deforested area, which occurred in my district. So I compliment the gentleman from New York.  Mr. Chairman, I do, as I mentioned before, support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues for a loud ``yes'' voice vote in accepting the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
