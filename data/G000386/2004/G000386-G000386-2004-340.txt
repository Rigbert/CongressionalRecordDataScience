  Mr. President, we heard testimony from the other side on the fiscal condition of the U.S. Government, how bad it is and they are sounding alarms. I think all that is very legitimate. I am not here to dispute specific figures, I am not here to say that the other side has been intellectually wrong, but at least to say they have left some misimpressions about some aspects of this budget. I will start with the chart shown about borrowing from foreign countries.
