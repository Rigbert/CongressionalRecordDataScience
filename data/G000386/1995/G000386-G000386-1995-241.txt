 President, I am pleased to introduce the Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995. I believe this bill would provide children with the strongest possible protection from computer pornography. I would like to thank the majority leader for his crucial support of this important piece of legislation. Currently, child molesters and sexual predators use computer networks to locate children and try to entice them into illicit sexual relationships. Accordingly, my bill would make it a crime to knowingly or recklessly transmit indecent pornographic materials to children over computer networks. Some so-called access providers facilitate this by refusing to take action against child molesters, even after other computer users have complained. So, my bill would make it a crime for access providers who are aware of this sort of activity to permit it to continue.  Mr. President, I have carefully drafted this bill so that it will withstand the inevitable court challenge. This bill focuses only on protecting children from material which the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated is harmful to children. The Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995 would not tell any adult what type of computerized material they may view or obtain.  Finally, Mr. President, due to time constraints, I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of my remarks be printed into the Record.Analysis of the Protection of Children From Indecent Pornography Act of                                   1995       At the outset, this initiative, which amends 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1464 (1984), defines several technical terms. For      ``remote computer facility'' and ``electronic communications      service,'' the definitions used in the ``Protection of      Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995'' are taken      from existing sections of the criminal code. Because it was      unclear whether the terms ``remote computer service'' and/or      ``electronic communications service'' would include an      electronic bulletin board, the Grassley initiative creates a      specific definition for electronic bulletin board systems.      This was done to avoid the possibility that electronic      bulletin boards, some of which specialize in providing      pornographic materials, would be exempt from the bill.       Substantively, this creates two distinct criminal offenses.      First, it is a crime to knowingly or recklessly transmit      indecent pornography to minors. The Grassley bill deals      exclusively with indecent pornography provided to children      because there are already federal laws against providing      obscene material and child pornography to anyone, including      children. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252 (Supp. 1994); 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1465 (Supp. 1995). The definition of indecent material      has been established by the Supreme Court and is discussed      below.       Second, the bill would make it a crime for an on-line      service which permits users to access the Internet or      electronic bulletin board to willfully permit an audit to      transmit indecent pornography to a minor. In the criminal      law, ``willful'' has a specific meaning which is uniquely      suited to on-line access providers. See ``Manual of Modern      Criminal Jury Instructions for the Ninth Circuit'' Sec. 5.05      (West 1989). A willfulness standard is more appropriate for      on-line service providers because those services can only      monitor customer communications in narrow circumstances, or      face criminal prosecution for invasion of privacy. See 18      U.S.C. Sec. 2510 (Supp. 1995).       To prove a violation under the bill for permitting adults      to transmit indecent material to children, the Justice      Department would have to show that the access provider was      actually aware that a particular recipient was a child and      that the access provider's customers were using the on-line      service to transmit indecent material to minors. Importantly,      although this burden of proof appears to be high, it could      easily be met by prosecutors, given the current practice.               legal background: the concept of indecency       Basically, there are three categories of sexually explicit      expression which are subject to congressional regulation      notwithstanding the First Amendment. See New York v. Ferber,      458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15      (1973). The Grassley initiative focuses exclusively on      indecent material because existing federal laws largely cover      the transmission of obscene and child pornographic material      in interstate commerce. See U.S.C. Sec. 2252 (Supp. 1995);      U.S.C. Sec. 1465 (Supp. 1995); U.S.C. Sec. 1462 (Supp. 1995).       For present purposes, indecent material can be defined as      depictions of sexual activity or sexual organs which are      patently offensive according to contemporary community      standards. See FCC v. Pacifica, 438 U.S. 726, 732 (1978);      Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 10 F.3d 812 (D.C. Cir.      1993), rehearing en banc granted, 15 F.3d 186 (D.C. Cir.      1994); Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504      (D.C. Cir. 1991). This test is basically the second prong of      the ``Miller Test.'' 413 U.S. 24-25. It is important to note      that while indecent material is not constitutionally      protected for children, indecency is protested for and among      adults. Thus, laws intended to protect children must not      ``reduce the adult population . . . [to viewing] . . . only      what is acceptable to children.'' Butler v. Michigan, 352      U.S. 380, 383 (1957). While some court have applied the      indecency in slightly different ways depending on the medium,      (see Pacifica, supra; Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 492      U.S. 115 (1989)), the central purpose of the indecency      standard is to prohibit or to regulate the display of      patently offensive representations of sexually explicit      material which is openly available to the public. As the      Court stated in Pacifica, see 438 U.S. at 748-49, this means      a medium, like computers, which has ``a uniquely pervasive      presence in the lives of all Americans'' and is ``uniquely      accessible to children'' can be regulated to protect      children.       That is precisely what the ``Protection of Children from      Computer Pornography'' initiative would do--prohibit      transmission of computerized indecent pornography to children      while permitting adults to access otherwise constutitionally      protected material.       In some respects indecency is similar, though not      identical, to the concept of ``harmful to juveniles'' laws,      which exist in nearly every state. These laws prohibit the      sale (and sometimes the display) of certain sexually explicit      material to minors. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629      (1968). In order to determine whether material is harmful to      juveniles, the material must be found to satisfy a three-part      test. One part of this test involves a showing that the      material depicts or describes sexual activity in terms      patently offensive according to contemporary community      standards for what is acceptable for children. In a sense,      the federal indecency standard is designed to protect      children from harmful depictions of sexual activity, similar      to the goal of the harmful to juveniles test.       Traditionally, the federal government has not regulated      extensively to protect children from inappropriate exposure      to pornography because it is primarily a matter of local      concern. With the rise of global, international computer      networks, however, it has become clear that Congress has a      more extensive role to play in protecting children. The      Grassley initiative responds to this changed environment by      ``filing in the gaps'' created by new technology.
