 Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not new. The gentleman from Wisconsin offers this amendment every year. This is his annual amendment of how we gut the GPO. Annually we say, ``Oh, it's not going to be a problem.'' The fact of the matter is that this is an over 10 percent reduction. It is going to be approximately 50 plus 350, 400. It is going to require RIFs.  I regret that the chairman, somewhat in my opinion, cavalierly accepts this amendment. This is not a small cut. This is a cut on top of, as the gentlewoman from Maryland indicated, 1,000 employees out of 4,500 employees over the last 4 years.  They are not dairy farmers. So if we no longer stop buying milk or have price supports or anything of that nature, who cares? But these people are going to be put out on the street. We have gone from 8,000 down to 3,600 in 20 years. We have done 25 percent of that in the last 4 years.  The fact of the matter is, if we want GPO to do something different, then let us pass legislation and mandate that. If we want them to be, I tell my chairman, financially solvent, then have the Congress pay its bills. Have the Congress pay fair market value for the product it gets from GPO and I guarantee that they will show a profit.  I ask my chairman to go over to GPO. They have as modern a capability in information technology as there is in Washington. Period. They are on line and on top of it.  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. This amendment, I will tell the chairman, will cost the government money. It costs approximately $25,000 to $35,000 per RIFed employee. This amendment will cost us, not save us. Reject the Klug amendment.
