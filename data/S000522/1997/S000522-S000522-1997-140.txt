Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I want to commend my friend for his amendment. I served as ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere for a couple of terms. It was very apparent that Latin America often got short-shrifted and did not get its fair share of developmental aid.  In the heyday of the Nicaraguan and El Salvadoran crisis, the Contras and all of that, all of a sudden everybody cared about Central America. When that was over, it seemed a lot of people just wanted to look elsewhere. I think the amendment is a good step in the right direction, and in Asia as well. I thank the gentleman for his amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey Mr. Menendez.  The amendment was agreed to.              Amendment offered by Mr. Smith of New Jersey
