President, everybody, whether we supported Donald Trump or not--and, obviously, I did not--wants to give any President a chance to bring this country together. Throughout the country, during this campaign, we have become terribly divided. Even in my own State of Vermont, we heard of some of these divisions.  I feel fortunate that Vermonters reelected me. I have never run negative campaign ads, and did not this time. I was opposed by somebody who ran a completely negative campaign. I think people reject negativity. There are so many positive aspects to America. We talk about making America greatagain, and there is no other country we would trade it for. What country would we trade our country for? None. We are a great nation. But what makes us great is our diversity and our ability to come together. That is what we should be doing.  I hope the President-elect will reconsider naming Stephen Bannon as his chief White House strategist and understand what kind of signal this sends to the country. We do not need more division. We certainly do not need people who might attack someone because of their religion. We need people who will realize the United States is an inclusive country, not an exclusive country. This is not the message we should send within our own country or throughout the world.  Mr. Bannon wants to continue making these horrible and offensive comments, as he has a First Amendment right to do at Breitbart News, but let us not have that be the example set from the White House, by the President of the greatest nation on Earth.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
