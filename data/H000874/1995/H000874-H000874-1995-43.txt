Speaker, I have that copy as well. I will not object, but simply reiterate that I want to make it clear, because she says that I question her abilities or her abilities have been questioned, I do not question that. There are some other things in the letter with which I disagree. But I think she has set forth her case, and I think it is appropriate that it be in the Record at this time.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
