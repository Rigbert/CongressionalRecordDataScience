Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor a warrior for civil rights and social justice, a veteran of the modern-day Civil Rights Movement, a resident of the 5th Congressional District, and a friend. In a few days, we in Georgia will be honoring the life of the Reverend Dr. Cordy Tindell Vivian, better known as C.T. Vivian, who will turn 85 years old on July 30, 2009.  Born in 1924, Vivian grew up in Macomb, Illinois and was raised by his mother and grandmother. Even though Illinois was not segregated by law, C.T. Vivian was keenly aware that the customs and traditions of racism and discrimination pervaded his life. As a young man Vivian wanted to find a way to make an impact on society, so after leaving college he began working with youth at Carver Community Center in Peoria, Illinois. As a young man deeply influenced by the church and the visionary faith of his grandmother and mother, Vivian recognized the power of nonviolence as a tool for social change. He joined a successful non-violent movement in Peoria in 1947 to integrate restaurants in the city, which brought down barriers in all public eating establishments throughout the city.  In 1955, C.T. Vivian was called to the ministry and enrolled in what would some years later become my alma mater, American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee. That same year, he began working with a new subdivision of Martin Luther King Jr.'s organization established by the Rev. Kelly Miller Smith called the Nashville Christian Leadership Conference. The NCLC began training Nashville college students in the discipline and philosophy of non-violence and was involved in organizing the first student sit-ins and marches in the city in 1960.  Vivian's experiences in Peoria helped provide leadership for student organizers in Nashville, and in 1961, he joined the FreedomRides, after the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) had suspended their efforts. One bus had been set on fire in Anniston, Alabama. Freedom Riders had been surrounded by an angry mob in a church in Montgomery, Alabama. Attorney General Robert Kennedy had called in the National Guard to protect riders traveling from Montgomery to Jackson, Mississippi. CORE suspended its efforts to test the desegregation of interstate transportation. In spite of these dangers, Vivian joined a new attempt to renew the rides on a bus trip from Nashville to Jackson. Martin Luther King Jr. asked Vivian to join the executive staff of his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He worked with SCLC campaigns in St. Augustine, Florida; Danville, Virginia; and Chicago, Illinois. Vivian was in Birmingham in 1963, participated in the Mississippi Freedom Summer Project in 1964 and came to Selma in 1965.  In Selma, he worked with the voter registration efforts that the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee already had in progress, and would serve as a lead protestor, persistently confronting Sheriff Jim Clark on the steps of the Selma, Alabama courthouse at the head of a band of non-violent marchers seeking to register and vote. He was arrested and jailed in Selma several times.  In February 1965, Vivian was a speaker at a non-violent, peaceful night-time rally meant to support protestors jailed in Marion, Alabama. The marchers were ambushed by a violent posse who killed military veteran and Marion native Jimmie Lee Jackson. Efforts to commemorate Jackson's death ultimately became the historic Selma to Montgomery march which culminated in the passage of the Voting Rights Act. The act opened up more free and fair access to the ballot box for all African Americans, as well as other Americans of color, and it resulted in the election of literally thousands of black elected officials in subsequent years, including the first African American president of the United States, Barack Obama.  Following the death of Martin Luther King Jr., Vivian formed an organization dedicated to the training of African American youth called Vision, which ultimately became known as Upward Bound, an educational program that provides college students with scholarships. After working with SCLC, Vivian organized campaigns against racism and advocated for racial justice. He has worked to found other organizations, including the Black Action Strategies and Information Center, the Center for Democratic Renewal, and the C.T. Vivian Leadership Institute, all based in Atlanta. In 2008 he led the Yes We Care campaign, which contributed over $500,000 to Morris Brown University, a fiscally challenged historically black university in the city. He is the author of Black Power and the American Myth.  The Rev. Dr. C.T. Vivian has served as an inspiring leader, an electrifying minister, and a force for good in our society. As a participant in the modem-day Civil Rights Movement, he successfully implemented the discipline and philosophy of non-violent social resistance that helped to transform America forever. For this role, C.T. Vivian must be seen as one of the authors of a new chapter in American history that hastens the advent of a society based on simple justice that values the dignity and the worth of every human being, or the Beloved Community. For his eloquence, insight, vision, persistence, determination and courage, we commemorate the service of C.T. Vivian on his 85th birthday.                          ____________________
