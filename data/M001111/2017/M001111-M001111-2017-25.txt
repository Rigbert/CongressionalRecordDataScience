 President, Republicans have now put forward proposal after proposal to rip protections away from Americans with preexisting conditions. This amendment is yet another example of Republican efforts to increase costs for people who need healthcare the most. It would put insurance companies back in charge. It would allow them to deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions or discriminate against them by charging higher premiums.  This repeals the essential health benefits, rips away access to critical services like maternity care, mental health, and substance use disorder treatment, and repeals the requirement that coverage be available to dependents under the age of 26.  Americans have rejected this crass partisan proposal. It is long past time to focus on bipartisan proposals like the one that Senator Alexander and I announced today that actually protects people with preexisting conditions while bringing down premiums for patients and family.  I urge a ``no'' vote.
