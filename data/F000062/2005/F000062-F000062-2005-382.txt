 President, I rise today to introduce the Public Lands Corps Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2005. I am introducing this bill with Senators Domenici and Bingaman, whose cosponsorship I greatly appreciate. I also understand that Congressmen Greg Walden and Tom Udall are introducing an identical version of the bill in the House, which I also appreciate.  This bill authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with qualified corps to perform appropriate conservation projects, assist governments and Indian tribes in performing research and public education associated with natural and cultural resources, introduce young people to public service and expand their educational opportunities, and stimulate interest among the Nation's youth in careers in conservation and land management.  Consistent with the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, this bill also identifies a series of priority projects for corps to carry out including the restoration and protection of public lands threatened by severe fire, insect or disease infestation or other damaging agents; the protection, restoration, or enhancement of forest ecosystem components to promote the recovery of threatened and endangered species; the improvement of biological diversity; and, the enhancement of productivity and carbon sequestration.  In general, the Secretaries may give a preference to those corps that enroll young people who are economically, physically, or educationally disadvantaged. When it comes to the priority projects, the Secretaries shall ``to the maximum extent practicable'' give preference to those corps that have a substantial number of members who are disadvantaged. It also allows the Secretaries to grant noncompetitive hiring status to corps alumni for future Federal hiring. Finally, the bill authorizes $15 million a year, of which $10 million is for the priority projects identified in the bill and $5 million is for nonpriority projects.  I have named this legislation the Public Lands Corps Healthy Forests Restoration Act because it builds on both the Public Lands Corps Act of 1993 and the recently enacted Healthy Forest Restoration Act. I also want to note that last year the administration supported an earlier, but substantially similar, version of this bill.  This bill uses the cost saving resources of youth corps to carry out projects. It is estimated that youth corps generate $1.60 in immediate benefits for every dollar in costs. This figure is important given both the great need and great costs associated with fighting fires. The Federal Government is responsible for overseeing 689 million acres of land and five Federal agencies reported spending $1.6 billion in 2002 on fire fighting suppression efforts--a whopping $300 million more than the previous record.  As an example of what can happen in one State, consider 2003's catastrophic wildfires in southern California. Before these wildfires were contained, they scorched a total of 739,597 acres, killed 24 people, and destroyed approximately 3,631 homes and thousands of other structures. Not only did insurance payouts cost more than $3 billion, but public expenditures for firefighting and recovery ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars. And California is certainly not the only State to incur large costs from fires.  I want to reduce the chances of this type of catastrophe recurring in the future. To do so, we must use every resource at our disposal. I know that youth service and conversation corps can play a significant role in reducing the physical and financial strain that public land management agencies bear, and help protect our Nation's public lands from wildfires and other forms of devastation.  I have seen firsthand the benefits that service and conservation corps bring to communities and the difference that they make in the lives of disadvantaged youth. In 1983, I founded the first urban youth corps as mayor of San Francisco, and during that time I saw a great improvement in the quality of life of the corps members and of the city itself. When the program started, it had a million-dollar budget and employed 36 disadvantaged young people 18 to 23 years old. They needed some direction, wanted a challenge, and to make themselves socially useful.  That first year, we paid corps members $3.35 an hour to repair bathrooms in affordable housing for senior citizens and others, build a park in Hunter's Point, clear scotch broom from the Twin Peaks hillside, and fix up Alcatraz Island. In the subsequent 22 years, the San Francisco Conservation Corps, SFCC, has grown into a multisite, multifaceted agency that engages more than 500 young adults annually who have completed over 3.5 million hours of community service.  The San Francisco Conservation Corps has also given thousands of corps members a sense of personal pride, helped connect them with their community, and prove that hard work pays off. I started the corps to help young people break out of the cycle of poverty and crime and improve their job skills by giving them guidance and support through labor-intensive activities.  I am introducing this bill with the hope that the success of the San Francisco Conservation Corps can be duplicated nationwide. This program will not reach every disadvantaged young person in need of guidance and a second chance. But it is a start, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1238       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to permit the Indian Health Service, an Indian tribe, a tribal organization, or an urban Indian organization to pay the monthly part D premium of eligible medicare beneficiaries; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the American Indian Elderly and Disabled Access to Health Care Act of 2005 to revise the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.  The legislation I introduce today will amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to permit the Indian Health Service, an Indian tribe, tribal or Urban Indian organization to use their funding to pay the Medicare Part D premiums of eligible Indian beneficiaries. These premium payments are for the American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in the prescription drug plans under part D of title XVIll of the Social Security Act. Currently, these funds can be used for paying Medicare Parts A and B premiums but not Part D, and this legislation will enable eligible Indian beneficiaries to enroll and participate in the Part D program when it begins in January, 2006.  Mr. President, this legislation will increase the ability of the elderly and disabled American Indians and Alaska Natives to access the prescription drug benefits available under Medicare Part D and assist the Indian Health Service in achieving potentially significant cost savings. I urge my colleagues to join me in improving access to health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1239       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``American Indian Elderly and      Disabled Access to Health Care Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. PAYMENT OF MEDICARE MONTHLY PART D PREMIUM.       (a) In General.--Section 404 of the Indian Health Care      Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1644) is amended by adding at the      end the following new subsection:       ``(d) Payment of Monthly Part D Premium Under the Medicare      Program.--       ``(1) Payment of monthly part d premium.--The Service, an      Indian tribe, a tribal organization, or an urban Indian      organization may use appropriated funds or funds collected      pursuant to the authority granted in this title to pay the      monthly beneficiary premium (as determined under section      1860D-13 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-113) of      an eligible medicare beneficiary enrolled in a prescription      drug plan or an MA-PD plan under part D of title XVIII of      such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-101 et seq.).       ``(2) Considerations.--In deciding whether to pay the      premium of an eligible medicare beneficiary under paragraph      (1), the Indian Health Service, Indian tribe, tribal      organization, or urban Indian organization shall consider the      cost effectiveness of paying such premium for such      individual, taking into account--       ``(A) the beneficiary's expected drug utilization; and       ``(B) other factors that the Service, Indian tribe, tribal      organization, or urban Indian organization determines      appropriate for the purpose of determining the cost      effectiveness of paying such premium.       ``(3) Eligible beneficiary defined.--The term `eligible      medicare beneficiary' means an individual who--       ``(A) is an Indian;       ``(B) is a part D eligible individual (as defined in      section 1860D-1(a)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act (42      U.S.C. 1395w-101(a)(3)(A))); and       ``(C) is not a subsidy eligible individual who receives a      full premium subsidy under 1860D-14(a)(1)(A) of such Act (42      U.S.C. 1395w-114(a)(1)(A)).''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section      shall apply to monthly beneficiary premium payments made with      respect to months beginning on or after January 1, 2006.                                 ______                                       By
