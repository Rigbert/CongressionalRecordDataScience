President, I rise today to introduce the Counterfeiting and Money Laundering Deterrence Act of 1995.  Counterfeit money is the cheap way for terrorists to fund their activities around the world. The opening of the trial in New York of the accused terrorists, who allegedly threatened to blow up the United Nations, FBI Headquarters, and other sites, serves as a reminder that our Nation is not immune to such activities. This bill outlines steps we should take to combat both the counterfeiting of our currency and the laundering of the estimated $300 billion per year of ill-gotten profits from drugs, arms smuggling, and other crimes.  [[Page S1859]] This legislation, which Senator Kerry and I also introduced in the last Congress, would accomplish two objectives: First, it would bring our $100 currency up to date and stop letting counterfeiters have a free meal ticket. Second, it would put the squeeze on drug trafficking organizations that have to launder vast sums of money to operate--making their costs of doing business significantly higher and hopefully turning piles of their money into worthless paper.                       counterfeiting deterrence  The currency of this country faces a serious challenge from new technologies that enable counterfeiters to turn out excellent reproductions. According to the Secret Service, overseas counterfeiting of U.S. currency has increased dramatically. For example, from 1992 to 1993, counterfeit currency detected abroad increased 300 percent.  A number of analysts believe the threat to the U.S. currency is urgent. News reports say that intelligence experts in the United States and Israel are aware of a highly skilled group of counterfeiters operating out of Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. These counterfeiters, controlled by Syria and Iran, have turned out as much as $1 billion of extremely high-quality reproductions of the United States $100 bill.  We must be very concerned with what nations like Iran or Syria can do with $1 billion in bogus United States currency so convincing that it can be passed onto the international market. Would these poor countries use this money to purchase sophisticated weaponry that challenges the security of the region or of this country? Would they use this currency in an effort to destabilize U.S. currency? Would they use it to fund smaller scale but still serious terrorist activities throughout the world? No one knows.  The opening of the Russian Republics and the Eastern Bloc has also resulted in increased counterfeiting activity. Because the situation is changing in this part of the world so fast, it is difficult to determine the amount of counterfeiting that occurs there. According to the chief of the Russian Interior Ministry's Department of Economic Crimes, the amount of counterfeit United States currency confiscated by Russian authorities increased 10 times from 1992 to 1993. With organized crime increasingly taking hold in the Republics, counterfeiting has become a national cottage industry according to Moscow news reports. Because of mounting inflation of the ruble, foreign currency such as the U.S. $100 bill has a special place in that country's economic system, making it particularly attractive to counterfeiting.  What makes this situation all the more pressing is that the U.S. currency is among the most easy to counterfeit in the world. Although recently updated with a deterrent polyester strip, our bills do not use the watermarks or sophisticated dying and engraving techniques that other countries employ to make it difficult to reproduce their bills convincingly. Nor do we change the appearance of our currency from time-to-time to discourage counterfeiters as other countries do.  To address this threat, this legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury to design a new $100 bill that incorporates some of the counterfeit-resistant features that other countries have adopted. The Treasury Department has already done substantial design work on a new $100 bill, and it is the intention of this legislation to permit the Secretary to draw on that work in meeting the requirements of the act.                      money laundering deterrence  But aside from bringing our currency into modern times to address state-of-the-art counterfeiting technology, this legislation is designed to put a full court press on money laundering. We need to realize that the international drug industry is a multibillion-dollar, highly sophisticated enterprise. A single undercover operation in which Federal agents operated a fake bank to launder money recently netted $52 million in cash and assets. If we are really going to stop international drug trafficking and terrorist activities, we need to focus more on stopping the ease with which those organizations move their money internationally to finance their crimes.  My bill strikes two blows against money launderers. First, the bill requires all existing $100 denomination U.S. currency to be exchanged within a 6-month period. This would make drug traffickers who hoard vast amounts of hard currency hard-pressed to convert their existing cash into the new money. If they cannot convert the money within the specified time frame, their funds become worthless under the bill. Even if drug organizations could somehow convert their money within the exchange period, the likelihood of their being traced by currency transaction reporting increases substantially, as does the cost of laundering their ill-gotten gains. Of course, there is an exception for hardship cases in the bill where money has not been derived from unlawful activity.  Second, the bill establishes two new versions of the $100 bill: One for use at home and one for use abroad. The only business that relies on exporting large amounts of hard currency is drug trafficking. This provision would make money smuggled out of the United States worthless, turning the tables on drug traffickers who covertly move money from the streets of this country to foreign banks who launder it without reporting illicit transactions to the Treasury.  A U.S. citizen traveling abroad who wished to bring $100 currency with him would hardly be inconvenienced by this measure: A quick stop at a U.S. bank to convert their greenbacks into differently colored foreign-use bills would be all that is necessary--just like purchasing travelers' checks. The only ones inconvenienced would be drug traffickers who would hate to exchange their greenbacks for foreign-use currency at a U.S. bank because of currency transaction reporting requirements.  To the extent drug traffickers cannot exchange their $100 bills within the timeframe and they become worthless, this is a debt against the U.S. Treasury that can be written off to finance the costs of this legislation, and further, to pay off other obligations of the U.S. Treasury.                let's begin a discussion on these issues  I know there will be opposition from some quarters to this proposal. The Federal Reserve likes the current situation and believes the good-old, easily copied $100 bill provides welcome stability to the international monetary system. The banks feel burdened by the currency transaction reporting requirements. Adding new counterfeit-resistant features to bills is not costless. The Drug Enforcement Administration supports the concept but some there would prefer to go further and establish domestic and foreign use versions of all our currency.  Let us begin a serious discussion and debate on the steps we should take to address high-technology counterfeiting and money laundering. If this proposal is not the best way to go, then let's work to fashion a measure that will take strong steps against these threats. I am not comfortable with the current situation: We face the threat of potentially billions of passable counterfeit U.S. dollars going into the hands of terrorists. We must do more to cripple the big business of drug trafficking. Continuing to put our collective heads in the sand will not suffice. I encourage my colleagues and the relevant agencies and others with expertise in these areas to consider and take the steps necessary to address these important issues.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Summary of the Counterfeiting and Money Laundering Deterrence Act of                                   1995       Section 1. The short title of the bill is the      ``Counterfeiting and Money Laundering Deterrence Act of      1995.''       Section 2. Findings and Purposes. Congressional findings      are summarized and the purposes of the bill to combat      counterfeiting and money laundering are described.       Section 3. Counterfeit-Resistant $100 Denomination      Currency.       The bill amends Title 31, United States Code, with new      section 5123 to require the Secretary of the Treasury, in      consultation with the Attorney General and the Administrator      of the Drug Enforcement Administration, to design and      designate new counterfeit-resistant $100 bills for domestic      and foreign use within 6 months of enactment.       The new bills must have counterfeit-deterring features such      as watermarks, multi-colored dyes, holograms, sophisticated      engraving techniques etc.       [[Page S1860]] The domestic use bills would be legal tender      only in the U.S.; the foreign use bills would be legal tender      abroad only. The two types of money could be exchanged at      banks subject to U.S. currency transaction reporting      requirements only. The domestic use bills have distinctly      different coloring from the foreign use bills. This means      money smuggled out of the country to be laundered at offshore      banks that do not engage in currency transaction reporting      would be worthless.       A 6-month currency exchange period would begin one year      from the date of enactment. Old $100 bills must be exchanged      for new domestic or foreign use $100 bills within this 6-     month period, or they become worthless. The bill includes a      process for extending the exchange period for hardship cases.       The currency exchange must occur at banks regulated by U.S.      currency transaction reporting and anti-money laundering laws      or at foreign banks that the Secretary of the Treasury finds      by treaty or agreement abide by currency transaction      reporting laws.       The Act would be financed by using credits obtained from      extinguishing the Treasury's liability for $100 bills not      exchanged within the exchange period. Additional credits so      generated would be returned to the general fund.       Section 4. Notice of Currency Exchange Period. The      Secretary must begin notifying foreign and domestic      governments and financial institutions of the upcoming      exchange period within 6 months of enactment.                                 ______      By
