I ask this question in good faith because I think we should have this dialogue.  Step aside from the argument about whether we should have abortion at all, and go to the first two points; that thisprocedure is never medically necessary and is especially risky.  Before I was elected to Congress, I used to practice law as a trial lawyer in medical malpractice cases.  I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, why would any physician subject themselves to a medical malpractice case if the two points that the Senator made are so obvious; that is, this procedure is never medically necessary, and it is more dangerous than other procedures for the mother? Why in the world would they ever take the risk of a lawsuit by using this procedure unless they believe they could justify that it is medically necessary and that in effect it was the safest procedure for the mother to use?
