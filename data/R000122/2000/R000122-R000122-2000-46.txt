President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Durbin on an amendment to restore funding to one of our most accomplished public health initiatives, our national immunization program.  The purpose of the amendment is quite simple--it seeks to strengthen and enhance the operations and infrastructure grants administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Section 317 immunization program.  These monies fund a variety of essential programs and services within the immunization program for children, including outreach efforts to educate parents about the immunization schedule, training and education of providers about new vaccines and outbreak control when cases of infectious diseases arise. The CDC's operation and infrastructure grants also support vital initiatives to identify under-immunized children, provide resources necessary to implement and maintain state-based immunization registries and allow the state immunization program to forge linkages with other public health services, such as WIC and Head Start, since these places are often points of entry for low-income children who may lack all or some of the recommended vaccinations.  Originally, Senator Durbin and I had intended to offer an amendment that would add a total of $75 million for the CDC Section 317 operations and infrastructure grant program. We have modified our amendment so that it now calls for a $37.5 million increase in funding for these grants this year with the understanding that Chairman Specter has agreed to work to provide additional $37.5 million in FY 2002 for this grant program. I would thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for agreeing to accept this important amendment.  Numerous public health and provider groups including the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the American Academy of Pediatrics and every Child by Two, just to name a few support our amendment.  Since the advent of the polio vaccine in 1955, the United States has invested in a national immunization campaign to rid the population of devastating diseases such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria and measles.  The CDC Section 317 program has been an integral part of our national immunization initiative. The Section 317 program can be broken down into two main categories--(1) vaccine purchase and (2) infrastructure to facilitate the delivery and monitoring of vaccines. The Section 317 program is the only source of critical federal funding to support the infrastructure necessary to administer immunizations to children in communities throughout the country.  A little over a week ago, the Institute of Medicine released their report on immunization finance policies and practices. This report was conducted at the request of the Senate Appropriations Committee and more specifically by our colleague Senator Dale Bumpers, a long-time champion of the immunization program.  This landmark report offers us many important insights into the complex federal-state-local partnership that makes up our national immunization initiative. The report found that although average immunization coverage levels are at record highs, several problems continue to plague the program, while even greater challenges lie ahead. The issues threaten the great success we have achieved in essentially eradicating deadly and debilitating diseases that were prevalent in this country a relatively short time ago. Many of these same diseases continue to strike children in developing nations throughout the world.  According to the IOM report, one of the greatest challenges currently facing our immunization program is the persistent disparities in coverage that exist among and within states, as well as within major cities.  The 1998 National Immunization Survey (NIS) found a gap of between 7 and 8.6 percent between the immunization rates for non-Hispanic white children and those of Hispanic and African-American children for one of the most important series of immunizations. Disparities in immunization levels also fall along the poverty line. For the same series, National Immunization Survey found a 9 percentage point difference between the immunization rates for children living below the poverty level compared to those at or above the poverty line.  These disparities in coverage are often found in concentrations of un-immunized and under-immunized children who typically reside in urban areas as well as in certain rural areas. These areas are also referred to as `pockets of need'.  Our investments in the immunization program thus far have yielded great benefits in terms of improving the health of children, as well as producing significant health care cost savings. For example, for every dollar spent on the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine, $10.30 in savings were captured in terms of direct medical costs and $13.50 in indirect societal costs, such as lost work time, disability and death.  While great progress has been made in boosting immunization coverage nationally, we are at a point where it will require additional resources in order to reach those remaining children who have not been immunized. In other words, reaching these remaining un-immunized and under-immunized children in `pockets of need' areas, will require more effort and more resources.  Another significant problem outlined in the IOM report is the, ``The repetitive ebb and flow cycles in the distribution of public resources for immunization programs . . .'' Federal funding for the immunization program has been volatile, particularly over the past decade.  To give my colleagues some background, the federal government began to pay greater attention to the need to support and strengthen our immunization program after a measles outbreak struck several parts of the U.S. in 1989-1990. Following the epidemic, the CDC launched a national initiative designed to strengthen state immunization programs and provide resources for a broad array of direct services and outreach. The goal of this effort was to strengthen and enhance our capacity to monitor immunization levels and improve our ability to respond to disease outbreaks.  During that period, federal funding for infrastructure grants increased seven-fold from a total of $37 million in 1990 to $271 million in 1995. However, states were not immediately prepared for the dramatic funding increases and the expansion of immunization delivery systems at the state level took time. As a result, funds were ``carried over'' from one year to the next as states prepared to make the capital investments necessary to strengthen critical areas of their immunization program, such as vaccine delivery, outreach into underserved areas and improvements in monitoring through the development of state-based immunization registries.  However, as the threat of another disease outbreak faded, carry-over fund balances grew and pressure to reduce federal discretionary spending intensified here in Congress. What happened as a result was an almost 50 percent decline in funding, and for the past two years, the CDC infrastructure grant program has been level funded at $139 million.  For the past few years, states have been using remaining carry-over funds to cover expenses that could not be met by their new award. The estimated FY 2001 figures indicate that most states have exhausted their carry-over funding and must rely solely on their new grant award to finance their operations.  This cut has seriously eroded states' ability to develop and implement program innovations and threatened their capacity to administer vaccines. These reductions over the past several yearshave also forced states to scale back on other important activities such as community outreach, parental and physician education and the development and operation of registries.  This reduction in the operations and infrastructure grant awards has had a significant impact on my home state of Rhode Island. My state has gone from a high of approximately $3 million to a low of $500,000 in just four years. These kinds of swings in funding make it virtually impossible for a state to administer its program, let alone plan ahead for the future.  And these dramatic declines have not only happened in my state--they have happened in virtually every state in the country.  Fortunately, my state has been extremely successful thus far in expanding immunization coverage rates in the nation (89%). However, continued vigilance is necessary to maintain coverage rates in states like Rhode Island, while additional effort and resources are required to bring up immunization rates in areas like Chicago (69%) and Houston (56%).  Mr. President, we must remain diligent and focused on our immunization goals and invest in the tools necessary to protect our children. This additional funding will help to achieve that end by restoring immunization grant awards to a level that will enable states to carry out critical program activities. As I mentioned before, our amendment would add $37.5 million over two years to the CDC operations and infrastructure grant program.  The IOM report makes clear that our immunization system is at a critical juncture, and I am pleased that Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin have agreed to accept our amendment because we should not wait for a serious outbreak to a vaccine-preventable disease to address the shortfall in the CDC immunization program.                           amendment no. 3710   (Purpose: To require that contracts for the care of research NIH    chimpanzees be awarded to contractors that comply with the Animal                               Welfare Act)       At the appropriate place, add the following: ``None of the      funds appropriated under this Act shall be expended by the      National Institutes of Health on a contract for the care of      the 288 chimpanzees acquired by the National Institutes of      Health from the Coulston Foundation, unless the contractor is      accredited by the Association for the Assessment and      Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International or has      a Public Health Services assurance, and has not been charged      multiple times with egregious violations of the Animal      Welfare Act.''.
