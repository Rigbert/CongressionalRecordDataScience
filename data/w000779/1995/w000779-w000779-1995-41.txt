Chairman, I would urge my colleagues in the strongest possible way to oppose this amendment.  The FDA needs reform, and I have introduced the first comprehensive bill in this session to get that reform. But make no mistake about it, the Bunning amendment would cripple the safety mission of the Food and Drug Administration.  My colleagues, let me say I know of no major industry group in our country that wants to go as far as the Bunning amendment. The biotechnology industry, which we have so much hope for in the 21st century, is certainly not going to want to cut all of this funding. The device industry, which also shows such great promise, does not want to go this far. The pharmaceutical industry does not want to go this far. They all believe that the Food and Drug Administration needs reform.                              {time}  2100  We can do that on a bipartisan basis, but let us not turn back the clock, let us not play Russian roulette, with the safety of the America public. Vote no on the Bunning amendment.
