President, we voted today on the nomination of Prof. Jack Goldsmith to head the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice. I have serious reservations about Professor Goldsmith's nomination. In particular, I am concerned about his positions as they relate to the international protection of human rights, the engagement of the United States in holding accountable those who commit crimes against humanity, the administration's use of military tribunals and, more broadly, our Nation's place in the global community.  Professor Goldsmith is a leading opponent of the use of the Alien Tort Claims Act, ATCA. For the past 23 years, judges have interpreted the ATCA to allow victims of torture and abuse to file claims in United States courts against foreign governments, torturers, and multinational corporations. Victims have used the act to bring claims against notorious violators of human rights, such as war criminal Radovan Karadzic, the former prime minister of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, and the banks and companies that profited from Nazi war crimes. Professor Goldsmith's opposition to the use of ATCA reflects a disturbing shift away from international efforts to hold human rights abusers responsible for their inhumane treatment of innocent victims throughout the world.  Professor Goldsmith is also a vocal opponent of the International Criminal Court, ICC. Over the past few months, the ICC has taken steps toward becoming an effective tool to hold accountable those accused of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. Yet Professor Goldsmith has dismissed the Court as ``futile'' and ``unrealistic.'' Many believe that the ICC is the best forum to bring the world's worst criminals to justice, but Professor Goldsmith has predicted that it is headed for the grave: I am hopeful that the United States can one day play a key role in ensuring that the ICC effectively carries out its historic mandate, and I worry that Professor Goldsmith has not demonstrated a commitment to leading the administration in this important direction.  Professor Goldsmith also vigorously defended the President's authority to try suspected terrorists by military tribunal, despite the concerns raised by many Americans and our allies about the legality of these practices. Legitimate questions have been raised about the administration's inconsistency in bringing some cases in federal court while referring other similar cases to military tribunals, where the defendants' rights are fewer and the procedures less clear. I urge Professor Goldsmith to take a hard look at the administration's recent treatment of prisoners of war: I fear it may have negative implications for the treatment of our own citizens abroad.  Professor Goldsmith's positions on ATCA, the ICC, and military tribunals reflect a broader, disturbing trend in his thinking, scholarship and writings. At a time when the United States should be increasing our engagement in the international community, I am concerned that Professor Goldsmith will advocate for less engagement. At a time when the United States should be increasing our global cooperation in areas such as the war on terrorism, the environment, and international peace and security, I am concerned that Professor Goldsmith will advocate for less cooperation. At a time when the United States should be reaffirmingour commitment to protecting individual liberties, due process rights, and access to equal justice, I am concerned that Professor Goldsmith lacks a true commitment to these foundations of our democracy.  I am also alarmed by the veil of secrecy that has been drawn by Attorney General Ashcroft over the operations of the Office of Legal Counsel. I encourage Professor Goldsmith to allow the sun to shine into the Office of Legal Counsel by disclosing memoranda and opinions to the American public, insofar as such disclosure would not raise legitimate national security concerns.  I hope that, within the context of Professor Goldsmith's temporary appointment, he will look beyond his academic musings and offer the objective legal advice he promised this Senate he would provide. As he develops his legal opinions and advises the administration, I hope that he seriously considers the universally accepted international legal norms that have proven essential in protecting the rights of all members of our global community to freedom, security, and due process of law.                          ____________________
