Chairman, I want to make sure I understand the gentleman's amendment. Is the gentleman saying if I happen to have my home next to wetland and the developer goes on that wetland under this bill and somehow fills it in with a landfill or whatever so he can build a subdivision or building of some sort, as a result my property, my basement floods or something happens to my property, that I have a right to recover for my loss?
