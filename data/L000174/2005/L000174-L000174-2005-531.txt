President, less than 2 weeks after the horrific events of September 11, Congress passed a law to establish the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, providing assistance to victims and their families during an unimaginably difficult time. I was pleased to work with my colleagues to create this needed resource for the families of this national tragedy. The families of victims that died in the September 11 attacks also came together and created their own nonprofit organization, Families of September 11.  Although no amount of compensation can replace a lost loved one, Families of September 11 and Ken Feinberg, the Special Master in charge of overseeing the Fund, worked diligently to improve the rules governing the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, to give the victims and their families more flexibility and to provide information to victims and their families about how and where they could find support. Working together, Mr. Feinberg and Families of September 11 reached out to the victims and their families to make sure they understood their rights and to assist them in filing their claims. This task was made all the more difficult because many victims and survivors of those terrorist attacks had to confront the logistical burden and emotional pain of filing a death or injury claim.  Last October, Mr. Feinberg submitted to the Department of Justice a final report summarizing the accomplishments and work of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. While the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund has reached its final deadline, Families of September 11 continues its mission, including supporting legislation on security and intelligence reform. This week, Families of September 11 also submitted a final report to the Department of Justice, sharing the experiences of the victims and their families, including those who chose not to participate in the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. The report in its entirety may be read at http://www.familiesofseptember11.org.  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of the Executive Summary of this report be in the Record for lawmakers and the public to review.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Executive Summary: Final Report of Families of September 11 on the             September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001       Families of September 11 is a nonprofit organization      founded in October 2001 by families of those who died in the      September 11 terrorist attacks. We gather and disseminate      helpful information, refer victims' families, survivors, and      others affected by the events of 9/11 to assistance      providers, offer online chat sessions, and address such      issues as victims' assistance, methods of response to trauma      from terrorist attacks, and the effects of terrorism on      children. We support public policies that effectively respond      to the threat of terrorism, including support for the 9/11      Commission Recommendations, development of appropriate agency      procedures, legislation related to aviation, border, port and      transportation security, and intelligence reform.       Our Final Report on the September 11th Victim Compensation      Fund follows the format of ``Final Report of the Special      Master for the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of      2001.'' Just as the Special Master's Final Report provides      the perspective of the administrator of the Fund, our Report      gives voice to those victims and family members who      participated in the Fund as well as those who elected not to.      Although much of our report serves as counterpoint to the      Special Master's observations and conclusions, we agree with      much of what is said in his report and our Report should be      read with an acknowledgement that the Special Master was      asked to and did construct a program in extremely difficult      circumstances. The enabling legislation that created the Fund      was hastily crafted, imprecise in significant ways, and      sometimes internally inconsistent. The Special Master was      faced not only with the uncertain nature of the legislation,      but with a host of other competing influences: e.g., the      enormity of the losses, emotionally overwhelmed victims and      families, a stunned public, and conflicting compensation      policy ideologies. The Special Master and those who worked      with him deserve great credit for their tireless and devoted      work under these daunting circumstances, particularly in the      administration of the Fund after promulgation by the      Department of Justice of the Final Rules.       In many respects, the Fund was a success. Much of this      success was due to the efforts of the Special Master and his      staff in meeting with individual family members,      demonstrating flexibility where possible in making      determinations of awards, and expressing     compassion for family members in the process. But, the      Special Master's view, expressed in the introduction to his      Final Report, that ``the Fund was an unqualified success'' is      not shared by many who participated in the Fund and most of      those who did not. The options available to the victims and      families of September 11 were substantially impaired by the      Victim Compensation Act and subsequent legislation.      Lawsuits were confined to a narrow population of      potentially responsible parties whose liability exposure      was limited to available and inadequate insurance (e.g.,      the airlines). Evidence for use in litigation was sure to      be (has been) compromised by government intervention      (e.g., assertions of national security and criminal      prosecution grounds for non-disclosure). Families were,      thus, faced with a Hobson's choice and for most the Fund      was the better one.       In December 2004, Families of September 11 conducted a Web-     based survey of its members consisting of fourteen questions      and an opportunity to make narrative comments designed to      elicit information that might be helpful in assessing whether      there should be a compensation mechanism in place before      another terrorist attack occurs. One hundred forty-four (144)      members responded. Though not designed to conform with      scientifically reliable protocols, the results are of      interest and are included in our Report.       Much of the Special Master's report is devoted to efforts      made by him and his staff to assure that families could      obtain detailed information about their likely recovery from      the Fund and assist families in the process. Although our      Report applauds him for these efforts, it points out that had      there been pre-existing comprehensive legislation in place,      the Special Master's extraordinary efforts to educate      potential participants about and assist them with the Fund      would not have been necessary and the enormous anxiety      created by the uncertainties surrounding the Fund would have      been avoided.       The regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice      established ``grid'' awards with ``extraordinary      circumstances'' thresholds of proof to overcome them and no      review process. Claimants were accustomed to the very      different and more substantial notions of ``hearings'' and      ``due process'' embedded in our legal culture and were left      disappointed and uncomfortable by the Fund design. Mr.      Feinberg and his staff should, however, receive high marks      for the way they played the cards dealt them.       The victims and their families were faced with enormous      uncertainty in the weeks and months following September 11,      2001, during which the Department of Justice promulgated      regulations and the Special Master developed claims handling      procedures. It is this uncertainty that Families of September      11 believes must be eliminated by enactment of forward-     looking legislation. The victims of future terrorist attacks      will need to go on living, as have the victims of the      September 11 attacks and should have the comfort of knowing      immediately after a terrorist event occurs that they have      rights to compensation sufficient to allow them to do so and      a clear and certain path to obtaining those rights.       Issues of accountability and responsibility by those in the      chain of causation linked to the injuries and deaths on      September 11, 2001, and the suffering that followed are of      great importance to the survivors of the attacks. The Fund,      its enabling legislation, and related congressional and      administrative actions had the effect of limiting that      accountability and responsibility. Our Report expresses      concern that this model tends to increase the risk of future      terrorist attacks and needs to be reassessed and remedied.       The Special Master made determinations on 7,403 claims      completing its work by the statutory deadline in June 2004.      Congress now has the benefit of more than 11,000 comments      made to the Justice Department during the rule-making      process; the comments of the Special Master; the opinions of      lawyers, economists, academics, mental heath professionals,      victims and survivors of the attacks; and the developing      history of terrorism and its effects on our society. In its      report, Families of September 11 encourages Congress and the      Administration to:       a. Use the perspectives of time and experience in      implementation of the Victim Compensation Fund to consider      carefully issues it was forced to address hastily in the      immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11,      2001;       b. assess how well the rules adopted in 2002 to implement      the legislation met Congressional intent;       c. consider the incentives and disincentives to reducing      the risks of terrorist attacks implicit in the legislation;      and       d. fashion legislation that will reduce those risks and      ensure that victims of future terrorist attacks and their      families are made whole.
