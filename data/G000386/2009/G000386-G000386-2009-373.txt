 I would like to speak right after him for a couple minutes.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, with all due respect to the Senator from Vermont, we should stay on this amendment and have the speakers on this amendment, then move to the Sanders amendment. The pending business is my amendment before the Senate.
