Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I would like to engage in a colloquy.  It is my understanding that the Department of Defense has been authorized to purchase a total of 120 C-17s as a follow-on aircraft to the C-141, which is in the process of a complete drawdown. It is also my understanding that the C-17 aircraft is a key component for modernizing our Nation's Active Duty and Reserve component's air mobility resources.  I ask the chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), what is his opinion of the effectiveness of the C-17 aircraft, especially during the current high level of operations.
