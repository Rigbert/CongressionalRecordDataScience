President, I have a unanimous consent on behalf of the leader.  Before I make that unanimous consent request, I would like to thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Alaska in reference to the amendment concerning our policy with North Korea. Senator McCain has pointed out the situation that now exists with another flare-up of hostilities on the DMZ between South Korea and North Korea.  Some time ago--about 4 months--I was privileged to take part in a delegation with Senator Stevens. Senator Stevens, Senator Domenici, Senator Inouye, Senator Cochran, and myself were the first American congressional delegation allowed into North Korea.  We went to North Korea with a specific purpose. We know that country is hard hit by a famine, and that the situation is very real. We wanted to encourage the North Koreans, in cooperation with Ambassador Richardson, the State Department and the administration, to participate in the four-party peace talks.  Since I have had the privilege of being the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and serve on the Agriculture Committee here in this body, I wanted to encourage the North Koreans to explore every opportunity for normal trading relations--that is, to explore the possibility of commercial trade and third-party agreements that would alleviate their situation.  I think we made some progress. I think we tried to make our point that these kind of negotiations, these kind of contacts, would certainly open up new doors of cooperation only to find out, however, that now just at the time the administration is announcing a doubling of the humanitarian food assistance to North Korea we see another repeat of these hostilities.  I remember well in meeting with the South Korean Government officials when South Korea sent a ship full of grain and other food shipments to the North. The North simply confiscated the ship, took down the South Korean flag, raised the North Korean flag, took all of the personnel involved, and had them incarcerated for about 10 days, and then finally let those folks go back to South Korea. That to me is not a very willing partner in an effort to relieve any kind of famine.  Quite frankly, when we were in North Korea they were conducting a military exercise at the time that we were there, and wasting, as far as I am concerned and any other observer, valuable dollars that could have been provided to their own people who are suffering. This is a repressive regime--a theocracy, if you will--that is punishing their senior citizens and their very young--putting them through a famine at the same time that they are asking us for this kind of assistance.  Question: Will these funds go to the purpose that it should go to, or will they go to simply reinforce a very repressive military?  These are questions that should be answered. And I think with the latest flare-up on the DMZ Senator Murkowski and Senator McCain have made an excellent amendment, and I hope we would consider it and I hope it will be improved.                  Unanimous-Consent Agreement--s. 1004  In behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, S. 1004, be considered read a third time, that the vote on passage occur as under the original consent, and additionally the bill not be engrossed, that it remain at the desk pending the receipt of the House companion measure; I further ask unanimous consent that when the House companion measure is passed pursuant to the previous order, the passage of S. 1004 be vitiated and that S. 1004 be indefinitely postponed.
