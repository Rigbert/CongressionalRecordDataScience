 President, it was good to see Democrats finally bring an end to their weeks-long filibuster of the Homeland Security funding bill. Once the measure we voted on yesterday is complete, the Senate will consider sensible legislation from Senator Collins.  The Collins bill is really quite simple. It would protect our democracy from the most egregious example of Executive overreach we saw back in November. It is overreach described by President Obama himself as ``ignoring the law.'' The Collins measure simply takes the President at his word and helps him follow the law instead of ignoring it.  It is hard to see how any Senator could oppose such a good, commonsense idea. So we look forward to that vote.                          ____________________
