President, I rise today to reintroduce the Reasonable Search Standards Act. This Act prohibits racial or other discriminatory profiling by Customs Service personnel. I am please that Senator Voinovich is an original cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation.  Last year, I released a study, conducted by GAO at my request, of the U.S. Customs Service's procedures for conducting inspections of airport passengers. The need for this study grew out of an investigative report by Renee Ferguson of WMAQ-TV in Chicago and several complaints from African-American women in my home state of Illinois who were strip-searched at O'Hare Airport for suspicion of carrying drugs. No drugs were found and the women felt that they had been singled out for these highly intrusive searches because of their race. These women, approximately 100 of them, have filed a class action law suit in Chicago.  The purpose of the GAO study was to review Customs' policies and procedures for conducting personal searches of airport passengers and to determine the internal controls in place to ensure that airline passengers are not inappropriately targeted or subjected to personal searches. Approximately 140 million passengers entered the United States on international flights during fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Because there is no data available on the gender, race and citizenship of this traveling population, GAO was not able to determine whether specific groups of passengers are disproportionately selected to be searched. However, once passengers are selected for searches, GAO was able to evaluate the likelihood that people with various race and gender characteristics would be subjected to searches that are more personally intrusive, such as strip-searches and x-rays, rather than simply being frisked or patted down.  The GAO study revealed some very troubling patterns in the searches conducted by U.S. Customs Service inspectors. GAO found disturbing disparities in the likelihood that passengers from certain population groups, having been selected for some form of search, would be subjected to the more intrusive searches, including strip-searches and x-ray searches. Moreover, that increased likelihood of being intrusively searched did not always correspond to an increased likelihood of actual carrying contraband.  Because of the intrusive nature of strip-searches and x-ray searches, it is important that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory bias in forcing passengers to undergo these searches. GAO found that African-American women were much more likely to be strip-searched than most other passengers. This disproportionate treatment was not justified by the rate at which these women were found to be carrying contraband.  Certain other groups also experienced a greater likelihood of being strip-searched relative to their likelihood of being found carrying contraband. Specifically, African-American women were nearly 3 times as likely as African-American men to be strip-searched, even though they were only half as likely to be found carrying contraband. Hispanic-American and Asian-American women were also nearly 3 times as likely as Hispanic-American and Asian-American men to be strip-searched, even though they were 20 percent less likely to be found carrying contraband. In addition, African-American women were 73 percent more likely than White-American women to be strip-searched in 1998 and nearly 3 times as likely to be strip-searched in1997, despite only a 42 percent higher likelihood of being found carrying contraband. Moreover, among non-citizens, White men and women were more likely to be strip-searched than Black and Hispanic men and women, despite lower rates of being found carrying contraband.  As with strip-searches, x-rays are personally intrusive and it is of particular concern that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory bias in requiring x-ray searches of passengers suspected of carrying contraband. GAO found that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans were much more likely to be x-rayed than other passengers. This disproportionate treatment was not justified by the rate at which these passengers were found to be carrying contraband. Specifically, GAO found that African-American women were nearly 9 times as likely as White-American women to be x-rayed even though they were half as likely to be carrying contraband. African-American men were nearly 9 times as likely as White-American men to be x-rayed, even though they were no more likely than White-American men to be carrying contraband. Moreover, Hispanic-American women and men were nearly 4 times as likely as White-American women and men to be x-rayed, even though they were only a little more than half as likely to be carrying contraband. And among non-citizens, Black women and men were more than 4 times as likely as White women and men to be x-rayed, even though Black women were only half as likely and Black men were no more likely to be found carrying contraband.  For these reasons, we are reintroducing the Reasonable Search Standards Act. This bill is a direct response to the concerns raised by the GAO report. The bill prohibits Customs Service personnel from selecting passengers for searches based in whole or in part on the passenger's actual or perceived race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation. To ensure that a sound reason exists for selecting someone to be searched, the bill requires Customs Service personnel to document the reasons for searching a passenger before the passenger is searched. The only exception to this requirement is when the Customs official suspects that the passenger is carrying a weapon.  The bill also requires all Customs Service personnel to undergo periodic training on the procedures for searching passengers, with a particular emphasis on the prohibition of profiling. The training shall include a review of the reasons given for searches, the results of the searches and the effectiveness of the criteria used by Customs to select passengers for searches. Finally, the bill calls for an annual study and report on detentions and searches of individuals by Customs Service personnel. The report shall include the number of searches conducted by Customs Service personnel, the race and gender of travelers subjected to the searches, the type of searches conducted--including pat down searches and intrusive non-routine searches--and the results of these searches.  Since the release of the GAO report, the Customs Service has assured me that improvements have been made to ``. . . better gather and analyze data, and to improve search procedures and results.'' These changes, along with better training of Customs Service personnel, will not only prevent unfair profiling practices, but will actually improve the effectiveness of operations at Customs. I commend former Commissioner Kelly for his quick response to the concerns raised by the GAO study and for implementing changes to the Customs Service's personal search policies.  The legislation we are introducing today will ensure that such progress continues, and is reported to Congress on a periodic basis. The Reasonable Search Standards Act will make the task at Customs easier by ensuring that a key federal service--one where profiling practices have already been demonstrated--remains focused on improving its personal search procedures and eliminating any practices that bear even the slightest resemblance to racial profiling.  President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft have both said that ending racial profiling will be a high priority for this Administration. We applaud their commitment to this important issue. We have written a letter to President Bush, co-signed by Representatives Lewis and Houghton, to commend the President's attention to racial profiling, and to urge him to support the Reasonable Search Standards Act. Similar letters have been sent to Attorney General Ashcroft and to Treasury Secretary O'Neill. This is not a black, or brown, or white issue. It is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Racial profiling is an affront to all Americans. Allowing it to continue would diminish democracy for all Americans.  Martin Luther King had a dream that the United States would become a nation where children would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. We still have a long road to travel to make Dr. King's dream a full reality for all people. The Reasonable Search Standards Act is one step along that road. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent to President Bush be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2001.     Hon. George W. Bush,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Bush: We are writing to commend you and      Attorney General Ashcroft for the priority your      administration has given to the issue of racial profiling,      and to seek your assistance regarding ongoing efforts to      address this issue in the U.S. Customs Service. The insidious      practice of racial profiling undermines public confidence in      law enforcement and damages the credibility of police forces      around the country, even though the vast majority of police      are carrying out their duties responsibly and professionally.      Most importantly, racial profiling creates an atmosphere of      distrust and alienation that isolates broad segments of the      American population.       As you know, this issue affects federal, as well as state      and local law enforcement activities. In fact, a GAO study of      profiling practices of airline passengers concluded that the      U.S. Customs Service was intrusively searching African-     American women and other minorities for contraband at much      higher rates than they searched other segments of the      population. Ironically, the women being targeted were      statistically less likely than other passengers to be found      carrying contraband.       Commissioner Kelly quickly responded to the concerns raised      by the GAO study by implementing significant changes to the      Customs Service's personal search policies and data      collection activities. The Customs Service is to be commended      for its responsiveness that, we hope, will eventually      eliminate the practice or appearance of discrimination. Your      continued attention to this issue will insure that the rapid      pace of progress that the Customs Service has already made on      the issue of racial profiling will continue unabated. To that      end, we ask, first, that you quickly nominate someone who      shares your commitment to the issue of racial profiling to      the position of Commissioner of Customs.       We also introduced Customs search legislation to      specifically address the issue by codifying some of the      changes already made by the Customs Service, and adding a      modest reporting requirement. The legislation would prohibit      the use of race, gender or other inappropriate criteria as      the basis for Customs Service selection of people for      searches or detention, and require Customs to improve its      record-keeping and analysis, institute periodic training, and      report annually to Congress. There is every indication that      these types of measures will help the Customs Service make      more effective use of its resources, and avoid unwarranted      searches.       We are reintroducing these companion bills to address      profiling in the Customs Service and hope that you will work      with Congress to insure their passage as part of your effort      to bring an end to the inexcusable practice of racial      profiling.           Sincerely,     Richard J. Durbin,       U.S. Senator.     George V. Voinovich,       U.S. Senator.     John Lewis,       Member of Congress.     Amo Houghton,       Member of Congress.                                 ______                                       By
