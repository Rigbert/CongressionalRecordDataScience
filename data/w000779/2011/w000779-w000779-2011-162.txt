President, this month the Oregon Air National Guard is celebrating its 70th anniversary.  ``We've got people, we've got a place, and we're ready!'' These were the historic words written in a request by Major G. Robert Dodson, an Oregonian assigned to organize and command the first squadron of Oregon National Guard Air Corps.  Ready as Major Dodson was, it hadn't happened quickly or easily. It took several years to get the squadron assembled. General George A. White, Oregon's Adjutant General, requested a squadron as early as August 1939, but didn't receive official authorization to form the squadron from the National Guard Bureau until August 1, 1940. On April 18, 1941, Major Dodson assembled a group of 117 volunteers to form the 123rd Observation Squadron.  Less than 8 months later, these Airmen were the first to conduct maritime surveillance of the continental United States following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.  For the most part, their job was to conduct surveillance on the enemy. However, they did on at least one occasion ignore their orders to ``stick to taking pictures'' and dropped ordnance instead. It was not without good reason. It seems that the Japanese they targeted had sunk the ship carrying the unit's beer rations. Their improvised attack wasn't appreciated by their commander, but even back then getting between Oregonians and their beer didn't go unpunished.  After the war, the Air National Guard was established as a separate component of the U.S. Air Force. Since being formally designated the Oregon Air National Guard, our State's aviators have played a vital role in Korea, the cold war, and in military operations throughout the world since the tragic events of 9/11. Seventy years and 15 different aircraft models since their inception, the number of citizen-airmen has increased more than twentyfold to 2,000.  Today, our Nation relies on F-15s from the Oregon Air National Guard to perform the air sovereignty mission for the entire Pacific Northwest. Our twin-engine, air superiority fighter jets--Eagles--fly upwards of Mach 2 to intercept any threat along our Nation's border. Additionally, the Oregon Air National Guard trains new Air Force pilots at Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls.  They are not only there for our Nation in times of war, but they answer the call of the Governor during natural disasters. When flooding threatened hundreds of lives in Vernonia, OR, in 2007 it was the Oregon Air National Guard's 125th Special Tactics Squadron that was first on the scene. They saved hundreds of people from the rising water.  Today's Oregon Air National Guard units include the 142nd Fighter Wing, 125th Special Tactics Squadron and 123rd Weather Flight in Portland, the 173rd Fighter Wing and 270th Air Traffic Control Squadron in Klamath Falls, Joint Force Headquarter in Salem, and the 116th Air Control Squadron in Warrenton.  As an Oregonian and as their Senator, I could not be more proud of today's Oregon Air National Guard and its rich heritage. It is an honor to serve these heroes; active, retired, and those that have given their lives. I am very appreciative of their 70 years of selfless service and sacrifice. The people of Oregon thank every member of this pillar of freedom.                          ____________________
