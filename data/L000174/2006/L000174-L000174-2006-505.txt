I supported that amendment. It called for replacing and repairing barriers in certain border towns.  Now Senator Sessions is offering an amendment to correct what Senator Kyl had included in the Judiciary Committee bill and that was incorporated in the underlying bill now before the Senate. I had thought that the Senator from Arizona had consulted with the administration and, in particular, with the Department of Homeland Security before offering his amendment and that the committee action would have been sufficient. Apparently Senator Sessions and his cosponsors, which include a number of Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee, think that the Kyl amendment was inadequate.
