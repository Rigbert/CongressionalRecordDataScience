Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The gentleman from Alabama put it very clearly: This is not about the author of the amendment's statement about money. This is about, very frankly, the environmental community opposes this dam. Let us get beyond that. Let us go to the commitment we have made to the American Indian. Let us make that commitment one not of the forked tongue. This project has been worked on for over 100 years. It is time that this Congress speaks with a straight tongue and fulfill our obligations.  I would suggest respectfully that if we do not do so, we have gone back and repeated what we have done over the years, breaking our word again and again. I would suggest respectfully this amendment is not appropriate if we are to fulfill our obligations. I urge a strong no vote. Let us speak with a straight tongue, and not forked tongue.  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, let us start out, the gentleman from Oregon states that the President's recommendation did not include construction. The gentleman is wrong on that. The President did include construction. The President supports this, Bruce Babbitt supports it, there are a lot of people in support for this, except for the Sierra Club. Why are they in support of it? It is because we have a treaty with the native Americans. Let me read a letter, one of the most moving letters I have read.                              {time}  1630  This is from the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council, from the chairman:       After reading the article on the Animas-La Plata Projection      the June 29, 1995, edition of The Washington Post, I knew how      my ancestors must have felt when the United States government      repeatedly broke treaties with the Colorado Ute Indians.      First in 1863, then in 1868, 1873 and, finally, in 1880. With      each treaty, the homelands of the Utes were reduced in size.      Finally, in 1880, Congress confiscated all of the Ute lands      in Colorado--over one-third of the state of Colorado. In the      1930's, a small remnant of our aboriginal homelands in      Southwestern Colorado were restored to tribal ownership.       Now, The Washington Post suggests that the United States      government breach the agreement that was entered into in      1988. At that time, the Colorado Utes chose to negotiate      rather than litigate and entered into another treaty, or      contract, with America, in return for deferring the Colorado      Utes' senior Winters water claims on the rivers in      Southwestern Colorado that cross the reservation. Congress      and then President Reagan said, ``We will build the Animas-La      Plata Project. The Utes will have wet water--not paper water      rights.'' Upon passage of the Colorado Ute Indian Water      Rights Settlement Act, the legislation was hailed as a model      for all tribes to follow--negotiate, do not litigate. Since      passage, the States of Colorado, New Mexico, the water      districts, the municipalities, and the Indian tribes, have      been strangled in a swamp of red tape and bureaucratic      backpeddling.       Now comes The Washington Post, not unlike the Indian givers      of the last century. Do not honor our commitment to the      Indians. Ignore the trust responsibility the United States      government has under the Constitution of the United States.      Sacrifice the Indian water claims on the alter of economics.      It is too expensive to build the Animas-La Plata. Let's give      he Indians ``wampum'' instead of water. My ancestors were all      too familiar with the ``beads for Manhattan'' mentality of      the early Indian traders. Colorado Ute Indian tribes      honorably negotiated the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights      Settlement Act, which mandates construction of the Animas-La      Plata Project. In his inaugural message to the Congress,      President Bush said ``great men, like great nations, must      keep their promises. The Colorado Ute Indian tribes expect      this great nation to keep is promise and construct the      Animas-La Plata Project.''  Above everything else, the number one issue that we have to face as Members of the United States Congress and on this very amendment that is in front of us today is will we or will we not honor our treaty agreement with the native Americans. If you vote yes on this amendment, you once again walk away from the native Americans of this country. Vote ``no'' on DeFazio.
