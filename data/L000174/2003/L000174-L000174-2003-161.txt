President, if the Senator will yield, I think there may be a Senator on this side who has a question. We are not quite prepared to accept it yet. I suggest that a way to handle this is to set it aside. Of course, it can be brought back at any time. If there is a need to have more debate and a vote, we will bring it up for that purpose.  I yield the floor.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from Colorado. I misspoke earlier when I thought it was cleared on the other side. We are working on that now. Hopefully, we will be able to get it cleared. If the Senator from Colorado will agree to temporarily set it aside and go back to it before we finish the bill, we hope to get it cleared.
