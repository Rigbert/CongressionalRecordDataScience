 President, I rise today to honor Dr. Kenneth Winters on the occasion of his retirement as president of Campbellsville University. Ken is a good personal friend and an admired leader in Taylor County.  Ken served as Campbellsville's president for the past 11 years, and accomplished much during his tenure. Under Ken's leadership, the school gained university status after having been known as Campbellsville College since its inception in 1909. The added prestige that comes with university status, coupled with Ken's hard work to make the school an academic success, helped increase Campbellsville enrollment by stunning 150 percent. The university also has been duly recognized by publications such as U.S. News & World Report, Money and Newsweek for its outstanding academic reputation. Ken's presidency brought a strong, guiding presence to Campbellsville, leaving a legacy of growth and progress.  As importantly, Ken showed unswerving commitment to the students and faculty at CU, and was well-liked and respected by all. Ken's colleagues describe him as a man with great strength of character--a man who demonstrated honesty and integrity, and who served as a campus role-model.  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Ken Winters has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others toward that same goal. Ken, best wishes on your future endeavors, and know that your efforts to better Christian higher education will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, thank you for your contribution to Taylor County, the State of Kentucky, and to our great Nation.                          ____________________
