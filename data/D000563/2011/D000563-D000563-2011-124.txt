It will, for the first time in the history of the United States of America, authorize the indefinite detention of American citizens in the United States. I have spoken to the chairman of the committee, who said he is open to language that would try to protect us from that outcome. But the language as written in the bill, unfortunately, will allow for the indefinite detention of American citizens for the first time. The administration takes this seriously. We should too. They have said they will veto the bill without changes in this particular provision.  I hope we will step back and look at a record of success in keeping America safe and not try to reinvent our Constitution on the floor of the Senate. I believe we ought to give to every President, Democratic and Republican, all of the tools and all of the weapons they need to keep America safe. Tying their hands may give us some satisfaction on the floor of the Senate for a moment, but it won't keep America safe.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Michigan.
