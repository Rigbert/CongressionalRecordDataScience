 I am sure he is aware now that the junior Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz, is making a list of those agencies of government which he and the tea party Republicans believe should be reopened. The first cut on that list includes the Veterans' Administration, but it doesn't include the 564,000 employees who are also veterans, one-fourth of whom are disabled veterans. He has included the National Park Service because of the embarrassment of international visitors coming to the Statue of Liberty and finding it closed, and he included the District of Columbia.  I note he has not included the National Institutes of Health.  I wonder if the Senator from Iowa has read the Wall Street article today. It says, as follows:       At the National Institutes of Health nearly three-quarters      of the staff were furloughed. One result: director Francis      Collins said about 200 patients who otherwise would be      admitted to the NIH Clinical Center into clinical trials each      week will be turned away. This includes about 30 children,      most of them cancer patients, he said.  My question is this: Would the Senator from Iowa join me in writing a letter to the junior Senator from Texas and the tea party Republicans begging them to include the National Institutes of Health on their list of agencies that they may consider reopening?
