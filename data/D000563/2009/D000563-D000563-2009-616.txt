BOXER. My friend is right. But I want to give credit to Senator Inhofe. He is with us. There are many Members on his side of the aisle, however, who are letting this happen. But my friend has it exactly right. The Republicans who are objecting to this are protecting the toxic asset relief program and they are jeopardizing 17,000 jobs across America.  I am as stunned as you are, and I guess I am going to try one more time. If I hear another objection, we will leave it for another day. I will try it one more time. Maybe I have convinced my friend. Maybe my friend needs to leave the floor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3617, received from the House and at the desk, and that the Boxer substitute amendment at the desk be considered; further, that the Boxer-Inhofe second-degree amendment with an offset be considered and agreed to, the substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements relating to the measure appear in the appropriate place in the Record as if read, without further intervening action or debate.
