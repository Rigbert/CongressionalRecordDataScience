Last year's Interior Appropriations bill included my sense-of-the-Senate language that the National Park Service should take what steps are necessary to ensure that appropriate exhibits are completed by 2004. This year's Appropriations Committee mark includes $200,000 in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service construction budget to assist with the Downeast Heritage Center. The Center, which we will make every effort to complete in time for the 2004 celebration, will allow state and federal agencies and other partners in the project to interpret the French settlement efforts at Saint Croix Island and other historical, recreational, and cultural aspects of Downeast Maine.
