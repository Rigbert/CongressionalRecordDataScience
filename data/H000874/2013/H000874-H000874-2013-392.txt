Speaker, I rise today to recognize the long and influential career of Judith Frazier-Thompson as she retires after 45 years of Federal service, with 40 of them years spent at the Congressional Research Service.  Judith was born and raised in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Eastern High School in 1967. While in high school, she began her service to the local government working part-time for the District of Columbia Recreation Department. While an undergraduate at Howard University, Judith worked part-time for the Library of Congress, variously as an order clerk, deck attendant and issue desk assistant. During that time she met and came to know the author Alex Haley, who frequently used the Library of Congress for research. After graduating from Howard University in 1973, she accepted a full-time position working for the Congressional Research Service, where she has worked ever since. Judith began pursuing a Masters Degree from the University of Maryland at College Park while rising through the ranks at the Library of Congress, where she was accepted into the CRS Crossover Program.  During her tenure in the Congressional Research Service, Judith has worked closely with the House of Representatives, assisting Members and staff with all manner of tasks. She has worked on the Government and Law Team of the Congressional Research Division, helping various organizations perform research on such issues as voting rights, and campaign finance reform. Through her years of dedication, Judith has been recognized for her work with many awards, including numerous Library of Congress Special Achievement Awards, and a Congressional Research Employees Association Presidential Certificate of Merit.  Judith plans to retire from her current position as a liaison between the CRS and the House of Representatives on May 3, 2013, and hopes to spend more time with her husband golfing and traveling.  I am honored to pay tribute today to Judith Frazier-Thompson and her long and distinguished career in service to his great Nation. She will be greatly missed on Capitol Hill, and I join in wishing her the best in her retirement.                          ____________________
