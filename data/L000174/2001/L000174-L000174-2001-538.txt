We have several pending amendments that could all be voted on. I have one or two. We have the yeas and nays ordered, and I am willing to have a 2- or 3-minute time agreement.  I suggest to those who keep complaining about why this is taking so long, the amendments we know are going to require rollcall votes, we could dispose of more than half of them by 7 o'clock this evening.
