 The Deputy Attorney General is the No. 2 position at the Department of Justice. It is a critical national security and Federal law enforcement position. These former officials who served with distinction in that post write that the deputy is ``the chief operating officer of the Department of Justice, supervising its day-to-day operations'' and that ``the deputy is also a key member of the President's national security team, a function that has grown in importance and complexity in the years since the terror attacks of September 11.'' These former Deputy Attorneys General are right. I thank them for speaking out to urge the Senate to complete consideration of this important nomination.  I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.
