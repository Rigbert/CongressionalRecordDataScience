One thing that needs to be clarified, and we have asked the staff to do it because it has not been done before, is to see--I mean, we are in the same situation. The State of Texas today is getting back 90.5 percent. We are getting back 90.5 percent. It is kind of an interesting study that is being conducted right now to determine how much of the money--when the Senator says Texans pay in so much and get back so much, a lot of the fuel that is being purchased, subject to excise tax, is not purchased by citizens of Texas, particularly talking about a corridor going through. I know when I am down there, I purchase a lot of fuel. That same I-35 goes through my State of Oklahoma. A lot of the NAFTA traffic is traffic that is not Texas traffic, but they are purchasing fuel there. It would be interesting to know whether or not the citizens of my State of Oklahoma or the citizens of State of Texas are actually getting back perhaps more than they are paying in in fuel revenues.
