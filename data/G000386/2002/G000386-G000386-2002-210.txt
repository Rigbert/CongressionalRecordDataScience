 President, it is my intention to back the amendment. This amendment makes an important contribution to the underlying trade promotion authority bill.  Before addressing the substance of the amendment, I put it in context. The Doha ministerial held in Qatar last year was a profound breakthrough for the United States and the World Trade Organization. For the first time in many years, over 130 nations came together to launch a new round of international trade negotiations. This is no small achievement, as virtually every action taken during the Doha ministerial had to be done by consensus. These nations strongly believed a new round of international trade negotiations was in their best interests. I agree it is in their best interests, and it is in the best interests of the United States. I also think it is in our best interests to get these negotiations underway and give the President the authority he needs to negotiate the best deals for our workers and small and large businesses.  During the WTO ministerial at Doha, the members of the organization adopted a political declaration that highlights the provisions in the TRIPS agreement that provide members with the flexibility to address public emergencies, such as the epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The objectives on intellectual property, which are part of this bill, were drafted before completion of the Doha ministerial. Senator Kennedy's amendment updates these objectives to take into account the important declaration on public health made at the Doha meeting. It is a good addition to the bill. I am pleased to accept it.
