 President, I will read just a few of the highlights from the cover letter. This is dated October 3, 1997.       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for requesting our      comments on the revised McCain-Feingold campaign finance      bill. . . .       Much of what the Cato Institute and similar nonprofit      research and public policy corporations do could no longer be      done or, done only if we are comfortable having research      publications, public policy forums, city seminars,      conferences and the like classified as ``contributions.'' In      this bizarre scenario, these ``contributions'' would have to      be paid for out of our ``PAC'' (which, of course, we would      never have), and, probably, could not be done at all since      much of the ``anything of value'' we produce often costs more      than the $5,000 limit on contributions.       Here is a group, Mr. President, not in politics. They do      not go out and create a PAC, they do not do voter guides, and      they think that the most recent version of McCain-Feingold is      going to make it hard for them to function.  The Cato Institute goes on:       For example, if we published a study on the flat tax, or      tax reform and ever discussed the issue with Representative      Dick Armey--or, heaven forbid, held a policy forum or city      seminar with Dick Armey, Steve Forbes, Reps' Paxon, Tauzin,      Archer, or any of the other leading proponents of tax      reform--under the new McCain-Feingold, these could become      contributions.       I guess the good news is, as Bob Levy says, that ``the      September 29 version of McCain-Feingold reduces the first      amendment to scrap''--so blatantly unconstitutional that it      will never become law. As Bob also says, ``McCain-Feingold is      an insidious and destructive piece of legislation. It      deserves an ignominious burial. To be blunt, either it dies,      or we do.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the communication from the Cato Institute be printed in the Record, along with another letter from the National Taxpayers Union.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         Cato,                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1997.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for requesting our      comments on the revised McCain-Feingold campaign finance      bill. A copy of Bob Levy's detailed analysis is attached (Bob      is a senior fellow in constitutional studies here at Cato.) I      think you will find the first two and closing paragraphs      succinct and to the point.       In summary, much of what the Cato Institute and similar      non-profit research and public policy corporations do, could      no longer be done or, done only if we are comfortable having      research publications, public policy forums, city seminars,      conferences and the like classified as ``contributions.'' In      this bizarre scenario, these ``contributions'' would have to      be paid for out of our ``PAC'' (which of course, we would      never have), and, probably, could not be done at all since      much of the ``anything of value'' we produce often costs more      than the $5,000 limit on contributions. And, of course, if      you know anything at all about the Cato Institute and our      president, Ed Crane, the last thing we would ever do is allow      ourselves to be in a situation that could be interpreted as      making contributions to political candidates.       For example, if we published a study on the flat tax, or      tax reform and ever discussed the issue with Rep. Dick      Armey--or, heaven forbid, held a policy forum or city seminar      with Dick Armey, Steve Forbes, Reps. Paxon, Tauzin, Archer,      or any of the other leading proponents of tax reform--under      the new McCain-Feingold, these could become      ``contributions.''       I guess the good news is, as Bob Levy says, that ``the      September 29 version of McCain-Feingold reduces the First      Amendment to scrap''--so blatantly unconstitutional that it      will never become law. As Bob also says, ``McCain-Feingold is      an insidious and destructive piece of legislation. It      deserves an ignominious burial. To be blunt, either it dies,      or we do.''       We hope the above and attached is helpful.           Sincerely,     Peggy J. Ellis.                                                                    ____       Attachment.                                     National Taxpayers Union,                                  Alexandria, VA, October 6, 1997.     Attention: Campaign Finance Reform Aide.       Dear Senator: When you took your oath of office you said:       I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will      support and defend the Constitution of the United States      against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear      true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this      obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose      of evasion; and that I well and faithfully discharge the      duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me      God (5 U.S.C. 3331.)       S. 25, the campaign finance bill by Senators McCain and      Feingold, is blatantly unconstitutional under the First      Amendment, which says in part that ``Congress shall make no      law-.-.-.-abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;      or the right to the people peaceably to assemble, and to      petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'' You      cannot ``support the Constitution'' by trying the patience of      the Courts. Therefore, we believe that every Senator has a      constitutional obligation to vote against passage of this      bill.       The restrictions are so absurd that, if the bill were law,      it would be illegal for any organization to energetically      lobby for or against any legislation within 60 days of any      election unless it excluded the names of their lawmakers. So      for at least four months of every other year, groups could      not pay for ``any paid advertisement that is broadcast by a      radio broadcast station or television broadcast station'' if      they identified the name of a local lawmaker. If the Congress      wants such silly rules, then it should also arrange to be out      of session during these 60-day periods, and require that all      state congressional primaries he held on the same day.       The bill also proposes to ban, year-round, so-called      express advocacy while going far beyond the Supreme Court's      definition of express advocacy. The definitions are so vague      that candidates could complain to the Federal Election      Commission that many criticisms of their views constitute      ``illegal'' activity. Since there would be no cost to      complain, complain they will.       The sponsors of this legislation may claim it would have no      cost to taxpayers. We strongly disagree. Since the proposal      is so vague and so far-reaching in its application and      attempt to regulate speech and political activity, it would      take an enormous and costly expansion of the FEC to      administer our newly regulated ``free-speech'' rights.      Therefore, we will count a vote against this bill as a pro-     taxpayer vote in our annual Rating of Congress.       One final note. As a taxpayer organization, we know a thing      or two about complex and vague laws such as our tax code. But      if this bill becomes law, many of our tax laws will be a      model of clarity compared to the election law. And the tax      laws will have one advantage. Audits are not set in motion by      the frivolous complaints that would be the rule under this      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                    David Keating,                                         Executive Vice President.  Mr. McCONNELL. Preferring substance to petitions, I have a couple of constitutional analyses to have printed in the Record. I understand from the Government Printing Office that it will cost approximately $12,000 to print this material in the Record.  The first is an outstanding dissertation on the constitutional implications of campaign finance reform by law professor and renowned legal scholar Lillian R. BeVier of the University of Virginia, and again I will just read some of the highlights for the information of those listening to the debate.  Professor BeVier appeared before the Rules Committee on several occasions. Her report of September 4, 1997, says:       The shortcomings of current ``reform'' proposals are no      small matter, given the First Amendment's crucial historical      role in protecting our right to self-government and its      sustaining liberty. For the proposals to pass constitutional      muster, the First Amendment would have to be itself      ``amended'' by judicial fiat.  And that, Mr. President, sums up I think quite well what Professor BeVier goes on to point out in some greater detail and I ask unanimous consent that that dissertation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Campaign Finance ``Reform'' Proposals--A First Amendment Analysis                         (By Lillian R. BeVier)                           executive summary       In the wake of recent reports of questionable campaign      finance practices have come ever more draconian proposals to      ``reform'' the campaign finance system. Those proposals pose      a disturbing threat to the individual political freedom      guaranteed by the Constitution. Under current precedents,      none of them could survive a First Amendment challenge.       In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Supreme Court affirmed that      giving money to and spending money on political campaigns is      a core First Amendment activity. Accordingly, regulations of      political contributions and expenditures will not be      sustained unless justified by a compelling state interest and      crafted to achieve their objective by the least restrictive      means.       Current proposals to regulate campaign finance practices      cannot survive the kind of scrutiny that the First Amendment      requires. This study demonstrates that the ban on political      action committees, the PAC ban fallback provisions, the      ``voluntary'' spending limits, the restrictions on soft      money, the regulation of issue advocacy, and the proposals to      expand the enforcement powers for the Federal Election      Commission all substantially infringe on core First Amendment      freedoms, but none serves a compelling interest with the      least restrictive means. And the proposal that broadcasters      be required to provide free TV time to federal candidates is      constitutionally insupportable.       The shortcomings of current ``reform'' proposals are no      small matter, given the First Amendment's crucial historical      role in protecting our right to self-government and in      sustaining liberty. For the proposals to pass constitutional      muster, the First Amendment would have to be itself      ``amended'' by judicial fiat.                              introduction       Since the 1996 elections, campaign finance practices have      dominated the news. Reports of unpalatable fundraising      strategies, such as renting out the Lincoln bedroom to major      donors and using White House telephones to solicit      contributions, have appeared with distressing frequency on      the nightly news. The media tend to portray those actions not      as straightforward individual ethical or legal lapses but as      self-evidently symptomatic of the need for stringent new      campaign finance ``reforms.'' President Clinton, who claims      to have played by the rules in his reelection campaign, also      claims to strongly favor ``reform.'' Recently, for example,      in a ``stop-me-before-I-kill-again'' move, he petitioned the      Federal Election Commission to ban political parties from      accepting the ``soft-money'' contributions that provided so      much of the fuel for the 1996 presidential contest.       A chorus of those who advocate increased regulation of the      political process is always available to chant the reform      mantras, and the mainstream press appears credulously willing      to broadcast them: ``Well-heeled [unequivocally self-serving      and never public-regarding] special interests'' dominate the      political process; challengers and incumbents alike, consumed      by the need to raise money for their campaigns, spend ``most      of their time . . . scrounging for funds.'' \1\ A Washington      Post headline declared, ``The System Has Cracked under the      Weight of Cash.'' \2\ ``[F]renized fund-raising and      freewheeling spending . . . [of] torrents of cash'' now rule      the day, and election contests are conducted principally via      expensive ad campaigns that saturate the airwaves.\3\ Money--     dollars contributed to candidates, given to political      parties, and spent on election campaigns--undermines the      integrity of and ``defeat[s] the democratic process'' \4\--or      so it is said.       Despite the overheated rhetoric of dysfunctionality and      doom, the debate about the nature of the changes that ought      to be made in the present system of campaign finance      regulations is often framed as though short-term political      advantage were the only thing at stake.\5\ Republicans, it is      said, are against restricting campaign contributions and      expenditures--but only because they are richer and better at      raising money. Democrats, on the other hand, favor      restrictions--but only because they wish to counter the      perceived Republican money-raising advantage. Because      Republicans control the present Congress, stringent new      giving and spending regulations are thought unlikely.     And finally, it is said that because the incumbents of both      parties are ``beneficiaries'' of the present system,      political reality suggests that those incumbents are unlikely      to change the system in any way that might threaten their      reelection.       For all the rhetoric, however, the debate over campaign      finance regulation raises issues that genuinely transcend the      short run, issues of fundamental and permanent significance      that cry out to be acknowledged. Indeed, though they come to      us in the benign guise of ``reform,'' many of the campaign      finance regulations that have recently been proposed would      require us to renege on a central premise of our      representative democracy--the individual political freedom      our Constitution guarantees.       This study will examine the constitutionality of current      campaign finance regulatory proposals. It will also strive to      bring the stakes in the campaign finance debate into the      sharpest possible focus--to provide a full accounting of      regulation's cost to political freedom so that, if they find      themselves tempted to adopt a short-term fix to the campaign      finance ``mess,'' legislators will not fatally underestimate      the price.                         the regulatory agenda       On the agenda of today's proponents of reform are a number      of specific, often shifting legislative proposals. Rather      than treat each of those proposals in detail, I will proceed      in more generic terms, focusing on the broad outlines of the      most frequently recurring--and thus most prominent--     individual suggestions for ``reform.'' I will consider the      following proposals:       The PAC ban: Eliminate political action committees (PACs)      from federal election activities by banning all expenditures      by and contributions to them for purposes of influencing      elections for federal office, broadly defined, except those      contributions and expenditures made by political parties and      their candidates.       The PAC ban fallback: If the complete ban if found      unconstitutional, lower the permissible amount of PAC      contributions to single candidates from the present $5,000 to      $1,000 and prohibit any candidate from receiving any PAC      contribution that would raise that candidate's PAC receipts      above a given percentage (say, 20 percent) of applicable      expenditure ceilings; ban the ``bundling'' of individual      contributions; ban the receipt by a candidate of PAC monies      that exceed 20 percent of the particular election's campaign      expenditure ceilings; redefine independent expenditures so as      to turn more activities into ``coordinated'' expenditures      (thus subjecting them to the contribution limitations); and      broaden the definition of ``express advocacy'' so as      essentially to prohibit generic partisan communications of      any kind (by defining express advocacy to include any      ``expression of support for or opposition to a specific      candidate, to a specific group of candidates, or to      candidates of a particular political party'' and to include      suggestions ``to take action with respect to an election * *      * or to refrain from taking action'').       Spending limits and communication discounts: Impose      ``voluntary'' spending limits for candidates in House and      Senate races and prohibit spending of personal funds in      excess of 10 percent of that limit; provide to candidates who      agree to be bound by the limits certain amounts of free      television time, plus the right to purchase additional time      at reduced rates, and give them a reduced rate for mailing to      state voters; limit their receipt of out-of-state      contributions by requiring them to receive 60 percent of the      contributions to their campaign from individuals in their own      states or districts; and prohibit candidates who do not agree      to be bound by the spending limits from receiving PAC      contributions, require them to pay full rates for      broadcasting and postage, raise the limits on contributions      to their opponents from $1,000 to $2,000, and raise the      expenditure limits of their opponents by 20 percent.       Restrictions on soft money: Bar federal officeholders,      candidates, and national political parties from accepting      unregulated contributions; subject all election-year      expenditures and disbursements by political parties,      including state and local parties that ``might affect the      outcome of a federal election''--including those for voter      registration, get-out-the-vote drives, generic campaign      activities, and any communication that identifies a federal      candidate--to the full panoply of Federal Election Campaign      Act (FECA) restrictions and compliance and regulatory rules.       Controls on ``issue advocacy'': Regulate communications      that do not contain words of ``express advocacy'' as defined      by the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo (i.e.,      communications that do not ``in express terms advocate the      election or defeat of a clearly defined candidate for federal      office'').\6\ Define ``issue advocacy'' to include a broader      range of communications than does ``express advocacy'';      regulate it by subjecting groups funding issue advocacy      communications to FECA disclosure requirements and      controlling the content of issue advocacy communications      by requiring disclosure of funding sources and disclaimers      of candidate advocacy.       Free TV: In exchange for, and as a ``public service''      condition of, the allocation to them of spectrum space,      require broadcasters to provide substantial amounts of free      air time to all candidates for federal office. Require      candidates to appear in person in the free time provided to      them and to speak for themselves.       Expand Federal Election Commission enforcement powers:      Grant broad new enforcement powers to the Federal Election      Commission, including the right to go to court to seek an      injunction against potential offenders on the ground that      there is a substantial likelihood that a violation is about      to occur.              first amendment analysis: general principles                         The Buckley Framework       To be constitutional, the proposals outlined above must not      violate principles of political freedom and free political      speech as protected under the First Amendment. The      cornerstone of the Supreme Court's First Amendment      jurisprudence in this area is Buckley. In that case the Court      decided several challenges to the FECA amendments of 1974.\7\      FECA was at that time Congress's most ambitious effort at      election campaign reform. According to its defenders, the act      was designed to equalize access to and purify the political      process by ridding it of corruption and the appearance of      corruption. Among other things, the plaintiffs in Buckley      challenged the act's stringent limitations on the amounts of      money individuals could contribute to and spend on campaigns      for federal office and the act's provisions for public      funding of presidential candidates who agreed to abide by      spending limits during their campaigns. The Court sustained      the provisions for public funding of presidential campaigns      and the contribution limitations. It invalidated the      expenditure limitations.       In resolving the Buckley challenges, the Court correctly      took as its central premises that ``a major purpose of [the      First] Amendment was to protect the free discussion of      governmental affairs'' and that contribution and expenditure      limitations ``operate in an area of the most fundamental      First Amendment activities.'' \8\ Pursuant to conventional      canons of First Amendment review, that meant that      contributions and expenditure limitations would be subject to      ``strict scrutiny'' by the Court and would not survive unless      they were found to serve a ``compelling state interest''      using the ``least restrictive means.'' Due to differences it      perceived in the relative magnitudes of the First Amendment      interests, the Court distinguished between limits on      contributions of money to politicians or their campaigns and      limits on campaign expenditures by citizens and candidates. A      contribution limit, said the Court, ``entails only a marginal      restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free      communication,'' \9\ because ``the transformation of      contributions into political debate involves speech by      someone other than the contributor.'' \10\ Hence, such limits      could presumably be evaluated using a slightly more lenient      standard of review.\11\ Limits on expenditures, on the other      hand, ``represent substantial rather than merely theoretical      restraints on the quantity and diversity of political      speech.'' \12\       Thus, whereas the Court strongly suggested that limitations      on expenditures may well run afoul of the First Amendment      regardless of the context or the purported justification for      their imposition, it held that limitations on contributions      are constitutional if their purpose is the compelling one of      preventing corruption (i.e., ``the attempt to secure a      political quid pro quo from current and potential      officeholders'') \13\ or the appearance of corruption. Of      particular importance to today's debate, the Court rejected      equalization of political power as even a permissible, much      less a compelling, justification for restrictions on either      contributions or spending, observing that ``the concept that      government may restrict the speech of some elements in our      society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is      wholly foreign to the First Amendment.'' \14\       Buckley has proven remarkably robust and has provided the      doctrinal framework for all seven of the major campaign      finance cases that the Court has since decided. In each of      those cases (briefly summarized in the Appendix), the Court      has remained committed to Buckley's major conclusions. That      is not to say that the Buckley framework has gone      unchallenged within the Court itself.\15\ Still, taken as a      whole, Buckley and its progeny stand foursquare for the      following doctrinal generalizations. Because they represent      governmentally imposed constraints on political activity,       Restrictions on political contributions and expenditures      infringe on rights of speech and association. Therefore, the      Court will strictly scrutinize such restrictions, even      when they are directed at corporations instead of at      individuals or groups.       Limits on independent expenditures by individuals and      political groups are likely to be unconstitutional regardless      of the context or the purported justification.       Preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption      remains the ``single narrow exception to the rule that limits      on political activity'' are contrary to the First      Amendment.\16\       Since a ballot measure offers no opportunity to corrupt      elected officials with either contributions or expenditures,      the First Amendment probably prohibits restrictions on both      contributions and expenditures in the context of ballot-     measure elections: both kinds of restrictions infringe on      First Amendment rights without countervailing benefit since      ``there is no significant state or public interest in      curtailing debate and discussion of a ballot measure.'' \17\       Equalization of political influence is not a permissible      justification for restrictions. The Court has never wavered      in its view that government may not restrict the speech of      some to enhance the relative voice of others.                      Applying Buckley: In General       How do the campaign finance regulations that are presently      being debated fare when subjected to analysis in light of the      Buckley framework and the First Amendment foundation upon      which it rests? The first step in the calculus of      constitutionality is to determine the extent to which each      proposal infringes on established First Amendment rights.      That step is doctrinally uncontroversial, its analytical path      clearly marked, for Buckley and its progeny unequivocally      establish that regulations of campaign contributions and      expenditures operate upon fundamental First Amendment rights      to free speech and free association.       Cynically claiming that that central premise of Buckley      represents nothing more than capitulation to the idea that      ``money talks,'' advocates of regulation mock and demean the      premise. In doing so, they miss the point entirely. Buckley      was not written on a blank First Amendment slate. Rather, it      was firmly grounded upon, and thus was the natural outgrowth      of, a long line of cases that affirmed that the core      principles of the First Amendment protected citizens' right      to speak, to publish, and to associate for political causes,      free from government interference or control. Contributing to      and spending money on political campaigns--whether to      advocate the election of particular candidates or to take      positions with respect to particular issues--was protected in      Buckley not because money talks but because the central      purpose of the First Amendment is to guarantee political      freedom. The amendment ensures that individual citizens may      exercise that freedom by speaking, discussing, publishing,      advocating, and persuading and that they may enhance their      individual voices by joining together in groups,      organizations, associations, and societies. The specific      rights of citizens to contribute to and spend money on      political campaigns are merely necessary corollaries of their      more general rights to speak freely and to associate with one      another to advocate causes in which they believe.       Having established that regulations of campaign      contributions and expenditures impinge on fundamental First      Amendment rights, the Court will then apply ``strict      scrutiny'' and sustain the regulations only if it finds that      they serve a compelling government interest and use the least      restrictive means to do so. The analytical task implicit in      those second and third steps in the constitutional calculus      is the identification and evaluation of the government      interests that supposedly support regulation and the      appraisal of the means deployed to serve those interests.       Performing that task is not as easy as its doctrinal      formulation suggests. Although the Court has clearly      commanded that strict scrutiny is required, it has not always      adhered to the implications of that command by engaging in      rigorous examination of both proffered ends and the means      chosen to achieve them. In fact, the Court has occasionally      been highly deferential and credulous in its assessments of      ends and means, making prediction in the present case an      uncertain undertaking. Still, if the integrity of First      Amendment principles is to be preserved, it is critically      important that both legislators and judges take great care      that rhetoric and assertion not substitute for the careful      analysis that truly strict scrutiny requires. For that      reason, the analysis that follows will attempt not merely to      summarize but to examine skeptically the arguments and the      rhetorical strategies of the advocates of regulation.                  Applying Buckley: Specific Proposals       The PAC Ban       In Buckley, the Supreme Court held that the only legitimate      and compelling government interest in restricting campaign      contributions and expenditures is to prevent corruption or      the appearance of corruption. And the Court defined      corruption precisely and narrowly as entailing a financial      quid pro quo: dollars for political favors.       Despite that, advocates of the PAC ban offer justifications      unrelated to preventing corruption as the Court defined it in      Buckely. Instead, such justifications as they offer are      directed, in vague terms, at reforming ``an unresponsive      government and a political process that has grown      increasingly mean-spirited''--a view reformers seem to      believe is universally shared. Regarding contribution      prohibitions, reformers condemn unspecified ``elected      officials who listen more to big money and Washington      lobbyists than to their own constituents''; they decry the      ``influence-money culture'' and claim that ``our political      system is rigged to benefit campaign contributors and      incumbent officeholders at the great expense of citizens'';      and they see an ``inherent problem''--the nature of which      they do not define--``with a system in which individuals and      groups with an interest in government decisions can give      substantial sums of money to elected officials who have the      power to make those decisions.''\18\ At bottom, the      justification they offer seems to be that special-interest      PAC contributions are a dominant force in the financing of      federal election campaigns, that members of Congress are      dependent on them and influenced by them, that the giving of      PAC money is linked to the particular PAC's legislative      agenda, and that PAC money goes overwhelmingly to incumbents.      Thus, they justify the PAC expenditure ban not with reference      to preventing corruption but on the ground that it is a      loophole-closing measure: if independent PAC expenditures      continue to be permitted for ``purposes of influencing any      election for Federal office,'' they will undermine the      ability of the contribution prohibitions to achieve their      purpose of preventing PACs from wielding influence.       Buckley and its progeny signal quite clearly that those      ``justifications'' for the PAC contributions and expenditure      ban are neither legitimate nor compelling. The rhetorical      parade of horribles cited by the advocates of increased      regulation simply does not amount to corruption as the Court      has defined it; thus, curing the system of them is not      corruption prevention. Even if ridding the political system      of the influence of big money and Washington lobbyists were      somehow transformed into legitimate ends of government, a      total ban on PAC contributions could not survive, for it is      grossly over inclusive. Eliminating all political committee      activity is not narrowly tailored, nor is it the least      restrictive means of ridding the system of the influence of      the money culture.       Unless the advocates of increased regulation truly intend      to denounce all political alliances--regardless of whether      they be ideological, issue driven, or public spirited--on the      ground that they are all, in the very nature of things, bound      to represent special interests, and unless they think that      all attempts by individuals to maximize their political      voices by joining together with others of like mind present      an inherent problem, it is impossible to imagine how they      could justify such a draconian measure as a total ban on PAC      giving and spending. Cutting the heart out of the freedom of      political speech and association, and conferring what would      amount to a permanent monopoly on political parties, is      neither necessary nor a narrowly tailored means for attaining      even the ill-defined--and probably illegitimate--goal of      eliminating the influence of big money and Washington      lobbyists.       The PAC Ban Fallback. The fallback provision--which would      lower the permissible amount of PAC contributions from $5,000      to $1,000 per election and would go into effect if or, more      accurately, when the total ban on PAC contributions was      declared unconstitutional--allegedly serves the same interest      as the total ban. Since it aims to reduce rather than      prohibit permissible contributions, the fallback provision      might appear on its face to be less problematic than the      total ban. That appearance is deceptive. Although the Court      stated in Buckley that contribution limits are easier to      defend than expenditure limits, it held that strict scrutiny      was appropriate for both. Thus, the contribution limits of      the fallback provision must run the same strict scrutiny      gauntlet, and their chances of surviving are slim to none.       First, note again that the advocates have not claimed      during the course of recent debates that the interest being      served by reducing the contribution limit from $5,000 to      $1,000 is that of preventing corruption in the Buckley sense.      It seems quite implausible to assert that any politician      would be corrupted--or even appear to be corrupted--in the      quid pro quo sense by a single contribution of even $5,000.      Instead, the interest that the contribution reduction would      serve is, again, the diffuse one of ending the ``dominance''      and ``influence'' of PACs. Thus, the problem the fallback      limitation confronts at the outset is that, even if precisely      defined, it serves an interest that has never been held to      be either legitimate or compelling. And second, instead of      being narrowly tailored, the limitation appears quite ill-     suited to serve the interest asserted for it. Indeed, it      is difficult to identify any interest that would be served      by making it so much more difficut than it presently is      for candidates to raise money: candidates will hardly be      less distracted by fundraising if they have to raise money      from even greater numbers of people because of the smaller      amounts that any one individual or PAC may contribute.       Both the contribution ban and the fallback treat all PACs      alike, as though whatever cause they espouse and however      great (or limited) their resources, they all pose precisely      the same danger--and the same degree of danger--of      undermining the integrity of our political process. But given      the enormous range and diversity of interests that PACs      represent, treating them all alike makes little sense--and      certainly fails the narrowly tailored, least restrictive      means test. Moreover, it is important to note that even while      it was sustaining the particular contribution limits in      Buckley, the Court ``cautioned . . . that if the contribution      limits were too low, the limits could be unconstitutional.''      \19\ Thus, contribution limits so low as significantly to      impair the regulated party's ability to exercise First      Amendment rights (as a $1,000 limit on PAC contributions      would surely do) or so unreasonably below an amount that      would give legitimate rise to a perception that the      contributor was acquiring ``undue influence'' (as the $1,000      limit would surely be) are constitutionally vulnerable.       The only interest served by the fallback provision's ban on      the bundling of small individual contributions to PACs would      be that of preventing evasion of the contribution limitation.      The bundling ban, however, represents a different sort of      burden on First Amendment rights than does the      constitutionally doubtful contribution limitation, which it      supposedly serves as a backstop. For the bundling ban      directly burdens the associational rights of individual PAC      contributors. The Supreme Court recognizes that the right to      associate is a ``basic constitutional freedom'' \20\ and has      stated repeatedly that ``the practice of persons sharing     common views banding together to achieve a common end is      deeply embedded in the American political process.'' \21\       Advocates of the bundling ban claim that it is necessary to      forestall PACs' evading the contribution limitations. Thus,      whether the ban serves a compelling state interest will      depend upon whether the interest served by the contribution      limitations survives review and, if so, whether the ban is      narrowly tailored--whether the Court sanctions a one-size-     fits-all prohibition. Since the contribution limitations are      unlikely to survive review, and since the one-size-fits-all      prohibition is a clumsy solution in any event, the bundling      ban is likely to be even more vulnerable than the      contribution limitation it serves.       The fallback's prohibition of PAC contributions that raise      any candidate's PAC receipts above 20 percent of campaign      expenditure ceilings would also, to a large extent, stand or      fall with the contribution limitations themselves, since the      prohibition is defended in terms of its ability to strengthen      the contribution limitations. The First Amendment burden of      the 20-percent-of-expenditure limitation is more onerous than      first appears, however, for after the 20 percent limit is      reached the so-called limitation has the effect of a total      ban. How such a limit would serve a corruption-prevention      objective, moreover, is very difficult to discern. Corruption      arises when large contributions are exchanged for particular      political favors. If PAC contributions are not individually      large enough to create a risk of corruption or its      appearance, the fact that a candidate receives many of them--     even were he to receive 100 percent of his campaign funding      from them--simply does not increase the risk that he will be      corrupted. Thus, the 20-percent-of-expenditure limitation not      only is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state      interest in preventing corruption or its appearance but also      is not tailored to serve any identifiable or legitimate      interest at all.       Finally, the attempt to redefine ``independent      expenditure''--and, in particular, to redefine ``express      advocacy'' so as to include any and all partisan      communications--runs flatly counter to the Buckley Court's      explicit effort to immunize issue advocacy from regulation or      restriction: ``So long as persons or groups eschew      expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to      spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his      views.'' \22\                     ``Voluntary'' Spending Limits       The proposals for voluntary spending limits keyed to      relevant voting age populations are said to serve the      interest in curbing excessive and even obscene campaign      spending. Spending limits will hold down the costs of running      for office and thus prevent one candidate from having an      excessive advantage over another by reason of spending more.      The limits are also touted for their supposed ability to      redress the present imbalance in favor of incumbents (who      have a grossly unfair advantage in fundraising because      most PAC money goes to them).       Mandatory spending limits confront an impenetrable      constitutional wall. The Supreme Court said in Buckley that      expenditure limits simply do not serve to prevent corruption      or the appearance of corruption in the electoral process,      which is the only justification that the Court has ever      accepted for limiting political expression. Indeed, the Court      went further. It explicitly denounced the other      justifications for spending limits that proponents had      offered in Buckley, namely equalizing speech resources and      stemming the rising cost of political campaigns. Because it      represents such an unequivocal endorsement of freedom from      government as the underlying conception of the First      Amendment, the Court's aversion to restricting the voices of      some in order to enhance the voices of others is worth      emphasizing. Moreover, because it represents such a clear and      definite rejection of the paternalism of those who think they      know how much is too much to spend on political campaigning,      it is worth quoting the Court's confirmation that ``the mere      growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of      itself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the      quantity of campaign spending and the resulting limitation on      the scope of federal campaigns . . . In the free society      ordained by our Constitution it is not the government, but      the people--individually as citizens and candidates and      collectively as associations and political committees--who      must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on      public issues in a political campaign.'' \23\       It is, of course, because mandatory spending limits are so      clearly unconstitutional that advocates of the proposed      spending limits insist that they be voluntary. The      transparent objective is to fit the limits into the safe      harbor that the Buckley Court provided when it qualified its      rejection of expenditure limitations by the following      footnote:       ``Congress may engage in public funding of election      campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an      agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure      limitations. Just as a candidate may voluntarily limit the      size of the contributions he chooses to accept, he may decide      to forgo private fundraising and accept public funding.''      \24\       For a number of reasons, all reflecting the magnitude of      the benefits and burdens attached to accepting or not      accepting the limits, it is pure fiction to call them      voluntary. They simply do not fit the Buckley proviso. To be      specific, significant benefits are promised to those who      accept the voluntary limits: candidates become eligible for      free and reduced-rate television time \25\ and reduced      mailing rates while their opponents who do not accept the      voluntary limits receive neither free time nor reduced rates.      Moreover, candidates who agree to voluntary contribution      limits when their opponents do not get an added benefit--     their contribution limits and expenditure ceilings are      raised. But burdens come with the benefits as well:      candidates who volunteer to comply with the spending limits      must demonstrate a threshold level of support (by raising 10      percent of the limit) before becoming eligible for the      benefits; they must agree to raise 60 percent of their funds      from individuals who reside in their own states or districts;      and they must agree to limit the use of their own resources.      In addition, they cannot use their free air time for      commercials of less than 30 seconds in length.       When the Court in Buckley sustained the exchange of a      presidential candidate's right to make unlimited expenditures      in his own behalf for the right to receive public funding, it      did so because it concluded that the purpose of public      funding ``was not to abridge, restrict, or censor speech, but      rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public      discussion and participation in the electoral process.'' \26\      The purpose of the current proposals to impose voluntary      spending limitations along with their accompanying burdens      and benefits, however, is quite different.       In the first place, the limits are not imposed in exchange      for receipt of public funding and thus could not be defended      as necessary to protect the integrity of a government-funded      program. Second, the effect of the proposed expenditure      limitations--whether they are deemed voluntary or not--will      be to reduce substantially the quantity of campaign speech.      Indeed, that must be their purpose, since the restrictions      are explicitly motivated by the objective of reducing      excessive spending. As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals      recently noted when evaluating analogous provisions of state      campaign finance restrictions, one is ``hard-pressed to      discern how the interests of good government could possibly      be served by campaign expenditure laws that necessarily have      the effect of limiting the quantity of political speech in      which candidates for public office are allowed to engage.''      \27\       The spending limitations also do not serve the posited goal      of creating a level playing field between incumbents and      challengers because the limitations fail to dissipate the      already significant advantages of incumbency. Incumbents      begin every electoral race with important advantages;      equalizing the amount of money that incumbents and      challengers can spend would simply make permanent the      incumbent advantages that already exist. When the spending      limits are combined with the proposed new restrictions on      contributions and the increasingly complicated system of      fundraising for challengers, they appear narrowly tailored      not to level the playing field for challengers but instead to      transform a challenger's initial disadvantage into a      practically insurmountable barrier. That is the reason the      proposals are so susceptible to the charge of being      incumbent-protection measures.                          Limits on Soft Money       Advocates of increased regulation of campaign finance often      assert that soft money is the most dangerous and destructive      money in the political system today. Soft money is money      contributed by individuals, corporations, unions, and the      like to the national and state parties for party-building      activities, voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives,      and generic issue- (rather than candidate-) oriented      advertising. It is not subject to contribution limitations      imposed by FECA because it is not used to advocate expressly      the election of any clearly identified candidate. Reformers      want to ban soft money because they believe that even though      it does not go to support particular candidates it      nevertheless has the unseemly propensity to influence      elections. Thus, it invites wholesale evasion of the      contribution limits now in place.       The reformers are right, of course: soft money does      influence elections. But the resort to soft-money      contributions is exactly what one would expect when people      are prohibited from giving more directly.       Yet a ban on soft-money contributions would amount to an      unprecedented restriction on political activity, one whose      justification is not compelling and whose scope far exceeds      what the First Amendment allows. Advocates of a soft-money      ban defend it as a contribution-limitation-loophole-closing      device: corporations and unions that would not otherwise be      permitted to contribute to candidates' campaigns make large      soft-money donations to political parties; and individuals      often contribute soft money in excess of the amount they      would be entitled to contribute to particular candidates.      Such arguments assume, of course, that contribution      limitations represent an appropriate and inviolable ceiling      on the amount of money that individuals, corporations, and      unions should be allowed to contribute to the political      process whether or not the contribution funds speech that      creates a risk of quid pro quo corruption of particular      candidates. Thus, supporters of the ban make no pretense of      establishing a link between soft-money contributions and the      appearance or reality of candidate corruption that alone     provides a constitutional predicate for regulation.\28\       Calling the soft-money contribution ban a contribution-     limit-loophole closure does not change the basic fact,      however: soft money does not fund speech that ``in express      terms advocate[s] the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate for federal office,'' which is the only      kind of speech for which the Court has held that      contributions may be constitutionally restricted.\29\ To      regulate contributions for speech that is other than express      advocacy of the election of particular candidates, the Court      said, would create intractable vagueness problems and cause      unacceptable chilling of protected, issue-oriented political      speech. It would, in other words, thwart speech debating the      merits of government policies and addressing the public      issues that are at stake in an election--the very kind of      speech that the First Amendment was written primarily to      protect. Thus, because a ban on soft money aims directly and      indiscriminately at core political activity, and because its      proponents have not made their case that soft-money      contributions pose a danger of quid pro quo corruption, the      ban could not pass muster as a finely tuned means of      achieving a compelling state interest.       Also bearing on the First Amendment implications of a ban      on soft money is the Court's recent decision in Colorado      Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, which held      limits on independent expenditures by political parties--     expenditures not coordinated with any candidate--to be      unconstitutional. The independent expression of a political      party's views, the Court affirmed, is core First Amendment      activity, and limits on it cannot be justified with reference      to a corruption-prevention rationale. Indeed, although the      majority of the Court did not reach or address the issue,      four justices expressed the further view that, given the      practical identity of interests between party and candidate      during an election, the corruption-prevention rationale for      sustaining limitations on contributions did not support any      limits on party spending, whether coordinated with the      candidate or not. Although present law makes coordinated      spending illegal, Justice Thomas pointedly questioned its      rationale: ``What could it mean for a party to `corrupt'      its candidate or to exercise `coercive' influence over      him?'' \30\ If the Court were to decide, when squarely      facing the issue, that party spending on political      activity cannot be limited, whether or not coordinated,      then contributions to the party to make those expenditures      would likewise seem to be protected from regulation. In      sum, from constitutional perspective, restrictions on soft      money are among the least defensible proposals for      campaign finance reform. Indeed, arguments purporting to      support such restrictions serve only to raise questions      about limits on direct contributions.                             Issue Advocacy       Insofar as they entail broadening the reach of campaign      speech regulation to include speech that does not ``in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate for federal office,'' proposals to      control issue advocacy are constitutionally inform for the      same reason that the soft-money ban is constitutionally      infirm: they would regulate--and thus unacceptably chill--     core political speech about the merits of policies and the      proper resolution of public issues without a corruption-     prevention rationale for doing so. Proponents of controls on      issue advocacy claim that controls are necessary to prevent      the acquisition of undue influence by advocates of particular      issues. There is, however, no constitutional warrant or means      for calibrating what constitutes ``undue'' influence, for the      Constitution does not permit, nor does it provide, a metric      for discerning how much influence is enough. We have no      constitutional Goldilocks to say when the amount of influence      possessed by advocates of particular positions is ``just      right.'' The inherent payoff for political participation in a      democracy is the acquisition of influence, and it is the      function of the First Amendment to protect efforts to acquire      it, not to limit or constrain them.\31\       The constitutionality of proposals for regulation, insofar      as they require disclosure by groups engaging in issue      advocacy, is seriously jeopardized by McIntyre v. Ohio      Electrons Commission.\32\ In McIntyre, the Court had before      it an Ohio statute that prohibited the distribution of      anonymous campaign literature. Because the statute was a      regulation of core political speech, the Court subjected it      to strict scrutiny; and, because the statute did not serve a      compelling state interest using the least restrictive means,      the Court proceeded to strike it down. Unpersuaded that the      ban was justified by Ohio's asserted interests either in      preventing fraudulent and libelous statements or in providing      voters with relevant information, the Court also could find      no support for the statute in either First National Bank of      Boston v. Bellotti \33\ or in arguably relevant portions of      Buckley.       In Bellotti, the Court invalidated a state law that      prohibited corporations from spending money on speech      designed to influence the outcome of referenda. In the course      of doing so, the Court commented in dicta on the possibility      that a requirement that the sponsor of corporate advertising      be identified might be thought to be permissible on account      of its ``prophylactic effect.'' The McIntyre Court realized      that the context of the Bellotti statement--expenditures by      corporations--was not the same as the context of the Ohio      statute, which purported to regulate independent expenditures      by an individual. And whereas in Buckley the Court sustained      mandatory reporting of independent expenditures in excess of      a threshold level, the justices noted in McIntyre that the      independent expenditures to which the disclosure requirement      applied had been construed to mean only those expenditures      that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate.\34\ Thus, in Buckley there was a      corruption-prevention rationale to support the expenditure-     disclosure requirement. Such a rationale would lend only the      most tenuous possible support to required disclosures of      issue advocacy.       McIntyre does not purport completely to foreclose      disclosure or reporting requirements with respect to      independent expenditures. It does, however, reaffirm the      Court's commitment to scrutinize strictly such requirements      in order to preserve the right to engage in issue advocacy      unencumbered by regulations that burden speech without      producing a reciprocal benefit in corruption prevention.                                Free TV       The proposals to require broadcasters to provide ``free''      TV time to federal candidates do not come under the Buckley      rubric. Instead, insofar as they apply to broadcasters, their      constitutionality is a function of the unique First Amendment      jurisprudence that the Court has developed for the electronic      media. That jurisprudence had its beginnings in Red Lion      Broadcasting Co. v. FCC,\35\ in which the Court, pointing to      ``spectrum scarcity,'' upheld the Federal Communication      Commission's rule that those attacked editorially by the      broadcast media had a right of reply. Thus it denied the      broadcasters' First Amendment claim that such an obligation      impinged on their editorial freedom.       It is clear beyond peradventure that Congress could not      constitutionally compel the print media to provide free space      to similarly situated political candidates.\36\ Red Lion      sanctioned a different set of First Amendment rules for the      broadcast media because the Court was persuaded that the      scarcity of broadcast spectrum warranted content      regulation of spectrum licensees' programming in the      interests of diversity and fairness.       Many commentators questioned the rationality of the      spectrum scarcity argument even at the time Red Lion was      decided.\37\ Regardless of whether it provided a plausible      rationale at that time, however, spectrum scarcity has been      rendered obsolete by the advent of cable and other      technological advances. And courts, too, have increasingly      criticized the argument as a justification for government      control of the content of broadcast programming.\38\       There is no longer a factual foundation for the argument      that spectrum scarcity entitles the government, in the public      interest, to control the content of broadcast speech. Without      the spectrum scarcity rationale to support it, the attempt to      control broadcasters' speech by requiring them to provide      free TV time to candidates for office would seem doomed to      constitutional failure. Even were the spectrum scarcity      rationale still viable, the Court has never held that Red      Lion sanctioned ``government regulations that impose      specifically defined affirmative programming requirements on      broadcasters.'' \39\ The Court has been suspicious of any      government action that ``requires the utterance of a      particular message favored by the Government,'' and it has      been alert to guard against the ``risk that Government seeks      not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal but to suppress      unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public      debate through coercion rather than persuasion.'' \40\       With respect to all speakers except the broadcast media,      and most certainly with respect to candidates for political      office, it goes almost without saying that any attempt by the      government to dictate the format or control the content of      speech is constitutionally suspect. In addition to commanding      broadcasters to donate time so that political candidates may      speak, the free TV proposals contemplate requiring candidates      themselves, and not any surrogates, to speak in the donated      time, thus dictating the format of their speech; and several      suggestions have been made that the candidates must not      engage in ``negative'' campaigning if they are to receive the      free time, thus controlling the content of their entire      speech. Those highly questionable aspects of the free TV      proposals cannot be defended on the ground that the      government, in pursuit of the public interest, is subsidizing      certain candidate speech--thus conditioning receipt of its      funds on the candidates' agreement to respect the contours of      the government program. Such was the rationale that underlay      the Court's holding in Rust v. Sullivan,\41\ where the      Department of Health and Human Services' ``gag rule''      prohibited recipients of federal family planning funds from      providing abortion information. The Rust rationale could not      support the format and content controls envisaged by the free      TV proponents for the simple reason that the speech would be      subsidized not by the taxpayers but by the broadcasters.\42\       In fact, what the free TV time proposals contemplate seems      to be a bold end-run around traditional and well-established      First Amendment principles. The broadcasters have no First      Amendment right to resist compliance, proponents say, because      spectrum scarcity permits the government to     regulate their editorial judgments in the public interest.      And the candidates have no First Amendment right to resist      compliance with format or content controls because they are      being permitted to speak for free. As the analysis above has      demonstrated, the First Amendment stands as a more effective      defense of freedom than the proponents imagine, and the      Supreme Court would surely have little difficulty detecting      the constitutional shell game that the free TV proposals      epitomize.        Expanded Federal Election Commission Enforcement Powers       Many of the proposals for increased regulation of campaign      finance envision a hugely enlarged enforcement role for the      already overburdened and generally ineffectual Federal      Election Commission.\43\ The wisdom of imposing such a      monumental burden on any federal agency, much less on this      particular one, is questionable; but whether the enforcement      mechanisms that Congress devises for implementing particular      regulatory strategies are feasible or not does not usually      raise First Amendment issues.       One enforcement proposal does raise such issues, however:      the proposal to give the FEC power to seek to enjoin      potential offenders on the ground that ``there is a      substantial likelihood that a violation is about to occur.''      The proposal is vulnerable to two different First Amendment      challenges. The first involves vagueness. Many of the      proposed substantive violations are themselves vague, and the      ``substantial likelihood'' criterion for FEC action is also      vague. The threat of FEC action based on either vague element      of that ground would not only have an unacceptable chilling      effect on many activities that are not violations; more      significantly, it would also invite precisely the kind of      arbitrary exercise of government power that the vagueness      doctrine is designed to forestall.\44\       The second First Amendment challenge to giving the FEC      power to enjoin campaign activity involves prior restraint on      speech. Prior restraints are the ``most serious and the least      tolerable infringement of First Amendment rights,'' \45\ and      they will not be sustained unless the Court is convinced that      ``the gravity of the evil, discounted by its probability,      justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to      avoid the danger.'' \46\ It seems unlikely that the Court      would hold that the mere possibility of violating campaign      finance regulations poses the kind of threat to the national      interest that would justify imposing prior restraints on      speech, especially since the kind of speech put at risk by      such an injunction--political speech during the course of an      election campaign--lies at the very core of the First      Amendment.            the first amendment according to the regulators       When one looks at Supreme Court precedents--in particular      at Buckley and its progeny--the First Amendment case against      current proposals for more stringent campaign finance      regulations appears impregnable. But, given the vehemence and      surety with which those proposals are advocated, perhaps it      is well to look more closely both at the precedents for      Buckley and related cases and at the conception of the First      Amendment the reformers embrace and how that conception      differs from the First Amendment that is presently embodied      not only in our democratic traditions but in our supreme law.       An important question to ask is to what extent the      precedents--which stand as barriers to so-called reform      efforts--are rooted in traditions and ideas of freedom that      we wish to preserve. Buckley may be the cornerstone of the      Supreme Court's modern campaign finance jurisprudence, but it      is important to appreciate that it was not a novel, isolated      case. Rather, it was laid upon an already existing, solidly      constructed First Amendment foundation. Thus, to appreciate      its true significance, and understand what is at stake in the      present debate, it helps to see Buckley as sustaining a First      Amendment tradition that was already deeply embedded at the      time the case was decided. Buckley was one in a long and      continuing line of cases that have articulated and upheld, in      a wide variety of contexts, the principles of free political      speech and individual political freedom that lie at the very      heart of the First Amendment.       The Constitution is the fundamental charter of our      representative democracy, the embodiment of our right to      self-government and of all our corollary liberties. The First      Amendment's specification that ``Congress shall make no law .      . . abridging freedom of speech or of the press; or of the      right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition      the Government for a redress of grievances'' plays a crucial      role in determining the character of our democracy. ``A major      purpose of [the] Amendment was to protect the free discussion      of governmental affairs.'' \47\ Accordingly, it guarantees      that individual citizens may speak, publish, and join      together in groups to engage in political activity to try to      achieve the substantive ends they deem desirable.\48\ They      may attempt to persuade others and to acquire political      influence, and the government may not interfere with, punish,      repress, or otherwise impede their efforts.\49\       That conception of the First Amendment is fleshed out in      Supreme Court opinions that both pre- and post-date Buckley.      Those opinions make it clear that implicit in the First      Amendment guarantee of freedom from government control over      what citizens may say and with whom they may associate as      participants in the political process is the important      corollary that citizens may freely contribute or expend the      resources at their command--their intellect, their time,      their talent, their organizational or rhetorical skills,      their money--to or on political activity.\50\ The government      may not interfere in their efforts to persuade their fellow      citizens of the merits of particular proposals or of      particular candidates,\51\ nor may it disrupt the free      communication of their views,\52\ nor penalize them for      granting or withholding their support from elected officials      on the basis of the positions those officials espouse.\53\      Government may neither prescribe an official orthodoxy,\54\      require the affirmation of particular beliefs,\55\ nor compel      citizens to support causes or political activities with which      they disagree.\56\ Government may neither punish its critics      nor impose unnecessary burdens on their political      activity.\57\ Those are the bedrock principles of political      freedom with which Buckley and its progeny are consistent;      those are the principles that impelled the Buckley Court's      conclusion that government may not restrict independent      political expenditures and may limit political campaign      contributions only in the name of preventing corruption.       To remain faithful to those principles, one must be      vigilant to detect the costs to freedom lurking in reform      proposals that come dressed as benign efforts to achieve a      healthy politics. In the course of explaining why the First      Amendment should be amended, House Minority Leader Richard      Gephardt (D-Mo.) baldly stated that formal amendment was      needed so that Congress could enact new and      stringent campaign finance restrictions because ``[w]hat      we have is two important values in direct conflict:      freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in      a healthy democracy. You can't have both.'' \58\ That      breathtaking assertion performs a real service. It alerts      us to the fact that, in the eyes of advocates of reform,      freedom as we know it cannot survive an ambitious program      of campaign finance regulations. Of equal importance, it      begs the all-important questions about what a ``healthy      democracy'' would look like and why a healthy democracy is      not by definition one, like ours at present, in which      freedom of speech reigns.       Nevertheless, the regulatory proposals that have recently      been placed on the legislative agenda do claim to embody a      First Amendment vision of sorts. Based not on legal precedent      but crafted by legal scholars and judges who adumbrated it in      the pages of scholarly journals and treatises, the conception      of the First Amendment that animates proposals for campaign      finance regulation bears almost no resemblance to the      freedom-oriented conception that actual First Amendment      doctrine embodies. Indeed, it distorts our traditional      understandings of what the very words of the amendment mean      and imparts an extraordinary and unprecedented significance      to the phrase ``freedom of speech.'' Precisely because it      animates the present reform agenda, however, it warrants a      brief summary.       The conception of the First Amendment that underlies the      regulatory agenda of proponents of campaign finance reform is      best understood as a rejection of the traditional      understanding that freedom of speech necessarily implies      individual political liberty and the absence of substantive      or qualitative regulation of political debate. Proponents of      reform do not perceive that they utter a contradiction when      they assert that freedom of speech can be ``enhanced,'' \59\      its purposes ``furthered, not abridged,'' \60\ by legislation      that regulates and restricts political speech. That is      because the proponents of regulation believe that freedom is      a quality of political life that can be regulated into      existence rather than an aspect of democracy that government      regulation necessarily and by definition destroys. They think      that the guarantee of freedom of speech is in fact a grant of      power to, rather than a withholding of power from, the      government. With such power, government can control the      content of political debate and fix the political process so      that ``political reason-giving'' will prevail. Political      influence will be distributed equally among groups so that      ``people who are able to organize themselves in such a way as      to spend large amounts of cash [will] not [be] able to      influence politics more than people who are not similarly      able.'' \61\ Then money will no longer play a role in our      politics.       The regulators appear to distrust deeply the American      people. They unselfconsciously express the concern that      ``completely unregulated [i.e., free] political campaigns      will degenerate in such a way that the electorate would be      divested of its power to make a reasoned choice among the      candidates.''\62\ In other words, they believe that the      American people cannot be trusted with the choices and      political responsibilities entailed in a free political      system; instead, the government must regulate the political      process in order to help the people to make appropriate      decisions.       In the First Amendment context, three aspects of the      regulators' conception deserve particular emphasis. The first      has already been mentioned: the regulators' conception      perverts the meaning of the word ``freedom.''       Second, while decrying the polluting effect of wealth on      the democratic process and celebrating spending and      contribution restrictions purporting to keep the voices of      individual citizens from being drowned out, reformers exempt      the press from their reform proposals. In the recent debate,      of     course, the press has largely bemoaned the vices of the      current system, and ``its myth-making has been especially      important in the shaping of mass opinion about reform.'' \63\      Simply by virtue of their ability to influence the public      agenda, the media distort debate, and the distortion of the      political process that results from media treatment of      particular candidates or issues is likely to be      significant.\64\ The Supreme Court has explicitly eschewed      defining the rights of the press more broadly than speech      rights of ordinary citizens.\65\ Yet under the reformers'      conception of the First Amendment, the media and media      corporations enjoy privileges not enjoyed by ordinary      citizens.       The third noteworthy aspect of the reformers' conception of      the First Amendment is that the agenda that conception is      used to promote is neither premised on empirical analysis,      nor derived from established postulates, nor defended in      terms of predictions about testable results. Rather, it rests      on pejorative and highly charged rhetoric, is formulated in      ill-defined but evocative terms, and is defended with      extravagant claims about benign effects. Yet upon analysis,      the picture the regulators paint--both of political reality      and of the goals of reform--is so vague that it begs all the      important questions.       Thus, when the late Judge Skelly Wright, long in the reform      camp, surveyed the political process, he was dismayed to find      ``the polluting effect of money in election campaigns.'' He      worried that ``[c]oncentrated wealth . . . threaten[ed] to      distort political campaigns and referenda,'' and he announced      that ``[t]he voices of individual citizens are being drowned      out'' by the ``unholy alliance of big spending, special      interests, and election victory.'' \66\ Similarly, Professor      Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago more recently      asserted that ```[m]any people think that the present system      of campaign financing distorts the system of free expression,      by allowing people with wealth to drown out people without      it. . . . [C]ampaign finance laws might be thought to promote      the purpose of the system of free expression, which is to      ensure a well-functioning deliberative process among      political equals.'' \67\       What do all those words mean? What does the ``pure      political process''--the one that is being ``polluted''--     actually look like? How rich are ``people with wealth''? How      poor are ``people without it''? Apart from one person, one      vote, what does it mean to be a ``political equal''? If it      means that one cannot legitimately attempt to acquire any      more political influence than anyone else has, what point is      there in participating in even a ``well-functioning      deliberative process''? And why isn't the individual      political freedom that is guaranteed by present First      Amendment doctrine the best means of securing a ``well-     functioning'' democracy?       The reason questions like those are important is that the      Supreme Court engages in strict scrutiny of legislation that      restricts campaign giving and spending. That requires the      Court to analyze carefully the asserted relationships between      ends and means--a process that can hardly go forward when the      ends of the legislation cannot be precisely defined and the      means can be rhetorically invoked but not actually spelled      out. Moreover, since campaign finance reforms have so often      turned out to have unintended--indeed perverse--consequences      for the political process, and since past reforms, far from      having leveled the political playing field, have only      entrenched incumbents, it appears doubly important that the      goals of proposed new regulations be precisely specified and      that the means chosen to achieve them be persuasively shown      to be well targeted and genuinely likely to hit their mark.                               conclusion       In conclusion, current proposals for new regulation of      federal election campaign finance practices are      constitutionally indefensible. In their general conception,      they are nothing short of a practically complete rejection of      the individual and associational rights of expression and      political participation that the First Amendment guarantees.      In their specifics, the governmental interests they claim to      serve are neither compelling nor even legitimate. And the      means they deploy are neither the least restrictive nor      finely tailored. If they were to be enacted, and were      challenged in court and subjected to genuinely strict      scrutiny, none of the proposed regulations could survive      review. They could survive only if the Supreme Court decided      to amend the First Amendment by judicial fiat.                      appendix: buckley's progeny       Bellotti, widely known as the ``corporate speech'' case,      invalidated a Massachusetts law that prohibited banks and      business corporations from making expenditures to influence      the vote on ballot referenda that did not materially affect      their business, property, or assets. The Court strictly      scrutinized the state interests asserted in behalf of the      statute and the relationship between those interests and the      spending limitations alleged to be the means of securing them      and rather easily concluded that there was an insufficient      means-end relationship to justify the limitations.       Sustaining FEC limits on the amount of money that an      unincorporated association is permitted to give to a      multicandidate political committee, the Court in California      Medical Association v. Federal Election Commission engaged in      lenient review. Contributions are ``speech by proxy,'' the      Court declared, so limiting them did not ``restrict the      ability of individuals to engage in protected political      advocacy.'' \68\       Insisting that ``there is no significant state or public      interest in curtailing debate and discussion of a ballot      measure,'' the Court in Citizens against Rent Control v. City      of Berkeley \69\ strictly scrutinized a limitation on      contributions to committees formed to support or oppose      ballot measures. It invalidated the limitation.       Federal Election Commission v. National Right to Work      Committee was a challenge to a section of FECA that limited      the National Right to Work Committee to solicitation      of ``members.'' Declaring that it would not ``second-guess      a legislative determination as to the need for      prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil      feared,''\70\ the Court narrowly construed the section      and, as so construed, sustained it against a First      Amendment challenge.       But in the next case, Federal Election Commission v.      National Conservative Political Action Committee,\71\ the      Court reasserted its intention and authority strictly to      scrutinize corruption-prevention justifications, at least      when they were offered in support of limitations on      expenditures. The decision invalidated Sec. 9012(f) of the      Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act, which prohibited      political committees from making independent expenditures in      excess of $1,000 to support the election of a presidential      candidate who had opted to receive public funding. ``When the      First Amendment is involved,'' then-Justice Rehnquist said, a      ``rigorous'' standard of review is called for and deference      to a legislative judgment is appropriate only ``where the      evil of potential corruption had long been recognized.''\72\       Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for      Life\73\ was the next major campaign finance reform case.      Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a nonprofit, nonstock      corporation organized to ``foster respect for human life and      to defend the right to life of all human beings . . . through      . . . political . . . activities,'' violated FECA      restrictions on independent spending by corporations when it      financed a special edition of its newsletter in which it      identified and advocated the election of ``pro-life''      candidates. The Court held, however, that as applied to      MCFL's expenditure in this case FECA was unconstitutional.      First, it burdened the right of the organization to make      independent expenditures--``expression at the core of our      electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms.''\74\      Second, because ``it was formed to disseminate political      ideas, not to amass capital,''\75\ MCFL did not pose a threat      of ``unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes,''      nor did it ``pose [a] danger of corruption.''\76\ Thus the      ``concerns underlying the regulation of corporate political      activity are simply absent with regard to MCFL.''\77\ The      commission's argument that it needed a broad prophylactic      rule like the one the Court had sustained in National Right      to Work Committee did not persuade the Court. National Right      to Work Committee involved restrictions on solicitation for a      political committee that made contributions to candidates,      whereas the regulation at issue in MCFL was a restriction on      independent expenditures; moreover, the administrative      convenience of a bright-line rule is of insufficient weight      to count as a compelling interest in treating two unlike      entities--business corporations and groups like MCFL--alike.       The particular restrictions on independent expenditures at      issue in MCFL were held unconstitutional. On the way to      reaching that result, however, the Court appeared to suggest      that if MCFL had been an ``ordinary'' corporation--one that      posed a threat of corruption by ``unfair deployment of wealth      for political purposes'' instead of one formed for the      particular purpose of engaging in political advocacy--the      case might have come out differently.       That suggestion bore fruit in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of      Commerce,\78\ in which the Court sustained a state law      prohibiting the use of corporate treasury funds to make      independent expenditures in support of or in opposition to      candidates in elections for state office. The state defended      the expenditure prohibition on the ground that ``the unique      legal and economic characteristics of corporations      necessitate some regulation of their political expenditures      to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.''      Justice Marshall's majority opinion upholding the restriction      accepted that formulation of the corruption-prevention      rationale and in doing so seemingly embraced a conception of      legislative power to define and prevent ``corruption''      different from, more expansive than, and much less precise      than that which the Buckley court had endorsed. Buckley and      its progeny had limited legislative power to define      corruption by focusing on corruption's deleterious effect on      the integrity of elected officials. Corruption that      legislatures may prevent occurs only when ``[e]lected      officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations      of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or      infusions of money into their campaigns. The hallmark of      corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for      political favors.''\79\ The Austin opinion implied that      legislatures could choose to define ``corruption'' to include      imprecisely defined untoward effects that spending might have      not just on the behavior of elected officials but also on the      electoral process itself.\80\       Although it may signal a departure from Buckley's limiting      principles, the precise extent to which Austin undermines      Buckley's     constraints on legislative power to define corruption remains      unclear for at least two reasons. First, the Austin Court      made much of the fact that the restriction at issue there was      imposed on corporate expenditure of treasury funds, thus      hinting that had the prohibition applied to independent      expenditures by individuals, or even by separate segregated      corporate political action committees, the result would have      been different and the prohibition would have been struck      down. Second, Justice Marshall's opinion is obscure about      the meaning it ascribes to the term ``corruption.''      Although the opinion is larded with prejorative and      evocative references to the ``influence of political war      chests''\81\ and the ``corrosive and distorting effects of      immense aggregations of wealth,''\82\ it does not describe      a normative baseline of legitimacy that would permit a      disinterested observer to detect a genuine threat of      ``corruption'' in any particular campaign finance      practice. The most the opinion does in that regard is to      suggest that the distortion that is a permissible target      of the legislature's concern stems from the fact that      ``the resources in the treasury of a business corporation      . . . are not an indication of popular support for the      corporation's political ideas.''\83\ Unfortunately, the      opinion fails to explain the First Amendment principle      that gives that fact the power to transform the most      highly protected category of core political speech into an      activity subject to complete legislative proscription.       The Supreme Court's most recent pronouncement on the      constitutionality of campaign finance regulations came in the      1996 case of Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee,      in which the Court held seven to two that independent      expenditures by political parties cannot constitutionally be      limited by Congress. Two justices, Stevens and Ginsburg,      dissented. They signaled that they were prepared to retreat      from Buckley; they would have held that any spending by a      political party represents a contribution to a candidate and      can accordingly be limited, and they were prepared to defer      to Congress's judgment that measures to level the political      playing field were necessary and that there was too much      spending on political campaigns. The other justices stayed      well within the Buckley framework, and four of them would      have gone further to safeguard the First Amendment than did      Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court. Justice Kennedy, for      example, got the support of Chief Justice Rehnquist and      Justice Scalia for his position that spending by political      parties, even if it is coordinated with candidates, cannot be      restricted pursuant to the First Amendment because to      restrict party spending is to stifle what parties exist to      do. Justice Thomas, in a strongly argued opinion, endorsed      abandoning Buckley's dichotomy between contributions and      expenditures and advocated treating contribution and      expenditure limitations the same for First Amendment      purposes, subjecting both to strict scrutiny and not      permitting broad prophylactic corruption-preventing measures.                                 notes     1.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will ask to have printed in the Record an excellent treatise on campaign finance reform and the Constitution by Professor of Law Kathleen M. Sullivan of Stanford which was recently published in the law journal published by the University of California at Davis.  Professor Sullivan examines and dismisses what she terms the reformers' ``Seven Deadly Sins'' of political money. This is must reading for anyone desiring a better understanding of the first amendment's role in this debate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that treatise be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   [From the University of California, Davis Winter Law Review, 1997]                 Political Money and Freedom of Speech                       (By Kathleen M.

Some find the sheer volume of money spent      impressive: an estimated $3 billion on all elections, $660      million on electing the Congress, and $1 billion on the      presidential election. Others focus on the questions raised      about alleged fund-raising activities that are forbidden by      existing laws, such as contributions to political parties by      foreign nationals. Still others focus on ``loopholes'' in the      existing laws that allow their nullification as a practical      matter. Nearly all focus on the presumed special influence of      large contributors on political outcomes.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ Footnotes at end of article.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Against this backdrop has arisen a hue and cry for campaign      finance reform. Senators McCain and Feingold have revived a      proposed Senate campaign finance reform bill that withered      under filibuster in the 104th Congress; \2\ Representatives      Shays and Mechan have introduced comparable bipartisan      legislation in the House. President Clinton has endorsed      those bills.\3\ Newly retired Democratic Senator Bill Bradley      has called the McCain-Feingold proposal timid and advocates      more sweeping reforms; he favors a constitutional amendment      to overrule Buckley v. Valeo,\4\ the 1976 Supreme Court      decision holding that some campaign finance limits violate      the right of free speech.\5\ Other prominent advocates of the      overrule of Buckley include twenty-six legal scholars led by      Ronald Dworkin,\6\ and twenty-four state attorneys general      who argue that political money threatens the integrity of      elections that it is their job to defend.\7\ Countless      newspaper editorial pages have opined that the time is ripe--     while public outrage is high--to finally do something about      campaign finance reform. Voters in states such as California      and Oregon have adopted ballot measures imposing limits on      the financing of state election campaigns.\8\       In short, the view that political money should be limited      has become mainstream orthodoxy. Against this formidable      array of thoughtful opinion, I offer here a contrary view.      This Essay first lays out briefly the current law of      political money and the current landscape of proposals for      its reform. It then offers a critical guide to the reformers'      arguments by examining the political theories that more or      less explicitly underlie them. It concludes that the much      belittled constitutional case against campaign finance limits      is surprisingly strong, and that the better way to resolve      the anomalies created by Buckley v. Valeo may well be not to      impose new expenditure limits on political campaigns, but      rather to eliminate contribution limits.     I. The law of political money       In our political system, political campaigns are generally      funded with private money--the candidates' own resources plus      contributions of individuals, political parties, and      organized groups. The presidential campaign is an exception,      funded publicly since the 1976 campaign.\9\ In our system,      candidates also communicate primarily through entities that      are privately owned--the print and electronic press that      provide candidates free news coverage and opportunities for      paid political advertisements. One could imagine alternate      systems, such as public funding of parties and candidate      elections or public ownership of the communications media,      but such systems are not our own, nor likely to be our own      any time soon.       In the 1976Buckley decision, the Court held that      restrictions on political spending implicate freedom of      speech. Invalidating some portions of the post-Watergate      amendments to the Federal Elections Campaign Act but      upholding others, the Court held thatcontributions to a      candidate could constitutionally be limited, butexpenditures      could not, except as a condition of receiving public      funds.\10\ Thus, afterBuckley, candidates may spend all they      want, unless they are presidential candidates who have taken      public money; so may political parties, individuals, and      organized groups such as political action committees (PACs)--     as long as they act independently of the candidate.\11\ But      direct donations to a candidate's campaign may be limited in      amount. Under current federal law, an individual is limited      in each election to contributing one thousand dollars to a      candidate, five thousands dollars to a PAC, and twenty      thousand dollars to a national party, and must keep the grand      total to twenty-five thousand dollars. PACs may give only      five thousand dollars to a candidate, five thousand dollars      to another PAC, and fifteen thousand dollars to a national      party.\12\ Political parties, too, face spending limits when      they contribute to the campaigns of their candidates, though      these are higher than those for PACs.\13\       The split regime ofBuckley thus authorizes government to      limit thesupply of political money, but forbids it to      limitdemand. Why the distinction?Contributions, the Court      said, implicate lesser speech interests; they merely      facilitate or associate the contributor with speech. They      also raise the specter of ``corruption'' or the appearance of      corruption--that is, the danger of a quid pro      quo.\14\Expenditures, the Court said, are more directly      expressive, and involve no corruption--a candidate cannot      corrupt herself, and those who spend independently of the      candidate's campaign cannot reasonably expect a pay-back.\15\      Nor, held the Court, could spending limits be justified by      the alternative rationale of equalizing political speaking      power, because that rationale, the Court said, is ``wholly      foreign to the First Amendment.'' \16\ Thus, the Court held,      the only way government may bring about political expenditure      limits is through a quid pro quo of its own: government may      induce a candidate to accept expenditures limits in exchange      for public subsidies.       Various cogent criticisms have been leveled at the      contribution/expenditure distinction. First, both      contributions and expenditures may equally express political      opinions. As Justice Thomas wrote last summer:       ``Whether an individual donates money to a candidate or      group who will use it to promote the candidate or whether the      individual spends the money to promote the candidate himself,      the individual seeks to engage in political expression and to      associate with likeminded persons. A contribution is simply      an indirect expenditure.'' \17\       This argues for protecting both expenditures and      contributions alike. Second, an ``independent'' expenditure      may inspire just as much gratitude by the candidate as a      direct contribution. This argues for regulating them both      alike. Finally, it has been objected, it is unclear why      expenditure limits may be induced with carrots if they may      not be compelled with sticks.\18\ This argues for precluding      private expenditure limits even as a condition of public      subsidies.       These inconsistencies arise from theBuckley Court's attempt      to solve an analogical crisis by splitting the      difference.Buckley involved nothing less than a choice      between two of our most powerful traditions: equality in the      realm of democratic polity, and liberty in the realm of      political speech. The Court had to decide whether outlays of      political money more resemble voting, on the one hand, or      political debate, on the other. The norm in voting is      equality: one person, one vote. The norm in political speech      is negative liberty: freedom of exchange, against a backdrop      of unequal distribution of resources (it has been said that      freedom of the press belongs to those who own one \19\).      Faced with the question of which regime ought to govern      regulation of political money, the Court in effect chose a      little of both. It treated campaign contributions as more      like voting, where individual efforts may be equalized, and      campaign expenditures as more like speech, where they may      not.     II. Leading reform proposals       Currently on the table are three type of reform proposals      to impose new restrictions on political money. One advocates      further limiting campaign contributions. The second proposes      more conditioning of benefits upon corresponding      ``voluntary'' limits on private spending. The third would      place outright restrictions on campaign expenditures. The      first two seek to operate within theBuckley framework; the      third would overruleBuckley in part.       The first type of reform proposal would ``close loopholes''      in the existing regulatory scheme by extending the reach of      contribution limits. For example, there are currently no      restrictions on contribution ``bundling'' by intermediaries.      One political entrepreneur may collect several individual      contributions of one thousand dollars each and turn over the      entire sum to the candidate, PAC, or party--taking political      credit for a much larger amount than she personally could      have contributed. Some reform proposals, such as McCain-     Feingold, would treat such ``bundled'' contributions as      contributions by the intermediary, and therefore subject to      the otherwise applicable contribution limits.\20\ In other      words, no more bundling.\21\       Other such proposals would impose contribution limits on      so-called ``soft money''--     those sums that now may be given without limit by      individuals, PACs, and even corporations and labor unions      (who are forbidden to give directly to candidates) to      political parties for purposes of grass-roots ``party-     building'' activities. Since the 1988 campaign, use of soft      money to finance de facto campaign advertisements has      proliferated. Advertisements celebrating one's party, its      stand on issues, or the accomplishments of its leadership,      after all, do serve to build party loyalty; but to the      untutored eye, they may be difficult to distinguish from      campaign ads. The same is true of soft money ads attacking      the other party. The amount of soft money raised by the two      major parties combined has increased from $89 million in 1992      to $107 million in 1994 to roughly $250 million in 1996.\22\      Some reform proposals, again including McCain-Feingold, would      limit soft money contributions.\23\ The Democratic National      Committee has announced its intention to limit annual soft      money contributions from an individual, corporation, or union      to one hundred thousand dollars, and President Clinton said      that the Democratic Party would stop taking any soft money if      the Republicans would do the same.\24\       Would such new contribution limits be constitutional under      the Buckley regime? Any limit on party expenditures of soft      money would likely be struck down by the current Court in      light of its recent decision that political parties may make      unlimited independent expenditures on behalf of a particular      candidate.\25\ But limits on contributions, under Buckley,      are another matter. The Court has previously upheld ceilings      on individual contributions to PACs on the ground that such      restrictions prevent end runs around limits on contributions      to candidates.\26\ Bundling and soft money contribution      limits might be defended along similar lines, although they      also raise novel and questionable burdens on the right of      association.\27\       The second category of reform proposal would find new means      to use public funds or other public benefits to induce      candidates to agree to ``voluntary'' spending limits--a      practice that Buckley held constitutional, at least as to      full public financing of presidential campaigns. Extending      full public funding with attached spending limits from      presidential to congressional campaigns would be the most      obvious version of such reform, but is probably politically      infeasible. Some proposals seek to offer smaller carrots,      including ones that would not directly incur public expense.      For example, the McCain-Feingold Senate bill would extract      from broadcasters free and discounted broadcast time. The      bill would in turn give the time, as well as postage      discounts, to those Senate candidates who complied with      specified spending limits.\28\ California's Proposition 208      would give free space in the ballot statement and allow      higher contributions to candidates who adopted spending      limits.\29\       Such proposals too raise First Amendment questions despite      the public funding ruling in Buckley. For example, while a      private funding ban might reasonably further the goal of full      public financing of an election--in order to level the      playing field--it is hardly clear that private spending      limits are equally justified by the relatively trivial      communications subsidies proposed in these bills. And of      course, the broadcasters might object to the extraction of      ``free'' air time as an unconstitutional compulsion of      speech.\30\       The third, most dramatic type of proposal would overrule      the expenditure holding in Buckley and permit spending limits      outright. Since the current Court seems quite uninterested in      overruling Buckley, the most plausible vehicle for such a      reform would be some type of constitutional amendment. Most      advocates of such a reform support an amendment authorizing      Congress to reimpose expenditure limits as under the pre-     Buckley status quo, while leaving the authority to impose      contribution limits intact.     III. The political theory of campaign finance reform, or the          supposed seven deadly sins of political money       What political theory supports arguments for campaign      finance reform? Arguments for greater limits on political      contributions and expenditures typically suggest that any      claims for individual liberty to spend political money ought      yield to an overriding interest in a well-functioning      democracy. But what is meant by democracy here? The answer is      surprisingly complex; several distinct arguments that      democracy requires campaign finance limits are often lumped      together. I will try to disaggregate them and critically      assess each one. The reformers might be said to have      identified seven, separate, supposedly deadly sins of      unregulated political money.       A. Political inequality in voting       The first argument for campaign finance limits is that they      further individual rights to political equality among voters      in an election. This argument starts from the principle of      formal equality of suffrage embodied in the one person, one      vote rule that emerged from the reapportionment cases.\31\      Each citizen is entitled to an equal formal opportunity, ex      ante, to influence the outcome of an election. Moreover, each      person's vote is inalienable; it may not be traded to others      for their use, nor delegated to agents. Literal vote-buying      is regarded as a paradigm instance of undemocratic conduct.      We no longer countenance gifts of turkeys or bottles of      liquor to voters on election day, nor the counting of dead      souls. These qualities of voting distinguish the electoral      sphere from the marketplace, where goods and services, unlike      votes, are fungible, commensurable, and tradeable.       Reformers often proceed from the premise of equal suffrage      in elections to the conclusion that equalization of speaking      power in electoral campaigns is similarly justifiable in      furtherance of democracy. The most radical of such proposals      would bar expenditures of private campaign funds altogether,      and limit candidates to spending public funds allocated to      each voter equally in the form of vouchers that could be used      solely for election-related speech.\32\ The principle here      would be one person, one vote, one dollar.\33\       More commonly, however, the analogy to voting is meant to      be suggestive, not literal; few go so far as to say that      campaign finance limits are constitutionally compelled, as      equipopulous districts are. Nor do most advocates of campaign      finance reform argue for literal equality in electoral      expenditures; the asserted right to equal political influence      on the outcome of electoral campaigns is usually depicted as      aspirational. But reformers argue that the goal of equal      citizen participation in elections at least helps to justify      campaign finance limits as constitutionally permissible.\34\      On this view, campaign finance amounts to a kind of shadow      election, and unequal campaign outlays amount to a kind of      metaphysical gerrymander by which some votes count more than      others in that shadow election.       Such arguments from formal equality of the franchise to      campaign finance restrictions, however, often fail to      articulate a crucial intermediate step: that political      finance sufficiently resembles voting as to be regulable by      the equality norms that govern voting. There is an      alternative possibility: that political finance more      resembles political speech than voting. That is the analogy      drawn by the Buckley Court, at least with respect to      expenditures. The choice of analogy is crucial. In the formal      realm of voting--like other formal governmental settings,      such as legislative committee hearings and trials in court--     speech may be constrained in the interest of the governmental      function in question. For example, at a town meeting,      Robert's Rules of Order govern to ensure that orderly      discussion may take place; at a trial, witnesses testify not      to all they know but to what they are asked about, subject to      rules of evidence and the constraints of relevant rights of      the parties. Likewise, one voter does not get ten votes      merely because he feels passionately about a candidate or      issue.       By contrast, in the informal realm of political speech--the      kind that goes on continuously between elections as well as      during them--conventional First Amendment principles      generally preclude a norm of equality of influence. Political      speakers generally have equal rights to be free of government      censorship, but not to command the attention of other      listeners. Under virtually any theory of the justification      for free speech, legislative restrictions on political speech      may not be predicated on the ground that the political      speaker will have too great a communicative impact, or his      competitor too little. Conventional First Amendment norms of      individualism, relativism, and antipaternalism preclude any      such affirmative equality of influence--not only as an end-     state but even as an aspiration. Indeed, such equality of      participation as speakers in political debate is foreign even      under the more collectivist approach to political speech      outlined by Alexander Meiklejohn, who famously noted that the      First Amendment ``does not require that, on every occasion,      every citizen shall take part in public debate. . . . What is      essential is not that everyone shall speak, but that      everything worth saying shall be said.'' \35\       A few perceptive reform advocates have noticed this problem      and sought to fill in the missing step--the analogy between      political finance and voting that would make equality norms      relevant to both. For example, Ronald Dworkin, who largely      accepts arguments for unfettered political speech in other      contexts, rests his argument for campaign finance limits on      the proposition that the right to equal participation as      voters must be understood to entail a corollary right to      equal participation as advocates in the electoral campaigns      that precede and determine the vote:       ``Citizens play two roles in a democracy. As voters they      are, collectively, the final referees or judges of political      contests. But they also participate, as individuals, in the      contests they collectively judge: they are candidates,      supporters, and political activists; they lobby and      demonstrate for and against government measures, and they      consult and argue about them with their fellow citizens. . .      .  [W]hen wealth is unfairly distributed and money dominates      politics, . . . though individual citizens may be equal in      their vote and their freedom to hear the candidates they wish      to hear, they are not equal in their own ability to command      the attention of others for their own candidates, interests,      and convictions.\86\       In other words, formal equality of voting power implies a      corollary right to equality in the opportunity to speak out      in politics--at least in the particular subset of political      speech that is made in connection with electoral      campaigns.\87\       But what are the boundaries of an electoral campaign?      Dworkin does not suggest that equalization of speaking power      is a satisfactory justification for limitations of political      speech in other contexts. Yet his own examples belie any easy      distinction between     the formal realm of electoral discourse, which he would      regulate, and the informal realm of ongoing political      discourse, which he presumably would not. For example, he      lists ``lobbying'' and ``demonstrations'' as examples of      relevant forms of citizen participation. But lobbying and      demonstrations could not, without great alteration in      ordinary First Amendment understandings, be regulated on the      ground that their leaders had amassed too many resources.      Further, elections are seamlessly connected to the informal      political debates that continue in the periods between them.      The more electoral campaign speech is continuous with such      ordinary informal political discourse, the less campaign      finance resembles voting, and the more it partakes of a realm      of inevitable inequality.\88\       The reformers might answer that the equality principle      could be confined to speech made expressly by candidates or      their committees during formal electoral campaigns, defined      by reference to some particular period in relation to      elections. But now practical difficulties arise even as      analytical difficulties subside. Such an approach would leave      unregulated advocacy that redounds to the benefit of      candidates by persons, parties, and organizations independent      of them. To the extent such independent speech operates as a      substitute for express candidate speech--even if an imperfect      one--the principle of equality of voter participation      advanced by the limits on formal campaign expenditures will      be undermined.       An alternate response by reformers might be to question      conventional First Amendment principles generally, and to      assert political equality as a justification for regulating a      wide range of informal political discourse. Such an approach      raises large questions that go beyond the topic here. The key      point for now is simply that, short of major revision of      general First Amendment understandings, campaign finance      reform may not be predicated on equality of citizen      participation in elections unless electoral speech can be      conceptually severed from informal political discourse. But      formal campaign speech has so many informal political      substitutes that this proposition is difficult to sustain.       B. Distortion       A second argument against unregulated private campaign      finance is related to the first, but focuses less on      individual rights than on collective consequences. This      argument says that the unequal deployment of resources in      electoral campaigns causes the wrong people to get elected,      distorting the true preferences of voters.\89\ Good      candidates who cannot surmount the high financial barriers to      entry never get to run, and the choice among those who do is      influenced by spending power that is not closely correlated      to the popularity of the candidate's ideas. On this view,      unequal funding leads both candidates and voters to      misidentify the electorate's actual preferences and      intensities of preference.       The Supreme Court has accepted such an argument as      sufficient to justify some administrative burdens on the      deployment of political money. In Austin v. Michigan Chamber      of Commerce,\40\ the Court upheld a state requirement that      corporations (except nonprofit corporations organized solely      for ideological purposes \41\) make political expenditures      solely from separate segregated political funds, not from      their general treasuries.\42\ The Court reasoned that the      government's interest in preventing the ``distortion'' of the      apparent strength.\43\ A corporation that spent, for      political purposes, money raised for investment purposes,      would make it appear that there was more enthusiasm for the      ideas it backed than was warranted. Funds raised for      expressly political purposes and segregated in a separate      political fund or corporate PAC, by contrast, would represent      a more accurate proxy for the popularity of the ideas they      supported.       Campaign finance reformers would extend this antidistortion      principle beyond the particular problems of the corporate      form at issue in Austin. They suggest that the ability to      amass political funds in general does not correlate closely      with voter preferences. Rather, the unequal distribution of      campaign resources leads to misrepresentation of      constituents' actual preferences and intensities of      preference. The wealthy (or those who are good at fund-     raising) can spend more money on a candidate they care      relatively little about than can the poor (or those who are      inept at fundraising) on a candidate to whom they are      passionately committed. To the extent such ``distorted''      campaign speech influences voting, candidates will be elected      and platforms endorsed that differ from what voters would      otherwise choose.       This argument has both practical and conceptual      difficulties. First, a candidate's ability to attract funds      is at least to some extent an indicator of popularity.\44\      Money may flow directly in response to the candidate's ideas      or indirectly in response to the candidate's popularity with      others as reflected in poll numbers and the like.\45\ To the      extent that fundraising accurately reflects popularity, the      reformers exaggerate the degree of distortion. Second, there      are limits to how far private funding can permit a candidate      to deviate from positions acceptable to the mass of      noncontributing voters; the free press will to some extent      correct information provided in the candidate's      advertisements, and polls will discipline the candidate to      respond to preferences other than those of his wealthiest      backers.\46\       A third and deeper problem is that the concept of      ``distortion'' assumes a baseline of ``undistorted'' voter      views and preferences. But whether any such thing exists      exogenously to political campaigns is unclear. Popular      attitudes about public policy do not exist in nature, but are      formed largely in response to cues from political candidates      and party leaders. Moreover, the institutional press--itself      owned by large corporations commanding disproportionate power      and resources--plays a large role in shaping public opinion.      Any attempt to equalize campaign spending would still leave      untouched any ``distortion'' from the role of the press.\47\       C. Corruption, or political inequality in representation       A third argument for limiting political contributions and      expenditures is often made under the heading of fighting      political ``corruption.'' This is a misnomer. Properly      understood, this argument is a variation on the political      inequality argument.\48\ But unlike the first argument above,      it focuses not on the unequal influence of voters on      elections, but on the elected legislators' unequal      responsiveness to different citizens once in office. The      charge against unregulated political money here is that it      makes citizens unequal not in their ability to elect the      candidates of their choice, but in their ability to affect      legislative outcomes.\49\       The Court in Buckley held contribution limits permissible      to prevent ``corruption'' or the appearance of corruption of      legislators by contributors of significant sums. Popular      rhetoric about political money often employs similar      metaphors: polls show substantial majorities who say that      Congress is ``owned'' by special interests or ``for sale'' to      the highest bidder. It is important to note, however, that      the ``corruption'' charged here is not of the Tammany Hall      variety. There is no issue of personal inurement; the money      is not going into candidates' pockets but into television      advertisements, the earnings of paid political consultants,      and various other campaign expenses that increase the chances      of election or reelection. This is true a fortiori for      expenditures made independent of the candidate's campaign.       The claimed harm here is not, as the term ``corruption''      misleadingly suggests, the improper treatment of public      office as an object for market exchange, but a deviation from      appropriate norms of democratic representation. Officeholders      who are disproportionately beholden to a minority of powerful      contributors, advocates of finance limits say, will shirk      their responsibilities to their other constituents, altering      decisions they otherwise would have made in order to repay      past contributions and guarantee them in the future. Thus,      properly understood, the ``corruption'' argument is really a      variant on the problem of political equality; unequal outlays      of political money create inequality in political      representation.       Again, the difficulties with the argument are both      practical and conceptual. First, political money is not      necessarily very effective in securing political results. The      behavior of contributors provides some anecdotal support:      Many corporate PACs, to borrow Judge Posner's phrase, are      ``political hermaphrodites'';\50\ they give large sums to      both major parties. This hedging strategy suggests a weak      level of confidence in their ability to obtain results from      any particular beneficiary of their contributions.       President Clinton captured the same point at a press      conference where he said that he gives major donors an      opportunity for a ``a respectful hearing'' but not a      ``guaranteed result.'' \51\ While this comment might elicit      skepticism, the proposition that campaign donations are a      relatively unreliable investment has empirical support.      Various studies of congressional behavior suggests that      contributions do not strongly affect congressional voting      patterns, which are for the most part dominated by      considerations of party and ideology.\52\ Of course, such      evidence may be countered \53\ by noting that contributors      may be repaid in many ways besides formal floor votes--for      example, by relatively invisible actions in agenda-setting      and drafting in committees. Furthermore, the few votes      that are dominated by contributions may occur when there      is the greatest divergence between contributors' and other      constituents' interests. Still, the case that      contributions divert representative responsiveness is at      best empirically uncertain, and not a confident basis for      limiting political speech.       A second and deeper problem with the ``corruption''      argument, once it is properly recast as an argument about      democratic representation, is conceptual. The argument      supposes that official action should respond to the interests      of all constituents, or to a notion of the public good apart      from the aggregation of interests, but, in any event, not to      the interests of a few by virtue of their campaign outlays.      But legislators respond disproportionately to the interests      of some constituents all the time, depending, for example, on      the degree of their organization, the intensity of their      interest in particular issues, and their capacity to mobilize      votes to punish the legislator who does not act in their      interests. On one view of democratic representation,      therefore, there is nothing wrong with private interest      groups seeking to advance their own ends through electoral      mobilization and lobbying, and for representatives to respond      to these targeted efforts to win election and reelection.\54\      It is at least open to question why attempts to achieve the      same ends through amassing campaign     money are more suspect, at least in the absence of personal      inurement.\55\       But the question whether disproportionate responsiveness to      contributors is ultimately consistent with democratic      representation need not be answered to see the problem with      the reformers' argument. That problem is that selecting one      vision of good government is not generally an acceptable      justification for limiting speech, as campaign finance limits      do. Rather, what constitutes proper representation is itself      the most essentially contested question protected by freedom      of speech. The ban on seditious libel, the protection of      subversion advocacy, and the general hostility to political      viewpoint discrimination illustrate that free speech, under      current conceptions, protects debates about what constitutes      proper self-government from ultimate settlement by      legislatures. To be sure, legislatures are often permitted or      compelled to select among democratic theories, or to      privilege one version of representation over its competitors      in setting up the formal institutions of government. ``One      person, one vote,'' for example, privileges egalitarian      conceptions over various alternatives--such as the      inegalitarian representation provided by the United States      Senate. But the right to speak--and, it might be added, to      petition--includes the right to challenge any provisional      settlement a legislature might make of the question of what      constitutes appropriate democratic representation.       In other words, the ``anticorruption'' argument for      campaign finance reform claims the superiority of a      particular conception of democracy as a ground for limited      speech. As a result, it runs squarely up against the      presumptive ban on political viewpoint discrimination.\56\      Campaign finance reformers necessarily reject pluralist      assumptions about the operation of democracy and would      restrict speech, in the form of political money to foster      either of two alternative political theories. First, they      might be thought to favor a Burkean or civic republican view,      in which responsiveness to raw constituent preferences of any      kind undermines the representative's obligation to deliberate      with some detachment about the public good. Alternatively,      they might be thought to favor a populist view in which the      representative ought be as close as possible to a transparent      vehicle for plebiscitary democracy, for the transmission of      polling data into policy. Either way, they conceive democracy      as something other than the aggregation of self-regarding      interests, each of which is free to seek as much      representation as possible.\57\ But surely the endorsement of      civic republicanism or populism--or any other vision of      democracy--may not normally serve as a valid justification      for limiting speech. Legislators may enforce an official      conception of proper self-government through a variety of      means, but not by prohibiting nonconforming expression.       Campaign finance reformers might object that, after all,      campaign finance limits in no way stop would-be pluralists      from advocating pluralism, but only from practicing it. The      utterances being silenced are performative, not      argumentative. Such a response, however, is in considerable      tension with a long tradition of First Amendment protection      for symbolic and associative conduct.\58\ A further objection      might be that this argument extends only to legislative      campaign finance reform, and not to a constitutional      amendment such as Senator Bradley and others have      proposed.\59\ That is surely correct, as an amendment could      obviously revise the existing First Amendment conceptions on      which the argument rests. But, apart from general reasons to      tread cautiously in amending the Constitution, it might well      be thought especially risky to attempt by amendment to      overrule a constitutional decision that is part of the      general fabric of First Amendment law, as the anomaly created      by the new amendment might well have unanticipated effects on      other understandings of free speech.\60\       D. Carpetbagging       A fourth strand of the reform argument is a variant of the      third, with special reference to geography. Except in      presidential elections, we vote in state or local      constituencies. The fundamental unit of representation is      geographic. But money travels freely across district and      state lines. Thus, political money facilitates      metaphysical carpetbagging. Contributions from or      expenditures by nonconstituent individuals and groups      divert a legislator's representation away from the      constituents in his district and toward nonconstituents,      whether they are foreign corporations or national lobbies.      Various reform proposals seek to limit carpetbagging by      localizing funding: McCain-Feingold, for example, would      require candidates not only to limit expenditures but also      to raise a minimum percentage of contributions from      residents of their home state in order to receive public      benefits, such as broadcast and postage discounts.\61\       Again, this seeks to decide by legislation a question of      what constitutes proper representation. To some, it might be      legitimate for a legislator to consider the views of national      lobbies. For example, those lobbies might share strong      overlapping interests with her own constituents. Or the      legislator might conceive her obligation as running to the      nation as well as a particular district. For the reasons just      given, a privileged theory of what constitutes proper      political representation cannot serve as an adequate ground      for limitation of speech, for free speech is itself the      central vehicle for debating that very question.       E. Diversion of legislative and executive energies       A fifth critique of the current role of political money,      made often by politicians themselves and sometimes elaborated      as an argument for campaign reform, is that fundraising takes      too much of politicians' time.\62\ Many think that incumbents      spend so much time fundraising that governance has become a      part-time job.       This argument supposes a sharp divide between the public      activity of governing and the private role of fundraising.      But this distinction is hardly clear. The ``marketing''      involved in fundraising consists principally of conveying and      testing response to information about past and future policy      positions. How this differs from the standard material of all      political campaigning is unclear, and it may well be      continuous with governing. If the need for fundraising were      eliminated, legislators would still have to nurture their      constituencies in various ways between elections. Some might      think that nurturing grass roots is a more wholesome activity      than nurturing fat cast; but in that case, the diversion of      energies problem simply collapses back into the problem of      inequality in political representation discussed earlier.\63\      To the extent the candidate makes secret promises to PACs or      wealthy individuals that would be unpopular with the mass of      the electorate, there are strong practical limits to such      strategies, such as the danger of press exposure and      constituent retaliation.       However serious the problem of incursion on the candidate's      time might be, one thing is clear: the split regime of      Buckley exacerbates it. Contribution limits mean that a      candidate has to spend more time chasing a larger number of      contributors than she would have to do if contributions could      be unlimited in amount. Concern about time, therefore, may      involve a tradeoff with concern about disproportionate      influence.       F. Quality of debate       A sixth critique of the unregulated outlay of political      money arises on the demand side rather than the supply side.      The problem, in a word, is television. Where does all this      political money go? The biggest expense is the cost of      purchasing advertising time on television (though      increasingly, political consultants take a hefty share). The      critics regard repetitious, sloganeering spot advertisements      as inconsistent with the enlightened rational deliberation      appropriate to an advanced democracy. It is not clear what      golden age of high-minded debate they hark back to; the      antecedent of the spot ad is, after all, the bumper sticker.      Nonetheless, these critics clearly aspire to something wiser      and better. Ronald Dworkin's lament is representative: ``The      national political `debate' is now directed by advertising      executives and political consultants and conducted mainly      through thirty-second, `sound bite' television and radio      commercials that are negative, witless, and condescending.''      \64\ Political expenditure limits, some suggest, would cut      off the supply of oxygen to this spectacle and force      candidates into less costly but more informative venues such      as written materials and town hall debates.       To the extent this rationale for campaign finance reform is      made explicit, it would appear flatly precluded by      conventional First Amendment antipaternalism principles.      Permitting limitations on speech because it is too vulgar or      lowbrow would wipe out a good many pages of U.S. Reports.      Surely a judgment that speech is too crass or appeals to base      instincts is a far cry from Robert's Rules of Order or other      principles of ordered liberty consistent with government      neutrality toward the content of speech.       In any event, the indirect means of limiting expenditures      may not do much to solve this problem. Why not directly ban      political advertising on television outright? Then everyone      could campaign on smaller budgets. British politicians, for      example, are barred from taking out paid spots on the      airwaves. But Britain has strong parties and small districts;      we have neither. Banning television advertising in our      political culture would impair politicians', especially      challengers', ability to reach large masses of the      electorate. Banning television advertisements might make us      more republican, but it is hardly clear that it would make us      more democratic. Moreover, the special First Amendment      dispensation the Court has shown for broadcast regulation is      increasingly tenuous, and has not been extended to other,      increasingly competitive media. To be fully effective, a ban      on television advertising might have to extend to cable and      the internet, where the constitutional plausibility of      regulation is even more dubious.       G. Lack of competitiveness       Finally, a last argument would locate the key problem in      current campaign finance practices in the advantage it      confers on incumbents over challengers. Here the claim is      that a healthy democracy depends on robust political      competition and that campaign finance limits are needed to      ``level the playing field.'' The reformers contend that      unfettered political money confers an anticompetitive      advantage upon incumbents. This advantage arises because      incumbents participate in current policymaking that      affects contributors' interests. Thus, they enjoy      considerable fundraising leverage     while in office, and indeed, incumbents received on      average four times as much in contributions than      challengers in the 1996 congressional election.\65\ This      incumbent advantage, reformers argue, limits turnover and      makes challengers less effective at monitoring and      checking incumbents' responsiveness. It is no accident      that, for such reasons, some prominent supporters of      campaign finance reform, such as Republican Senator Fred      Thompson of Tennessee, a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold      bill, are also prominent supporters of term limits.       But there is some practical reason to think this argument      gets the competitiveness point backwards. Campaign finance      limits themselves may help to entrench incumbents in      office.\66\ Incumbency confers enormous nonfinancial      advantages: name recognition, opportunity to deliver      benefits, publicity from the free press, and the franking      privilege. To offset these advantages, challengers must amass      substantial funds. Challengers' lack of prominence may make      it more difficult for them to raise funds from large numbers      of small donations. They may therefore depend more than      incumbents on concentrated aid from parties, ideologically      sympathetic PACs, or even wealthy individual private      backers.\67\ Of course, once again, contribution limits under      the split regime of Buckley exacerbate the problem, as      incumbents are more likely to be able to raise a large number      of capped contributions than challengers can.       The effect of regulation or nonregulation on the      competitiveness of elections is a difficult empirical      question.\68\ But any prediction that campaign regulation      will increase electoral competitiveness and turnover is, by      virtue of its very empirical uncertainty, at least a      questionable ground for limiting political speech.                               conclusion       The discussion to this point has sought to disentangle the      separate elements of the campaign finance reformers'      arguments about the evils of unregulated political money and      to suggest why the proposed cure for the seven deadly sins      might be worse than the disease, even on the reformers' own      assumptions.\69\ I have sought also to show why limits on      political money are in deeper tension with current First      Amendment conceptions than is often supposed. Buckley's      declaration of the impermissibility of redistribution of      speaking power has been widely criticized; \70\ the effort      here has been to show alternative reasons why the      justifications for campaign finance reform might trigger      First Amendment skepticism. These reasons include the      inseverability of campaign speech from ordinary political      discourse and the viewpoint basis inherent in campaign      finance reform's selection of one conception of democratic      representation over its competitors as a basis for curtailing      speech.       If these alternative reasons have any force, then it is      easier to see why campaign finance reform is especially prone      to following the law of unintended consequences: for example,      limits on individual contributions helped to increase the      number of PACs; limits on hard money contributions stimulated      the proliferation of soft money contributions; and limits on      contributions generally spurred the growth of independent      expenditures.\71\ The reason is not just that the demand for      political money is peculiarly inelastic and thus, like the      demand for other addictive substances, likely to create black      markets in the shadow of regulation. The reason is that grim      efforts to close down every ``loophole'' in campaign finance      laws will inevitably trench unacceptably far upon current      conceptions of freedom of political speech. Even if formal      campaign expenditures and contributions are limited, the      reformers' justifications attenuate as the law reaches the      informal political speech that serves as a partial substitute      for formal campaign speech. Without altering conventional      free speech norms about informal political discourse, there      are outer limits on the ability of any reform to limit these      substitution effects.       What scenario are we left with if both political      expenditure and contribution limits are deemed      unconstitutional? Will political money proliferate      indefinitely, along with its accompanying harms? Not      necessarily, provided that the identity of contributors is      required to be vigorously and frequently disclosed. Arguments      against compelled disclosure of identity, strong in contexts      where disclosure risks retaliation,\72\ are weaker in the      context of attempts to influence candidate elections, as the      Buckley decision itself recognized in upholding the      disclosure requirements of the 1974 FECA amendments.\73\      Weekly disclosure in the newspapers, or better, daily      reporting on the internet, would be a far cry from earlier      failed sunshine laws. If the lists of names and figures      seemed too boring to capture general attention, enterprising      journalists could ``follow the money'' and report on any      suspect connections between contributions and policymaking.       Under this regime--in which contributions and expenditures      were unlimited, but the identities of contributors were      made meaningfully public--there would be at least three      reasons for modest optimism that the harms the reformers      fear from unlimited political money would in fact be      limited.     A. Increased supply       If contributions, like expenditures, could not be limited      in amount, the total level of contributions might be expected      to increase as there might be a net shift from expenditures      to contributions. The supply of political money to candidates      would be increased. This might be expected to lower the      ``price'' to the candidate of a political contribution. With      more quids on offer, a politician has less reason to commit      to any particular quo. In this politicians' buyers' market,      concerns about unequal political influence that arise under      the misleading ``corruption'' heading would arguably      attenuate, and contributors might curtail their outlays in      response to their declining marginal returns.     B. Decreased symbolic costs from subterfuge       If contributions could be made in unlimited amounts, would-     be contributors would not have to resort to the devices of      independent advertisements or party contributions as      substitutes. Public perception of a campaign finance system      gone out of control rests at least in part on the view that      politicians, parties, and donors skirt existing laws by      exploiting evasive ``loopholes.'' To the extent that all      functional contributions are made as explicit contributions,      the symbolic costs of the current split regime of Buckley      would decrease.     C. Voter retaliation       With contributions fully disclosed and their effects on      political outcomes subject to monitoring by the free press,      voters would be empowered to penalize candidates whose      responsiveness to large contributors they deemed excessive.      Voters could do retail what campaign finance reform seeks to      do wholesale: encourage diversification in the sources of      campaign funding. Political challengers could capitalize on      connections between political money and incumbents' official      actions. A striking demonstration of this point arose in the      1996 presidential election, when the Dole campaign's attack      on alleged Democratic fund-raising scandals drove President      Clinton's poll numbers into a temporary freefall.\74\      Political money would itself be an election issue; a      candidate would have to decide which was worth more to her--     the money, or the bragging rights to say that she did not      take it.       Of course, the harms of political money cannot be expected      to be entirely self-limiting. The deregulation outlined here      is only partial; compelled disclosure avoids a regime of      absolute laissez-faire. Even this partial deregulation might      have unintended consequences. Some of the reformers' goals      are widely shared and might require market intervention. For      example, achieving adequate competitiveness in elections      might require some public subsidies for challengers who can      demonstrate certain threshold levels of support--floors but      not ceilings for political expenditures.\75\ But the      possibilities outlined here at least suggest some hesitation      before deciding which way the split regime of Buckley ought      to be resolved.                               footnotes     \1\ See generally David E.

The Court does not      apply strict scrutiny where the government's reason for the      compulsion bears no relation to the content of the compelled      speech. See Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S.      622, 641-42 (1994) (reviewing content-neutral law requiring      cable operators to carry unwanted broadcast stations under      intermediate scrutiny). Broadcasters, however, have been held      subject to compelled carriage requirements that would be      unconstitutional if applied to non-broadcast speakers.      Compare Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 400-     01 (1969) (upholding mandatory reply obligations applicable      to broadcasters), with Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. Tornillo, 418      U.S. 241, 256 (1974) (invalidating mandatory reply      obligations applicable to newspapers). With the obsolescence      of the spectrum scarcity argument on which Red Lion was      premised, it is unclear whether broadcasters would have a      compelled-speech objection to the extraction of free or      discounted air time for candidates as a condition of their      receipt of public licenses.     \31\ See Reynolds v.

Edwin Baker,      Limits on Campaign `Speech' Are Just an Extension of Existing      Rules, Philadelphia Inquirer, Jan. 28, 1997, at A11. Baker      distinguishes between the aspects of politics, such as      voting, that are ``legally created and structured'' and      ``specially designed to fairly achieve certain results,'' in      which speech may be limited, and the realm of informal      political debate and dialogue that ``occurs as much between      elections as during them,'' in which speech ought to be      ``unbounded.'' See id. Like Dworkin, Baker allocates      political finance to the formal rather than the informal      realm, and hence regulable by norms of equality. See id. But      like Dworkin, Baker does not explain how campaign speech may      be severed for informal political speech.     \38\ See, e.g., Sanford Levinson, Regulating Campaign      Activity: The New Road to Contradiction?, Mich L.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, no discussion of the issue advocacy provisions in the McCain-Feingold bill can be complete without the input of James E. Bopp, Jr., who is perhaps the most experienced lawyer in America in this area of the law and the bane of the FEC's irresponsible battalion of lawyers who have made it their mission in life to harass citizen groups. For that worthy accomplishment, Mr. Bopp deserves special commendation.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Jim Bopp's recent law review article entitled, ``The First Amendment Is Not the Loophole,'' which he coauthored with Richard E. Coleson.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [Reprinted from University of West Los Angeles Law Review, Volume 28,                                  1997] The First Amendment Is Not a Loophole: Protecting Free Expression In                      The Election Campaign Context             (By James Bopp, Jr.* and Richard E. Coleson**)       ``Congress shall makes no law. . . abridging the Freedom of      Speech. . . .''\1\                              INTRODUCTION       The First Amendment plainly states that Congress is to      ``make no law'' which would ``abridg[e] the freedom of      speech,''\2\ yet Congress enacted the Federal Election      Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended in 1974,\3\ precisely      to abridge certain forms of speech in election campaigns. In      the landmark case of Buckley v. Caleo,\4\ the United States      Supreme Court struck down many FECA provisions on free      expression grounds.       For the two decades since Buckley, the Federal Election      Commission (FEC) has fought to close the perceived loopholes      created by Buckley in the federal election laws, so that the      agency could regulate all speech relating in any way to      federal elections. Throughout this period, the Supreme Court      has repeatedly proclaimed that the First Amendment is not a      loophole--free expression must be protected amidst the rush      to impose campaign finance restrictions.       Undeterred, the FEC has created new theories in an attempt      to bypass Supreme Court holdings and pursued regulation of      constitutionally-protected expression. On June 26, 1996, the      United States Supreme Court decided the case of Colorado      Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (Colorado      Republican),\5\ again rejecting the FEC's creative efforts to      regulate political speech protected by the First Amendment.      This article discusses the Colorado Republican case in its      historical context of conflict between federal court      protection of free expression and attempts, by the FEC and      various states, to regulate protected expression in the name      of campaign finance reform.       The article is written from a practical perspective, i.e.,      what the courts have held, not what certain theoreticians      would like the courts to hold.\6\ In Part I, ``A Primer on      Protected Political Expression,'' the authors will summarize      briefly some of the key theoretical debates, but will      primarily focus on the principles undergirding free political      expression, discuss some terms of art, and explain the sorts      of activity over which litigation usually arises. The robust      First Amendment protection of issue advocacy will be the      topic of Part II, ``Supreme Court Defense of Issue      Advocacy Through Buckley,'' and Part III, ``FEC Efforts to      Stifle Issue Advocacy.'' Part IV will focus on ``Other      Protection for Free Political Expression,'' discussing (1)      MCFL-type organizations, (2) members, (3) anonymous      literature, (4) caps on contributions and expenditures,      (5) political committees, (6) burden of proof, and (7)      prior restraint of speech. In Part V, ``A Proposal for      Speech-Enhancing Campaign Reform,'' the article will      conclude with a proposal for constitutionally-permissible      campaign finance reforms which would enhance, rather than      suppress, the free flow of speech about candidates and      issues of public concern which is essential to our      democratic Republic.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     See footnotes at end of article.---------------------------------------------------------------------------             i. a primer on protected political expression       Our political system is based on the model of an open and      free marketplace of ideas. The Framers of our Constitution      believed that good ideas will triumph over bad ideas if the      People are free to debate and to champion the ideas they find      convincing. Free speech is not only valuable intrinsically as      a personal liberty, but it is a necessary prerequisite for      limited representative government, particularly in free      elections.\7\ This has been well stated by the District of      Columbia Circuit: ``If popular elections form the essence of      republican government, free discourse and political activity      formed the prerequisite for popular elections. As Madison      wrote, a government which is `elective, limited and      responsible' to the people requires `a greater freedom of      animadversion' than one not so structured.''       In our day, the Supreme Court has recognized that ``debate      on the qualifications of candidates [is] integral to the      operation of the system of government established by our      Constitution.'' Because the electoral process plays so      central a role in our conception of a free government, ``it      can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee [of      the First Amendment] has its fullest and most urgent      application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for      political office.'' \8\                           *   *   *   *   *       This effort goes by the innocuous name of campaign finance      reform. While ``reform'' is generally considered a salutary      goal, ``reform'' is not good when it is a euphemism for      silencing the voice of the People at election time.       The Supreme Court and lower courts have repeatedly had to      protect the First Amendment rights of the People against      misguided ``reform'' efforts which impinge on essential      liberties.\24\ Truly beneficial ``reform'' would enhance      the power of the People to communicate and promote their      ideas, not repress it. Proper reform would return power to      the People, not enhance the power of media elite, wealthy      candidates, and Washington insiders to influence      elections--which is the ultimate outcome if the People's      voice through their political parties and political      committees is muffled or silenced.\25\       Bopp writes that this fight against unconstitutional      political speech restrictions advanced under the guise of      ``reform'' is bipartisan. That may be the case in the outside      world but, regrettably, that is not the situation in the      Senate where it appears Democrats are going to join hands in      delivering a crushing blow to First Amendment freedom that      Americans have savored for two hundred years.       The battle to preserve free speech rights in the election      context is bi-partisan and non-ideological, as evidenced by      the existence of the Free Speech Coalition. This Coalition is      co-chaired by Ellie Smeal of the Fund for the Feminist      Majority and David Keene of the American Conservative Union      and is made up of approximately 50 public interest advocacy      groups ranging ideologically from the left to the right, from      environmental activist groups to pro-business organizations,      and from gun control enthusiasts to the National Rifle      Association. The broad-based agreement on protecting free      expression rights in the election context was symbolized      recently when James Bopp, Jr., General Counsel for the      National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and co-author of the      present article, presented testimony on behalf of the Free      Speech Coalition before the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules      and Administration considering campaign finance reform.\26\      These public policy groups agree on little else, but they      agree that the First Amendment protects their right to      advocate on issues on public concern. This is the marketplace      of ideas at work, with opposing groups vying for the blessing      of public opinion on their issue. It is America working at      its best.\27\       This battle for First Amendment liberty is being fought      over several types of activities. It will be helpful to      consider some of them briefly and note some terms of art.       A ``political action committee'' (PAC) (also sometimes      known as a ``political committee'' in statutes) is nothing      more than individuals uniting to promote issues and      candidates more effectively than they could do on their own.      \28\ A PAC may lawfully engage in ``express advocacy,'' i.e.,      expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate, \29\ and make contributions to      candidates. First Amendment rights do not diminish in any way      because persons associate to advocate for their cause more      effectively; in fact, the right of citizens to band together      in PACs is specifically protected by the First Amendment's      freedom of association protections.\30\ Thus, pejorative      references to PACs as ``special interests'' which need to be      stifled are actually misguided attacks on the core First      Amendment rights of free political expression and      association. The marketplace-of-ideas response to a PAC      message one opposes is not to silence PACs but to form one's      own association of persons to advocate an opposing message in      the marketplace. \31\ The cacophony of competing      communications may sometimes be deafening and disquieting,      but that is the way of liberty. The road to serfdom is the      quiet and quiescent road. Recognizing free speech as an      inherent good and the necessity of free political debate and      association in a democratic republic, the Supreme Court has      permitted only limited regulation of PACs. \32\       Litigation often arises over the scope of a state's      definition of a political committee or PAC. Often states try      to channel all individuals and groups, who advocate on issues      in a manner which would in any way ``influence'' an election,      into the political committee category so that they will have      to register and report as if they were a political committee.      \33\ However, an organization cannot constitutionally be      required to register and report as a political committee      unless it ``major purpose'' is the nomination or election of      candidates. Imposing the relatively burdensome reporting      requirements which may be imposed on PACs on issue-advocacy      groups is simply too heavy a burden on free expression to be      permitted. \34\ There is no compelling governmental interest      to justify such a burden on First Amendment rights.       An ``independent expenditure'' is an expenditure made for a      communication which contains ``express advocacy'' and is made      without any prior consultation or coordination with a      candidate. An entity which makes an independent expenditure      may be required to report that expenditure, even if it is not      required to register and report as a political committee.      \35\       ``Issue advocacy'' is advocacy of issues without engaging      in express advocacy. \36\ For example, if a pro-life group      publishes a newletter on the eve of an election describing      Candidate D as pro-life and Candidate C as pro-abortion      rights in an article about the two candidates, that is issue      advocacy, not express advocacy, because there have been no      explicit words expressly advocating the election or defeat of      a clearly identified candidate for public office. \37\ The      candidates have been clearly identified, they are running for      public office, but saying that Candidate D is pro-life is not      express advocacy, it is issue advocacy. This is so even      though the statement is made in a pro-life newsletter, in a      discussion of candidates, on the eve of an election. \38\       A ``voter guide'' is a table showing the positions of      candidates on various issues. If it does not expressly      advocate the election or defeat of any of the identified      candidates, the voter guide is pure issue advocacy and may      not be regulated by the FEC or any state. The voter guide may      even indicate what is the response preferred by the      organization publishing the guide, e.g. by indicating a      favorable answer (from the perspective of the publisher) with      a (+) and an unfavorable response with a minus (-). Or the      voter guide can word the questions in such a way that a      candidate giving favored responses will have a ``yes'' answer      for every question, while a candidate giving disfavored      responses will have all ``no'' answers.\39\ These voter      guides may be paid for and distributed by any individual or      organization.\40\       Because they discuss candidates, are distributed at      election time, and may actually influence elections, voter      guides have been the target of intense efforts by the      FEC,\41\ state legislatures,\42\ and the Democrat Party \43\      in an effort to force voter guide activity into the      definition of express advocacy and, thereby, prohibiting      citizens groups which publish them from doing so unless they      register and report as political committees. Such efforts      have been repeatedly rejected as courts have followed the      bright-line express advocacy test set out by the United      States Supreme Court to protect issue advocacy.       Advocates of McCain-Feingold cling to a groundless belief      that the Supreme Court is going to do a 180 and suddenly      retreat on decades of jurisprudence blasting such gross      government intrusion into First Amendment speech. A notion      Bopp dispels.      II. supreme court defense of issue advocacy through buckley       The United States Supreme Court has long and carefully      watched over efforts to regulate political speech in order to      ensure that the guarantees of the First Amendment \44\ are      not denied. This is because such restrictions ``limit      political expression `at the core of our electoral process      and of First Amendment freedoms.' '' \45\ All political      speech, including communications which expressly advocate      election or defeat of Supreme Court has declared: ``[T]he      First Amendment right to `speak one's mind . . . on all      public institutions' includes the right to engage in ``      `vigorous advocacy' no less than `abstract discussion.' ''      Advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates for federal      office is no less entitled to protection under the First      Amendment than the discussion of political policy generally      or advocacy of the passage or defeat of legislation.'' \46\       Not only has the Court afforded strong constitutional      protection for political speech in general, but it has      afforded exceptionally strong constitutional protection for      issue-oriented speech. As a result, the Court has repeatedly      given a narrowing construction to statutes regulating      political speech, so as to permit regulation of only express      advocacy, in order to shield the statutes from constitutional      attack. Moreover, the Supreme Court has established two      bright-line tests to protect the advocacy of issues in the      election context: (1) the ``express advocacy test'' and (2)      the ``major purpose test.'' \47\ These will be discussed in      turn.                a. the bright-line express advocacy test       In a series of cases, the United States Supreme Court has      drawn a distinction between express advocacy, which may be      regulated, and issued advocacy, which may not be regulated.      As shall be seen, both enjoy full First Amendment protection,      but the compelling interest in preventing corruption (or its      appearance) in the election process is only sufficiently      compelling to warrant some regulation of express      advocacy.\48\ No governmental interest is sufficiently      compelling to regulate issue advocacy.       In 1948, the Supreme Court considered the case of United      States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations (C.I.O).\49\      C.I.O. concerned a federal statute prohibiting a corporation      or labor organization from making ``any expenditure in      connection with a federal election.'' \50\ Under this      provision, an indictment was returned against the C.I.O. and      its president for publishing, in The CIO News, a statement      urging all members of the C.I.O. to vote for a particular      candidate for Congress in an upcoming election.\51\ In      affirming a dismissal of the indictment, the Court observed:      ``If Sec. 313 were construed to prohibit the publication, by      corporations and unions in the regular course of conducting      their affairs, of periodicals advising their members,      stockholders or customers of danger or advantage to their      interests from the adoption of measures, or the election to      office of men espousing such measures, the gravest doubt      would arise in our minds as to its constitutionality.'' \52\       A lengthy footnote appended to this statement set forth      several passages from case law wherein the Court had declared      the specially protected nature of free speech concerning      public policy and political matters:       ``Free discussion of the problems of society is a cardinal      principle of Americanism--a principle which all are zealous      to preserve. Penekamp v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331, 345 [(1946)].       ``The case confronts us again with the duty our system      places on this Court to say where the individual's freedom      ends and the State's power begins. Choice on that border, now      as always delicate, is perhaps more so where the usual      presumption supporting legislation is balanced by the      preferred place given in our scheme to the great, the      indispensable democratic freedoms secured by the First      Amendment. Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 529-30 [(1945)].       ``For the First Amendment does not speak equivocally. It      prohibits any law `abridging the freedom of speech, or of the      press.' It must be taken as a command of the broadest scope      that explicit language, read in the context of a liberty-     loving society, will allow, Bridges v. California, 314 U.S.      252, 263 [(1941)].'' \53\       In 1976, the Supreme Court considered a successor statute      to the one discussed in C.I.O., the Federal Election Campaign      Act of 1971, as amended in 1974.\54\ This new statute was      reviewed in Buckley v. Valeo.\55\       Buckley dealt, inter alia, with a provision which limited      ``any expenditure . . . relative to a clearly identified      candidate.' '' \55\ The provision placed a limit on the      amount of an independent expenditure on behalf of a      candidate. However, this provision was considered to be      unconstitutionally vague.\57\ Therefore, the Court construed      it with another provision of the same statute to require ``      `relative to' a candidate to be read to mean `advocating the      election or defeat of' a candidate.'' \58\       However, as the Buckley Court noted, this construction      merely refocused the vagueness problem. The real problem, the      Court noted, as that: ``the distinction between discussion of      issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of      candidates may often dissolve in practical application.      Candidates, especially incumbents, are often intimately tied      to public issues involving legislative proposals and      governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the      basis of their positions on various public issues, but      campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.\59\       Because of the problem described, the Supreme Court settled      on the express advocacy test as marking the line of      demarcation between the permitted and the forbidden. This      test is constitutionally mandated because only a statute      regulating the express advocacy of a clearly identified      federal candidate has a sufficiently bright line of      distinction to make it constitutionally defensible. The      Supreme Court, in Buckley, explained the problem with a      quotation from Thomas v. Collins: ``[W]hether words intended      and designed to fall short of invitation would miss the mark      is a question both of intent and of effect. No speaker, in      such circumstances, safely could assume that anything he      might say upon the general subject would not be understood by      some as an invitation. In short, the supposedly clear-cut      distinction between discussion, laudation, general advocacy,      and solicitation puts the speaker in these circumstances      wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding of his      hearers and consequently of whatever inference may be drawn      as to his intent and meaning. Such a distinction offers no      security for free discussion. In these conditions it blankets      with uncertainty whatever may be said. It compels the speaker      to hedge and trim.\60\''       Thus, the Supreme Court, in Buckley, said that ``[t]he      constitutional deficiencies described in Thomas v. Collins      can be avoided only by reading Sec. 608(e)(1) [placing a      ceiling on independent expenditures] as limited to      communications that include explicit words of advocacy of      election or defeat of a candidate.'' \61\       Without such a clear line of demarcation, then, a speaker      is forced to ``hedge and trim'' comments made on issues of      public importance for fear he will be charged with forbidden      electioneering. This is too heavy a burden on First Amendment      Rights to be constitutionally permitted.\62\       The Buckley Court concluded that ``[t]he constitutional      deficiencies'' of such unclear statutory language could only      be cured by reading the statute ``to apply to expenditures      for communications that in express terms advocate the      election of a clearly identified candidate for a public      office.'' \63\ The Court added that ``[t]his construction      would restrict the application of Sec. 608(e)(1) to      communications containing express words of advocacy of      election or defeat, such as `vote for,' `elect,'      `support,' `cast your ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,'      `vote against,' `defeat,' `reject.' '' \64\       The Buckley Court then proceeded to determine whether the      statute, ``even as thus narrowly and explicitly construed,      impermissibly burdens the constitutional right of free      expression.'' \65\ The Court determined that the government      could not advance an interest in support of the statute      sufficient to ``satisfy the exacting scrutiny applicable to      limitations on core First Amendment rights of political      expression.'' \66\       In sum, the Court established the express advocacy test as      a bright-line rule to distinguish political advocacy, which      could be regulated, from issue advocacy, which may not.                 b. the bright-line major purpose test       In Buckley, the Supreme Court also established the bright-     line ``major purpose'' test. In practical application, this      test means that government may not require an organization      which makes contributions and independent expenditures to      register and report as a political committee unless the      ``major purpose'' of the organization is the election or      nomination of candidates for political office.\67\ Government      may, however, require that the independent expenditures be      reported by the organizations making them and that      contributions be reported by the candidate receiving them.      However, there is no sufficiently compelling interest to      justify imposing the onerous burdens imposed on a political      committee on an issue advocacy group.\68\       This test was set forth in the Buckley Court's discussion      of 2 U.S.C. Sec. 434(e), which required ``[e]very person      (other than a political committee or candidate) who makes      contributions or expenditures'' aggregating over $100 in a      calendar year ``other than by contribution to a political      committee or candidate'' to file a statement with the      Commission. Unlike the other disclosure provisions, this      section does not seek the contribution list of any      association. Instead, it requires direct disclosure of what      an individual or group contributes or spends.'' \69\       ``In considering this provision,'' the Court wrote, ``we      must apply the same strict standard of scrutiny, for the      right of associational privacy developed in NAACP v. Alabama      derives from the rights of the organization's members to      advocate their personal points of view in the most effective      way.'' \70\       The Court continued:       ``When we attempt to define `expenditure' . . . .      [a]lthough the phrase, `for the purpose of . . . influencing'      an election or nomination, differs from the language used in      Sec. 608(e)(1), it shares the same potential for encompassing      both issue discussion and advocacy of a political result. The      general requirement that `political committees' and      candidates disclose their expenditures could raise similar      vagueness problems, for `political committee' is defined only      in terms of amount of annual `contributions' and      `expenditures,' and could be interpreted to reach groups      engaged in purely issue discussion. . . . To fulfill the      purposes of the Act they need only encompass organizations      that are under the control of a candidate or the major      purpose of which is the nomination or election of a      candidate. Expenditures of candidates and `political      committees' so construed can be assumed to fall within the      core area sought to be addressed by Congress. They are, by      definition, campaign related.       ``But when the maker of the expenditure is not within these      categories--when it is an individual other than a candidate      or a group other than a `political committee'--the relation      of the information sought to the purposes of the Act may be      too remote. To insure that the reach of Sec. 434(e) is not      impermissibly broad, we construe `expenditure' for purposes      of that section in the same way we construed the terms of      Sec. 608(e)--to reach only funds used for communications that      expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate.'' \71\       So construed, the reporting of independent expenditures is      justified by the substantial governmental interest in      ``sched[ding] the light of publicity on spending that is      unambiguously campaign related,'' \72\ i.e., an interest in      preventing corruption in the political process.       After the Supreme Court's 1976 Buckley decision, the      express advocacy test and the major purpose test were clearly      deployed as twin defenses against governmental encroachment      on issue advocacy. However, as shown in the next section, the      FEC and some state legislatures have spent the next two      decades trying to evade the Court's pronouncements.       Before proceeding, however, comment needs to be made on the      recent case of Akins v. FEC.\73\ That case held that the      major purpose test applied when an organization engaged in      independent expenditures, but not when it made contributions.      The decision, however, was wrongly decided because the court      did not engage in the most basic First Amendment analysis,      which would have led to a different result.       The case involved a complaint to the FEC that the American      Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) was a ``political      committee'' subject to the broad disclosure requirements and      limits imposed on political committees. The FEC dismissed the      complaint because the Committee did not met its definition      for a political committee. The definition required that a      committee (1) meet the $1,000 expenditure threshold and (2)      have as its major purpose the nomination or election of      candidates. The FEC ``determined that AIPAC likely had made      campaign contributions exceeding the $1,000 threshold, but      concluded that there was not probable cause to believe AIPAC      was a political committee because its campaign-related      activities were only a small portion of its overall      activities and not its major purpose.''\74\ The FEC argued      that Buckley required it to include a major purpose exception      for such contributions in its rules implementing 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 431(4)(A) (the definition of ``political      committee'').\75\ Ironically, as the FEC properly followed      and defended the Buckely major purpose test in this instance,      it was overruled.       The D.C. Circuit's analysis reviewed the language of      Buckley and decided that the major purpose test was only      established by the Court in the context of expenditures.\76\      The Akins court similarly dismissed the language about the      major purpose test in MCFL \77\ as only applying in the      context of independent expenditures, so that ``the Court's      rationale in MCFL and Buckely is simply inapplicable to the      present case.'' \78\ The Akins court proceeded with some      policy arguments about how the FEC's interpretation ``would .      . . allow a large organization to contribute substantial sums      to campaign activity, as long as the contributions are      a small portion of the organization's overall budget,      without being subject to the limitations and requirements      imposed on political committees.'' \79\ Of course, that is      so and is as it should be. The very idea of the major      purpose test is that the heavy limits and disclosure      requirements imposed on political committees are too great      a burden on the First Amendment rights of organizations      whose major purpose is not campaign advocacy. It is      sufficient that the details of each independent      expenditure or contribution to a candidate be disclosed to      the FEC as matters of public record.       What was glaringly absent from the Akins opinion was a      constitutional analysis.\80\ A proper constitutional analysis      would have begun with the strong First Amendment protection      for all forms of political expression, including      contributions. Next, the analysis would have asked whether      there was any compelling governmental interest sufficient to      override the First Amendment's protection. A proper analysis      would have noted that the only interests found sufficiently      compelling by the Court are the interests in preventing      corruption and its appearance in the political process. The      analysis would have then asked whether contributions to      candidates from an organization whose major purpose is      education and lobbying posed such a threat of corruption to      the political system that is could only be cured by imposing      on the organization the heavy burdens imposed on PACs. The      answer, of course, would be that fully disclosed      contributions, which are a small fraction of an      organization's activities, pose not credible threat of      corruption or the appearance thereof. Therefore, imposing the      limitations and broad disclosure requirements, which are      placed on political committees, on an organization whose      major purpose is not the nomination or election of candidates      would violate the First Amendment in the same way that the      Constitution is violated in the context of such organizations      making independent expenditures.       It may safely be assumed that, at such a time as the United      States Supreme Court has the opportunity to review the issue      raised in Akins, the major purpose test will be reasserted in      the context of contributions, as well as independent      expenditures. Meanwhile, it is clearly in force with respect      to independent expenditures and with respect to contributions      in all but the D.C. Circuit. The FEC filed a petition for a      writ of certiorari on April 7, 1997.\81\            iii. failed fec efforts to stifle issue advocacy       The FEC apparently did not like the answers the Supreme      Court gave in Buckley \82\ because it soon began challenging      the decision with enforcement actions and rulemaking that did      not follow the express advocacy and major purpose tests. This      resulted in a long string of litigation, traced below,      highlighted by judicial rebuffs and rebukes.       In this twenty-year effort to suppress political speech by      circumventing Buckley, the FEC has treated the First      Amendment as a loophole in the Federal Election Campaign Act      which it is the FEC's duty to close, and the FEC has treated      United States Supreme Court decisions against it as      inconveniences to be overcome. As a result, the FEC has      engaged in a sustained and unprecedented assault on the First      Amendment, consuming enormous FEC resources. Rather than      enforce the many uncontroversial and clearly constitutional      provisions of the FECA, the FEC has used its limited      resources to launch a series of regulatory changes and      enforcement actions with the intent of expanding its      powers to regulate free speech. This effort has resulted      in a series of court cases striking down these regulations      \83\ and defeating the FEC's enforcement actions.\84\       The courts have, therefore, frustrated the unlawful efforts      of the FEC to impinge on free speech, but at an enormous cost      in taxpayer funds and in attorney fees for successful victims      of the FEC's enforcement actions. The cost to the free speech      of those intimidated by the heavy hand of the FEC, however,      cannot be calculated. Instead of enforcing the important and      uncontroversial provisions of the Act, the FEC has focused      its attention on ``grassroots groups and citizens who want to      take part in the political debate, too--groups far less well-     funded and less capable of extricating themselves from the      tangle of FEC regulations.'' Thus, the FEC has functioned      ``more and more as a censor of political expression,      especially by issue-oriented, grassroots activists.'' \85\      Some of the most significant cases are reviewed below.                        A. FEC v. AFSCME (1979)       In FEC v. American Federation of State, County and      Municipal Employees (AFSCME),\86\ the District of Columbia      district court rejected the FEC's contention that a poster      qualified as express advocacy because it contained a clearly      identified candidate, ``may have tended to influence      voting,'' and ``contain[ed] communication on a public issue      widely debated during the campaign.'' \87\ The AFSCME union      had printed a     poster with a caricature of President Ford wearing a button      reading ``Pardon Me'' and embracing President Nixon, but it      did not report the expenditure as express advocacy. The      district court held that this was issue advocacy, not express      advocacy, because it contained no express words urging the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\88\ The      AFSCME court noted that ``[t]he Buckley analysis of the      limits of political activity is based on long recognized      principles: (1) political expression, including discussion of      candidates, is afforded the broadest protection under the      first amendment; and (2) discussion of public issues which      are also campaign issues unavoidably draws in candidates and      tends to inexorably exert influence in voting at elections.''      \89\                        B. FEC V. CLITRIM (1980)       Undeterred, the FEC brought suit against the Central Long      Island Tax Reform Immediately Committee for the      Organization's failure to report funds expended to publish      and distribute a leaflet advocating lower taxes and smaller      government. The Second Circuit, in FEC v. Central Long Island      Tax Reform Immediately Committee (CLITRIM),\90\ adhered to      the express advoacy test set forth in Buckley and, therefore,      ruled against the FEC.       The first provision at issue required ``any `person . . .      who makes contributions or independent expenditures expressly      advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified      candidate' '' in excess of one hundred dollars to file a      report with the FEC.\91\ The second provision required ``any      person who `makes an expenditure for the purpose of financing      communications expressly advocating the election or defeat      of a clearly identified candidate' . . . through media,      advertising or mailing to state whether the communication      is authorized by a candidate. . . .'' \92\       The CLITRIM court noted ``the broad protection to be given      political expression,'' \93\ as indicated by the Supreme      Court in Buckley, and observed that: ``[t]he language quoted      from the statutes was incorporated by Congress in the 1976      FECA amendments to conform the statute to the Supreme Court's      holding in Buckley v. Valeo that speech not by a candidate or      political committee could be regulated only to the extent      that the communications ``expressly advocate the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate.'' \94\       The court further observed that limiting the statutes to      reach only express advocacy ``is consistent with the firmly      established principle that the right to speak out at election      time is one of the most zealously protected under the      Constitution.'' \95\       The CLITRIM court held that: ``[t]he history of      Sec. Sec. 434(c) and 441d thus clearly establish that,      contrary to the position of the FEC, the words ``expressly      advocating'' mean[ ] exactly what they say. The FEC, to      support its position, argues that `[t]he TRIM bulletins at      issue here were not disseminated for such a limited purpose'      as merely informing the public about the voting record of a      government official. Rather the purpose was to unseat `big      spenders.' Thus, the FEC would apparently have us read      `expressly advocating the election or defeat' to mean for the      purpose, express or implied, of encouraging election or      defeat. This would, by statutory interpretation, nullify the      change in the statute ordered in Buckley v. Valeo and adopted      by Congress in the 1976 amendments. The position is totally      merit-less.'' \96\       From the CLITRIM decision, it seemed clear that the express      advocacy test was firmly ensconced as black-letter      constitutional law. Nevertheless, the FEC continued its      campaign to eliminate freedom of speech on issues at election      time.                        C. FEC. v. NCPAC (1985)       In 1985, the Supreme Court considered FEC v. National      Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC).\97\ This      case involved a declaratory judgment action seeking to have a      provision of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act \98\      declared constitutional. It was originally initiated by the      Democrat National Committee in hopes that it could prevent      NCPAC and another conservative PAC (Fund For A Conservative      Majority) from implementing their expressed intent to spend      large sums of money to aid the 1984 reelection of President      Ronald Reagan.\99\       The disputed provision made it a criminal offense for an      independent political committee ``to expend more than $1,000      to further [a] . . . candidate's election,'' if the      ``Presidential candidate elects public financing.'' \100\ The      Supreme Court declared the $1,000 cap on independent      expenditures unconstitutional because such independent      expenditures enjoyed full First Amendment protection and      there was no compelling state interest to override this right      of free expression.\101\       In NCPAC, the Supreme Court stated the only interest      sufficiently compelling to justify regulation of political      speech in the form of contributions and expenditures:       ``We held in Buckley and reaffirmed in Citizens Against      Rent Control that preventing corruption or the appearance of      corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government      interests thus far identified for restricting campaign      finances. . . .       ``Corruption is a subversion of the political process.      Elected officials are influenced to act contrary to their      obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to      themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns. The      hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars      for political favor.'' \102\       The Court went on to state that: ``The fact that candidates      and elected officials may alter or reaffirm their own      positions on issues in response to political message paid for      by PACs can hardly be called corruption, for one of the      essential features of democracy is the presentation to the      electorate of varying points of view.'' \103\       The implication of these statements should have been clear,      even to the FEC. For years the FEC has maintained the      position that it ought to be able to regulate issue advocacy      in the form of voter guides which tell where candidates stand      on issues, on the theory that issue-advocacy groups were      actually engaging in express advocacy or making a      contribution to the candidates who favored their issues.\104\      Voter guides might have the effect, the argument would go, or      persuading candidates to support the organization's views on      an issue.       However, if the only compelling interest for restricting      speech at election time is corruption (or its appearance),      and if persuading politicians to a different viewpoint of      advocacy of issues is not corruption, then there can be no      compelling governmental interest which would permit      restriction of issue advocacy. If this is true of PACs, then      a fortiori there can be no corruption or appearance of      corruption resulting from issue advocacy by any issue      advocacy groups. Undeterred, the FEC rejected the clear      teaching of the Supreme Court in Buckley, CLITRIM, and NCPAC      and continued its efforts to attempt to regulate issue      advocacy.                         D. FEC v. MCFL (1986)       In 1986, the Supreme Court again considered the      constitutional protection afforded issue advocacy in the case      of FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life (MCFL),\105\ The      FEC had brought an enforcement action against MCFL, alleging      that the organization had violated 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b, a ban      on corporate expenditures ``in connection with any      election,'' by publishing a voter guide.       The voter guide, published by MCFL, was contained in a      ``Special Edition' newsletter which encouraged readers to      ``Vote Pro-Life'' and identified the pro-life      candidates.\106\ A complaint was filed with the FEC alleging      that MCFL had violated the ban on corporate expenditures      found at 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b.\107\ The Supreme Court decided      that this ``Special Edition'' did not qualify for the      newspaper exemption found in the FECA,\108\ and that MCFL had      engaged in express advocacy, but that the First Amendment      required a special exemption from Sec. 441b's prohibitions      for MCFL-type corporations.\109\       Under the FECA, ``expenditure'' means to provide anything      of value ``for the purpose of influencing any election for      Federal office.'' \110\ This ``influencing'' language was the      same terminology construed by the Supreme Court in Buckley to      mean only express advocacy, in order to save a different      provision of the FECA from unconstitutionality for      sweeping issue advocacy within its ambit.       In MCFL, the Supreme Court considered the contention of      MCFL ``that the definition of an expenditure under Sec. 441b      necessarily incorporates the requirement that a communication      `expressly advocate' the election of candidates,'' relying on      Buckley.\111\ The FEC argued that the express advocacy test      should not be extended to this provision barring corporate      expenditures.       The MCFL Court held, however, that the express advocacy      rationale must be extended to restrictions on expenditures by      corporations.\112\ The Court said that, if a ceiling on      independent expenditures, at issue in Buckley, had to be      construed to apply only to express advocacy of the election      or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (in order to      eliminate the constitutional deficiencies described in      Buckley), ``this rationale requires a similar construction of      the more intrusive provision [at issue in MCFL] that directly      regulates independent spending.'' \113\       The Supreme Court rejected the FEC's argument that      extending the express advocacy protection to corporations and      labor unions ``would open the door to massive undisclosed      political spending.'' \114\ Nevertheless, the FEC continued      to treat constitutionally-protected issue advocacy as a      loophole which ought to be closed because it limited the      FEC's ability to regulate anything that might possibly      influence an election.\115\                       E. FEC v. FURGATCH (1987)       In 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth      Circuit decided the case of FEC v. Furgatch.\116\ This case      contained obiter dicta suggesting that the court was applying      a broadened express advocacy test to the FECA's requirement      that independent expenditures by an individual over $250 must      be reported to the FEC \117\ and must contain a      disclaimer.\118\       Buckley held that only ``explicit words'' ``expressly      advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified      candidate,'' constitute express advocacy.\119\ However, the      Ninth Circuit wrote that a court could look beyond the      explicit words of the communication to consider the context      in which the words were communicated.\120\ Furgatch      considered newspaper advertisements which made a number of      allegations about President Jimmy Carter followed by the      phrases, ``And we let him,'' ``And we let him do it again,''      ``We are letting him do it,'' and following paragraphs:       ``He continues to cultivate the fears, not the hopes, of      the voting public by suggesting the choice is between `peace      and war,' `black or white,' `north or south,' and `Jew vs.      Christian.' His meanness of spirit is divisive and reckless      McCarthyism at its worst. And from a man who once asked, `Why      Not the Best?'       ``It is an attempt to hide his own record, or lack of it.      If he succeeds the country will be burdened with four more      years of incoherences, ineptness and illusion, as he leaves a      legacy of low-level campaigning.       ``DON'T LET HIM DO IT.''\121\       Noticeably absent from this communication are any words of      express advocacy. Nowhere does the communication contain      explicit words such as ``vote for'' or ``defeat.'' The Ninth      Circuit, however, decided that the context should be      consulted: ``We conclude that speech need not include any of      the words listed in Buckley to be express advocacy under the      Act, but it must, when read as a whole, and with limited      reference to external events, be susceptible of no other      reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote for      or against a specific candidates.'' \122\       Applying its contextual standard, the Ninth Circuit      determined that Mr. Furgatch had engaged in express advocacy.       Four key facts should be noted about Furgatch. First,      although the MCFL decision was issued on December 15, 1986,      and the Furgatch decision was issued just days later on      January 9, 1987, Furgatch made no mention of the newly      announced MCFL decision, which clearly reaffirmed the bright-     line Buckley approach. Second, as discussed below, the      Furgatch contextual approach has not been followed by other      courts and has, in fact, been expressly repudiated by      some.\123\       Third, the broader test was employed in a case which      involved only a failure to report an expenditure to the      FEC.\124\ Fourth, the Fourth Circuit has recently      demonstrated in a careful exegesis of Furgatch that the Ninth      Circuit did not go to the extreme to which the FEC has tried      to stretch it and that the actual holding of Furgatch      conforms quite closely to Buckley and MCFL.\125\       Thus, the Furgatch test was decided in, and only logically      applies to, the very narrow context of disclosure provisions.      The Furgatch court noted the Supreme ``Court's directive      that, where First Amendment concerns are present, we must      construe the words of the regulatory statute precisely and      narrowly, only as far as is necessary to further the purposes      of the Act.'' \126\ The court then devoted a full page to      discussing the importance of disclosure, the purposes served      thereby, and the minimal burden imposed by disclosure.\127\      Because it concluded that disclosure ``serves an important      Congressional policy and a very strong First Amendment      interest,'' and, because the burden imposed would be      ``minimally restrictive,'' the Ninth Circuit adopted a      totality of the circumstances test.\128\ Therefore, if      Furgatch is good law, it should be limited to its context.       Moreover, as mentioned, the Fourth Circuit's careful      analysis has demonstrated that the core Furgatch holding      closely conforms to the Buckley and MCFL express advocacy      test and that any more broadly worded language was both dicta      and contrary to Supreme Court precedent,\129\ a fact the FEC      clearly understood at the time.\130\ In fact, the Fourth      Circuit has recently excoriated the FEC, and awarded      attorneys' fees against it, for bad faith prosecution in      duplicitous reliance on a broad interpretation of Furgatch      when the FEC had demonstrated its clear understanding of the      true narrowness of the Furgatch holding in its Brief for      Respondent in Opposition to Mr. Furgatch's petition for a      writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.\131\ The Fourth      Circuit's censure of the FEC for its duplicity and      dissembling with regard to Furgatch is discussed at greater      length below.       Nevertheless, energized by its success in opposing Supreme      Court review of Furgatch and preserving the broadly-worded      Furgatch dicta, which was useful for expanding FEC power, the      FEC launched a campaign to apply its totality-of-the-     circumstances ``express advocacy'' test in a wide range of      contexts.                          F. FEC v. NOW (1989)       In the case of FEC v. National Organization for Women      (NOW),\132\ the FEC again brought an enforcement action      employing its broadly defined express advocacy test. The FEC      charged that membership solicitation letters discussing      issues to pay inequality, abortion, and the Equal Rights      Amendment (ERA) constituted express advocacy. The letters at      issue expressly criticized the Reagan Administration and the      Republican Party, including the following phrase which the      FEC found damming: ``Politicians listen when they think an      organized group of citizens can help elect or defeat them.''      Another letter criticized by name Senators Helms, Hatch, and      Thurmond and spoke of ``a renewed effort now being launched      by New Right reactionary groups in preparation for the 1984      elections,'' which phrase the FEC condemned as      electioneering. A third letter made the case for the ERA and      condemned President Reagan and named several senators ``up      for reelection in 1984,'' who ``must be made to understand      that failure to pass the ERA will result in powerful      campaigns to defeat them''\133\ As a result of these      statements, the FEC claimed that NOW has violated the      corporate prohibition on candidate-related speech.       The NOW court referred to both the Buckley test \134\ and      the Furgatch ``broad test.''\135\ However, the NOW court held      that there simply was no express advocacy under any      test,\136\ tying its holding explicitly to the Buckley      principles: ``At issues in this case is political speech,      which lies at the core of the First Amendment. Discussion of      public issues and the qualifications of candidates for public      office is integral to a system of government in which the      people elect their leaders. In order to make informed choices      about its leaders, the citizenry needs to hear the free      exchange of ideas. The First Amendment affords the broadcast      protection to such political expression.'' \137\                        G. FAUCHER v. FEC (1991)       It should have been clear to the FEC that the Supreme Court      meant what it said in Buckley about issue advocacy being      sacrosanct when the Court reaffirmed the test in a new      context in MCFL. However, the FEC continued to press ahead      with its efforts to regulate issue advocacy. Included in its      effort was the promulgation of new rules regulating voter      guides.       In Faucher v. FEC,\138\ the First Circuit struck down the      Federal Election Commission's regulations of voter guides as      being beyond the authority of the FEC under 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 441b as interpreted by the Supreme Court in MCFL. The      regulation at issue, 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.4(b)(5), required      that a voter guide by ``nonpartisan,'' which the FEC defined      by reference to six factors. These factors included whether      ``the wording of their questions presented . . . suggest or      favor any position on the issues covered'' and whether ``the      voter guide expressed (any) editorial opinion concerning the      issues presented.'' \139\       The United States District Court for the District of Maine      struck the regulations down for trespassing upon      constitutionally protected issue advocacy and for reaching      beyond the authority of the Federal Election Commission under      Sec. 441b, which bars corporate political speech.\140\ The      First Circuit affirmed the decision of the District      Court,\141\ declaring that ``[t]he first amendment lies at      the heart of our most cherished and protected freedoms. Among      those freedoms is the right to engage in issue-oriented      political speech.'' \142\       The First Circuit expressly applied the ``bright-line''      test of Buckley in accordance with the speech-protective      rationale of that case: ``In our view, trying to discern when      issue advocacy in a voter guide crosses the threshold and      becomes express advocacy invites just the sort of      constitutional questions the Court sought to avoid by      adopting the bright-line express advocacy test in Buckley.''      \143\                h. fec v. survival education fund (1994)       In FEC v. Survival Education Fund,\144\ the U.S. District      Court for the Southern District of New York rejected an FEC      attempt to broaden the express advocacy test of Buckley and      MCFL. The case involved letters sent four months before an      election by Dr. Benjamin Spock that were hostile to President      Reagan and condemned his policies. The FEC argued that the      letters constituted express advocacy and, therefore, were      prohibited political communications by a corporation. The      court, however, pointed to the ``express words'' formula in      Buckley and held that: ``It is clear from the cases that      expressions of hostility to the positions of an official,      implying that that official should not be reelected--even      when the implication is quite clear--do not constitute the      express advocacy which runs afoul of the statute. Obviously,      the courts are not giving a broad reading to this statute.''      \145\               i. fec v. christian action network (1995)       In FEC v. Christian Action Network,\146\ a Virginia      district court considered advertisements, run during the 1992      election campaign, which the FEC considered to be express      advocacy of the defeat of presidential candidate Clinton.      Because the ads did not contain ``explicit words or imagery      advocating electoral action,'' the court held that they      constituted protected issue advocacy and not      electioneering.\147\ The Court followed the ``strict      interpretation'' of the express advocacy test: ``In the      nineteen years since the Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley v.      Valeo, the parameters of the `express advocacy' standard have      been addressed by several federal courts in a variety of      circumstances. * * * Acknowledging that political expression,      including the discussion of public issues and debate on the      qualifications of candidates enjoys extensive First Amendment      protection, the vast majority of these courts have adopted a      strict interpretation of the `express advocacy' standard.''      \148\       On August 2, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for      the Fourth Circuit issued a brief per curiam opinion      affirming the district court.\149\                         j. fec v. gopac (1996)       FEC v. GOPAC,\150\ the FEC's much ballyhooed enforcement      action against GOPAC (which Newt Gingrich served as      chairman), amply demonstrates the FEC's refusal to recognize      the constitutional protection afforded issue advocacy by the      bright-line express advocacy test and the major purpose test.      Despite the fact that GOPAC did not have as its major purpose      the election or nomination of candidates for federal office,      the FEC pushed for a test that would make an organization a      political committee if it ``engage[s] in `partisan politics'      or `electoral activity.' '' \151\ The court rejected this      approach and granted GOPAC summary judgment because the test      proposed was not that of the Supreme Court in Buckley.\152\                k. new fec regulations (october 5, 1995)       After the Faucher decision in 1991, which struck down FEC      regulations prohibiting voter guides from expressing a      position on an issue,\153\ the FEC needed to revise or delete      its regulation dealing with voter guides. All that was needed      to bring the regulation into compliance with the First      Amendment was a     small excision in the definition of ``nonpartisan,'' so that      the factors for what constituted ``nonpartisan'' would not      include whether a question is worded in a way that supports      the position of a candidate on the issue covered.\154\       The FEC took from 1991 to late 1995 to promulgate its new      rules.\155\ When the new rules were published, there was no      mere excision or minimal editing to fix the First Amendment      problem with issue advocacy. Rather, the new FEC      regulations were an expansive effort to bypass the First      Amendment jurisprudence of the federal courts. The rules      were a transparent attempt to incorporate the FEC's      interpretation of the Furgatch totality of the      circumstances test into the FEC rules in the hope that the      FEC could sell the federal courts on the notion that      deference should be granted to the agencies interpretation      in federal law in this area.\156\       If such deference were forthcoming, the FEC would have      accomplished by rulemaking what it had failed in years of      litigating enforcement actions to achieve, i.e., imposing its      broad interpretations of the Furgatch test in place of the      Supreme Court's bright-line express advocacy test. As shall      be seen, the deference was not forthcoming.       The FEC issued its copious new post-Faucher rules in two      sets in late 1995. The first set was to take effect on      October 5, 1995. The revision of the FEC voter guide      regulations necessitated by Faucher four years before      occurred in a later set of rules to take effect March 13,      1996.       The October 5 set of rules contained a new definition of      express advocacy, tracking the FEC's broad interpretation of      Furgatch:       ``Expressly advocating means any communication that--       ``(a) uses phrases such as `vote for the President,' `re-     elect your Congressman,' `support the Democratic nominee,'      `cast your ballot for the Republican challenger for U.S.      Senate in Georgia,' `Smith for Congress,' `Bill McKay in 94,'      `vote Pro-Life' or `vote Pro-Choice' accompanied by a listing      of clearly identified candidates described as Pro-Life or      Pro-Choice, `vote against Old Hickory,' `defeat' accompanied      by a picture of one or more candidate(s), or communications      of campaign slogan(s) which in context can have no other      reasonable meaning than to encourage the election or defeat      of one or more clearly identified candidate(s), such as      posters, bumper stickers, advertisements, etc. which say      `Nixon's the One,' `Carter 76,' `Reagan/Bush' or `Mondale!';      or       ``(b) when taken as a whole and with limited reference to      external events, such as the proximity to the election, could      only be interpreted by a reasonable person as containing      advocacy of the election or defeat of one or more clearly      identified candidate(s) because--       ``(1) The electoral portion of the communication is      unmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of only one      meaning; and       ``(2) Reasonable minds could not differ as to whether it      encourages actions to elect or defeat one or more clearly      identified candidate(s) or encourages some other kind of      action.\157\''       While the first part of subsection (a) generally followed      Buckley, specifying explicit and express words of advocacy in      the communication itself, the second part of subsection (a)      added a contextual factor, relying on Furgatch. Subsection      (b) was wholly patterned after the FEC's broad interpretation      of Furgatch. Of course, such a definition of express advocacy      would leave the speaker uncertain whether the FEC would find      a communication to constitute express advocacy, consequently      chilling protected speech. Such a definition would abandon      the bright-line test Buckley said was essential to safeguard      protected issue advocacy in this arena, and it would afford      the FEC great latitude in its enforcement.\158\             L. MAINE RIGHT TO LIFE COMMITTEE v. FEC (1966)       The FEC's new express advocacy definition took effect on      October 5, 1995. On November 22, 1995, Maine Right to Life      (also a plaintiff in the Faucher case) filed a complaint and      motions seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\159\ On      February 13, 1996, the United States District Court for the      District of Maine declared the latest regulations of the FEC      seeking to define express advocacy\160\ to be ``invalid as      not authorized by the Federal Election Campaigns Act of 1971,      as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in      Massachsuetts Citizens for Life, and by the United States      Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Faucher, because it      extends beyond issue advocacy.''\161\ The district court      struck down a definition of ``[e]xpressly advocating,'' \162\      which ``comes directly from'' Furgatch.\163\ The district      court relied on the fact that, contrary to the Ninth      Circuit's decision in Furgatch, the Supreme Court in      Buckley and MCFL created a bright-line protection of issue      advocacy, ``even at the risk that it is used to elect or      defeat a candidate.'' \164\       On October 18, 1996, the First Circuit issued a brief per      curiam opinion affirming ``for substantially the reasons set      forth in the district court opinion.''\165\       The FEC, however, has obstinately taken the position that      these regulations are still in effect in all other      jurisdictions than the First Circuit, even though the action      was brought under the Administrative Procedure Act and the      First Circuit held that the FEC was without authority to      promulgate these regulations and, thus, they are void.\166\                M. NEW FEC REGULATIONS (MARCH 13, 1996)       After releasing the regulations which were struck down in      Maine Right to Life Committee, the FEC next released revised      rules setting forth the FEC's requirements for ``voter      guides'' and ``voting records.'' \167\ They became effective      on March 13, 1996.\168\ Under the new voter guide      regulation,\169\ the amount of contact that a corporation had      with a candidate regarding the voter guide severely affected      the content of the voter guide.       First, if the corporation had any oral communications with      a candidate regarding the voter guide, the publication of the      voter guide was absolutely prohibited. A prohibited oral      communication would even include contacting the candidate to      clarify a candidate's position on an issue.\170\ As a result      of the oral communication, the publication of the voter guide      was considered by the FEC to be an in-kind contribution to      the candidate and, thus, a prohibited corporate contribution      under Sec. 441b.       However, if the corporation had no oral or written contact      with the candidate,\171\ the corporation retained its right      to state a position on the issues of the voter guide (a First      Amendment right recognized in the Faucher case). Of course,      it is very difficult to prepare a voter guide without sending      a written questionnaire to the candidates asking them to      state their positions on the issues, so written      questionnaires are the common practice.\172\ Because the use      of a questionnaire is so important to an effective voter      guide, most organizations would feel compelled to at least      contact the candidate in writing, resulting in severely      limiting their issue advocacy.       If an organization had written contact with the      candidate,\173\ the content of the voter guide was severely      restricted.\174\ First, ``all of the candidates for a      particular seat or office shall be provided an equal      opportunity to respond . . . .'' \175\ Second, ``no candidate      may receive greater prominence in the voter guide, than other      participating candidates, or substantially more space for      responses.''\176\ Voter guides shall not contain an      ``electioneering message.''\177\ Finally, the regulation      mandates that a ``voter guide and its accompanying materials      shall not score or rate the candidates' responses in such a      way as to convey an electioneering message.'' \178\ Thus, to      do a voter guide after written contact with a candidate, the      corporation had to surrender its constitutionally-protected      right to engage in issue advocacy in voter guides.       Having been repeatedly frustrated by the courts in its      attempt to regulate voter guides as expenditures because of      the express advocacy test, the FEC based its new voter guide      regulations on a new ``contribution'' theory. This theory      attempted to avoid the express advocacy test by      labeling\179\ expenditures for a voter guide as ``in-kind      contributions'' to the candidate, which are also      prohibited by corporations under Sec. 44lb. The FEC's hope      was that, if an expenditure for a communication was      labeled as an ``in-kind contribution,'' then the courts      would not require that the communication contain express      advocacy but merely influence an election. Furthermore,      this theory took a very expansive view of when an      expenditure was requested by or coordinated with a      candidate, which is an essential element to make an      expenditure into an ``in-kind contribution.'' In both      respects, however, the FEC violated existing court      precedents.       The FECA made it unlawful for any corporation or union ``to      make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any      election''\180\ The FECA defines ``contribution or      expenditure'' to include ``any direct or indirect payment, .      . . or gift of money, or services, or anything of value . . .      to any candidate . . . in connection with any      election.''\181\ Of course, it was this language that the      Court in MCFL held must contain ``express advocacy,'' if an      expenditure were to be considered an independent expenditure.      However, the FEC is shifting from the word ``expenditure'' to      the word ``contribution,'' which encompasses both direct and      indirect contributions. A direct contribution is made by      actually giving money to the candidate. An in-kind      contribution occurs when something of value (like a mailing      list) is given to the candidate or when a person pays, at the      request of the candidate or an agent of his campaign, for an      expense that the campaign itself would otherwise pay (like a      billboard) in lieu of a direct contribution to the candidate.      However, Congress did not intend for ``in-kind      contributions'' to be a broad category. In adopting the      concept of an ``in-kind contribution,'' the Senate Report      described an ``in-kind contribution'' as ``the use of an      individual's resources to aid a candidate in a manner      indistinguishable in substance from the direct payment of      cash to a candidate.''\182\       Thus, an ``in-kind contribution'' has two elements. The      first element is the nature of the expenditure. According to      the courts, an expenditure for a communication must contain      ``express advocacy'' to be an independent expenditure. The      logic of the courts' analysis suggests that this extends to      in-kind contributions. According to the FEC, however, an in-     kind contribution may exist where there is only issue      advocacy. The second element is whether it is made with the      consent or in coordination with the candidate. Here, the FEC      also has a very expansive view of coordination.       Ironically, the FEC had previously adopted the correct      position that express advocacy is necessary in order to      transform a protected expenditure into a prohibited      contribution. In Orloski v. Federal Election Commission,\183\      a political opponent of an incumbent Congressman challenged      the FEC's failure to     find ``reason to believe'' that the Act had been violated.      The case concerned a senior citizens' picnic at which the      Congressman spoke and to which several corporations had      provided food and services such as transportation.       At issue was the FEC's interpretation of what constituted a      corporate contribution under Sec. 441b(a). The FEC had      previously ``interpreted the Act to mean the corporate      funding of events sponsored by congressmen who are candidates      for reelection is not prohibited by Sec. 441(b)(a) if those      events are non-political.''\184\ In order to determine      whether an event is non-political, the FEC adopted the      following test: ``An event is non-political if (1) there is      an absence of any communication expressly advocating the      nomination or election of the congressman appearing or the      defeat of any other candidate, and (2) there is no      solicition, making, or acceptance of a campaign contribution      for the congressman in connection with the event.'' \185\       Because the FEC found that there was no express advocacy at      the picnic in question, it found that the event was ``non-     political'' and, thus, that it did not entail a violation of      the corporate contribution prohibition of Sec. 441b. As the      Orloski court explained: ``the mere fact that corporate      donations were made with the consent of the candidate does      not mean that a `contribution' within the meaning of the Act      has been made. Under the Act this type of `donation' is only      a contribution if it first qualifies as an `expenditure' and,      under the FEC's interpretation, such a donation is not an      expenditure unless someone at the funded event expressly      advocates the reelection of the incumbent or the defeat of an      opponent . . .''\186\       In its new regulations, however, the FEC now sought to      repudiate its former, reasonable position that corporate      expenditures are not political contributions which can be      prohibited under Sec. 441(b) unless they involve express      advocacy. The new regulations governed the      ``electioneering message'' of voter guides on the      porported authority derived from converting expenditures      for voter guides into contributions.       The new regulations also adopted an expansive view of what      constitutes ``coordination.'' The FEC apparently has two      theories: (1) the contact coordination theory, and (2) the      presumed coordination theory.\187\ The contact coordination      theory was employed in the new voter guide regulations. As      the structure of the voter guide regulation made clear, the      FEC viewed any contact between the corporation publishing the      voter guide and a candidate to constitute coordination of the      voter guide and the greater the contact the greater the      taint. Thus, oral communications resulted in an absolute      prohibition on publishing a voter guide; written      communication forfeited the corporation's right to engage in      issue advocacy in their voter guide.                        N. Clifton v. FEC (1996)       In response to these newly-issued FEC regulations      restricting voter guides, Maine Right to Life Committee \188\      again filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act to      have the regulations declared beyond the authority of the FEC      under 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441(b), as construed by the Supreme Court      in MCFL.\189\ The case, Clifton v. FEC,\190\ challenged the      regulations,\191\ which ``restrict(ed) contact or      coordination between a corporation and a candidate when the      corporation publishes candidate voting records or voter      guides.'' \192\       On May 20, 1996, the district court granted Plaintiffs'      request for a declaration that the regulations were void as      beyond the statutory authority of the FEC. The district court      found that the voter guide regulation restricted not only      ``express advocacy'' but also ``issue advocacy.'' As the      Court stated, ``[t]he new regulations go far beyond the      language of section 441(b) as interpreted by MCFL. Under the      provisions for voter guides, the FEC test is not whether a      corporation is engaging in issue advocacy `on behalf of a      candidate' (a test which MCFL would support), but whether it      has had any 'contact' with the candidate. The regulations      permit unrestricted issue advocacy only if there is no      contact, oral or written in connection with a voter guide.      Any oral contact concerning the content of a voter guide--     questions to clarify a candidate's position for example--     results in outright prohibition of corporate issue advocacy      through use of the guide. Even written contact with      candidates results in severe constraints on issue advocacy      otherwise entitled to broad First Amendment protection under      the teachings of Buckley and MCFL.'' \193\       Also under the ostensible statutory authority of 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 441(b), the FEC promulgated 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.4(c)(4)      which purported to govern corporate preparation and      distribution of the ``voting records'' of Members of Congress      to the general public. That regulation provided that ``the      decision on content and the distribution of voting records      shall not be coordinated with any candidate, group of      candidates or political party.''       The district court agreed with Plaintiffs' contention that      the ``voting record'' regulation also impermissibly      restricted issue advocacy. Noting that the regulation      provided that the decision on ``content'' could not be      ``coordinated'' with a candidate, the Court asked: ``Does      that prohibit discussion with the candidate of what a      particular vote meant and a summary of the outcome in the      published voting record? If there are three apparently      inconsistent votes and the MRLC asks the candidate for a      explanation in the publication, is that prohibited      coordination of a decision on content? These are exactly the      types of issue advocacy undertaken by the MRLC and, as I      understand the FEC's counsel at oral argument, such      activities are indeed prohibited by the new regulations.''      \194\       Because the district court found that both regulations      restricted issue advocacy, not just express advocacy, it held      that they were invalid under Faucher, MCFL and Buckley: ``It      is equally clear after Buckley and MCFL that corporate      expenditures in connection with a federal election or primary      cannot constitutionally be limited except when they are      devoted to express advocacy of the election or defeat of a      particular candidate or candidates.'' \195\       The FEC has appealed the decision to the First      Circuit.\196\        O. COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE v. FEC       While there has been a great deal of ongoing litigation in      state and federal courts over election laws, the 1996 case of      Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC \197\      is significant as the most recent word from the Supreme Court      on election law issues. The case revealed steadfast support      on the Court for protecting First Amendment rights in the      election law context.       Significantly, the case completely undercut the FEC's      presumed coordination theory. Colorado Republican did not      involve Sec. 441(b) (barring corporate campaign expenditures      and contributions), but its rejection of the presumed      coordination theory is a clearly transferable concept      relevant to the FEC's efforts to regulate corporate political      speech under Sec. 441(b).\198\ Moreover, the opinions in the      case revealed strong support for the express advocacy test in      this context as well.       The case involved FEC allegations that the Colorado      Republican Party had exceeded FECA limits on what a party      could spend to promote a candidate in a U.S. senatorial      race.\199\ The case arose as a result of advertisements      purchased in April 1986 by the Federal Campaign Committee of      the Colorado Republican Party. The radio advertisements      attacked Democrat Timothy Wirth, who was then a U.S.      Congressman and the most likely Democrat candidate for the      open Senate seat.\200\ He had announced in January 1986 that      he would run for the Senate.\201\ At the time of the      advertisements, the Republican Party had not chosen its      nominee from among the three persons competing for the      nomination.\202\       The record revealed how the expenditure for the      advertisements was made. The GOP state chairman arranged for      the script on his own initiative.\203\ He approved it without      input from others.\204\ In sum, he did not actually      coordinate the expenditure with any candidate. It was what      normally would be considered an independent expenditure.       However, the FEC argued that, because of the relationship      between a party and its candidates, ``coordination with      candidates is presumed,'' \205\ even though there was      factually none in this case.\206\ The lead opinion of Justice      Breyer, joined by Justices O'Connor and Souter, rejected this      presumed coordination approach, declaring that, because ``the      record shows no actual coordination as a matter of fact,''      \207\ ``we therefore treat the expenditure, for      constitutional purposes, as an `independent' expenditure, not      an indirect campaign contribution.'' \208\ This rejection of      presumed coordination in the context of expenditures by a      political party to attack an opposing candidate for office      makes it highly unlikely that a presumption of coordination      will be permitted in situations where there is less basis for      a presumption. Coordination will have to be actual before an      expenditure will be considered a contribution.\209\       Because Justices Breyer, O'Connor, and Souter rejected the      notion of presumed coordination, they also rejected the      notion that the expenditures at issue were actually      contributions. Therefore, they decided it would be prudential      not to reach the issue of whether a cap on coordinated      expenditures by a political party is constitutional, as urged      by the Colorado Republican Party. However, an opinion by      Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and      Justice Scalia, opined that the party contribution limit to      candidates was unconstitutional on its face, but concurred in      a judgment vacating the court of appeals decision and      remanding the case,\210\ as did Justice Thomas.\211\       From the Colorado Republican case, it seems clear that any      theory that presumed coordination can convert independent      expenditures into contributions must fail. Only actual      coordination will achieve such a result. Of course, this      is also true where a voter guide merely contains issue      advocacy.                    FEC v. Christian Action Network       After the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's      dismissal of FEC charges in FEC v. Christian Action      Network,\212\ the Christian Action Network filed a petition      for attorneys' fees and costs under the Equal Access to      Justice Act, which permits fee awards for enforcement actions      that are not ``substantially justified.'' \213\ The Fourth      Circuit determined that the FEC's enforcement in reliance on      its broad interpretation of Furgatch was not ``substantially      justified,'' but was in ``bad faith.'' \214\       The Fourth Circuit cataloged the reasons why the express      advocacy test, as set forth in Buckley and MCFL, was so clear      that failure to follow it constituted bad faith.\215\ The      court focused especially on the Furgatch decision, on which      the FEC had based its authority to prosecute the Christian      Action     Network.\216\ After carefully analyzing Furgatch, the Fourth      Circuit summarized the holding of that case: ``Indeed, the      simple holding of Furgatch was that, in those instances where      political communications do include an explicit directive to      voters to take some course of action, but that course of      action is unclear, `context'--including the timing of the      communication in relation to the events of the day--may be      considered in determining whether the action urged is the      election or defeat of a particular candidate for public      office.'' \217\       The fourth Circuit then pointed out that the FEC had fully      understood that explicit words expressly advocating the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate were      essential to ``express advocacy'' when it opposed Supreme      Court review of the Furgatch case:       ``That the commission knows well the Court's holdings in      Buckley and MCFL is further confirmed by the agency's      subsequent action in Furgatch. . . . Because Furgatch,      despite its narrow holding, does include broad dicta which      can be read (or misread) to support the FEC's expansive view      of its authority, the agency vigorously opposed certiorari in      the case.       ``Wishing to have the opinion preserved intact, the      Commission in its submissions there, in contrast to its      submissions before this court, quoted Buckley as `requir[ing]      ``explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a      candidate.''' The Commission even took the position that      Furgatch did . . . interpret the Federal election Campaign      Act's corporate disclosure statutes as `narrowly limited to      communications containing language ``susceptible to no other      reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote'' ' .      . . .       ``Moreover, the FEC argued to the Supreme Court that      Furgatch was fully consistent with Buckley and MCFL precisely      because the opinion focused on the specific language of      Furgatch's advertisement and concluded that express advocacy      existed only because the advertisement `explicitly exhorted'      voters to defeat then-President Carter. Thus, there is no      doubt the Commission understands that its position that no      words of advocacy are required in order to support its      jurisdiction runs directly counter to Supreme Court      precedent.'' \218\       The fourth Circuit took the FEC to task for ``dissembling      before th[e] court'' for ``quot[ing] the very sentence from      page 80 of Buckley in which the Court uses the phrase      `express advocacy,''' but leaving out ``the sentence's      footnote 108'' (which defined express advocacy ``to mean      `express words of advocacy,'') without ``any reference, by      parenthetical or otherwise to the fact that footnote 108      appears in that sentence.\219\       The Fourth Circuit concluded that the FEC had acted in bad      faith by bringing an enforcement action against the Christian      Action network in the face of absolutely clear precedent on      the express advocacy test: ``In the face of the unequivocal      Supreme Court and other authority discussed, an argument such      as that made by the FEC in this case, that `no words of      advocacy are necessary to expressly advocate the election of      a candidate,' simply cannot be advanced in good faith (as the      disingenuousness in the FEC's submissions attests), much less      with `substantial justification.''' \220\       The Fourth Circuit further concluded that, even if the      precedent were not unequivocally clear, the court ``would      bridle at the power over political speech that would reside      in the FEC under'' the FEC's interpretation of the express      advocacy test.\221\ The FEC's interpretation, said the court      boils down to ``an argument that the FEC will know `express      advocacy' when it sees it.'' \222\ The court summarized the      clarity of the precedent and the danger of FEC's      overreaching as follows: ``[T]he Supreme Court has      unambiguously held that the First Amendment forbids the      regulation of our political speech under such      indeterminate standards. `Explicit words of advocacy of      election or defeat of a candidate,' `express words of      advocacy,' the Court has held, are the constitutional      minima. To allow the government's power to be brought to      bear on less, would effectively be to dispossess corporate      citizens of their fundamental right to engage in the very      kind of political issue advocacy the First Amendment was      intended to protect--as this case well confirms.''\223\       In summary, as this section has shown, there has been a      long and relentless effort by the FEC to close what it has      perceived to be a loophole with respect to issue advocacy--     the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's express advocacy      test and major purpose test remain as the twin bulwarks      against this encroachment of liberty.           iv. other protection for free political expression       In addition to its zealous safeguarding of issue advocacy      in the election context, the United States Supreme Court has      provided safeguards for other forms of speech related to      political matters. The seven key protections have to do with      (1) MCFL-type organizations, (2) members, (3) anonymous      literature, (4) caps on contributions and expenditures, (5)      political committees, (6) the burden of proof, and (7) prior      restraint of speech. These topics will be dealt with in turn.                       a. mcfl-type organizations       In FEC v. Masschusetts Citizens for Life,\224\ the Supreme      Court did two important things: (1) it reasserted the bright-     line express advocacy test for protecting issue advocacy, and      (2) it also created an exemption to the ban on corporate      express advocacy found in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b for nonprofit,      nonstock, ideological corporations. Other cases have refined      this test for MCFL-type organizations. As would be expected,      the FEC has attempted to overrule the case law with new      regulations, which have promptly been declared      unconstitutional. These developments will be considered in      turn.       Section 441b of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971      prohibits corporations from making ``expenditures'' in      connection with a federal election.\225\ The United States      Supreme Court, however, has limited the scope of Sec. 441b's      corporate expenditure prohibition. In MCFL, the Supreme Court      held that the prohibition on corporate expenditures could not      constitutionally be applied to certain nonprofit ideological      membership corporations because they did not pose a threat of      corruption to the political system.\226\       Specifically, the ``MCFL exemption'' from the prohibition      on corporate political speech applies to those nonprofit      corporations which were established to promote political      ideas, have no shareholders or members with economic      disincentives to disassociate with the corporation if they      disagree with its position on an issue, were not established      by a business corporation or labor union, and do not act as      `'conduits'' for funneling money from such organizations into      the political marketplace.\227\       In Day v. Holahan,\228\ the Eighth Circuit held that the      MCFL exemption applied to Minnesota Citizens Concerned for      Life (MCCL), despite the face that the organization received      some corporate contributions. The court held that MCCL was      the type of corporation which did not pose a threat of      corruption to the political marketplace and, therefore, under      the Constitution, was entitled to the MCFL exemption. As a      result, the Eighth Circuit held that a Minnesota state      statute that narrowed the MCFL exemption to such an extent      that it did not apply to MCCL was unconstitutional. This      case, therefore, established a de minimis test with respect      to MCFL-type organizations which receive some minimal      corporate contributions.       Subsequent to Day, the FEC promulgated regulations at 11      C.F.R. Sec. 114.10, purporting to define the circumstances      under which the MCFL exemption is available to nonprofit      ideological corporations under the FECA. In it's      ``Explanation and Justification'' for the regulation, the FEC      explicitly admitted that its regulation was in direct      conflict with Day v. Holahan: ``In that case, the Eighth      Circuit decided that a Minnesota statute that closely tracked      the Supreme Court's three essential features was      unconstitutional as applied to a Minnesota nonprofit      corporation. The Commission believes the Eighth Circuit's      decision, which is controlling law in only one circuit, is      contrary to the plain language used by the Supreme Court in      MCFL, and therefore is of limited authority.'' \229\       Thus, the FEC promulgated 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.10 despite its      recognition that the regulations would directly violate the      Eighth Circuit's holding in Day.       The FEC's regulations disallowed an exemption unless, inter      alia, each of the following criteria were met: (1) the      corporation's ``only express purpose is the promotion of      political ideas,'' \230\ (2) the corporation ``cannot engage      in business activities,'' \231\ (3) the corporation has      ``[n]o persons who are offered or who receive any benefit      that is a disincentive for them to disassociate themselves      with the corporation on the basis of a political issue.''      \232\ and (4) the corporation can ``demonstrate through      accounting records'' that it ``does not . . . accept      donations or anything of value from business corporations''      or that it ``has a written policy against accepting donations      from business corporations. . . .'' \233\       The FEC regulations further required \234\ that a      corporation which is not a political committee file a      certification that it complied with the provisions of the      regulations \235\ and, therefore, was eligible for an      exemption from the prohibition on corporate expenditures. The      regulations also required that ``[w]henever a qualified      nonprofit corporation solicits donations, the solicitation      shall inform potential donors that their donations may be      used for political purposes, such as supporting or opposing      candidates.'' \236\       The FEC's new regulations were clearly unconstitutional.      They constituted another transparent effort by the FEC to      expand its power and to limit political speech, as set out      below.  1. MCFL's Test for an Exemption from Sec. 441b Must Be Read in the             Context of That Case's Protection of Free Speech       The Supreme Court's decision in MCFL is essentially a      speech-protective holding. The Court's fashioning of the      ``MCFL exemption'' was rooted in the very principles of      public policy and governance which animate the First      Amendment, and which bear brief reiteration. The Court stated      that ``[f]reedom of speech plays a fundamental role in a      democracy. . . .'' \237\ As the Court had previously stated      in Buckley: ``Discussion of public issues and debate on the      qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of      the system of government established by our Constitution. The      First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such      political expression in order to assure [the] unfettered      interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and      social changes desired by the people.'' \238\       Freedom of speech, particularly political speech, is thus      necessary to the functioning of a representative democracy.      As such, it is also ``the matrix, the indispensable condition      of every other form of freedom.'' \239\ That is, because      freedom of speech protects our very form of government, it      necessarily plays a pivotal and essential role in protecting      the other freedoms which are safeguarded by the Constitution.      Finally, as the MCFL Court pointed out, ``First Amendment      speech is not necessarily limited to such an instrumental      role.'' \240\ In other words, the First Amendment protects      speech not only because it fosters free government, but      because it fosters the development of the individual by      protecting freedom of thought and conscience. Quoting Justice      Brandeis, the Court stated: ``Those who won our independence      believed that the final end of the State was to make men free      to develop their faculties; and that in its government the      deliberative forces should prevail over the arbitrary. They      valued liberty both as an end and as a means.'' \241\       Thus, free speech plays a vital role in protecting      democracy itself, thereby making possible the other freedoms      we enjoy and allowing people to develop their faculties to      the fullest extent possible.       Given the centrality of free speech, it is not surprising      that the Supreme Court has been extremely solicitous to      protect it. The MCFL Court explained that, because free      speech is fundamental, ``we must be as vigilant against the      modest diminution of speech as we are against the mode3st      diminution of speech as we are against its sweeping      restriction.'' \242\ The Court's solicitude for free speech,      in turn, caused it to fashion the fundamental principle which      both mandates and explains the Court's holding in MCFL:      ``Where at all possible, government must curtail speech only      to the degree necessary to meet the particular problem at      hand, and must avoid infringing on speech that does not pose      the danger that has prompted regulation.'' \243\       The quoted statement is, in reality, a reformulation of the      ``strict scrutiny'' test (i.e., speech regulation must be      narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest) which      the Supreme Court applies in all cases where a regulation is      challenged as a content-based restriction on speech.\244\ In      essence, the Court was saying that, because as a Nation we      value free speech so highly, our government is permitted to      regulate it only where the government's interest is      compelling and only to the extent absolutely necessary to      achieve that interest.       The burden of demonstrating the existence of such an      interest is squarely on the government. As the Supreme Court      explained in First National Bank v. Bellotti, ``where, as      here, as a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the      speech is intimately related to the process of governing, the      State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest      which is compelling and the burden is on the Government to      show the existence of such an interest. Even then, the State      must employ means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary      abridgement. . . .'' \245\       The MCFL Court pointed out the danger which looms whenever      speech is sought to be regulated, i.e., the incremental loss      of freedom which may begin when we first allow speech to be      restricted in pursuit of other governmental goals. ``Our      pursuit of other governmental ends, however, may tempt us to      accept in small increments a loss that would be unthinkable      if inflicted all at once.'' Thus, courts should, wherever      possible, avoid the slippery slope of speech regulation      altogether--for although a particular restriction on speech      may appear to be ``modest,'' no restriction of speech is ever      ``minor.''       The import of the above discussion is that the specific      legal rules which the Supreme Court has developed (such as      the MCFL exemption) have not been fashioned in a vacuum.      Rather, they have a discernible origin in the public policies      which inform the First Amendment. Those policies, in turn,      are determinative of the rationales upon which the specific      holdings are based.       However, in fashioning its ``MCFL exemption'' regulations,      the FEC read MCFL as if those policies and rationales did not      give meaning to its holdings. The FEC, therefore, justified      its regulation almost completely by reference to the eight      sentences toward the end of the MCFL opinion which contain      a summary of the Court's specific holding,\247\ while      largely ignoring the lengthy discussion of the rationale      for the holding which comprises the previous eight pages.      However, it is rudimentary that ``black letter law''      cannot be understood without reference to the judicial      reasoning which undergirds it.       In sum, the FEC sought a ``modest diminution'' in speech      based on ``government ends'' other than the protection of      free speech. However, the FEC has been unable to meet its      heavy burden of demonstrating that its asserted interests are      compelling and that its speech restriction is narrowly      tailored.    2. The Scope of Each of the MCFL Features Was Determined by the                      Rationales Which Underlaid It       The Court in MCFL identified ``three features essential''      to its holding that MCFL could not be prohibited from      independent political spending: ``First, it was formed for      the express purpose of promoting political ideas, and cannot      engage in business activities. Second, it has no shareholders      or other persons affiliated so as to have a claim on its      assets or earnings. Third, MCFL was not established by a      business corporation or labor union, and it is its policy not      to accept contributions from such entities.'' \248\       As will be seen, the FEC took these ``essential features''      literally and provided in its regulations that, if a      corporation did not have these identical features, it was      denied the ``MCFL exemption.'' As will be demonstrated,      however, each of these features was explicitly tied to a      rationale which both explained the feature and defined its      scope. a. The first MCFL feature assured that political resources reflected                            political support       The first feature which mandated an exemption from      Sec. 441(b) was that the corporation in question was ``formed      for the express purpose of promoting political ideas, and      cannot engage in business activities.'' \249\ As the Supreme      Court stated, this feature ``ensures that political resources      reflect political support.'' \250\ The underlying reason for      this concern was ``to protect the integrity of the      marketplace of political ideas'' from ``the corrosive      influence of concentrated corporate wealth.'' \251\       In fashioning this feature, the Court was concerned that      ``[d]irect corporate spending on political activity raises      the prospect that resources amassed in the economic      marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the      political marketplace.'' \252\ As the Court later clarified      in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the danger was not      simply the infusion of money into the political marketplace,      but infusion of funds amassed in the economic marketplace      which were unrelated to support for the corporation's      political ideas.\253\       However, as the FEC's broad prohibition of ``business      activities'' \254\ demonstrated, the FEC misconstrued this      rationale as prohibiting any business income by the      corporation. The FEC regulation reached ``any provision of      goods or services which results in income to the      corporation'' and which is not ``expressly described'' as      donations for political purposes, as well as any      ``advertising or promotional activity which results in income      to the corporation.'' \255\ The Supreme Court, however, was      concerned solely with the impact on the political marketplace      caused by the use of funds which are unrelated to the      corporation's political ideas.\256\       The MCFL Court recognized that Sec. 441b took account of      this distinction by allowing corporations to make political      expenditures through a separate segregated fund or PAC.      Expenditures by a PAC are permitted precisely because they      come from voluntary contributions and, therefore, reflect      political support: ``the money collected is that intended by      those who contribute to be used for political purposes and      not money diverted from another source.'' \257\ The FEC      failed to recognize that, just as PACs do not pose the      problem sought to be addressed by Sec. 441b, i.e., ``that      substantial general purpose treasuries should not be diverted      to political purposes,'' \258\ neither do ideological      corporations such as MCFL.       As the MCFL Court explained, ``the power of a corporation      may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.'' \259\      Unlike business corporations, however, the resources of which      ``are not an indication of popular support,'' the resources      available to corporations such as MCFL exist precisely      because of their political support, i.e., the fact that the      ideas that they propound are considered to be important to      those who, for example, patronize its bake sales.       The Supreme Court could not have been clearer about its      rationale in this regard: ``[r]egulation of corporate      political activity thus has reflected concern not about the      use of the corporate form per se, but about the unfair      deployment of wealth for political purposes. Groups such as      MCFL do not pose that danger of corruption.'' \260\       In its ``Explanation and Justification'' for the challenged      regulation, the FEC demonstrated its complete      misunderstanding of the above-quoted language: ``[i]n order      to pose no such threat, a corporation must be free from      resources obtained in the economic marketplace. Only those      corporations that cannot engage in business activities are      free from these kinds of resources.'' \261\ However, as      demonstrated, the Court's rationale in this regard did not      constitute a condemnation of the political use of ``resources      obtained in the economic marketplace''; rather, it was only      concerned with the diversion of funds acquired in the      economic marketplace to the political marketplace where those      funds were acquired in a manner which was unrelated to the      political purposes of the corporation.       Groups such as MCFL, however, do not pose a threat of the      danger that funds unrelated to the corporation's political      goals will be funneled into the political marketplace of      ideas. This is so because ``[t]he resources it has available      are not a function of its success in the economic      marketplace, but its popularity in the political      marketplace.''\262\ Contributors give money to such groups      precisely because they wish to further the groups' political      goals, i.e., ``because they regard such a contribution as a      more effective means of advocacy than spending the money      under their own personal direction.''\263\ Likewise, a person      who engages in ``business activities'' with such an      organization does so with the same underlying motivation. He      does not spend money at a bake sale or a flower sale      primarily to get cookies or carnations. Rather, he does so to      benefit the organization and to further its political goals,      which he realizes are better served by concerted action than      by his individual efforts. Thus, the money which changes      hands is directly related to the political purposes of the     organization and does not come within the permissible      rationale for restricting all corporate expenditures.       The FEC, however, ignored the distinction between business      activities which are unrelated to political ideas and those      which are related to political ideas in their regulations.      Through its denial of the exemption to any corporation which      engages in any ``business activities'' (so broadly defined as      to include such insensibly politically-motivated transactions      as purchases made at bake sales and sales of an ad in a      newsletter), the FEC had extended its regulation to ``speech      that does not pose the danger that has prompted      regulation.''\264\   b. The Second MCFL Feature Assured That Members Would Not Have a     Disincentive to Disassociate With a Corporation With Which They                                 Disagree       The second MCFL feature was that a corporation ``has no      shareholders or others associated so as to have a claim on      its assets or earnings.''\265\ Like the other MCFL features,      this one cannot be understood apart from the rationale for      its formulation. The Supreme Court explained that the absence      of such persons ``ensures that persons connected with the      organization will have no disincentive for disassociating      with it if they disagree with its political activity.''\266\      In developing this feature, the Supreme Court was concerned      with situations which may arise with respect to the ordinary      business corporation or labor union. It is conceivable that      people who are associated with such entities would not want      their dues or investment funds used for political purposes.      As the Court explained: ``such persons . . . contribute      investment funds or union dues for economic gain, and do not      necessarily authorize the use of their money for political      ends. Furthermore, because such individuals depend on the      organization for income or for a job it is not enough to tell      them that any unhappiness with the use of their money can be      redressed simply by leaving the corporation or the      union.''\267\       Based on this reasoning, the MCFL Court concluded that,      although it was reasonable for Congress to require the      establishment of separate segregated funds to which such      persons could make voluntary contributions, ``[t]his      rationale for regulations is not compelling with respect to      independent expenditures by [MCFL].''\268\ This is because,      as explained above, MCFL had no stockholders or members who      could share in the corporation's assets or earnings.       In fashioning its new regulation, however, the FEC again      failed to take account of the underlying rationale and how it      affects the scope of the feature. In denying the exemption to      corporations who offer any benefit, no matter how de minimis      to its members,\269\ the FEC failed to recognize that the      primary purpose of the feature was to protect those who      ``depend on the organization for income or for a job,'' that      is, those who may have a ``claim on its assets or      earnings.''\270\ Thus, as with the first MCFL feature, the      scope of this feature can only be understood by reference to      the rationale for its creation.c. The Third MCFL Feature Assured That Exempt Corporations Did Not Act    as Conduits for the Type of Spending That Created a Threat to the                          Political Marketplace       The third MCFL feature concerned the fact that ``NCFL was      not established by a business corporation or labor union, and      it was its policy not to accept contributions from such      entities.''\271\ In Austin, the Court described this feature      as ensuring ``the organization's independence from the      influence of business corporations.''\272\ The rationale for      this feature is that such independence ``prevents such      corporations from serving as conduits for the type of direct      spending that creates a threat to the political      marketplace.''\273\       In its regulation, however, the FEC not only required that      corporations be in fact independent of the influence of      business corporations, but also that they either have a      policy against accepting any donations from business      corporations or do not accept, either directly or indirectly,      donations from business corporation. As the Second Circuit      recognized in FEC v. Survival Education Fund (SEC),\274\      however, the rationale of this feature does not depend on      whether a corporation has a policy against accepting      corporate donations, but upon whether it is, in fact,      independent of the influence of corporate donations. That      Court explained:       ``To be sure, an express policy against accepting corporate      or union contributions is clear proof that no such danger      exists, as the Court in MCFL duly found. But a nonprofit      political advocacy corporation, which in fact receives no      significant funding from unions or business corporations,      does not surrender its First Amendment freedoms for want of      such a policy.       ``Under MCFL, a nonprofit political advocacy corporation      having no shareholders or members with financial      disincentives to disassociate from the corporation if they      disagree with its views is exempt from Sec. 441b as long as      it is independent in fact from significant business or labor      influence. The existence of a policy against accepting      contributions from business corporations or unions is      relevant to, but not dispositive of, the issue of      independence.''\275\       In addition, it is not necessary that the corporation      receives no business contributions. As the court in Day v.      Holahan found, ``the key issue here is the amount of for-     profit corporate funding a nonprofit receives, rather than      the establishment of a policy not to accept significant      amounts.''\276\       Thus, the Eight Circuit in Day recognized, like the Second      Circuit in SEF, that ``the factual findings of MCFL [did not]      translate into absolutes in legal application.''\277\ The      scope of each of these features can be understood only by      understanding the particular evil that the Supreme Court in      MCFL sought to avoid. For that reason, governmental      regulation is permissible only to the extent ``necessary to      meet the particular problem at hand,''\278\ However, the FEC      overstepped the zone of permissible regulation and has sought      to regulate speech which is protected by a proper      understanding of the purposes and rationales which account      for the MCFL exemption.3. Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life v. FEC Held the FEC's New MCFL                           Regulations Unlawful       A challenge, under the Administrative Procedures Act, to      the new FEC regulations of MCFL-type organizations was      brought in the Eighth Circuit case of Minnesota Citizens      Concerned for Life v. FEC.\279\ The district court declared      the new regulations void as beyond the statutory authority of      the FEC as construed by the federal courts.       The court based its rejection of the regulations on the      ``functional interpretation'' of Day rather than the ``formal      interpretation'' of the FEC.\280\ In examining the      regulations, the District Court specifically found that the      ``prohibition against any `business activities' '' and the      ``prohibition against the receipt of corporate donations      [are], unquestionably, too restrictive.'' \281\       In addition, the district court also implied that the third      and fourth provisions were of questionable validity under the      approach taken by the Eight Circuit in Day. As the district      court states, ``Day rejected a `bright-line' approach to      implementing the MCFL exemption, and instead looked to the      particular characteristics of the nonprofit as they relate to      the purpose of Sec. 441(b) and the members' First Amendment      rights. Thus, Day casts serious doubt on Sec. 114.10(c)(1)'s      requirement that a qualified nonprofit's `only' express      purpose be the expression of political ideas and      Sec. 114.10(c)(3)(ii)['s] requirement that a qualified      nonprofit not have members which receive `any' benefit which      is disincentive to associate themselves from the      corporation.'' \282\       The FEC appealed the decision to the Eighth Circuit, which      decided Day, apparently on the hope that the circuit would      change its mind about its understanding of the MCFL      exemption.\283\ On May 7, 1977, the Eighth Circuit affirmed      the decision of the district court.\284\                               B. MEMBERS       Another protection for speech about political matters by      organizations is the First Amendment guarantee that      organizations may communicate with their members unencumbered      by governmental regulation. This protection was recognized in      1948 by the Supreme Court in United States v. Congress of      Industrial Organizations (CIO).\285\ As noted earlier in this      article, this case involved a prohibition on ``any      expenditure in connection with a federal election'' by a      corporation or labor organization.\286\ Charges were brought      against the CIO for publishing in its membership newsletter a      statement urging members to vote for a particular federal      candidate.\287\ The Court cited several authorities about the      sacrosanct nature of free expression and dismissed the      indictment, stating that: ``If Sec. 313 were construed to      prohibit the publication, by corporations and unions in the      regular course of conducting their affairs, of periodicals      advising their members, stockholders or customers of danger      or advantage to their interests from the adoption of      measures, or the election to office of men espousing such      measures, the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to      its constitutionality.'' \288\       In 1982, the Supreme Court revisited the subject in FEC v.      National Right to Work Committee (NRWC).\289\ This case      involved solicitation by NRWC to ``some 267,000 persons for      contributions to a separate segregated fund [a PAC] that it      sponsored.'' \290\ NRWC was a nonstock corporation.\291\ The      issue was whether NRWC had limited its solicitations to      ``members'' within the meaning of 2 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 441b(b)(4)(A) and (C), which provide that a      nonstock corporation may solicit contributions to its PAC      only from ``members'' of the corporation.\292\ The organic      documents of NRWC stated that it would have no members.\293\      Although NRWC had mailed millions of letters promoting its      opposition to compulsory unionism and soliciting donations,      none mentioned membership.\294\ When NRWC created its PAC      (because corporations could not contribute to candidates      under 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441(b)), it solicited persons who had      made donations to NRWC. Upon examining the brief legislative      history of Sec. 441(b), the Supreme Court decided that the      congressional intent was ``that some relatively enduring and      independently significant financial or organizational      attachment is required to be a `member' under      Sec. 441b(b)(4)(C).'' \295\ As a consequence, the Court      held that NRWC did not have members ``under any reasonable      interpretation of the statute.'' \296\ The Court      reiterated the high constitutional protection accorded      associational rights,\297\ holding that, in this case,      ``the associational rights asserted by respondents may be      and are overborne by the interests Congress has sought to      protect in enacting Sec. 441(b).'' \298\       Not content with the statutory definition of ``member,''      with the new gloss of NRWC,     the FEC set about to define ``member'' in new regulations. As      usual, the FEC pursued a speech and association suppressing      approach, attempting to define ``member'' as narrowly as      possible in order to limit as much as possible the class of      persons to whom the corporation may communicate its political      messages and from whom it may solicit PAC funds.       An older definition of ``member'' had been promulgated by      the FEC in 1976. The regulation defined the term as: ``all      persons who are currently satisfying the requirements for      membership in a membership organization, trade association,      cooperative, or corporation without capital stock. . . . A      person is not considered a member under this definition if      the only requirement for membership is a contribution to a      separate segregated fund.'' \299\       The new definition of ``member,'' promulgated in 1993,      defined the term much more restrictively:       ``Members means all persons who are currently satisfying      the requirements for membership in a membership association,      affirmatively accept the membership association's invitation      to become a member, and either:       ``(i) Have some significant financial attachment to the      membership association, such as a significant investment or      ownership stake (but not merely the payment of dues);       ``(ii) Are required to pay on a regular basis a specific      amount of dues . . . and are entitled to vote directly either      for at least one member who has fully participatory and      voting rights on the highest governing body of the membership      association, or for those who select at least one member . .      .; or       ``(iii) Are entitled to vote directly for all those on the      highest governing body of the membership association.'' \300\       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Medical      Association were both affected by the new regulation and      ``ceased making their traditional political solicitations''      to persons they had considered their members.\301\ They filed      suit seeking a declaration that the FEC had violated their      First Amendment rights by ignoring the disjunctive ``or'' in      the Supreme Court's statement quoted above,\302\ treating it      rather as a conjunctive ``and.'' \303\       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit found fatal flaws in the new FEC      regulations. The court faulted the notion that dues to a      nonstock corporation were less of a financial attachment to      the organization than was ownership of a single share of      stock in a public corporation.\304\ The court also faulted      the requirement that a ``member'' who paid dues must vote      directly for a member of the highest governing body, noting      that this excluded without justification many hierarchical      organizations.\305\ As a result, the court declared the      regulations void under the Administrative Procedures Act.       Based on the case law, therefore, to be a ``member'' of a      nonstock organization to receive a corporation's or labor      union's political communications and to be solicited for PAC      purposes, one must have some financial connection with the      organization (usually done with dues payments) and have a      right to vote at least at a local level for persons who will      chose the voting representative of a local organization to      the larger governing body of the organization (typically done      by allowing local members to vote for the local delegate to      the state-wide governing body of the organization.\306\                        C. ANONYMOUS LITERATURE       In McIntyre v. Ohio Election Commission,\307\ the United      States Supreme Court declared that a broadly worded      requirement that there be a mandated disclaimer identifying      the author or any writing intended to ``influence'' an      election is unconstitutional. Indeed, the Supreme      Court upheld the right of an individual or organization to      publish anonymously concerning the advocacy of political      causes.       In McIntyre, the Court considered an Ohio election      practices statute in the context of an enforcement action      against a woman, Margaret McIntyre, who distributed flyers      generated on a home computer and printed at her own expense      relating to a referendum on a proposed school tax levy.\308\      Some of her handbills identified her as the author, while      others contained the identifier ``CONCERNED PARENTS AND TAX      PAYERS.'' \309\ Margaret was fined $100 by the Ohio Election      Commission for failure to use the required disclaimer.\310\      On appeal of the case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the      Ohio statute imposing a state-mandated disclaimer on      literature intended to ``influence the voters in any      election.'' \311\       Noting that the statute was a content-based ``limitation on      political expression'' at ``the core of the protection      afforded by the First Amendment,'' the Court applied      ``exacting scrutiny.'' \312\ The Court noted that in addition      to ``exacting scrutiny'' such a restriction on ``core      political speech'' must be ``narrowly tailored to serve an      overriding state interest.'' \313\       Ohio asserted two interests to justify its disclaimer: (1)      an ``interest in preventing fraudulent and libelous      statements'' and (2) an ``interest in providing the      electorate with relevant information.'' \314\ The High Court      noted that free expression includes the right to release what      information one desires and that the name of a private      citizen would be meaningless to most readers anyway with      regard to the reader's ability to evaluate the message.\315\      The Court dismissed the interest in informing the public as      ``plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of      its disclosure requirements.'' \316\       The Court gave more weight to Ohio's interest in preventing      fraud and libel, noting that this interest ``carries special      weight during election campaigns when false statements, if      credited, may have serious adverse consequences for the      public at large.'' \317\ The Court, noted, however, that Ohio      had a statute setting forth penalties for false statements      during political campaigns, so that the disclaimer provision      was ``not its principal weapon against fraud.'' \318\ The      Court noted that the disclaimer provision served as an ``aid      to enforcement'' and a ``deterrent to the making of false      statements by unscrupulous prevaricators,'' but these      ``legitimate'' benefits did not justify the ``extremely      broad'' disclaimer mandate.\319\       This is so the Court said, inter alia, because the broad      prohibition ``encompasses documents that are not even      arguably false or misleading. It applies not only to the      activities of candidates and their organized supporters, but      also to individuals acting independently and using only their      own modest resources. . . .'' \320\       The Court distinguished its upholding in Buckley of a      requirement that expenditures in excess of a certain amount      be reported to the FEC, declaring that the Ohio disclaimer      requirements is ``more intrusive than the Buckley disclosure      requirement'' and ``rests on different and less powerful      state interests.'' The Court noted that the FECA ``regulates      only candidate elections, not referenda or other issue-based      ballot measures; and we construed `independent expenditures'      to mean only those expenditures that `expressly advocate the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.' ''      \321\       Reporting requirements, like disclaimers, are a type of      disclosure mechanism.\322\ Buckley approved reporting      requirements for express advocacy; it did not approve      disclaimers on this type of speech. Indeed, McIntyre      recognized that Buckley did not even address the issues of      disclaimers or anonymous speech: ``Ohio vigorously argues      that our opinions in First National Bank of Boston v.      Bellotti, . . . and Buckley v. Valeo, . . . amply support the      constitutionality of its disclosure requirements [i.e.,      disclaimer]. Neither case is controlling: . . . [Buckley]      concerned mandatory disclosure of campaign-related      expenditures [i.e., reporting requirements]. Neither case      involved a prohibition of anonymous campaign literature.      ''\323\       McIntyre went on to recognize that Buckley upheld reporting      requirements for express advocacy, and unlike disclaimers,      such requirements advance the interest in obtaining      information without unduly impinging upon protected speech:      ``True, in another portion of [Buckley] we [approved] a      requirement that even independent expenditures in excess of a      certain threshold level be reported. * * * But that      requirement entailed nothing more than an identification * *      * of the amount and use of money expended in support of a      candidate [through a report]. Though such mandatory reporting      undeniably impedes protected First Amendment activity, the      intrusion is a far cry from compelled self-identification      [i.e., disclaimers] on all election-related writings.'' \324\       The Court concluded that ``the Ohio statute's infringement      on speech [disclaimers,] [is] more intrusive than the Buckley      disclosure requirement [reporting].'' \325\ Both means      provide the State with information; however, reporting      requirements are more narrowly tailored to do so.\326\                   d. contribution & expenditure caps       Another protection afforded political speech by the First      Amendment and recognized by the United States Supreme Court      is the limitation on the extent to which government may place      caps on contributions and expenditures. While the Court      permits some caps on contributions, there are limits as to      how low the caps may go. No caps are permitted on independent      expenditures.       Buckley's point of departure is the principle that any      restriction of the amount of money that can be spent in      campaigns is suspect. The Supreme Court stated that [a]      restriction on the amount of money a person or group can      spend on political communication during a campaign      necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting      the number of issues discussed, the depth of their      exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\327\       Thus, a regulation which seeks to regulate political      spending is subject to a presumption of invalidity. In      Buckley, the Supreme Court did, however, enunciate a      constitutional distinction between ``expenditures'' and      ``contributions.'' The Court stated that: ``although the      Act's contribution and expenditure limitations both implicate      fundamental First Amendment interests, its expenditures      ceilings impose significantly more severe restrictions on      protected freedoms of political expression than do its      limitations on financial contributions.'' \328\       Expenditures could not be regulated unless they constituted      ``express advocacy'' of the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate (and if they were ``independent      expenditures'' they could not be limited even if they did      constitute express advocacy).\329\ On the other hand,      contributions were, under the reasoning of Buckley, more      susceptible of regulation.       The Court's reasons for making a distinction of      constitutional dimension in this regard were essentially      twofold. First, the Court found that contribution limitations     did not place significant burdens on protected speech and      associational freedoms. Second, the Court found that      contributions could be limited because, unlike expenditures,      they posed the danger of quid pro quo corruption (and the      appearance thereof) to the political system. Unless both of      these rationales are satisfied, contributions cannot be      limited. I. Contributions Can Only be Limited Because They Threaten Corruption                         to the Political System       As noted above, the Buckley Court began its analysis with      the proposition that limits on spending in connection with      campaigns are presumptively invalid. It did, however, permit      the government to limit contributions to candidates or      campaigns. One of the two fundamental rationales for allowing      such restrictions was that, unlike expenditures,      contributions pose a threat of corruption to the political      system. The Court stated that ``[t]o the extent that large      contributions are given to secure a political quid pro quo      from current and potential office holders, the integrity of      our system of representative democracy is undermined.'' \330\       In addition, the Court was concerned with ``appearance of      corruption stemming from public awareness of the      opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large      individual financial contributions.'' \331\ Therefore, the      Court permitted governmental limitations on contributions      \332\ because of the governmental interest ``in the      prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption      spawned by the real or imagined influence of large      financial contributions on candidates' positions and on      their actions if elected to office.'' \333\       The Supreme Court in Buckley then proceeded to approve an      aggregate contribution cap of $1,000 for each election by any      person to any candidate for federal office.\334\ The Court      found that the interest in limiting ``the actuality and      appearance of corruption resulting from large individual      financial contributions'' justified ``the limited effect upon      First Amendment freedoms caused by the $1000 contribution      ceiling.'' \335\ More precisely, the Court found that in 1976      a $1,000 limit on contributions was sufficiently high to be      narrowly tailored to limit corruption, while allowing      individuals and organizations to assist to a ``substantial      extent in supporting candidates and committees with financial      resources.'' \336\       However, contribution caps are not one of those things      where, if a little is good, more is better. Efforts to set      lower limits have been routinely struck down. In several      post-Buckley decisions, courts have upheld contribution      limits above $1,000,\337\ but have struck down those below      it. In Carver v. Nixon,\338\ the Eighth Circuit struck down a      $300 limit on direct contributions in state elections on the      ground that it was not narrowly tailored to advance the      state's interest in combating corruption.\339\ It noted that      Buckley upheld a $1,000 limit twenty years ago because such a      limitation focused precisely on the problem with large      campaign contributions without unduly impinging on protected      speech, i.e., it was narrowly tailored to achieve its      goal.\340\ Similarly, in Day v. Holahan,\341\ the Eighth      Circuit struck down a $100 limit on contributions to and from      political committees.\342\ 2. Expenditures, However, Cannot be Limited Because Doing So Imposes   Restrictions on the Freedoms of Speech and Association That are Not                    Justified by a Compelling Interest       As the Buckley Court explained, independent expenditures      are entitled to full constitutional protection: ``Advocacy of      the election or defeat of candidates for federal office is no      less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than      discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of the      passage or defeat of legislation.'' \343\       In contrast to contributions, however, ``expenditures''      which are not coordinated with a candidate or campaign do not      pose a danger of corruption or its appearance. Thus, there is      no compelling interest in their limitation. This is so      because a candidate does not necessarily benefit from (and      may well even be harmed by) an expenditure which is made      independently of his campaign. As the Supreme Court      recognized, ``[u]nlike contributions, such independent      expenditures may well provide little assistance to the      candidate's campaign and indeed may prove counterproductive.      The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an      expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only      undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but      also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as      a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.''      \344\       Thus, because as a practical matter the candidate may well      not benefit from an expenditure made without coordination,      the danger of quid pro quos is obviated. This results not      only in alleviating the danger of corruption, but the      appearance of corruption as well.       In addition, in contrast to limits on contributions that      ``entail[s] only a marginal restriction on the contributor's      ability to engage in free communication,'' \345\ the Court      reasoned that, ``because virtually every means of      communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the      expenditure of money,'' the ``expenditure limitations      contained in the Act represent substantial rather than merely      theoretical restraints on the quantity and diversity of      political speech.'' \346\ Whereas a contribution to a      candidate merely ``serves as a general expression of      support for the candidate and his views, but does not      communicate the underlying basis for the support,'' \347\      ``a restriction on the amount of money a person or group      can spend on political communication during a campaign      necessarily reduces the quality of expression by      restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of      their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.''      \348\       As a result, the Court has struck down limits on      independent expenditures by individuals \349\ and political      committees.\350\                        e. political committees       As noted by the Court in Buckley,\351\ ``the First      Amendment protects political association as well as political      expression.'' As a result, citizens have the ``freedom to      associate with others for the common advancement of political      beliefs and ideas.'' \352\ ``Governmental action which may      have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is      subject to the closest scrutiny.'' \353\       Political action committees (PACs) are associations      organized to enhance the political expression of citizens by      joining individual contributions with those of others so that      they may more effectively participate in political      speech.\354\ As a result, the Supreme Court has ``reject(ed)      the notion that the PACs form of organization or method of      solicitation diminishes their entitlement to First Amendment      protection,'' \355\ and expressly held that they are      protected by the First Amendment freedom of association.\356\      Furthermore, any disparate treatment of a political      committee, such as lower contribution limits for PACs as      opposed to individuals, would violate the PACs freedom of      association.\357\                           f. burden of proof       A final protection for free political speech and      association is the burden of proof placed on legislatures      which enact a ``law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.''      \358\ Because free expression and association are such      cherished American rights, they are protected as fundamental      rights against infringement. To be valid, a law burdening or      chilling these rights must serve a compelling interest and be      narrowly tailored to effect only that interest.\359\       Once a plaintiff has demonstrated that a statute infringes      the exercise of his or her First Amendment rights, the burden      is on the state to justify this infringement. As the United      States Supreme Court declared in 1978: ``The      constitutionality of Sec. 8's prohibition of the `exposition      of ideas' [a ban on corporate contributions or expenditures      to influence the outcome of a referendum] by corporations      turns on whether it can survive the exacting scrutiny      necessitated by a state-imposed restriction of freedom of      speech. Especially where, as here, a prohibition is directed      at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the      process of governing, `the State may prevail only upon      showing a subordinating interest which is compelling' `and      the burden is on the Government to show the existence of such      an interest.' Even then, the State must employ means `closely      drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment. . . .' '' \360\       The state's effort to carry its burden must be done under      ``the closest scrutiny.'' \361\ As the U.S. Supreme Court has      stated: ``When the government defends a regulation on speech      . . . it must do more than simply ``posit the existence of      the disease sought to be cured.'' . . . It must demonstrate      that the recited harms are real, . . . and that the      regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and      material way.'' \362\       In Carver v. Nixon,\363\ a case involving campaign      contribution caps, the Eighth Circuit declared that the      government must produce ``evidence to demonstrate that the      limits were narrowly tailored to combat corruption or the      appearance of corruption. . . .'' \364\ ``The record is      barren of any evidence of a harm or disease that needed to      be addressed,'' the court proclaimed.\365\       In Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Maupin,\366\ the U.S.      District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri observed      that ``[d]efendants wholly failed to adduce any evidence of      actual corruption taking place. . . . The harm that the      defendants seek to eradicate must exist and its cure must      specifically be directed toward the elimination of that harm.      . . . . The defendants fail to point to one incident wherein      a[n] . . . official . . . has cast a vote or agreed to      influence a vote, during the general assembly's regular      session, in exchange for a contribution. As for the      appearance of corruption, the defendants' two witnesses      testified in general terms of their belief that the public      perceives the acceptance of contributions during the      legislative session as ``inappropriate''. No factual basis      was given for these witnesses' perception that the electorate      believes that contributions accepted during the general      assembly's regular session reflect corruptive deal-making.''      \367\       In sum, when the government makes a law abridging free      speech, it has an extremely heavy burden of proof that there      is a compelling interest, and this burden must be met with      the clearest of facts carefully established, not with mere      speculation about possible corruption. There are two obvious      reasons for this.       First is the premier protection given to free speech and      free association rights in our constitutional system. Because      of the supreme importance of free political speech and      association to the very democratic foundations of our      Republic, government should     make no law abridging these expressly protected activities on      the basis of unproven speculation about corruption.       Second is the fact that the legislation abridging political      speech is being enacted by incumbent politicians. Justice      Thomas in his concurrence in Colorado Republican put the      matter well when he referred to the notion of according      special deference to congressional judgments about campaign      finance as ``letting the fox stand watch over the henhouse.''      \368\ He added, ``What the argument for deference fails to      acknowledge is the potential for legislators to set the rules      of the electoral game so as to keep themselves in power and      to keep potential challengers out of it.'' \369\       This warning has been echoed by various commentators. For      example, Lillian BeVier points out the importance of three      scope-of-review issues in protecting constitutional rights in      the political speech area: (a) courts must ``insist on a      rigorous definition of `corruption' as well as an      intelligible description of both empirical counterparts of      this corruption and the purified political order it hopes to      attain'' \370\; (b) courts ``should adopt a `premise of      distrust' with respect to legislative means'' \371\; and (c)      courts should take note of the realities of campaign finance      reform--such as ``unintended consequences'' and ``at least      temporary reallocations of political advantage'' and sanction      ``only reforms that are practically guaranteed to achieve a      clearly specified and unquestionably legitimate corruption-     prevention goal.'' \372\ Similar warnings have come from John      Hart Ely \373\ and Ralph Winter,\374\ among others.       Thus, the burden is on the government to establish by clear      evidence the compelling interest in corruption or its      appearance which it proposes as supporting its decision to      make a law abridging free expression in the vital realm of      political speech.                      G. PRIOR RESTRAINT OF SPEECH       The United States Supreme Court has long held that ``the      loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of      time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.'' \375\      This is particularly true with political speech since      ``timing is of the essence . . . when an event occurs, it is      often necessary to have one's voice heard promptly, if it is      to be considered at all.'' \376\ Therefore, a prior      restraint, even for ``a day or two'' may be intolerable when      applied ``to political speech in which the element of      timeliness may be important.'' \377\       As set forth above, the First Amendment protects, as      political speech, both political contributions and political      expenditures, including both issue advocacy and independent      expenditures. Unfortunately, injunctions have been sought      and, on occasion, issued by lower state courts for alleged      ``violations'' of state election law.\378\ These injunctions      were sought to restrain the distribution of voter guides and      were overturned on appeal,\379\ but the damage to First      Amendment rights still occurred.           v. a proposal for speech-enhancing campaign reform       While most efforts at campaign finance reform have been      misguided and based on flawed assumptions, there is room for      speech-enhancing reform. Key to any reform to be attempted is      the need to protect and enhance constitutionally guaranteed      free expression. The case law is clear that such speech is      constitutionally protected, and, as set forth above, the      United States Supreme Court has shown no sign whatsoever that      it is prepared to back away from ensuring full First      Amendment protection to the political speech involved in      campaigns.       This section will summarize the flawed premises on which      most efforts at campaign finance reform are based, and set      out some proposals for speech-enhancing reform.                    A. FAULTY PREMISES TO BE AVOIDED       Recent campaign finance proposals \380\ in the U.S.      Congress have been based on certain premises that have been      thoroughly rejected by the United States Supreme Court in the      seminal election law case of Buckley,\381\ and its progeny.      As a result of these faulty premises, the proposals      themselves are fundamentally flawed and have diverted      attention from reform measures that would survive      constitutional scrutiny and that would correct current      perceived problems in the political system. These faulty      premises are as follows.1. (Faulty Premise #1) The First Amendment Is a Loophole in the Federal     Election Campaign Act (FECA) Which Should Be Narrowed or Closed       As set forth in detail above, the First Amendment protects      political freedoms that are vital to our representative      democracy. To limit these freedoms is to fundamentally      undermine the ability of our citizens to freely select their      representatives and to hold them accountable for their      governance. As has been shown, there is no indication      whatsoever that the courts are prepared to cooperate in any      endeavor to limit First Amendment freedoms in this area.\382\ 2. (Faulty Premise #2) The Political System Is Only about Elections,  Not about Political Ideas and the Accountability of Elected Officials               to the Public for Their Positions on Issues       The debate about campaign finance reform seems to focus      only on elections on the assumption that the political      process is only about elections. However, elections are only      a part of the political process. More importantly, elections      are simply a part of our system of democratic representative      government which fundamentally depends on ``the free      discussion of governmental affairs.'' \383\ Thus, issue      advocacy during an election, even though it may influence the      election, is also about the discussion of issues of public      concern and about holding public officials accountable for      their positions on these issues. Representative government      cannot survive without this ``free discussion of governmental      affairs.''3. (Faulty Premise #3) The Rising Cost of Political Campaigns Justifies               Severe Government Restrictions on Campaigns       Some promoters of campaign finance reform assert that the      rising cost of elections and the growing size of special      interest donations has corrupted the democratic process. On      that basis, they believe that severe limitations on campaigns      imposed by government are justified.       However, the United States Supreme Court has made it clear      that it is up to the people, not the government, to determine      what is spent on political campaigns. As the Court stated in      Buckley: ``In any event, the mere growth in the cost of      federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no      basis for government restrictions on the quantity of      campaign spending and the resulting limitation on the      scope of federal campaigns. The First Amendment denies      government the power to determine that spending to promote      one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise.      In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not      the government, but the people--individually as citizens      and candidates and collectively as associations and      political committees who must retain control over the      quantity and range of debate on public issues in a      political campaign.'' \184\   4. (Faculty Premise #4) The Only Way to Redress the Balance Is to       Stifle the Speech of Some Rather than to Enhance it for All       Some promoters of campaign finance reform believe that the      system needs to change because it has eroded the power of      individual voices and amplified the voices of special      interests. In pursuit of equalizing speech, they take the      approach of limiting, penalizing, and prohibiting speech of      some in order to enhance it for others.       However, the United States Supreme Court has expressly      rejected this proposition in Buckley: ``the concept that      government may restrict the speech of some elements of our      society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is      wholly foreign to the First Amendment.'' \385\ Thus, this      approach is fundamentally flawed.       But even more tragically, the ``solution'' of stifling      speech diverts attention away from positive, constitutional      measures which would redress the imbalance in the current      system by enhancing the speech of citizens and issue advocacy      groups. These speech enhancing measures would restore a      proper balance between the voices of ``special interests''      and the voices of individual citizens.       Some campaign finance reform advocates believe that the      only way that meaningful reform will be enacted is for      members to put aside partisan differences and work together      to make it happen. While this may be one necessary      precondition to reform, it is not the fundamental one. For      meaningful reform to occur, Congress must abandon the notion      that it is empowered to limit free speech in order to redress      any imbalance in speech and instead find ways to level the      playing field by enhancing the speech of citizens and issue      advocacy groups.          B. POSITIVE PROPOSALS FOR REFORM BY ENHANCING SPEECH       In contrast to the serious constitutional obstacles to      efforts to curtail speech, Congress is free to adopt measures      that will enhance and encourage speech. As the Buckley Court      explained, in upholding the provision of the FECA providing      public funds for elections: ``Although `Congress shall make      no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the      press.' [public funding of elections] is a congressional      effort, not to abridge, restrict, or censor speech, but      rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public      discussion and participation in the electoral process, goals      vital to a self-governing people. Thus, [the provision]      furthers, not abridges, pertinent First Amendment values.''      \386\       But public funding of campaigns is only one way for      Congress to ``facilitate and enlarge public discussion and      participation in the electoral process.'' The best antidote      to the ``undue influence of special interests'' is to      encourage citizens to take a more active part, as individuals      and in association with others, in the political process.       In addition, Congress should act to reign in the FEC's      effort to expand its power and regulate issue advocacy. The      incorporation of the Court's speech protective holdings in      appropriate provisions of the FECA and the adoption of      certain administrative reforms of the FEC itself are      necessary to accomplish this task. The following measures are      designed to do just that.\387\     1. Section 441b of the FECA Should Be Amended to Reflect the  Protections of Issue Advocacy and of the Political Speech of Not-for-                          Profit Corporations       Section 441(b) of the FECA makes it unlawful for any      corporation ``to make a contribution or expenditure in      connection with any [federal] election.'' However, as set      forth     above, the United States Supreme Court in MCFL,\388\ imposed      two significant limitations on this prohibition.       First, the Court interpreted Sec. 441b to be limited to      expenditures for ``express advocacy.'' Second, the Court held      that the prohibition on corporate expenditures was not      applicable to certain not-for-profit corporations. These      limitations should be incorporated by Congress in Sec. 441(b)      by amending it.       After Buckley, Congress amended the FECA to incorporate      changes in the statute required by the Court. For instance,      Congress amended Sec. 434(c) to reflect that disclosure of      expenditures by organizations that were not political      committees were limited to ``independent expenditures'' and      adopted a definition of ``independent expenditure'' in      Sec. 431(17).       Similarly Congress should amend Sec. 441(b) to incorporate      the holdings of MCFL by providing that it is unlawful for any      corporation ``to make a contribution or to make an      expenditure which expressly advocates the election or defeat      of a clearly identified candidate.''       In addition, Sec. 441(b) should be amended to add a new      subsection which provides that the prohibition on a      corporation making an expenditure which expressly advocates      the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate does      not apply to a not-for-profit membership corporation which      (1) does not engage in substantial business activities, other      than traditional fundraising activities of not-for-profit      organizations, that are unrelated to the charitable,      educational or political activities of the organization, (2)      has no shareholders or other persons affiliated so as to have      a claim on its assets or earnings, and (3) was not      established by a business corporation or a labor union and      does not receive a substantial portion of its contributions      from such entities.       These changes would conform with the Court's decision in      MCFL, and would signal the willingness of Congress to abide      by this important issue advocacy protecting decision.      Furthermore, incorporating these changes in the statute will      make it readily apparent to all that this provision is narrow      on its face; where now one has to read the United States      Reports to know about this significant limitation.2. The Definition of Contribution Should Be Amended to Clarify that It                     Does Not Apply to Issue Advocacy       The Federal Election Commission's effort to regulate and      restrict issue advocacy by claiming that it is a contribution      to a candidate and subject to the contribution limits if the      expenditure for the issue advocacy was coordinated with a      candidate should also be addressed. There is no justification      for issue advocacy losing its protected status just because      it has been communicated to a candidate.       This misguided attempt to circumvent the protection of      issue advocacy in Buckley can be prevented by adding to those      items listed in Sec. 431(8)(B) as not being included in the      definition of ``contribution'' ``any expenditure for a      communication which does not expressly advocate the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.'' 3. The Definition of Political Committee Should Be Amended to Reflect                      the Court's Major Purpose Test       The Court in Buckley held that an organization cannot be      considered a ``political committee'' unless the organization      is ``under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of      the organization is the nomination or election of a      candidate.'' \389\ Unfortunately, when Congress amended the      FECA after Buckley, this limitation was not included.       The effect of Congress's failure to modify the definition      of ``political committee'' \390\ to meet Buckley's      requirements has been to encourage the FEC to run amuck      trying to impose on issue advocacy groups the requirements      for PACs in the FECA.\391\ This has had the effect of      chilling the legitimate issue-oriented activities of such      groups and has imposed substantial costs on them in their      efforts to resist such unconstitutional impositions. Congress      should make this change now by amending Sec. 431(4)(a) by      adding at the end ``and which is under the control of a      candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or      election of a candidate.'' 4. Congress Should Allow Certain Not-for-Profit Corporations to Make                   Contributions to Federal Candidates       Since the Supreme Court held in MCFL that certain not-for-     profit corporations do not pose any threat to corrupt the      electoral process, because contributions to them are      generated by their advocacy of political ideas, and they are      thus free to make independent expenditures, there is no      justification to prohibiting them from also making      contributions to federal candidates.\392\       This change would expand the pool of possible contributors      to candidates and, since these nonprofit organizations often      promote important political ideas, rather than narrow      economic interests, their addition to the pool of possible      contributors would help offset these ``special interests.''       This change could be made by modifying the new subsection      proposed for Sec. 441(b) in Section 1, supra, by providing      that the prohibition on a corporation making a contribution      or an expenditure which expressly advocates the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate does not apply to      the not-for-profit membership corporations described therein.5. Certain Not-for-Profit Corporations Should Be Allowed to ``Bundle''                  Individual Contributions to Candidates       Bundling of individual contributions to candidates is      currently limited to PACs. Even if certain not-for-profit      corporations are not allowed to contribute to candidates,      Congress should allow them to solicit from their members      individual contributions to candidates that are then      ``bundled'' and given to the candidate. This could be      accomplished by specifically allowing this activity in the      amendment to Sec. 441(b) proposed above.       Providing this new method of encouraging individual      contributions will enhance political giving by individual      citizens, diminishing the relative influence of PACs and      ``special interests.'' This ``bundling'' activity should be      reported by amending Sec. 434(c) to so provide.6. The Individual Contribution Limit Should be Increased to $2,500 and                     the Aggregate Limit to $100,000       The individual contribution limit of $1,000, found in      Sec. 441(a)(a)(1) (A), and the aggregate contribution limit      of $25,000, found in Sec. 441(a) (a)(3), has been in effect      since 1974. While a $1,000 contribution represented a large      contribution in 1974, it does not today.\393\ Furthermore,      allowing individuals to make larger contributions will      enhance the ability of individual citizens to influence the      political process while helping to offset the influence of      ``special interests'' and PACs. The individual contribution      limit should be raised to $2,500 and be indexed for      inflation.       Furthermore, to accommodate the increase in individual      contributions to candidates and to political parties,      suggested below, the aggregate individual contribution limit,      found in Sec. 441(a)(a)(3), should be increased to $100,000. 7. The Individual Contribution Limit to Political Parties Should Also                                Be Raised       Individual contributions to any national political party      are limited to $15,000 per year by Sec. 441(a)(a)(2)(B). This      limitation has diminished the relative influence of political      parties and encouraged them to seek soft money. Increasing      the individual contribution limit to $50,000 would help      strengthen parties that can provide an effective      counterweight to ``special interests.'' \394\ Furthermore,      most agree that political parties serve a beneficial      mediating role in the political process that should be      enhanced. Both of these benefits would be derived by      increasing the contribution limit to political parties.\395\ 8. The Amount Political Parties Can Spend in Coordinated Expenditures             with Federal Candidates Should Also Be Increased       With the increase in the individual contribution limit to      political parties, Congress should increase the coordinated      expenditure limits provided in Sec. 441(a)(d). These limits      have also been in existence since 1974 and were not indexed      for increases in the consumer price index as were the      expenditure limits on presidential campaigns.\396\ Because of      the increase in the cost of federal campaigns, the influence      of political parties has diminished. Congress should restore      this balance and also index the new limits to inflation.\397\9. The FEC Should be Mandated, in its Regulatory Activities, to Observe                the Limits Imposed by the First Amendment       Since the admonitions of the courts have left the FEC      unchastened in its regulatory efforts to contain issue      advocacy, Congress should mandate that, in its regulatory      activities, the FEC should act in a manner that will have the      least restrictive effect on the rights of free speech and      association protected by the First Amendment. To give this      provision some teeth, a reviewing court should be authorized      to hold unlawful and set aside any action of the Commission      that did not use the least restrictive means available. 10. Reasonable Attorneys Fees Should Be Authorized by Congress if any  Provision of the FECA of Action of the FEC Violates Constitutionally                             Protected Rights       The provisions of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988, authorizing an award      of attorney fees to prevailing party who vindicates      constitutional rights as against a state, are a substantial      deterrent to states violating the guarantees of federal law.      While federal law currently allows for an award of attorney      fees against federal agencies in limited circumstances,\398\      the broader guarantees provided in Sec. 1988 are justified in      this case for two reasons.       First, the FECA uniquely involves the attempt by government      to regulate vital First Amendment rights that are      ``indispensable democratic freedoms.'' Particularly in light      of the efforts by some to pass provisions know to be      unconstitutional, a provision that allows an award of      attorney fees for a successful effort to strike down a      portion of the FECA is warranted.\399\       Second, the FEC has a sorry history of repeated attempts to      unconstitutionally expand its powers to regulate issue      advocacy. A significant deterrent to such intransigence, and      a justified effort to compensate the victims of it, would be      to award attorney fees to those private parties that prevail      in FEC enforcement actions or against new FEC regulations. 11. The Act Should Establish Term Limits for FEC Commissioners, Staff                      Director, and General Counsel       The six commissioners of the FEC are currently appointed      for six year terms and are     eligible for reappointment.\400\ The FEC is administered by a      staff director and general counsel appointed by the      Commission.\401\ Because of the strong institutional bias      toward regulating free speech in the FEC, fresh blood is      needed at the higher echelons of the Commission. This could      be established by providing term limits for the      Commissioners, staff director, and the general counsel.12. The Tax Credit for Small Political Contributions Should Be Restored       The 1974 amendments to the FECA contained a 50% individual      tax credit for political contributions up to $100. This tax      credit provided a substantial incentive for small political      contributions. This incentive should be restored to encourage      small contributions from a greater number of citizens.  13. Limits on Issue Advocacy for Tax Exempt Groups in the Internal                    Revenue Code Should Be Eliminated       The Internal Revenue Code imposes limits on issue advocacy      for tax exempt organizations. Specifically, the Internal      Revenue Code prohibits groups exempt under Sec. 501(c)(3)      from ``participat[ing] in, or interven[ing] in [including the      publishing or distributing of statements], any political      campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office.''      Organizations that are exempt under Sec. 501(c)(4) may engage      in political activity but such activity must be      ``insubstantial'' and is subject to a tax under Sec. 527.       Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service has given this      provision a very expansive interpretation which clearly      encompasses issue advocacy. For instance, in Revenue Ruling      78-248, the IRS interpreted this provision to include voter      guides, even though they only contained issue advocacy and      did not contain any ``express advocacy.'' As a result, not-     for-profit groups have been chilled in the exercise of their      constitutional right to issue advocacy.       Congress should correct this clear violation of First      Amendment speech by bringing this provision into compliance      with Buckley. This provision should be amended to read that      this exemption is available to Sec. 501(c)(3) organizations      that ``do not contribute to any political candidate,      political committee, or political party and do not make any      expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of a      clearly identified candidate for political office.''      Furthermore, Congress should make it clear in the statute      that Sec. 501(c)(4) organizations are not subject to a tax      except on any contribution to a political candidate,      committee, or party and on any independent expenditure      expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly      identified federal candidate.                               conclusion       As the U.S. Congress considers campaign finance reform, it      has a unique opportunity to make significant changes that      will improve our electoral process. There are two paths that      beckon. One to limit, stifle, punish and penalize speech is      doomed to failure at the doorstep of the United States      Supreme Court. The other to encourage, promote and enhance      speech will not only pass constitutional muster but will      restore the balance that many believe is critically needed.       Moreover, the FEC must be reigned in to protect the      constitutional rights of the people. The FEC is an agency out      of control. Instead of carrying out its legitimate      administrative role, it has expended considerable resources      seeking to restrict, stifle and punish constitutionally      protected free speech. Congress has an urgent duty to reorder      the priorities of the FEC in order to protect citizens and      grassroots organizations from the heavy hand of the censors      at the FEC. Until the FEC has demonstrated a proper      sensitivity for First Amendment rights, it should not be      entrusted with further authority to intrude into the vital      workings of our representative democracy.                               footnotes     *James Bopp, Jr., B.A., Indiana University, 1970; J.D.,      University of Florida, 1973; Attorney, Bopp, Coleson &      Bostrom, Terre Haute, Indiana; General Counsel, National      Right to Life Committee, Inc.; Vice Chairman, Free Speech and      Election Law Practice Group of the Federalist Society;      Editor-in-Chief, Issues in Law & Medicine.     **Richard E.

Free speech is both an end and a means, as stated by the      United States Supreme Court in FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens      for Life (MCFL):     ``[w]hile this market metaphor has guided congressional      regulation in the area of campaign activity, First Amendment      speech is not necessarily limited to such an instrumental      role. As Justice Brandeis stated in his discussion of      political speech in his concurrence in Whitney v. California,      274 U.S. 357, 375 . . . (1927):     ``Those who won our independence believed that the final end      of the State was to make men free to develop their faculties;      and that in its government the deliberative forces should      prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as an      end and as a means.'' MCFL, 479 U.S. 238, 257 n. 10 (1986)      (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted). ``It is the      fact of participation in the political process that the First      Amendment protects, not [merely] its qualities of sanity and      objectivity.''

BeVier,      The First Amendment and Political Speech: An Inquiry Into the      Substance and Limits of Principle, 30 Stan. L. Rev. 299, 317      (1978)).     8. FEC v.

The Federalist No. 10 (James Madison) (setting forth the      principle that in our federal system the ambition of one      group was to be checked and balanced by other groups, as all      argued for public support of their positions). The Supreme      Court has always held that certain categories of speech did      not have First Amendment protection, e.g., slander, libel,      fraud, fighting words, obscenity, criminal conspiracy or      incitement, treason, and communicating national security      secrets. See e.g., John E. Nowak, Ronald D. Rotunda & J.      Nelson Young, Constitutional Law 827 (3d ed. 1986) (Chapter      16, Freedom of Speech).                           *   *   *   *   *     24. Most notable among these has been Buckley itself, which      struck down several provisions of the Federal Election      Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-443, 88 Stat.      1263.     25. Bradley Smith makes a convincing case that campaign      finance reform as it has been practiced has led to      undemocratic consequences by entrenching the status quo,      promoting influence peddling, reducing accountability, and      empowering social elites (such as news reporters and wealthy      candidates) at the expense of grass-roots, populist efforts.      Bradley A. Smith, 105 Yale L.J. at 1071-84. In Day v.      Holahan, the United States Court of Appeal for the Eighth      Circuit noted one example of incumbent self-protection: ``It      appears that the legislators who enacted the $100 limit on      contributions to political committees and funds, and the      governor who signed the limit into law, approved limits on      election-year contributions to themselves that were many      times higher than the $100 limit on contributions to      committees and funds.'' Day v. Holahan, 34 F.3d 1356, 1365      N.8 (8th Cir. 1994).     26. Campaign Finance Reform: Hearings before the United      States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration (Mar. 13,      1996). The proposals in Section V of this article are largely      based on the recommendations made in this testimony.     27. Similarly, in the November 1996 election, national labor      unions spent $35 million dollars (by their own account) in      the weeks before the November 1996 election for      advertisements attacking targeted U.S. congressional      candidates on various issues. Apart from questions raised      about the accuracy of some of the advertisements (some have      been refused by broadcasters on accuracy grounds) and the      voluntariness of the use of union member's dues for pro-     Democrat attack ads, such issue advocacy is an appropriate      part of the American political system. The present authors      and the First Amendment strongly support the right of the      labor unions to engage in robust issue advocacy, even at      election time. The solution for those opposed to such issue      advocacy is not to silence the labor unions but to mount an      effective counter-attack. However, concomitant efforts by the      FEC to intimidate the Christian Coalition (and thereby      similar groups) from advocating essentially opposing issues      through voter guides, is abhorrent to First Amendment      principles.     28. ``Effective advocacy of both public and private points of      view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced      by group association.'' MCFL, 479 U.S. at 264 (quoting NAACP      v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958)).     29. Express advocacy consists of explicit words of advocacy,      such as ``vote for Candidate X'' or ``defeat Candidate Y.''      Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44.     30. Federal Election Commission v. National Conservative      Political Action Committee, 470 U.S. 480 (1985).     31. The public policy struggle over abortion rights is a good      example of the checks and balances in the free marketplace of      ideas. Abortion-rights advocates promote their favored      candidates by making donations through PACs such as Emily's      List, while pro-life advocates contribute to PACs such as the      National Right to Life Political Action Committee.     32. The Court, for instance, has approved statutory      requirements that PACs register and report their financial      activities. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 60-68.     33. See e.g., West Virginians for Life v. Smith, 919 F. Supp.      954 (S.D.W.V. 1996). Co-author James Bopp, Jr. was lead      counsel representing the Plaintiffs in this case.     34. The heavy burden imposed on PACs was well-described with      respect to federal PACs in FEC v. Machinists Non-Partisan      Political League, 655 F.2d 380, 392 (D.D.C. 1981), cert.      denied, 454 U.S. 897 (1981), which noted that, once an      organization is labelled a ``political committee,'' it must      ``then submit to an elaborate panoply of FEC regulations      requiring the filing of dozens of forms, the disclosing of      various activities, and the limiting of the group's freedom      of political action to make expenditures or contributions.''     35. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 74-82.     36. Id.     37. Of course, if the pro-life newsletter were to combine in      its election issue the words ``vote pro-life'' and the words      ``Candidate D is pro-life,'' the communication contains      express advocacy. MCFL, 479 U.S. at 249-50. This is based on      the unremarkable algebraic formula that, if a=b and b=c, then      a=c.     38. This is so because the Supreme Court has insisted that      the bright-line express advocacy test must govern any effort      to bar or restrict communications about candidates, parties,      and ideas in the election context. The Court has done so      because America believes in free expression on issues of the      day, even at election time, or, more correctly, especially at      election time. What good would a First Amendment be if it did      not protect communicators at precisely the time when free      speech would be most effective and is most important? The      fact that issue advocacy might affect an election is      constitutionally inconsequential because the First Amendment      right of issue advocacy must be preserved. In fact, to the      Framers of the Constitution and the First Amendment, the      constitutional protection of free expression was precisely to      protect the advocacy of issues and ideas in the political      context. ``Freedom of speech plays a fundamental role in a      democracy . . . [I]t `is the matrix, the indispensable      condition of nearly every other freedom.' '' MCFL, 479 U.S.      at 264 (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937)).      ``[T]he right of free public discussion     . . . [is] a fundamental principle of the American form of      government.'' New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 274      (1964) (paraphrasing James Madison, 6 Writings of James      Madison 341 (G. Hunt ed. 1908)).     39. Faucher, 928 F.2d 468.     40. A voter guide may be distributed by any individual or      organization, including churches and nonprofit entities      organized under 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) of the Internal      Revenue Code.     41. See infra Section III.     42. See e.g., West Virginians for Life, 919 F. Supp. 954      (permanently enjoining a state statute which defined the      distribution of a voter guide within 60 days of an election      to constitute express advocacy of the election of a      candidate).     43.

The Buckley court also quoted approvingly the      comments of the United States Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia, which it affirmed: ``Public discussion      of public issues which also are campaign issues readily and      often unavoidably draws in candidates and their positions,      their voting records and other official conduct. Discussions      of those issues, and as well more positive efforts to      influence public opinion on them, tend naturally and      inexorably to exert some influence on voting at elections.''      Id. at 42 n.50 (quoting, Buckley, 171 U.S. App. D.C. 172,      226, 519 F.2d 821, 875 (D.C. Cir. 1975)).     62. There are strong arguments that a person wishing to      express an opinion on any candidate to print and distribute      flyers opposing or supporting candidates, or to give a      donation to a campaign, should not have to think at all about      possible laws restricting his or her speech in America. That      is the spirit of the First Amendment, which says that      ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of      speech . . . .'' U.S. Const. amend. I (emphasis added). That      one could today suffer penalties for political speech which      is not libelous or fraudulent would, no doubt, be astounding      and disconcerting to the Framers of the First Amendment.     However, the Supreme Court has said that, at a minimum, one      should not have to think twice about speaking out on issues      of public concern for fear of violating some law. The result      of laws which limit speech in the campaign arena is to chill      speech by individuals and grassroots citizen groups and to      enhance the speech of organized advocacy interests who can      afford to hire lawyers to watch over all their publications      and expenditures. Bradley A. Smith, 105 Yale L.J. at 1077.      This reality runs exactly counter to the populist rhetoric of      most campaign finance reformers.     63. Buckley,  424 U.S. at 44.     64.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for      the District of Columbia has recently decided that the major      purpose test does not apply to contributions, but only to      independent expenditures. Akins v. FEC, 101 F.3d 731 (D.C.      Cir. 1996). This case will be analyzed infra.     68. These burdens include not only detailed recordkeeping and      reporting requirements for all of the organizations financial      activities but also disclaimer requirements on their      publications and limits on the contributions that may be      received by the organization. See FEC v. Machinists Non-     Partisan Political League, 655 F.2d 380, 392 (D.C. Cir.      1981).     69. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 74-75 (footnotes omitted).

From the opinion, it would appear that the FEC did not      make a vigorous First Amendment defense. Rather, it appears      to have relied on interpretation of precedent, statutory      interpretation, and a plea for deference to its      interpretation of the statute in its regulations.

The Fair Government Foundation's special report, The      FEC's Express War on Free Speech 18 (1996), sums up some of      the evidence of the FEC's hostility to the Supreme Court's      bright-line protection of issue advocacy in Buckley and MCFL:     ``That the Commission dragged its feet in revising its rules      to conform them with the Supreme Court rulings suggests that      the FEC sought to prolong its concession to the Supreme Court      in the hope of changing the high court's mind. . . . During      an open meeting of the FEC, Commission chairman Trevor Potter      . . . expressed concern whether the Commission was remaining      faithful to Supreme Court precedent. Potter questioned      whether `enforcing the law in specific matters and then in      drafting a definition in general, is consistent with the very      narrow language' of Buckley. [End note: `Federal Election      Commission Open Meeting (Aug. 11, 1994) (taped transcript      available at Commission).']     ``In the end, the Commission simply would not accept the      plain meaning of the Buckley decision because it so      conflicted with a majority of commissioners' fervently held      regulatory beliefs. Beliefs that were less a product of the      FECA or court cases than a personal philosophical      disposition.     ``Comments of the FEC's chairman during consideration of the      proposed rules reveal what in retrospect must seem like      inadvertent candor, as they demonstrate a willful disregard      of the Supreme Court's commands. Chairman Trevor Potter, who      cast the decisive fourth vote to approve the revised rules,      unabashedly revealed that the Commission is `close to being      on a different planet from the Supreme Court in terms of what      we are looking at.' In Chairman Potter's mind, `the [Supreme]      Court doesn't understand[.]' as its rulings are `directly      contrary to what the Commission understands the purpose of      the Act [FECA] to be . . . . ' Id.     ``Commissioner Danny Lee McDonald, who also voted for the      revised rules, was similarly dismissive of the Supreme      Court's edicts.

The Fair Government Foundation's special report on The      FEC's Express War on Free Speech includes the following      succinct chronology of the FEC's rulemaking efforts to      regulate express advocacy: Anatomy of a Rulemaking--The FEC's      Twenty Year Struggle Over Express Advocacy:     1976--Buckley v. Valeo decided.     1976--FEC rule defining ``express advocacy'' adopted.     1986--Massachusetts Citizens for Life decided.     1987--Petition for Rulemaking filed.     1988--Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.     1988--FEC holds public hearing.     1990--Request for Further Comment.     1992--Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.     1992--FEC holds public hearing.     1994--FEC open meeting to consider proposed rule.     1995--FEC open meeting to consider Final Rule.     1995--Final Rule transmitted to Congress.     1995--Revised Express Advocacy rules take effect.     1996--Revised rules struck down; Id. at 16.     156. See, e.g., Main Right to Life Committee 914 F. Supp. at      12 (considering and * * * deference to the FEC's      interpretation on which these new regulations were based).     157. 11 C.F.R. Sec. 100.22.     158. In this first set of 1995 regulation (released October      5), the FEC also tacked on a set of rules dealing with MCFL-     type organizations as established by the United States      Supreme Court in MCFL, 479 U.S. 238. This part of the      regulations will be discussed, infra, under a separate      heading.     159. James Bopp, Jr., co-author of this article, was lead      counsel in the case.     160. 11 C.F.R.

The new regulations      also governed several other things, including candidates      appearances at corporate meetings and use of corporate      letter-head in relation to campaigns.     168. 61 Fed. Reg. at 10269.     169.  The regulation, 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.4(c)(5), was      promulgated under the ostensible statutory authority of 2      U.S.C. Sec. 441b (the broad statutory prohibition on      corporate ``expenditures'' and ``contributions'').     170. Clifton, 927 F. Supp. at 497.     171. 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.4(c)(5)(i). Paragraph (c)(5)(i)      provides that corporations ``shall not contact . . . the      candidates, the candidates' committees or agents regarding      the preparation, contents and distribution of the voter      guide. . . .''     172. It is difficult to imagine how an organization could      prepare a voter guide which would be helpful to the voters      without contacting the candidates and asking for responses to      a survey form. The organization would be left to glean      candidate views from campaign literature, news accounts, and      the like. Information from such sources would often be      inaccurate, incomplete, or subject to the ``spin'' supplied      by a campaign strategist or reporter. Questions framed by      advocacy organizations elicit much truer pictures of      candidates' positions than candidates often are willing to      admit without such careful framing.     173. 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.4(c)(5)(ii)     174. 11 C.F.R. Sec. 114.4(c)(5)(ii) (A) through (E).      Paragraph (c)(5)(ii) provides that a ``corporation . . .      shall not contact . . . the candidates, the candidates'      committees or agents regarding the preparation, contents and      distribution of the voter guide, except that questions may be      directed in writing to the candidates included in the voter      guide and the candidates may respond in writing. . . .''     175. 11 C.F.R.

For instance, the FEC has also adopted a regulation at      11 C.F.R. Sec. 109.1(b)(4)(i)(B) which states that the      Commission will presume expenditures ``made by or through any      person who is, or has been, authorized to raise or expend      funds, who is, or has been, an officer of an authorized      committee, or who is, or has been, receiving any form of      compensation or reimbursement from the candidate, the      candidate's committee or agent'' to be coordinated. This      regulation is also of doubtful validity as a result of the      Colorado Republican decision.     199. Section 441a(d) of the FECA permits political parties to      spend $20,000 or $.02 per person of voting age in the state,      whichever is greater, adjusted for inflation since 1974.      Colorado Republican, 116 S. Ct. at 2313-44 (lead opinion of      Breyer, J., joined by O'Connor and Souter, JJ.).

It can be hoped that the FEC will be more willing to      follow the enactments of Congress than they have been willing      to respect the pronouncements of the United States Supreme      Court.     388. MCFL., 479 U.S. 238.     389. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79.     390. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 431(4)(a).     391. See e.g., GOPAC, 917 F. Supp. 851.     392. In fact, a prohibition of contributions by certain not-     for-profit corporations is currently being tested before the      6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Kentucky Right to Life v.      King, No 95-6581 (6th Cir. 1996) (oral arguments conducted      November 13, 1996). Co-author James Bopp, Jr. is lead counsel      representing Plaintiffs in this case.     393. In fact, based on figures from the Consumer Price Index,      $1,000 in 1974 was worth $2,604.57 in 1994.     394. See e.g., Colorado Republican, 116 S.Ct. at 2317 (``If      anything, an independent expenditure made possible by a      $20,000 donation (by an individual), but controlled and      directed by a party rather than the donor, would seem less      likely to corrupt than the same (or a much larger)      independent expenditure made directly by that donor.'').     395. Efforts to limit soft money contributions to political      parties have the opposite effect. If political parties must      use hard money for administration, legal and accounting      services, and generic, rather than candidate specific, voter      registration and get-out-the-vote activities, then their      relative influence with candidates is diminished and the      influence of ``special interests,'' is increased.     396. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441a(c).     397. Indeed, Congress should index all expenditures and      contributions limits to inflation in order to maintain the      balance between them struck by Congress in any new law.     398. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2411(d)(1)(A) allows for an award of      attorneys fees against a federal agencies for its actions,      ``unless the court finds that the position of the United      States was substantially justified or that special      circumstances make an award unjust.'' However, the amount of      the attorneys fees is limited to $75 an hour and only private      parties with modest assets are eligible for the award. Id. at      Sec. 2411(d)(2)(A) and (B). There are no similar limitations      on award of attorneys fees for prevailing private parties      under Sec. 1988.     399. Current federal law does not allow an award of attorney      fees against the United States for the striking down of a      federal statute for violation of constitutional protections.     400. 2 U.S.C.
