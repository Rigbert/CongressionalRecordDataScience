Speaker, it is with tremendous pleasure and admiration that I congratulate the parishioners of the Sacred Heart Parish in East Chicago, Indiana, as they celebrate their 75th anniversary as a congregation, as well as the 60th anniversary of the opening services in their current sanctuary, on March 4, 2001. The day will begin with a special Mass conducted by Bishop Dale Melczek to be followed by a celebratory luncheon.  Originally known as Mission of Assumption Slovak Parish, Sacred Heart was founded in order to service the spiritual needs of Slovaks in East Chicago and Whiting, Indiana. Services were held at several churches in the two cities until Father Clement Mlinarovich saw a great need for the Mission in East Chicago. From 1926 to 1941, the Sacred Heart Parish conducted Masses, confessions, and missions at various churches throughout the city.  After many years of relying on other churches' facilities, the dedicated parishioners decided to build their own sanctuary. The beautiful church was dedicated in May 1941 by Bishop John Francis Noll of the Fort Wayne Diocese, with many delighted Slovak priests and lay citizens from around Lake County attending. The Sacred Heart congregation was overjoyed that they finally had their own house of worship. They also took special pride in the building because many of the parishioners volunteered to assist with its construction.  Father Andrew G. Grutka was the first resident pastor at the newly completed church. He preached to the Sacred Heart congregation from 1942 to 1944, after which he became the first Bishop of the Diocese of Gary. Father Louis Duray and Father Milan Bach succeeded Father Grutka and made significant improvements, including beautifying the sanctuary and purchasing a home for the priest. Father Joseph Semancik was later sent to Sacred Heart as the pastor, a position he maintains today.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the congregation of Sacred Heart parish in East Chicago, Indiana as they celebrate the 75th anniversary of their founding and the 60th anniversary of the construction of their church. Sacred Heart Parish has undergone many changes from the time it began as the Mission of Assumption Slovak Parish. They have settled in East Chicago, built a beautiful sanctuary, and expanded the congregation to include a variety of ethnic backgrounds. What has remained the same is the dedication, loyalty, and love for their fellow man the parishioners have displayed throughout the parish's many years of service to the community. May God continue to bless the parishioners and the church leaders for many years to come.                          ____________________
