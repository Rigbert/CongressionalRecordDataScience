Floyd on his retirement after thirty-four years of service as the founding Chief Executive Officer of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Craig retired at the end of 2018 and leaves behind a powerful legacy of service to the men and women of law enforcement across our nation. I have been proud to work closely with Craig over the years on a cause about which we both care very deeply: honoring those who have fallen while protecting our communities.  Craig helped launch the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund in 1984, partnering with his former boss--and my friend--former Rep. Mario Biaggi of New York and others to establish a permanent memorial in Washington. In 1991, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial was unveiled, and it now preserves the names of 21,541 law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty. It stands as a powerful reminder to the millions of visitors to the nation's capital of the service and sacrifices of those keeping them safe back home and in every community. In 2018, the National Law Enforcement Museum was opened near the memorial to tell the stories of the men and women whose names are borne upon its walls.  Craig was instrumental in bringing this vision to completion and establishing the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and the National Law Enforcement Museum. Under his guidance, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund launched the world's most comprehensive database of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty; published To Serve and Protect--a Tribute to American Law Enforcement; built partnerships with the Department of Justice and Department of Transportation to promote officers' safety and wellbeing; and inaugurated the tradition of holding annual candlelight vigils during National Police Week in May. In many ways, these all stand not only to pay homage to the men and women of law enforcement but also as a lasting tribute to citizens like Craig W. Floyd who dedicated their careers to honoring and aiding these heroes.  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Craig for his service and wishing him well in his retirement. I encourage everyone to visit the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and the National Law Enforcement Museum in our nation's capital to learn about the service of those who put their lives on the line to protect our communities every day.                          ____________________
