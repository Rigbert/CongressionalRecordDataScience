 I also would note that the issue of Customs' revenue functions is dealt with differently in this bill than in the draft bill originally sent to Congress by the Administration. In the Administration's draft bill, all Customs functions would have been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security without any further action by any government official. That is, no Customs-related authorities would have been retained by the Secretary of the Treasury. Would the Senator from Montana agree that this contrast further supports the point that the bill now before the Senate is not intended to give the Secretary of the Treasury blanket permission to engage in a wholesale or large-scale transfer of revenue-related authorities to the Secretary of Homeland Security?
