 President, I will say just a word this morning about the still unfinished extenders package that is about to come over from the House.  The first thing to say is that Republicans are ready and willing right now to extend necessary benefits and to pay for them. We could get this done in literally no time. So any delay in passing this bill is coming from the other side of the aisle. I say this not to point fingers but because we have seen this Democratic playbook.  We know they will try to blame Republicans for their own inability to come to an agreement if we don't go along with their effort to add another $130 billion to the deficit by the end of the week. Let me say that again. We know they will try to blame Republicans for their own inability to come to an agreement if we don't go along with their effort to add another $130 billion to the deficit by the end of this week.  So let's be perfectly clear: There is one reason Democrats are having trouble getting an agreement on this bill, and one reason only. That is because it is so blatantly reckless.  Europe is in the midst of what German Chancellor Angela Merkel describes as an existential crisis, all brought about by governments that spend money they don't have. Americans are watching this crisis play out, and they see Democrats doing the same thing here day after day after day. This extenders package is just the latest example, the latest evidence of a majority that simply is out of control.  As early as today, we will reach a dubious milestone in America: a $13 trillion national debt--the first time in history we have crossed this frightening threshold.  This extenders bill would add another $130 billion on top of that--more debt in one vote than the administration claimed their health care bill would save over 10 years. The majority would have us add $130 billion to the $13 trillion debt in 1 week that would eat up all the alleged savings from the health care bill over 10 years. This is fiscal recklessness, and that is why even some Democrats are starting to revolt.  The time is long since past to reverse this dangerous trend, the way Europe has been forced to reverse the trend. But far from doing anything about our own looming debt crisis, Democrats only seem interested in making it worse.  The true emergency here--if we are looking for one--is our national debt. That is the emergency. A line must be drawn somewhere. Americans are simply running out of patience.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
