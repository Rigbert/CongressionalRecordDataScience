Chairman, the substitute would be a great improvement for the current Endangered Species Act. It would treat landowners much as we do under the Conservation Reserve Program; but the underlying bill would be a disaster for taxpayers, a new entitlement.  The Secretary shall pay no less than fair market value. I guess the Secretary, if they are feeling good that day, could pay more than fair market value with taxpayers' money, borrowed money; and it does not require the historic, usual, or custom use.  Take a piece of remote farm land, propose a huge development on it; it does not have to be proven to be economically viable. You proposed it; you were going to build 5,000 houses; you were going to make $1,000, $2,000, $5,000 on each house. You would have to be compensated for that. You do not have to prove that this is economically viable, and sequential owners would get that right. You then sell it to your next door neighbor; they can make the same claim. They sell it to the guy down the street, they can make the same claim, on and on and on.  What an incredible new, speculative market, helping the housing bubble, I guess; but this is going to kill the taxpayers and the Federal Treasury. You should vote for the substitute. It will improve the Endangered Species Act.
