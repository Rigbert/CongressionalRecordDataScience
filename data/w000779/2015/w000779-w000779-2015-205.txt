President, today I rise to introduce the PURPA PLUS Act.  In my home State we have numerous emerging small renewable energy technologies, such as wave energy buoys, hydropower turbines in irrigation canals, biomass burning cogeneration facilities and rooftop solar installations. Like Oregon, many States have sought to advance such new electricity technologies by allowing utilities to pay higher than normal power purchase rates, called ``incentive rates'', for power from these desirable technologies. Incentive rates allow individuals and small businesses deploying these desirable technologies to recover the money they invest in the infrastructure, such as solar panels or other electricity generation equipment, over a reasonable period of time. The ability of States to award such incentive rates for small projects is currently hampered by the need to go through a case-by-case review process before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC.  The PURPA PLUS Act simply provides States the legal authority to set incentive rates for small renewable energy projects. Currently, under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, PURPA, the FERC regulates the price that utility companies pay for electricity from small, independent power providers. Such prices can be no higher than what it would normally cost a utility company either to generate or to buy additional power from the lowest cost provider. This structure sets a limit on prices that is often too low for small renewable energy projects to be financially viable, despite other clear benefits they provide, such as local job creation, lower investment in high-voltage transmission lines, diversity in an area's power generation portfolio, and the environmental benefits of green energy.  PURPA PLUS would transfer the authority for setting power purchase rates for small power projects of less than 2 megawatts from FERC to the States on a voluntary basis. If a State chose to exercise this authority to promote small wind energy development, or solar, or cogeneration projects, it could. If a State chose not to use this authority, FERC would continue to regulate these projects as before. By capping the project size at 2 megawatts, PURPA PLUS only extends this new authority for small projects that are providing very small amounts of power to the local utility company, leaving regulation of large wind farms, hydropower and other large renewable energy projects unchanged.  While I acknowledge that the power from these small projects may be more expensive than a large central generation station powered by coal or gas, Ibelieve that States, if they choose, should be able to consider the associated benefits of small renewable power and set higher prices, when the market demands such action and when the benefits outweigh the costs.  I urge my colleagues to review and ultimately to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1233       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``PURPA's Legislative Upgrade      to State Authority Act'' or ``PURPA PLUS Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies      Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 824a-3)--       (A) established a new class of nonutility generators known      as ``qualifying cogeneration facilities'' and ``qualifying      small power production facilities''; and       (B) encouraged the development of alternate sources of      energy with the requirement that utilities purchase energy      offered by qualifying facilities;       (2) since the date of enactment of that section, materials      and designs for qualifying facility technologies have      advanced and placed renewable resources and cogeneration      facilities within the reach of more consumers, including      technologies such as--       (A) solar photovoltaic panels;       (B) small wind turbines;       (C) storage technologies to support renewable energy;       (D) small hydroelectric generators on existing dams,      diversions, and conduits;       (E) hydrokinetic generators;       (F) gas microturbines;       (G) steam-cycle turbines;       (H) Stirling engines;       (I) fuel cells; and       (J) biomass boilers;       (3) States need additional regulatory flexibility and      authority to be able to incentivize the qualifying      facilities; and       (4) the avoided cost caps on qualifying facilities should      be removed so that States can set the rates for qualifying      facilities of not more than 2 megawatts capacity.     SEC. 3. STATE AUTHORITY TO INCENTIVIZE QUALIFYING FACILITIES.       Section 210(b) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies      Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 824a-3(b)) is amended in the last      sentence by inserting before the period at the end the      following: ``, except that the rule shall provide that a      State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility,      acting under State authority, may set rates that exceed the      incremental cost of alternative electric energy for purchases      from any qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small      power production facility of not more than 2 megawatts      capacity''.                          ____________________
