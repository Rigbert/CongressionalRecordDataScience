 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record these statements by high school students from Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. White. The state government is not providing sufficient      funding for higher education and the federal government is      not providing the incentive for states to increase that      funding; especially in Vermont, the state with the lowest      provision for funding of higher education this has a      profoundly negative impact. The students from Vermont leave      the state as the out-of-state tuition at many other state      universities is less expensive than the in-state tuition of      that of the University of Vermont which is $7200 a year. The      tuition at SUNY Stonybrook, U.C. Berkeley, North Adams State,      U. Mass. at Amherst and almost all midwestern universities is      lower for an-out-of-state student than that of UVM. This      causes a drain of the best of the best students in Vermont      essentially.       With the best students leaving the state, industry does not      want to come with so few educated workers for hire. With no      industry there is no incentive for people to move to the      state who would then bring in revenue. With less revenue the      state has less money to pay for higher education, and it is      quite frankly a vicious cycle that needs to be broken.       Mr. Pappas. The federal proposals to offer help in paying      for higher education do not remedy this problem. The 105th      Congress law, HR 318 provides for federal income tax credit      for tuition. There's a proposal of a $10,000 Hope scholarship      tax deduction and one that would bring Pell Grant increases.      Bill HR 2050 from the 104th Congress would restore the      deduction for interest on higher education loans and permit      penalty-free deductions from retirement plans. All of these      proposals would bring relief if families are already saving      or if they qualify for the grants that would help. However,      all these bring individual relief only. They do not bring any      state initiative to fund higher education.       Ms. Black. We propose that when states fund higher      education above a certain minimum percentage, the federal      government will provide matching funds. These funds can be      drawn from the federal income tax. This small, relatively      small drain would have numerous benefits. This will allow for      lower tuition costs making higher education available to more      people in the State of Vermont as well as the rest of the      nation. When you create a more educated work force, you bring      in more industry, increase the economy and raise property      values and with more funding of education, the more      participation there is in the democratic process, and this      would help.       Mr. White. A loss of industry or a lack of industry rather      because who wants to come and set up business in a place with      no educated work force. It's not good for industry, it's not      good for business and it's not good for the economy of      Vermont.       Ms. Black. There there's the cycle that if industry doesn't      come because there's not an educated work force, we don't      have any incentive for out-of-state families to move in      because they realize there's not a future for their children      here and then there are even less people in which case there      is less of a tax base to help pay for the higher education      and less people that will stay.       Mr. White. The University of Vermont, for example, even for      an in-state student, as we said, charges more than SUNY at      Stonybrook or any of the--U.C. Berkeley. It's very expensive      for a Vermont student if they want to stay in state or go to      UVM or Castleton or any of the number of state schools. It's      just far too expensive, $7200 in tuition.       Ms. Black. In state and for students in the southern area      of Vermont, North Adams State is almost closer than the      University of Vermont and it's almost $2,000 less expensive      for an out-of-stater from Vermont than in state in--in      Vermont, so why would they stay?       Mr. White. We're exporting basically our best and brightest      out of state. In Europe, at least in Germany, they have a      system where you can go for free but the only--the only-- the      drawback to that is you have to be in the top of the top of      the top. Not everybody gets an opportunity to go on to      university in some European countries.       Ms. Black. In the midwestern states there's both state and      federal funding. Well, in every state there's both state and      federal funding to public higher education, but in Vermont      it's a lot lower. And if we had the process where the federal      government would match state funds, it would give smaller      states like Vermont more of an initiative to fund the higher      education.       Anybody who has the ability should be able to go to their      state university. I mean, not everybody could get into the      top schools, but everybody should have the chance to go to a      school for higher education because it's getting harder and      harder to get a decent job where you can make any sort of a      living without a college education.       Mr. Lafarge. More and more people are going to college      every year, but even people that get say a four-year degree      aren't even going to make as high a wage as would be      expected, so people who just go to high school are going to      be left behind and may be stuck to factory jobs or, you know,      just----       Mr. White. The numbers, in fact, show the disparity between      even a master's degree--a person with a master's and a person      with a four-year degree and a person with a high school      degree. It shows the disparity, the numbers which I don't      have obviously, but there's a great disparity between the      amount of money that each of those people would make.       Twenty percent of our budget is spent on defense. Well, it      seems to me that since there are no real wars going on, and      not to parrot what everyone else has said, but it seems as      though really defense should--shold and could be cut.       Ms. Black. I think that even if it would mean raising      income taxes and I know people are complaining that taxes are      too high and that education is too expensive, but you've got      to--you know, the public needs to understand the long-range      effect of having education accessible because if they were      willing to put up with a small increase in the income tax or      the taxes that this money could be drawn from, then if people      could go to college, they would--they could make more money      and the economy would be increased as a whole and the      property values would go up as a whole and in the long term      that small increase would not seem as large.       Mr. White. Plus it's cheaper to educate people and to have      them get jobs than to support them on welfare or to support      them in other ways when they can't find jobs down the line.      It's a lot cheaper, it's a better investment.       Ms. Black. I think in fact that--I think taxes are high for      everybody now and I think hopefully what this raising the      taxes would do would be to give aid to the people who      couldn't normally attend college and you'd--although I know      people who don't have as high incomes don't feel like they      want to be paying taxes, it seems as if it would benefit them      the most if they could help--if everybody had their taxes      raised a small amount, it would benefit them as well.                               ____________________
