 We are not sure exactly which days which bill will be considered, but I think they will probably be considered in the order that they are listed. But whether they will be Wednesday and Thursday or Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, I'm not exactly sure. The suspension bills will probably be considered most of Tuesday. I might also say, as the gentleman knows, there are a number of bills pending that may come from conference, and we will address those bills when and if they do come back.
