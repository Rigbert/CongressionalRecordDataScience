President, I agree with the point that the Senator from Utah has made. There are an awful lot of things in the Senate-passed bill besides guns. There are some very major changes in the handling of juvenile crimes, especially juvenile violent crimes, and matters relating to the relationship between the Federal Government and State governments. There are some very significant things that should not be overlooked and will be a part of the debate.  I was wondering if the Senator from Utah knows when the other body will appoint conferees and how quickly we might appoint conferees?
