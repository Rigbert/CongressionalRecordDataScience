Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to liveand work. Laura Pearson is one of these individuals.  Laura has represented Ward 7 of the City of Riverside for 14 years and has faithfully represented her constituents who live in both rural residential and contemporary neighborhoods. Her ability to see all sides of an issue have enabled her to be an effective councilmember.  Laura served as the Chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Vice Chair for the Development Committee and as a member of the Utility Services/Land Use/Energy Development Committee. At the regional level, Laura served on the Riverside County Habitat Conservation Agency Board, City/County Animal Control Advisory Committee, Regional Water Quality Board and the Model Deaf Community Task Force.  In 1998, a former Riverside City employee broke into the Riverside City Council Chamber during a meeting and seriously injured several people including Laura. Despite this incident, Laura persevered and continued public service. Her courage and devotion demand our deepest respect and gratitude.  Laura is newly and happily married to Bill Densmore, a County Veterans' Service Officer and a City of Riverside Planning Commissioner. She is also a proud mother and grandmother.  Laura's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. She has been the heart and soul of many community initiatives and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.                          ____________________
