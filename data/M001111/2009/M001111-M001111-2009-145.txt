 This is a major appropriations bill with funding for States across the country. I have been talking with a number of Senators who have amendments they would like to offer. Again, this is now the fourth day we have been on the Senate floor. We started on Thursday, we were here Friday, and we were here yesterday. We are here again today. The majority leader would like us to finish this bill tomorrow. We have other appropriations bills that need to be done and conferences to be concluded in order to meet important deadlines for this fiscal year.  Again, I want all Members to know we need them to offer their amendments, if they intend to, so we can wrap up this bill by tomorrow. I expect a few Senators will be here shortly to offer amendments. If other Senators are going to offer amendments, if they could please let us know so we could get them up in order and get votes scheduled so we could move to conclusion on this important bill.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
