 247, the nomination of John Gibson to be Deputy Chief Management Officer of the Department of Defense. I further ask that there be 60 minutes of debate on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate, and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
