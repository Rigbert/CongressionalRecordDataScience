Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues the outstanding career of the Honorable Vincent J. Femia, judge of the Circuit Court of Maryland, who is retiring after having served the State of Maryland for over 33 years.  I have known Judge Femia for close to four decades, and I can tell you he is a man of strong convictions and deep compassion for his fellow citizens. We began our careers in Prince Georges' County in the early 1960's. We soon found out that we shared many of the same convictions of law, on politics, and on life. And, we quickly entered into what is now a longstanding friendship.  One of the most admirable aspects of Vincent Femia's life is his devotion to public service. Either through the State's attorney's office, or as a judge on the circuit court, Vincent Femia has committed his career to serving the citizens of Maryland.  A prime example of this devotion to public service is highlighted by his term as a judge in the juvenile court system. Judge Femia spent countless hours traveling to schools and speaking to our youth on the need to stay in school and about the perils of entering a life of crime.  Judge Femia's distinguished legal career began with his practice in 1960 when he was qualified as a certified public accountant in Maryland. He was admitted to the practice of law before the Maryland Court of Appeals in 1961, and was later admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1966.  His public service career began in 1963 when he was appointed as a part time assistant State's attorney [ASA] in Prince Georges' County from 1963 to 1967. He then became a full time ASA until 1969 when he became the deputy assistant State's attorney, which he remained until appointed to the Maryland District Court by Gov. Marvin Mandel in 1972. On November 7, 1977 he was appointed as a judge to the Circuit Court of Maryland and was then elected to a 15-year term on November 7, 1978. He was reelected to a second 15-year term on November 8, 1994.  Judge Femia was born on July 26, 1936 in Philadelphia, PA. He received his bachelor of arts degree in accounting in 1959 from George Washington University and his juris doctorate degree in 1961 from George Washington University Law School. He maintained a private practice of general law in Oxon Hill, MD, from 1961 to 1967.  Judge Femia is a man revered and respected by his peers, seen as a source of knowledge in the legal realm. He has appeared on ``Nightline'' and ``60 Minutes'' and has written a weekly column for the Prince Georges' Journal.  On October 11, 1996, I will join with Judge Femia and his friends and colleagues in honoring his long service to the State of Maryland. While he has made no firm plans, I expect he will find more time to enjoy the company of his wife, Liz, and their three children and two grandchildren.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to convey how proud I am to know him, and wish him the best as he moves on to the next stage of his life.                          ____________________
