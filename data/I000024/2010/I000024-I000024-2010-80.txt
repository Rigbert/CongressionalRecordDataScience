The bill was just introduced 7 business days ago. It has been referred to the Judiciary Committee, where I assume Chairman Leahy will take a thoughtful look at it. Senator Reid has asked his committee chairmen to report out oilspill legislation by the 4th of July for consideration next month, so I think we should give that process an opportunity to work. So I do object.
