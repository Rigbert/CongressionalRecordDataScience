 President, this weekend I attended what some call Iowa's own Super Bowl, the Iowa v. Iowa State football game. I talked with Iowans while tailgating, and tailgating most of the time goes on before the game for me. We talked about issues such as ethanol, biodiesel, and trade.  This year, the game was in Ames, and Iowa State hosted ESPN's football ``College GameDay,'' and this was the first time ever for Iowans to do that. It was an opportunity to show off Iowa State's campus and to celebrate the tradition of the annual Cy-Hawk game.  Congratulations to the Iowa Hawkeyes for winning this year's match-up, but both teams put up a strong fight, as you can tell from the final score of Iowa's winning 18 to 17.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
