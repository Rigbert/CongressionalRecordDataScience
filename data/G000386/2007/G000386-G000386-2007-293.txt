 President, one of the issues that has been very much a shortcoming within the FDA besides lack of respect for the scientific process, but it is involved in the issue of this amendment as well, is whether scientists in the FDA who have the responsibility of postmarketing surveillance get the respect they ought to from the Office of New Drugs that previously had approved the drug. We have found in the case of Vioxx, in the case of antidepressants for children, and in a lot of other areas as well that this has just not been the case.  My amendment will follow the Institute of Medicine recommendation and make sure there is adequate time and consideration given to postmarketing surveillance, the same as there is to the approval of the drug in the first place. So I ask for approval of this amendment. It is backed by the Institute of Medicine.
