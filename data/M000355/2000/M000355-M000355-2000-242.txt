 President, I thank the Senator for his important contributions. It reminds me of when we discussed this issue previously. It leads me to believe that the appropriate way to deal with someone who desecrates the flag might be a punch in the nose as opposed to evisceration of the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which we have not changed--and I think wisely--in the 200-year history of our country.  I thank the Senator from Utah.  I yield such time as he may desire to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.
