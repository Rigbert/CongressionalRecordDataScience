President, if one travels across the States of Maryland or Illinois and stops at any business, large or small, and has a conversation about how the business is going, it won't take long for the conversation to move to the issue of health care. Virtually every business I have visited in Illinois in the last 10 or 20 years--or labor union, for that matter--wants to talk about health care.
