Speaker, it is with great sincerity and respect that I offer congratulations to several of Northwest Indiana's most talented, dedicated, and hardworking individuals. On Saturday, December 1, 2012, the Roofers Local Union 26 will honor the graduating class of 2012 at the Annual Apprentice Graduation Banquet, which will be held at the Patio Restaurant in Merrillville, Indiana.  At this year's banquet, the Roofers Local Union 26 will recognize and honor the following individuals who have completed their apprentice training in 2012: Jeremy Villarruel, Curtis Mueller, Jason Gutierrez, Jeremy Marsh, Mike Sallee, Fausto Jimenez Jr., Kevin Cooper, Travis Nuss, Chris Kittle, Tommy Haynes, and David Garcia.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These graduates are outstanding examples of each. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and tireless dedication.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated and hardworking individuals. Along with the other men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have committed themselves to making a significant contribution to the growth and development of the economy of the First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
