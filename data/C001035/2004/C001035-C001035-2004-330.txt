President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from South Carolina be accorded up to 10 minutes more for his debate, and then that Senator Lieberman and I have up to 10 minutes for us to use in opposition to the Hollings amendment. Then it is my intention to move to table.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so ordered.
