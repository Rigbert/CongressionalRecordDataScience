 President, we will soon be voting on two consequential and contentious matters, the DREAM Act and repeal of the legislation concerning the Defense Department's don't ask, don't tell policy. As our ranking member on one of the two committees of jurisdiction recently made clear, the Democratic majority in the Senate is again depriving the American people of the right to have their concerns addressed through debate on amendments by depriving the minority of its right to offer amendments.  When Democrats were in the minority, my good friend, the majority leader, said: This is a ``very bad practice,''and it ``runs against the basic nature of the Senate.'' In fact, he suggested we should not shut off debate ``before any amendments had been offered.''  With back-to-back blockage of amendments on both the DREAM Act and legislation repealing don't ask, don't tell, the current majority has set a dubious record by denying the minority its right to amendment a total of 43 times. Let me say that again.
