 President, today I pay tribute to Millard Fuller, a great American entrepreneur who dedicated his life to sheltering the poor. Millard passed away on February 3, 2009. He leaves behind a great legacy of leadership and of service to the world's most vulnerable residents.  Millard was born in 1935 in Lanett, AL. It was in this town that Millard, at only 6 years old, earned his first profit by selling pigs and chickens. His entrepreneurial spirit would certainly carry him far. After some time working as a door-to-door salesman selling silk hosiery and underwear, Millard attended Auburn University to study economics. Following his graduation, Millard attended my alma mater, the University of Alabama School of Law, and it was there that he married his wife Linda.  While a law student at the University of Alabama, Millard expanded his entrepreneurial horizons and began selling Christmas trees and mistletoe withour fellow student, Morris Dees. Together, they would go on to form a lucrative direct marketing business selling cookbooks and other items. This business would make Millard a millionaire by the time he reached the young age of 29. When his work and devotion to monetary success began to threaten his personal relationships, however, Millard and Linda made the decision to simplify their lives by selling their possessions and dedicating their lives to their Christian values.  In 1965, Millard and Linda moved to Koinonia Farm in south Georgia. It was there that Millard and Linda met and became close friends with the farm's founder, Clarence Jordan. Clarence and Millard had much in common and together they developed the concept of a housing program that would provide no-interest loans to people to build modest homes. This idea eventually grew into Habitat for Humanity.  In 1976, from a tiny house in Americus, GA, Millard and Linda established Habitat for Humanity. Today, the organization has built more than 300,000 houses around the world, providing more than 1.5 million people in more than 3,000 communities with safe, decent, affordable shelter. In April 2009, Habitat for Humanity's Alabama State Support Organization will celebrate the completion of its 1,500th house.  Millard is loved and will be missed by his wife Linda and their four children. He will also be missed by the thousands of volunteers who found inspiration through his dedication. It is because of Millard that thousands of people across the world have a place to call home. I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of Millard Fuller.                          ____________________
