This bill stems from the lessons learned during a series of Judiciary Committee hearings on oversight of the FBI that I chaired beginning last June. Even more recently, the important changes which are being made under the FBI's new leadership after the September 11 attacks and the new powers granted the FBI by the USA PATRIOT Act have resulted in FBI reform becoming an pressing matter of national importance.  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the anthrax attacks last fall, we have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic terrorism that endanger the lives of the American people and the institutions of our country. The men and women of the FBI are performing this task with great professionalism at home and abroad. I think that we have all felt safer as a result of the full mobilization of the FBI's dedicated Special Agents, its expert support personnel, and its exceptional technical capabilities. We owe the men and women of the FBI our thanks.  For decades the FBI has been an outstanding law enforcement agency and a vital member of the United States intelligence community. As our hearings and recent events have shown, however, there is room for improvement atthe FBI. We must face the mistakes of the past, and make the changes needed to ensure that they are not repeated. In meeting the international terrorist challenge, the Congress has an opportunity and obligation to strengthen the institutional fibre of the FBI based on lessons learned from recent problems the Bureau has experienced.  This view is not mine alone. When Director Bob Mueller testified at his confirmation hearings last July, he forthrightly acknowledged ``that the Bureau's remarkable legacy of service and accomplishment has been tarnished by some serious and highly publicized problems in recent years. Waco, Ruby Ridge, the FBI lab, Wen Ho Lee, Robert Hanssen, and the McVeigh documents--these familiar names and events remind us all that the FBI is far from perfect and that the next director faces significant management and administrative challenges.'' Since then, the Judiciary Committee has forged a constructive partnership with Director Mueller to get the FBI back on track.  Congress sometimes has followed a hands-off approach about the FBI. But with the FBI's new increased powers, with our increased reliance on them to stop terrorism, and with the increased funding requested in the President's budget will come increased scrutiny. Until the Bureau's problems are resolved and new challenges overcome, we have to take a hands-on approach.  Indeed our hearings and other oversight activities have highlighted tangible steps the Congress should take in an FBI reform bill as part of this hands-on approach. Last year's hearings demonstrated the need to improve FBI internal accountability, extend whistleblower protection, end the double-standard for discipline of senior FBI executives, enhance the FBI's internal security program to protect against espionage as occurred in the Hanssen case, and modernize the FBI's information technology systems. Since last year's oversight hearings, the committee has explored additional management issues that are reflected in the FBI Reform Act. Senator Grassley called attention to concerns about the practices of the FBI and other Federal criminal investigative agencies in reporting and using statistics on their investigations. In addition, FBI officials responsible for protecting its facilities informed us of difficulties in retaining the most qualified people on the FBI's own police force to protect some of our nation's most important and, unfortunately, most targeted facilities.  When Director Mueller announced the first stage of his FBI reorganization last December, he stressed the importance of taking a comprehensive look at the FBI's missions for the future, and Deputy Attorney General Thompson's office has told us that the Attorney General's management review of the FBI is considering this matter. Director Mueller has stated that the second phase of FBI reorganization will be part of a ``comprehensive plan to address not only the new challenges of terrorism, but to modernize and streamline the Bureau's more traditional functions. . . .'' Thus, through our hearings, our other oversight efforts, and the statements and efforts of the new management team at the FBI, an initial list of challenges facing the FBI has been developed.  The provisions in the FBI Reform Act address each of these challenges.  Titles I, II, and VII of the FBI Reform Act strengthen the system for uncovering and reviewing FBI misconduct and imposing appropriate discipline, so that there is appropriate accountability. Title I creates statutory jurisdiction for the DOJ Inspector General over allegations of misconduct in the FBI. It brings the statutory authorities of the Justice Department's Inspector General into line with the administrative regulations adopted by the Attorney General on July 11, 2001, ensuring that there will be no return to a system in which the FBI enjoyed unique exemption for scrutiny by an independent Inspector General. Title II strengthens whistleblower protection for FBI employees and protects them from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. Title VII eliminates statutory disparities in disciplinary penalties for Senior Executive Service and non-SES personnel.  The committee received testimony in our oversight hearings showing that, too often, the independence that is part of the FBI's culture crossed the line into arrogance. Senator Danforth expressed concern to the committee about entrenched executives at the FBI who had created a closed and insular culture resistant to disclosure of mistakes and to reforms. His concern was echoed in testimony the committee heard from experienced FBI Special Agents, including a unit chief in the FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility, who told us of a ``club'' mentality among some Bureau executives who viewed any criticism or change as a threat to their careers.  If there was one message from these witnesses, it was that FBI executives needed to be more willing to admit their mistakes. Too often their response was to shield the Bureau from embarrassment by sacrificing accountability and needed reform. For example, Senator Danforth testified that the FBI helped fan the flames of conspiracy theories at Waco by covering up evidence that it used pyrotechnic rounds, even though they had nothing to do with starting the fire. The FBI culture demanded covering up rather than admitting a mistake. Of course, as the FBI painfully discovered, the price for circling the wagons in this way can be the loss of public confidence.  The Justice Department Inspector General is in a position to conduct an independent investigation that enables the Attorney General and the FBI Director to hold FBI personnel accountable and learn the necessary lessons from mistakes. When Director Mueller was asked at his confirmation hearing about a separate FBI Inspector General, he replied, ``If I were the Attorney General I might have some concern about a separate Inspector General feeding the perception that the FBI was a separate institution accountable only to itself. And I'm not certain in my own mind whether or not what the accountability you seek cannot be discharged by an Inspector General with appropriate personnel in the Department of Justice, as opposed to establishing another Inspector General in the FBI.'' Attorney General Ashcroft decided to follow this route, and Title I of the FBI Reform Act codifies his action.  The committee also heard disturbing testimony about retaliation against FBI Agents who are tasked to investigate their colleagues or who discuss issues with the Congress, either directly or through cooperation with the General Accounting Office, which assists in congressional oversight. Therefore, Title II is important to ensure that the Federal whistleblower protection laws protect FBI personnel to the greatest extent possible. Senator Grassley deserves great credit for stressing the need for this provision and developing the language in the bill. The bill extends whistleblower protections to employees who report wrongdoing to their supervisors or to Congress, and ensures that whistleblowers will enjoy basic procedural protections, including the normal procedures and judicial review provided under the Administrative Procedure Act, if they are subjected to retaliation. It also ensures that those who report wrongdoing to the Office of the Special Counsel have access to the normal Merit System Protection Board rights if retaliated against.  Title VII addresses the issue of a double standard for discipline of senior executives. Internal investigations must lead to fair and just discipline. A troubling internal FBI study that was released at the committee's July hearing documented a double standard at work, with senior FBI executives receiving a slap on the wrist for the same kind of conduct that would result in serious discipline for lower level employees. At his confirmation hearing, Director Mueller said it is ``very important that there be no double standards in accountability. I know there have been allegations that senior FBI officials are sometimes treated more leniently than more junior employees. Any such double standard would be fundamentally unfair and enormously destructive to employee morale.'' Title VII embodies that principle by eliminating the disparity in authorized punishments between Senior Executive Service members and other Federal employees.  The Hanssen espionage case was a tremendous shock to the nation and to the FBI. A trusted and experienced FBI Supervisory Special Agent was foundto have sold many of the nation's most sensitive national security secrets to the Soviet Union and to Russia. Just as the Ames case forced the CIA to revamp its security program after 1994, the Hanssen case requires major changes in FBI security. Former FBI and CIA Director William Webster chairs a commission that is completing its review of lessons learned from the Hanssen case for the Attorney General and the FBI Director. It is my hope that Judge Webster will testify before the Judiciary Committee when his report is complete to present his unclassified findings and recommendations. The FBI Reform Act includes provisions that are based on the Judiciary Committee's initial oversight hearings and we remain open to incorporating the considered recommendations and reforms for which the Webster Commission may call.  Title III of the FBI Reform Act would establish a Career Security Program in the FBI and Title IV would establish an FBI Counterintelligence Polygraph Program for screening personnel in exceptionally sensitive positions with specific safeguards. In addition, as a result of concerns about terrorist attacks against FBI targets, Title V would authorize an FBI police force as part of comprehensive security enhancements.  The FBI Career Security Program would bring the FBI into line with other U.S. intelligence agencies that have strong career security professional cadres whose skills and leadership are dedicated to the protection of agency information, personnel, and facilities. The challenges of espionage, information technology vulnerability, and the FBI's high profile as a target of terrorist attack require that the FBI match or exceed the best security programs in the intelligence and national security community. This can only be achieved by a fundamental change that reverses the tendency, found too often in civilian agencies, to treat security as a secondary mission and security assignments as obstacles to career advancement. Before the Hanssen case, an FBI Special Agent experienced as a criminal investigator might be assigned for a few years to a security position and then move on without building continuity of security expertise. Turnover in FBI security work was high, the top rank was Headquarters Section Chief.  Director Mueller has changed direction by creating a Assistant Director position to head a new Security Division and supporting the principle of a Security Career Program. I support this change. Title II of the FBI Reform Act provides the statutory mandate and tools to achieve this goal based on the experience of the Defense Department in reforming its acquisition career program. The key requirements are leadership and accountability in a Security Director, creation of security career program boards, designation of security positions, identification of security career paths requiring appropriate training and experience, and development of education programs for security professionals. To help ensure that security professionals gain stature comparable to Special Agents, the program would limit the preference for Special Agents in considering persons for security positions. FBI security managers would complete a security management course accredited by the Joint Security Training Consortium recently formed by the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense.  The FBI Counterintelligence Polygraph Program that would be established under Title III of the Act also addresses the security issue. Title III recognizes the security value of polygraph screening, but provides specific safeguards for those who may be subject to adverse action based on polygraph exams. Screening procedures must address the problems of ``false positive'' responses, limit adverse actions taken solely by reason of physiological reactions in an examination, ensure quality assurance and control, and allow subjects to have prompt access to unclassified reports on examinations that relate to adverse actions against them. Title III is based upon the simple conviction that increased security and protection of employee rights can and must coexist at the FBI.  Title IV of the Act provides long overdue statutory authorization for a permanent FBI Police force, to protect critical FBI facilities. It would provide the men and women who currently guard the highest risk targets with the same pay and benefits as members of the Uniformed Division of the United States Secret Service. Today the FBI police force operating under delegated authority from the General Services Administration has been unable to retain skilled personnel at a rate commensurate with the threat and the need for experienced leadership. The FBI Reform Act would bring the FBI police force generally into line not only with the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service, but also with the Capitol Police and the Supreme Court police. It is intended to be consistent with the current Memorandum of Agreement between the FBI and the Metropolitan Police Force of the District of Columbia with respect to FBI buildings and grounds covered in Washington, D.C..  The Attorney General has directed Deputy Attorney General Thompson to lead a management review of the FBI, while Director Mueller has already begun reorganizing the Bureau. Congress must participate in reviewing the FBI's structure and identifying its future priorities. The FBI is being called on today to protect the national security from terrorist and intelligence threats mounted from abroad. FBI investigations now extend overseas far more often because of our government's decision to use law enforcement as an instrument of national security along with diplomacy, military deployments, and intelligence operations. At the same time, it must continue with other uniquely Federal areas of enforcement. Title VI requires a set of reports that would enable Congress to engage the Executive branch in a constructive dialogue building a more effective FBI for the future.  To help Congress participate in charting the FBI's course, Title VI directs the Attorney General to submit a comprehensive report on the legal authorities for FBI programs and activities. In the late 1970s the Judiciary Committee considered enactment of a legislative charter for the FBI that would spell out its authorities and responsibilities. That proposal was set aside in 1980 despite determined efforts by then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Kennedy, Judge Webster and Attorney General Civiletti to reach agreement. The time is ripe to revive consideration of this effort.  In addition to a comprehensive charter, Congress should consider whether the FBI should continue to have responsibility for the broad range of investigations that it is currently expected to conduct. I believe we have gone too far in federalizing criminal law enforcement and that more responsibilities which are not uniquely federal can be transferred back to the states. In addition, even within the Federal law enforcement family, numerous agencies perform redundant functions. The Attorney General's report would recommend whether the FBI should continue to have all its current investigative responsibilities, whether existing legal authority for any FBI program or activity should be modified or repealed, and whether the FBI must or should have express statutory authority for new or existing programs or activities.  Title VI also recognizes that the task of modernizing FBI's information technology and management is as important as setting the FBI's future missions. Judiciary Committee oversight hearings have documented, and Director Mueller has acknowledged, that the FBI must overcome years of neglect in this regard. Congress is providing the funds, especially in the FY 2002 Counterterrorim Supplemental for technology assistance. We must ensure, however, that the FBI can and does use these funds effectively. There is concern that the FBI may need greater flexibility than is allowed under current law to procure new technologies. Congress also needs to see detailed plans as to how the FBI plans to update its information technology systems. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice and the FBI have not provided quarterly status reports on the principal FBI computer upgrade program, known as TRILOGY, as requested in the Appropriations act for FY 2001. Title VI directs the Attorney General to address these concerns in a comprehensive report on FBI information management and technology.  Finally, Title VI requires the Comptroller General to investigate and complete a report on how statistics are reported and used by Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI. Senator Grassley has focused attention on the question whether the FBI and other agencies may be double-counting criminal investigations and arrests in the reporting of accomplishments. We also need to ascertain whether the FBI and other agencies properly use the statistics which they compile in making management decisions. It is important to get the facts and recommendations that put the FBI into the context of the full spectrum of Federal law enforcement agencies. Title VI ensures that the GAO can complete this important task by requiring agencies to comply with its requests for the information that is necessary to assist in preparing this report.  The legislation which Senator Grassley and I introduce today is just one part of a bipartisan, hands-on approach to FBI reform. The committee plans additional oversight hearings to consider the Justice Department Inspector General's report on the belated production of documents in the Oklahoma City bombing case and the report of Judge Webster's Commission on the security lessons of the Robert Hanssen espionage case. The committee also intends to hear from Director Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Thompson on their response to these reports and on their actions and goals in reorganizing the FBI and charting its management course for the future.  At the same time, we are focusing oversight attention on key aspects of FBI and law enforcement performance in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks and the lessons learned for developing an effective counterterrorism and homeland security program. As contemplated by the sunset provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act, we must monitor the implementation of new surveillance and investigative powers provided to strengthen counterterrorism efforts and, in some provisions, law enforcement and counterintelligence generally.  The FBI Reform Act is designed to strengthen the FBI as an institution that has a unique role as both a law enforcement agency and a member of the intelligence community. As the Judiciary Committee continues its oversight work and more is learned about recent FBI performance, additional legislation may prove necessary. Especially important will be the lessons from the attacks of September 11, 2001, the anthrax attacks, and implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act and other counterterrorism measures. Strengthening the FBI cannot be accomplished overnight, but today, with the introduction of FBI Reform Act, we take an important step into the future.  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Grassley. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record along with the sectional analysis.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1974       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 602. REPORT ON FBI INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND                    TECHNOLOGY.       (a) In General.--Not later than December 31, 2002, the      Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report on the      information management and technology programs of the Federal      Bureau of Investigation including recommendations for any      legislation that may be necessary to enhance the      effectiveness of those programs.       (b) Contents of Report.--The report submitted under      subsection (a) shall provide--       (1) an analysis and evaluation of whether authority for      waiver of any provision of procurement law (including any      regulation implementing such a law) is necessary to      expeditiously and cost-effectively acquire information      technology to meet the unique need of the Federal Bureau of      Investigation to improve its investigative operations in      order to respond better to national law enforcement,      intelligence, and counterintelligence requirements;       (2) the results of the studies and audits conducted by the      Strategic Management Council and the Inspector General of the      Department of Justice to evaluate the information management      and technology programs of the Federal Bureau of      Investigation, including systems, policies, procedures,      practices, and operations; and       (3) a plan for improving the information management and      technology programs of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.       (c) Results.--The results provided under subsection (b)(2)      shall include an evaluation of--       (1) information technology procedures and practices      regarding procurement, training, and systems maintenance;       (2) record keeping policies, procedures, and practices of      the Federal Bureau of Investigation, focusing particularly on      how information is inputted, stored, managed, utilized, and      shared within the Federal Bureau of Investigation;       (3) how information in a given database is related or      compared to, or integrated with, information in other      technology databases within the Federal Bureau of      Investigation;       (4) the effectiveness of the existing information      technology infrastructure of the Federal Bureau of      Investigation in supporting and accomplishing the overall      mission of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;       (5) the management of information technology projects of      the Federal Bureau of Investigation, focusing on how the      Federal Bureau of Investigation--       (A) selects its information technology projects;       (B) ensures that projects under development deliver      benefits; and       (C) ensures that completed projects deliver the expected      results; and       (6) the security and access control techniques for      classified and sensitive but unclassified information systems      in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.       (d) Contents of Plan.--The plan provided under subsection      (b)(3) shall ensure that--       (1) appropriate key technology management positions in the      Federal Bureau of Investigation are filled by personnel with      experience in the commercial sector;       (2) access to the most sensitive information is audited in      such a manner that suspicious activity is subject to near      contemporaneous security review;       (3) critical information systems employ a public key      infrastructure to validate both users and recipients of      messages or records;       (4) security features are tested by the National Security      Agency to meet national information systems security      standards;       (5) all employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation      receive annual instruction in records and information      management policies and procedures relevant to their      positions;       (6) a reserve is established for research and development      to guide strategic information management and technology      investment decisions;       (7) unnecessary administrative requirements for software      purchases under $2,000,000 are eliminated;       (8) full consideration is given to contacting with an      expert technology partner to provide technical support for      the information technology procurement for the Federal Bureau      of Investigation;       (9) procedures are instituted to procure products and      services through contracts of other agencies, as necessary;      and       (10) a systems integration and test center, with the      participation of field personnel, tests each series of      information systems upgrades or application changes before      their operational deployment to confirm that they meet proper      requirements.     SEC. 603. GAO REPORT ON CRIME STATISTICS REPORTING.       (a) In General.--Not later than 9 months after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United      States shall submit to the Committees on the Judiciary of the      Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the issue      of how statistics are reported and used by Federal law      enforcement agencies.       (b) Contents.--The report submitted under subsection (a)      shall--       (1) identify the current regulations, procedures, internal      policies, or other conditions that allow the investigation or      arrest of an individual to be claimed or reported by more      than 1 Federal or State agency charged with law enforcement      responsibility;       (2) identify and examine the conditions that allow the      investigation or arrest of an individual to be claimed or      reported by the Offices of Inspectors General and any other      Federal agency charged with law enforcement responsibility;       (3) examine the statistics reported by Federal law      enforcement agencies, and document those instances in which      more than 1 agency, bureau, or office claimed or reported the      same investigation or arrest during the years 1998 through      2001;       (4) examine the issue of Federal agencies simultaneously      claiming arrest credit for in-custody situations that have      already occurred pursuant to a State or local agency arrest      situation during the years 1998 through 2001;       (5) examine the issue of how such statistics are used for      administrative and management purposes;       (6) set forth a comprehensive definition of the terms      ``investigation'' and ``arrest'' as those terms apply to      Federal agencies charged with law enforcement      responsibilities; and       (7) include recommendations, that when implemented, would      eliminate unwarranted and duplicative reporting of      investigation and arrest statistics by all Federal agencies      charged with law enforcement responsibilities.

TITLE VII--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS     SEC. 701. ALLOWING DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE                    SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE FOR 14 DAYS OR LESS.       Section 7542 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by      striking ``for more than 14 days''.                                  ____                  S. 1974--Section-by-Section Analysis                                title i       Title I of this bill provides for improved Department of      Justice and Congressional oversight of the FBI by ensuring      that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector      General, ``OIG'', is authorized to investigate allegations of      misconduct at the FBI and requiring a report to the Judiciary      Committees on how the OIG carries out this new authority.      This title is consistent with provisions in the DOJ      Authorization Act, S. 1319/H.R. 2215, which have passed the      Senate by unanimous consent.     Section 101. Authority of Department of Justice Inspector          General       This section would amend Section 8E of the Inspector      General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) to provide explicit      statutory authority for the OIG to investigate all      allegations of criminal or administrative misconduct by DOJ      employees, including FBI personnel. The OIG is also      authorized to refer certain matters to the FBI Office of      Professional Responsibility or to the internal affairs office      of the appropriate component of the Department. The Attorney      General is directed to promulgate regulations implementing      this OIG authority.       For many years, the FBI was excluded from OIG jurisdiction      and the FBI's own internal Office of Professional      Responsibility had sole authority to investigate FBI      personnel misconduct, unless the Attorney General made an      exception. The FBI's exclusive domain to investigate its own      misconduct was unique in the Department and created the      appearance of a conflict of interest. On July 11, 2001,      Attorney General Ashcroft issued a new rule expanding the      OIG's jurisdiction over the FBI. This section is consistent      with, and codifies, the Attorney General's new rule.     Section 102. Review of the Department of Justice       To ensure that the OIG has the necessary structure and      resources to effectively assume its new jurisdiction over the      FBI and that the Congress is fully informed of such needs,      this subsection requires the Inspector General to: 1. appoint      an official to help supervise and coordinate oversight      operations and programs of the FBI during the transition      period; 2. conduct a comprehensive study of the FBI and      report back to the Judiciary Committees with a plan for      auditing and evaluating various parts of FBI, including      information technology, and for effective continued OIG      oversight; and 3. report back to the Judiciary Committee on      whether an Inspector General for the FBI should be      established.                                title ii       This title of the bill amends Title 5, U.S.C. Sec. 2303, to      enhance the whistle blower protection provided to FBI      employees and protect them from retaliation.     Section 201. Providing whistle blower protection for FBI          employees       Section 2303 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to      expand the types of disclosures that trigger whistle blower      protections by protecting disclosures, which the employee      ``reasonably believes'' evidences misconduct, to the OIG, the      Congress, a supervisor of the employee, or the Special      Counsel (an office of the Merit Systems Protection Board,      ``MSPB'', provided for by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 1214). The amendment      would also ensure that the procedural protections of the      Administrative Procedure Act, including but not limited to 5      U.S.C. sections 554-57 and 701-706, would be followed in      cases where a complaint of retaliation was made by an FBI      employee. These procedural protections include, among other      things, an impartial decision maker and decision based on the      ``record'' of any proceedings without ex parte contacts and      judicial review as provided. Current laws and regulations      which allow for the protection of classified material would      also be available for such proceedings in appropriate      situations. The amendment, in new subsection (c), provides an      individual right of action as provided under Chapter 12 of      Title 5 before the MSPB. The amendment, in new subsection      (d), requires the Attorney General to prescribe regulations      to ensure that the title is enforced at the FBI.                               title iii       Title III requires the FBI to establish a career security      program to enhance the internal security of the FBI and      ensure that appropriate management tools and resources are      devoted to that task. Security professional career      development requirements would be modeled generally on the      statutory Department of Defense Acquisition Career Program.     Sections 301-305. Establishing and defining career security          program       Section 301 requires the Attorney General to establish      policies and procedures for career management of FBI security      personnel. Section 302 authorizes the Attorney General to      delegate to the FBI Director the Attorney General's duties      with respect to the FBI security workforce. Section 303      directs the FBI Director to appoint a Security Director, who,      under Section 304, would chair a security career program      board to advise in managing hiring, training, education, and      career development. Section 305 directs the FBI Director to      designate certain positions as security positions, with      responsibility for personnel security and access control,      information systems security, information assurance, physical      security, technical surveillance countermeasures,      operational, program and industrial security, and information      security and classification management.     Sections 306-309. Career development and training       Section 306 requires that career paths to senior positions      would be published. FBI Special Agents would not have      preference for a security position, and no positions would be      restricted to Special Agents unless the Attorney General      makes a special determination. All FBI personnel would have      the opportunity to acquire the education, training and      experience needed for senior security positions. The Attorney      General would ensure that policies are designed to select the      best qualified individuals, consistent with other applicable      law. Consideration would also be given to the need for a      balanced workforce.       Section 307 would direct that education, training, and      experience requirements would be established for each      position. Before assignment as manager or deputy manager of a     significant security program, a person would have to complete      a security program management course accredited by the Joint      DoD-Intelligence Security Training Consortium or determined      to be comparable by the Director, and have 6 years security      experience including 2 years in a similar program. Section      308 directs the Director, in consultation with the DCI and      Secretary of Defense, to establish education and training      programs for FBI security personnel that are, to the maximum      extent practical, uniform with Intelligence and DoD programs.      Section 309 sets forth the process for approval of      requirements set forth under section 307.                                title iv       This title would require the Attorney General to establish      an FBI Counterintelligence Polygraph Program for personnel in      exceptionally sensitive positions that reflects the results      of a pending National Academy of Sciences review of the      validity of the polygraph, within 6 months after publication      of that review. The regulations would be prescribed in      accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. A similar      requirement for the Department of Energy was passed in the      latest Defense Authorization Act.     Sections 401-404. Definitions, establishment of program,          regulations, report       Section 402 requires the establishment of a      counterintelligence screening polygraph program consisting of      periodic polygraph examinations of employees and contractors      with access to sensitive compartmented information, special      access program information, on restricted data. This program      shall be established within 6 months of the publication of      the results of the report of the Committee to Review the      Scientific Evidence on the Polygraph of the National Academy      of Sciences. Section 403 directs that the program have      procedures that address ``false positive'' results and ensure      quality assurance and control in accordance with guidance      from the DoD Polygraph Institute and the DCI. No adverse      personnel action could be taken solely by reason of      physiological reactions on an exam without further      investigation and personal decision by the Director.      Employees could have prompt access to unclassified reports on      their exams that relate to adverse personnel action. Section      404 requires a report within 9 months of the enactment of the      Act on any further legislative action appropriate in the      personnel security area.                                title v       This title provides statutory authorization for an already      existing FBI police force that protects FBI buildings and      adjacent streets. Currently, the FBI police suffers from a      high rate of turnover due to lower pay and fewer benefits      than the Uniformed Division of Secret Service or Capitol and      Supreme Court police. This title would close the disparity.     Sections 501-503. Definitions; establishment; authority of          metropolitan police       Section 501 defines the terms ``Director,'' ``FBI buildings      and grounds,'' and ``FBI police'' as used in the title.      Section 502 authorizes the FBI Director to establish the FBI      police, subject to the Attorney General's supervision, to      protect persons and property within FBI buildings and      grounds, including adjacent streets and sidewalks within 500      feet. FBI buildings and grounds would include any building      occupied by the FBI and subject to FBI supervision and      control, the land on which such building is situated, and      enclosed passageways connecting such buildings. FBI police      would be uniformed representatives of the FBI with authority      to make arrests and otherwise enforce federal and D.C. laws,      carry firearms, prevent breaches of the peace, suppress      unlawful affrays and unlawful assemblies, and hold the same      powers as sheriffs and constables. FBI police would not have      authority to serve civil process. Pay and benefits would be      equivalent to pay and benefits for the Secret Service      Uniformed Division. Section 503 provides that the authority      of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police would not be      affected by this title.                                title vi       This title requires two separate reports by the Attorney      General and one by the General Accounting Office.     Section 601. FBI authority and mission       Section 601 requires the Attorney General to submit a      report to Congress on the legal authority for FBI programs      and activities, identifying those that have express statutory      authority and those that do not. The FBI does not have a      statutory charter. One was proposed in 1979 but never      enacted. Many FBI functions including its national      intelligence and counterintelligence activities are      authorized by Executive order rather than by statute. This      section also requires the Attorney General to recommend the      criminal statutes for which the FBI should have investigative      responsibility, whether the authority for any FBI program or      activity should be modified or repealed, whether the FBI      should have express statutory authority for any program or      activity for which it does not currently have such authority,      and whether the FBI should have authority for any new program      or activity.     Section 602. FBI information management       Section 602 requires the Attorney General to submit a      report on FBI information management and technology,      including whether the authority is needed to waive normal      procurement regulations. The report would provide the results      of pending Justice Management Council studies and Inspector      General audits and submitting a 10-point plan for improving      FBI information management and technology to ensure that 1.      appropriate FBI technology management positions are filled by      personnel with commercial sector experience, 2. access to the      most sensitive information is audited so that suspicious      activity is subject to near contemporaneous review, 3.      critical information systems employ a public key      infrastructure, 4. security features are tested by the      National Security Agency, 5. FBI employees receive annual      instruction in records and information management, 6. a      research and development reserve is established, 7. undue      requirements for less costly software purchases are      eliminated, 8. contracting with an expert technology partner      is considered, 9. procedures are instituted to procure      through contracts of other agencies as necessary, and 10.      system upgrades are tested before operational deployment.     Section 603. GAO report on crime statistics reporting       Section 603 requires the General Accounting Office to      report on how crime statistics are reported and used by      Federal law enforcement agencies. Specifically, the report      would identify policies that allow a case to be claimed or      reported by more than one law enforcement agency, the      conditions that allow such reporting to occur, the number of      such cases reported during a 4-year period, similar multiple      claims of credit for arrests, the use of such statistics for      administrative and management purposes, and relevant      definitions. The report would include recommendations for how      to eliminate unwarranted and duplicative reporting. Federal      law enforcement agencies would be required to comply with GAO      requests for information necessary to prepare the report.                               title vii       This title would address the issue of the ``double      standard'' in the FBI, to prevent lower level employees from      being more harshly disciplined than senior FBI officials.      Section 7542 of title 5, United States Code, would be amended      to allow disciplinary suspensions of SES members for 14 days      or less, as is the case for other federal personnel. Current      law provides only for suspension ``for more than 14 days.''     Section 702. Allowing disciplinary suspensions of members of          the senior executive service for 14 days or less       This section would lift the minimum of 14 days suspension      that applies in the FBI's SES disciplinary cases and thereby      provide additional options for discipline in SES cases and      encourage equality of treatment. The current inflexibility of      disciplinary options applicable to SES officials was cited at      a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing in July, 2001,      as one underlying reason for the ``double standard'' in FBI      discipline. In effect, those deciding the discipline of SES      employees are often left with the choice of an overly harsh      penalty or no penalty at all--so they decide not to impose      any meaningful disciplinary action.
