Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I support the amendment as well, and I understand why Federal officials who are designating the amendment would feel a need for this. As long as it is optional and as long as it requires training and certification, I think that this is an appropriate thing, to empower those Federal officials designated who feel the need to carry a firearm to be able to do so.
