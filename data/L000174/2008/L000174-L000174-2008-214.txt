President, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I would note, in all these numbers, we Democrats have worked very hard to erase what was done by the Republicans when there was a Democratic President. They pocket filibustered over 60 of President Clinton's nominees. They let one go through--actually voted for him in committee, one of the most distinguished African-American jurists in this country. Then, in lockstep, every single Republican voted against him--a humiliation for him. He went on to become chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court.  We have not done that.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
