President, on vote Nos. 206 and 207, the confirmations of Sharon Gleason to be United States District Judge for the District of Alaska, and Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to be United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, I was unavoidably absent. Had I been present, I would have supported the nominations and voted yea on both.
