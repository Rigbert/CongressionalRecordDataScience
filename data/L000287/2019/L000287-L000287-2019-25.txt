Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank Mr. Kelly--my friend, my brother--for all of his help, all of his support. Working together, Democrats and Republicans, we can get some things done. It has been a pleasure to work with the gentleman on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer First Act is a bipartisan bill in both the House and the Senate. The bill will improve the Internal Revenue Service and help our taxpayers.  Again, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, for working with me on this bill. And he is a good friend. We have traveled together from Washington, D.C., to the heart of the Deep South with his grandson and several Members of Congress. Again, I want to thank him and ask him to tell his grandson I said hi.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a product of more than 14 hearings and a number of roundtables over the past 3 years in the Subcommittee on Oversight. It is a good and thoughtful policy. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Taxpayer First Act.  I want to thank all of the staff, each and every one of them, on both sides of the aisle, for helping us. Without their help and without their support, we would not be here. Again, I say thank you.  Mr. Speaker, again, I say thank you to my friend and my brother, Mr. Kelly, and I yield back the balance of my time.
