Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  The gentleman from West Virginia was giving a history lesson a moment ago. We passed ANWR on this House 10 times, never got out of the Democrat Senate side because of filibuster, and Bill Clinton vetoed it. And my candidate has sort of changed his mind with his new Vice Presidential candidate, who is going to be the next Vice President of the United States, who strongly supports drilling in ANWR.  I am convinced with her great personality and her knowledge, she will be able to convince him the right way, more than we do Mr. Obama.  I reserve the balance of my time.
