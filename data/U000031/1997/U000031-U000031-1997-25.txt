Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1411, the Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Modernization Act.  Much has been said about the able leadership of our chairman, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley], the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Barton], the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Bilirakis], and our friends on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell], the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Eshoo], and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Brown].  I would also like to comment on our terrific staff on both sides of the aisle. Howard Cohen, Eric Berger and Jane Williams on my staff spent countless hours walking Members through the myriad of different amendments and travails. It was terrific to see us come together in a great moment of bipartisan harmony and pass this legislation out of our full committee 43 to nothing.  This legislation embodies several basic goals that I believe all of us, patients and consumers, health professionals and drug device and food industries, and the Congress, all share. We want to ensure that patients and consumers continue to enjoy the benefits of innovations in treatments and technologies that bring us lifesaving and enhancing drugs and medical devices, with a safe, abundant healthful, affordable food supply.
