This change in the Defense authorization bill goes beyond a military decision. It goes to the fundamental questions of principles of our Constitution and our body of law. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe this matter should have been considered as well by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I believe Senator Feinstein has expressed the feeling that it should have been considered as well by the Senate Intelligence Committee.  I wish to use one example to ask the Senator from Colorado a question. When we had the so-called Underwear Bomber, the passenger on a commercial aircraft who tried to detonate a bomb--and thank God was unsuccessful--he was subdued, arrested, and interrogated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Detroit. After that investigation was underway--and he surrendered some information--he stopped talking, at which point the FBI investigators read him his Miranda rights.  Then later, working with his parents, he resumed talking to the investigators and literally--according to the FBI--gave a dramatic amount of information helpful to us in keeping America safe and stopping terrorism. He was then prosecuted in the criminal courts of America, article 3 courts, and ultimately, weeks ago, pled guilty.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator state his question.
