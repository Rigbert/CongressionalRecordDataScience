I know the Democratic leader is also aware that two of our colleagues came to the floor yesterday and asked for emergency consideration of measures to deal with this right now, things that could make a difference.  Senator Menendez of New Jersey came to the floor and asked that we have a tax holiday so that the money can be given back to consumers across America that is being charged them now at the pump.  Senator Cantwell of Washington came to the floor and asked for us to consider an antigouging amendment so we can say that if oil companies are found guilty of gouging, they will be asked to pay the price in the courts and through the regulatory agencies.  The Senator from Nevada realizes that despite the best efforts of our colleagues, both of them were ruled out of order. The obvious question is: If we can't consider those measures on this bill, how soon will the Republican leader of the Senate move to legislation that deals with this immediately? The idea that we will get to this in 2, 3, 4, 5 months is not acceptable where I live. Families I know and businesses I know cannot wait. They expect this Congress to respond.  I know the Senator from Nevada realizes within our caucus there will be many other proposals that might deal with this issue. Senator Nelson of Florida has come up with a proposal as well to deal with this issue. We had Senator Stabenow come to the floor. Why aren't we dealing with this on an emergency basis? It is truly an emergency across America when it comes to our economy.
