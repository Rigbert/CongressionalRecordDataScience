President, today I am introducing legislation with Senators Feinstein, Dodd, Wellstone, and Bingaman to include full-time public defense attorneys in the Federal Perkins Loan forgiveness program for law enforcement officers. This amendment will provide parity to public defense attorneys and uphold the goals set forth by the Supreme Court to equalize access to legal resources. Representative Tom Campbell of California will be introducing a similar bill in the House.  Under section 465(a)(2)(F) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, a borrower with a loan made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program is eligible to have the loan canceled for serving full-time as a law enforcement officer or corrections officer in a local, State, or Federal law enforcement or corrections agency. While the rules governing borrower eligibility for law enforcement cancellation have been interpreted by the Department of Education to include prosecuting attorneys, public defenders have been excluded from the loan forgiveness program. This policy must be amended.  Like prosecutors, public defense attorneys play an integral role in our adversarial process. This judicial process is the most effective means of getting at truth and rendering justice. The United States Supreme Court in a series of cases has recognized the importance of the right to counsel in implementing the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a fair trial and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause requiring counsel to be appointed for all persons accused of offenses in which there is a possibility of a jail term being imposed.  Absent adequate counsel for all parties, there is a danger that the outcome may be determined not by who has the most convincing case but by who has the most resources. The Court rightly addressed this possible miscarriage of justice by requiring counsel to be appointed for the accused. Public defenders fill this Court mandated role by representing the interests of criminally accused indigent persons. They give indigent defendants sufficient resources to present an adequate defense, so that the public goal of truth and justice will govern the outcome.  The Department of Education's interpretation of the statue to exclude public defenders from the loan forgiveness program undermines the goals set forth by the Supreme Court to equalize access to legal resources. It creates an obvious disparity of resources between public defenders and prosecutors by encouraging talented individuals to pursue public service as prosecutors but not as defenders. The criminal justice system works best when both sides are adequately represented. The public interest is served when indigent defendants have access to talented defenders. One of the ways to facilitate this goal is by granting loan cancellation benefits to defense attorneys.  Moreover, public defense attorneys meet all the eligibility requirements of the loan forgiveness program as set forth in current federal regulations. They belong to publicly funded public defender agencies and they are sworn officers of the court whose principal responsibilities are unique to the criminal justice system and are essential in the performance of the agencies' primary mission. In addition, like prosecuting attorneys, public defenders are law enforcement officers dedicated to upholding, protecting, and enforcing our laws. Without public defense attorneys, the adversarial process of our criminal justice system could not operate.  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bingaman, and Representative Campbell in supporting the goal of equalized access to legal resources, as set forth in the Constitution and elucidated by the Supreme Court, by providing parity to public defenders and allowing them to join prosecutors in receiving loan cancellation benefits.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2423       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN CANCELLATION FOR PUBLIC                    DEFENDERS.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Department of Education has issued clarifications      that prosecuting attorneys are among the class of law      enforcement officers eligible for benefits under the Federal      Perkins Loan cancellation program.       (2) Like prosecutors, public defenders also meet all the      eligibility requirements of the Federal Perkins Loan      cancellation program as set forth in Federal regulations.       (3) Public defenders are law enforcement officers who play      an integral role in our Nation's adversarial legal process.      Public defenders fill the Supreme Court mandated role      requiring that counsel be appointed for the accused, by      representing the interests of criminally accused indigent      persons.       (4) In order to encourage highly qualified attorneys to      serve as public defenders, public defenders should be      included with prosecutors among the class of law enforcement      officers eligible to receive benefits under the Federal      Perkins Loan cancellation program.       (b) Amendment.--Section 465(a)(2)(F) of the Higher      Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087ee(a)(2)(F)) is amended      by inserting ``, or as a full-time public defender for      service to local, State, or Federal governments (directly or      by a contract with a private, nonprofit organization)'' after      ``agencies''.       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section      shall apply to--       (1) loans made under this part, whether made before, on, or      after the date of enactment of this Act; and       (2) service as a public defender that is provided on or      after the date of enactment of this Act.       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be      construed to authorize the refunding of any repayment of a      loan.                                 ______                                       By
