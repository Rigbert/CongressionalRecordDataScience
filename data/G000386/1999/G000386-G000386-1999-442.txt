 President, I am joining my colleagues, Senators Conrad, Hatch, and Harkin in support of a concurrent resolution establishing the Sense of Congress regarding Medicare beneficiaries access to chiropractic services under the Medicare+Choice program. In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) which established the Medicare+Choice program. The BBA required that all benefits covered under traditional Medicare be guaranteed under Medicare+Choice. However, it has come to our attention that chiropractic coverage is not being ensured under the regulations.  Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries can go to a chiropractor for manual manipulation to the spine which is a covered benefit under Part B. Under the regulations for Medicare+Choice plans, this benefit is covered. However, access to chiropractors for this benefit is not guaranteed. Unfortunately, some Medicare+Choice plans have interpreted this omission to mean they no longer need to cover chiropractic services for this benefit, which is most commonly provided by chiropractors. The result is that beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice are losing access to chiropractic services, a situation clearly not intended by Congress.  The concurrent resolution I am cosponsoring today would clarify congressional intent regarding guaranteed coverage to chiropractic services under the Medicare+Choice program. Medicare beneficiaries should have the same benefits required by law under traditional fee-for-service as they do under Medicare+Choice. If beneficiaries can receive care for manual manipulation by a chiropractor under Part B, then they should have this same right under Medicare+Choice.  I urge you to join me and my colleagues in support of this resolution.                          ____________________
