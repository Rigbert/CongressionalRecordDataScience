Speaker, during the August recess, I had the good fortune to spend some time with members of our naval forces, specifically the officers and crews of the aircraft carrier, U.S.S. ``George Washington'' and the ballistic missile submarine, U.S.S. ``Maryland''. I was joined on the ``George Washington'' visit by Congressman Gil Gutknecht. Congressman Ben Cardin and I were together on the ``Maryland'' visit.  We were able to stay for an overnight on each vessel and observe the ship's personnel, as they went about their normal duties.  Mr. Speaker, it was a distinct pleasure and source of pride watching our Navy in action. You would truly be amazed at the amount of coordination and communication that is required to safely and effectively utilize all of their ship's warfighting capabilities. Yet, these crews carried out their duties with great skill, making it all look easy.  In the case of the U.S.S. ``George Washington'', the advertisements are correct and possibly even understated. At almost 1,100 feet long, 257 feet wide, 244 feet high, and capable of housing and feeding over 5,000 sailors and marines, she really is 4\1/2\ acres of sovereign territory.  A cornerstone of our national defense strategy, ``George'' can transport over 70 combat aircraft almost anywhere in the world.  Such an important capability becomes even more invaluable as budgets and politics dictate that we vacate our forward bases. It is easy to see why our Nation's aircraft carriers have played a major role in almost every world crisis. Their forward presence is invaluable to our national defense.  Much less apparent--by design, I might add--but certainly no less important in its role, is the U.S.S. ``Maryland'', a strategic ballistic missile submarine. The ``Maryland'' is over 560 feet long with a hull diameter of 42 feet. She carries a complement of approximately 157 officers and enlisted personnel. For armament, she has 24 missile tubes carrying the Trident II D-5 missile and 4 torpedo tubes capable of firing the Mark 48 antisubmarine torpedo.  As an undersea launching platform, the Maryland is virtually undetectable. Her state-of-the-art mobility, speed, and quietness makes her one of our most survivable and cost-effective strategic systems.  As you know, the Navy is a very important part of my southern Maryland constituency. The Fifth Congressional District is home to the Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River Naval Air Station and St. Inigoes. We also have the Indian Head Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center.  Pax River personnel are trained to develop and test a host of systems designed to enhance the safety and reliability of all naval aircraft. In addition, St. Inigoes develops communications and radar systems designed to provide the fleet with state-of-the-art eyes and ears.  Similarly, Indian Head is a leading developer of insensitive missile and gun propellants for the fleet. As a result of their efforts, sailors can literally sleep on their munitions without concern.  The research and development conducted at Pax River, St. Inigoes, and Indian Head is absolutely critical to our national defense. It is their creativity and support that contributes to the excellence of our Navy.  When you combine their know how with the quality of our sailors, you have an unbeatable combination.  As good as our hardware is, it still requires human intervention. I was extraordinarily impressed by the professionalism and the dedication of the naval personnel assigned to the George Washington and the Maryland. Their days are long and the work is demanding. In addition, they endure long absences from their families.  I witnessed two separate crews with vastly different assignments, but with the common goal of being the best in the world.  Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to have the opportunity to talk to the members of the crew. They are young, insightful, professional, and most of all, enthusiastic about their jobs and the Navy.  Their training is first rate and constantly updated. It gives them a confidence that is unmistakable and it shows in the way that they carry themselves. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the officers and crews of the George Washington and the Maryland and their families that provide so much inspiration and support. You are the best.  I would like to acknowledge the following naval personnel whose participation in my visits made them so memorable:  U.S.S. George Washington visit: RADM Tim Ziemer, Commander, Naval Base, Norfolk; RADM Mike Mullen, Commander, George Washington Battle Group; Capt. Lindell ``Yank'' Rutherford, Commanding Officer, U.S.S. George Washington; Capt. John ``Boomer'' Stuffelbeem, Commander, Carrier Air Wing One; Command Master Chief Kevin Lavin; and Lt. Steve West, House Navy Liaison Office.  U.S.S. Maryland visit: RADM Chuck Beers, Commander, Submarine Group Ten; Capt. Randy Zeller, Commanding Officer, Trident Refit Facility; Comdr. Scott Gray, Commanding Officer, U.S.S. Maryland; Lt. Comdr. Tim Luffy, Executive Officer, U.S.S. Maryland; Lt. Comdr. Travis Hayes, House Navy Liaison Office; and Sonar Technician Senior Chief Tom Tribble, Chief of the Boat, U.S.S. Maryland.  Mr. Speaker, we owe the men and women of our Navy the best of everything--the best training, the best equipment, and the best support. I can assure you that they will use it wisely.                          ____________________
