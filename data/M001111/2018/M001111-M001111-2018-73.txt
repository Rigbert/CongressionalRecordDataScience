 President, reserving the right to object, I want to take a moment to talk about how we got to this point and why I am hopeful that, despite the Republican leader's decision to once again scuttle bipartisan negotiations on health stabilization, we can return to the table and work together to do what patients and families want; that is, to strengthen healthcare and lower the premiums next year.  Chairman Alexander had said that in September every Democrat in the Senate was ready to pass the original Alexander-Murray legislation, and he is right. We wanted to work with Republicans to undo as much of President Trump's healthcare sabotage as possible because of how it is hurting families and forcing them to pay more for care. Unfortunately, Senator McConnell blocked our bipartisan agreement because he wanted to pressure his caucus into supporting yet another harmful Republican repeal bill. That TrumpCare bill failed, and I was again hopeful that after it did, we could make progress on our bipartisan legislation. Instead, Senate Republican leaders opted to do the exact opposite. They jammed through a terrible tax bill that actually raises families' premiums to pay for tax cuts for massive corporations. Even after that, I and Democrats were still at the table and ready to do what we could to stabilize markets and lower families' healthcare costs.  Imagine my frustration when, at the very last minute--just days ago--Republicans leaders once again made clear that they didn't want to lower families' premiums. They didn't want to stabilize a healthcare system that, as one House Republican said, they never supported anyway. Senate Republicans opted, instead, to surprise Democrats with a new, last-minute partisan proposal, the so-called stabilization bill, which included poison pills that Republicans knew Democrats would never agree to.  The partisan bill that Republicans surprised us with would undermine access to care for people with preexisting conditions by writing President Trump's junk plans rule into law and by taking away protections included in our original agreement with Chairman Alexander to make sure that the sickest patients don't find themselves in a dramatically more expensive market.  This partisan bill also pulled the most worn page out of the Republicans' ideological playbook--making extreme, political attacks on women's healthcare. This partisan bill would take huge steps beyond current law, making it so women can't even buy abortion coverage using their own money.  From the start of negotiations last fall, I made it abundantly clear I will not allow women's reproductive freedoms to become a political football in these conversations. I also made clear that I understood, like it or not, that current prohibitions on taxpayer funding for abortion services would apply to our agreement. But that is not what this is--not at all.  I think that was made pretty clear when Republicans surprised us with this last-minute change in a press release without inviting any Democrats to join. I believe, and I think most people would agree, that the massive expansion of restrictions on women's access to safe, legal abortion we see in this partisan bill has nothing to do with lowering families' premiums or making healthcare work better in our country. That is not something that was in our original deal that had bipartisan support, and it is not something that should be in this bill now.  I am extremely disappointed that we have reached this point, but it does not mean I am giving up on getting this done. I know many Republicans have said that this is the end of the road for bipartisan negotiations on healthcare, but it is only if they choose that route.  Today I am laying out what I hope Republicans and Democrats will ultimately be able to agree on. This is legislation that includes current law prohibitions on taxpayer funding for abortion--what Senate Democrats and Republicans agreed was acceptable months ago. It would take strong steps to lower premiums and make healthcare more affordable for patients. It would hold protections for people with preexisting conditions, as so many Republicans and Democrats have said we need to do.  We are frustratingly close to an agreement, and I still do believe we can get there. This shouldn't be about the blame game. It should not be about pointing fingers. This has to be about getting results.  I hope Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting the amendment I am offering today, and even if they don't, I hope we can get back to the table and resume talks. I truly believe there are Republicans who want to do the right thing for patients and families, even if their leadership is determined to avoid a real debate and vote on the so-called ObamaCare bailout. Our work last fall showed that we can reach an agreement when we put aside partisan politics and focus on what is best for our families. I am ready to get back to work to get that done.  I object to the pending unanimous consent request.                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1625  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds to the consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 1625, the omnibus appropriations bill, the Murray amendment that is now at the desk be considered and agreed to.
