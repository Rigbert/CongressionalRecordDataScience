President, I rise today to introduce the Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 2005. Last year the State of New York enacted a bold new law. As of June 2004, all cigarettes sold in the State are tested for fire safety and required to self-extinguish.  Nationwide the statistics regarding cigarette-related fires are startling. Cigarette-ignited fires account for an estimated 140,800 fires in the United States, representing the most common ignition source for fatal home fires and causing 30 percent of the fire deaths in the United States. Such fires cause more than 900 deaths and 2,400 injuries every year. Annually, more than $400 million in property damage is reported due to a fire caused by a cigarette. According to the National Fire Protection Association, one out of every four fire deaths in the United States are attributed to tobacco products--by far the leading cause of fatal home fires in the United States. Overall, the Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that the cost of the loss of human life and personal property from not having a fire-safe cigarette standard is approximately $4.6 billion per year.  In my State of Illinois, cigarette-related fires have also caused too many senseless tragedies. In 1998 alone, the most recent year for which we have data, there were more than 1,700 cigarette-related fires, of which more than 900 were in people's homes. These fires led to 109 injuries and 8 deaths.  Tobacco companies spend billions on marketing and learning how to make cigarettes appealing to kids. It is not unreasonable to ask those same companies to invest in safer cigarette paper to make their products less likely to bum down a house. As of today cigarettes are designed to continue burning when left unattended. A common scenario is the delayed ignition of a sofa or mattress by a lit cigarette dropped by a smoker.  The Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 2005 requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a fire safety standard, specified in the legislation, for cigarettes. The CPSC would also have the authority to regulate the ignition propensity of cigarette paper for roll-your-own tobacco products. The Act gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission authority over cigarettes only for purposes of implementing and enforcing compliance with this Act and with the standard promulgated under the Act. It also allows states to pass more stringent fire-safety standards for cigarettes.  Two decades ago Joe Moakley set out to ensure that the tragic cigarette-caused fire that killed five children and their parents in Westwood, MA was not repeated. He introduced three bills, two of which passed. One commissioned a study that concluded it was technically feasible to produce a cigarette with a reduced propensity to start fires. The second required that the National Institute of Standards and Technology develop a test method for cigarette fire safety, and the last and final bill, the Fire-Safe Cigarette Act of 1999, mandates that the Consumer Product Safety Commission use this knowledge to regulate cigarettes with regard to fire safety.  Today I respectfully introduce this bill to bring fire-safe standards to all cigarettes sold in this country. I hope that the Commerce Committee will consider this legislation very soon and that my Colleagues will join me in supporting this effort. Now that New York serves as an example of success, it is time to establish a national standard to ensure that our Nation's children, elderly and families are protected.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 389       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Cigarette Fire Safety Act of      2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Cigarette ignited fires are the leading cause of fire      deaths in the United States.       (2) In 1999 there were 807 deaths from cigarette ignited      fires, 2,193 civilian injuries from such fires, and      $559,100,000 in property damage caused by such fires.       (3) Nearly 100 children are killed each year from cigarette      related fires.       (4) For over 20 years former Member of Congress Joseph      Moakley worked on behalf of burn victims, firefighters, and      every individual who has lost a loved one in a fire. By      securing enactment of the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 and      the Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990, Joseph Moakley completed      the necessary technical work for a cigarette fire safety      standard and paved the way for a national standard.       (5) It is appropriate for the Congress to require by law      the establishment of a cigarette fire safety standard for the      manufacture and importation of cigarettes.       (6) A recent study by the Consumer Product Safety      Commission found that the cost of the loss of human life and      personal property from not having a cigarette fire safety      standard is $4,600,000,000 per year.       (7) It is appropriate that the regulatory expertise of the      Consumer Product Safety Commission be used to implement a      cigarette fire safety standard.     SEC. 3. CIGARETTE FIRE SAFETY STANDARD.       (a) In General.--       (1) Requirement for standard.--Not later than 18 months      after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission      shall, by rule, prescribe one or more fire safety standards      for cigarettes that, except as provided in this Act, are      substantively the same as the standards set forth by the      State of New York in Part 429 of Title 18 of the Official      Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of      New York, as promulgated on December 31, 2003 (in this Act      referred to as the ``New York standard''), including the      Appendix to such Part.       (2) Cigarettes with unique characteristics.--In adapting      section 4(c) of such Part 429, if the Commission determines      that a cigarette, because of its unique or nontraditional      characteristics, cannot be tested in accordance with the test      method prescribed by the Commission, the manufacturer of such      cigarette may propose a test method and performance standard      for such cigarette. If the Commission finds the proposed      method and standard to be equivalent to the test method and      performance standard otherwise established by the Commission,      the Commission may approve the method and standard and the      manufacturer of such cigarette may employ such test method      and performance standard to certify the cigarette pursuant to      rules prescribed by this Act.       (3) Commission.--In this Act, the term ``Commission'' means      the Consumer Product Safety Commission.       (b) Procedure.--       (1) In general.--The rule under subsection (a), and any      modification thereof, shall be prescribed in accordance with      section 553 of title 5, United States Code.       (2) Modifications.--       (A) Modification by sponsor.--If the sponsor of the testing      methodology used under subsection (a)(2) modifies the testing      methodology in any material respect, the sponsor shall notify      the Commission of the modification, and the Commission may      incorporate the modification in the rule prescribed under      subsection (a) if the Commission determines that the      modification will enhance a fire safety standard established      under subsection (a)(2).       (B) Modification by commission.--The Commission may modify      the rule prescribed under subsection (a), including the test      requirements specified in subsection (a)(2), in whole or in      part, only if the Commission determines that compliance with      such modification is technically feasible and will enhance a      fire safety standard established under that subsection. Any      such modification shall not take effect earlier than 3 years      after the date on which the rule is first issued.       (3) Inapplicability of certain laws.--       (A) In general.--No Federal law or Executive order,      including the laws listed in subparagraph (B) but not      including chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 of title 5, United States      Code, commonly referred to as the Administrative Procedures      Act, may be construed to apply to the promulgation of the      rule required by subsection (a), or a modification of the      rule under paragraph (2) of this subsection.       (B) Included laws.--The Federal laws referred to in      subparagraph (A) include the following:       (i) The Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et      seq.).

(c) Effective Date.--The Commission shall specify in the      rule prescribed under subsection (a) the effective date of      the rule. The effective date may not be later than 24 months      after the date of the enactment of this Act.       (d) Treatment of Standard.--       (1) In general.--The fire safety standard promulgated under      subsection (a) shall be treated as a consumer product safety      standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act      (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.), except as provided in section 4.       (2) Treatment of cigarettes.--A cigarette shall be treated      as a consumer product under section 3(a)(1)(B) of the      Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(1)(B)) for      purposes of this Act and for purposes of sections 17 and 18      of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2066, 2067).
