Slaughter, and I thank her for the work that she's doing and has been doing over the years as our representative and leader on the Rules Committee.  I also want to congratulate my friend, Mr. Sessions, on attaining the chairmanship of the Rules Committee, an extraordinarily important committee that sets the parameters for debate and consideration of legislation on the floor of this House. I also want to thank him for his discussions with me, his willingness to work together, and I'm looking forward to a positive relationship as we try to make sure that we consider legislation on this floor, giving everybody on both sides of the aisle the opportunity to make their case.                              {time}  1520  I also want to thank the gentleman. He explained that we are effecting the rules, but I want to thank the Rules Committee--I want to thank the chairman in particular--and, frankly, the Speaker and the leadership for making changes prospectively so that existing individuals are not adversely affected, and I thank the chairman.  Having said that, let me say that I am disappointed, though, that the majority is calling up a rules package that again embraces what I believe to be a partisan budget, which, obviously, there is significant disagreement about, and rejects efforts to compromise toward restoring, in my view, fiscal stability in our country. Despite bipartisan agreement in the Budget Control Act, the continuing resolution and, just this week, on the fiscal cliff, this rules package returns to the partisan stance that Republicans brought to the last Congress on fiscal issues and particularly on the budget.  It deems the amounts in the Ryan budget to be the default funding levels this year, levels well below this week's compromised agreement. We saw that in the last budget process as well. We made an agreement, and lo and behold, the budget came out with numbers substantially below that agreement.
