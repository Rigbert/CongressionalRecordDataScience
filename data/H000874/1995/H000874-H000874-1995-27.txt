Speaker, the American public must be very perplexed. In addition, of course, we know that they are very angry and, very frankly, a number of us that sit in this body are very angry.  We began this session with the election of a new leadership. Speaker Gingrich annoiunced a new order, an order committed to revolutionary change. We have had, to some degree, a revolution. It is not, as so many revolutions are, not a pretty thing to watch.  The Contract With America, which was the plan of this so-called revolution, talked about, in two of its first three items, responsibility, personal responsibility, and fiscal responsibility. Personal responsibility was urged on all Americans to do that which would make their lives better and, consequently, the lives of their families and their communities and their State and Nation better and more productive, more successful.  We have been debating that contract for the last 11 months, and very frankly it has not gone very far. One of the reasons it has not gone very far is because the Republicans in the Senate could not agree with the Republicans in the House. Frankly, the Democrats have not been able to defeat or pass much on their own. We understand that, we are in the minority.  Now we come to funding Government. Personal responsibility would say that each and every one of us ought to share the most efficient and effective operations of the people's Government; reduce it, change it, eliminate some activities, do all of that, but ensure that those activities that we support operate in an efficient and effective manner. The Republican leadership has failed miserably in that effort. Because of Democrats? No. In the first instance, when this fiscal year ended September 30, the Republican leadership had failed to pass any appropriations bills to fund Government. Not 1 of the 13.  My colleague points out that perhaps we passed the legislative bill prior to the first of October, and that was, of course, vetoed because the President thought it unseemly that we take care of ourselves first before we took care of other people's business, and he made a good point.  The Republicans passed a short-term CR that expired, and they had yet to pass the appropriation bills that the President would sign and, indeed, as of today have seven bills that have yet to be passed into law.  Now, ladies and gentleman, we have come to a point where the President, President Clinton, the majority leader Bob Dole, and the Speaker, Newt Gingrich, sat down together at the White House last night and said, ``As reasonable people, let us work this out,'' and the reports I received this morning were that the Speaker thought that was a positive meeting. Senator Dole, the majority leader, thought that was a reasonable meeting. The President of the United States thought that that was a positive, productive meeting, and the three leaders came out and said, ``We think we have a construct to move forward.''  And then what happened? The Republican freshmen apparently thought that was not enough. The Republican freshmen want a guarantee that the President would agree to certain things that he believes are not in the best interests of this country, cutting Medicare deeply, cutting Medicaid deeply, cutting education for young people, which he believes, and I share his views is an investment in the future of America, undermining programs that protect our environment.  In point of fact, in the last legislation we passed to keep Government working, both parties agreed that that would be part of it. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the freshmen Republicans have demanded that Government shut down until the President gives up.  That is not right.                          ____________________
