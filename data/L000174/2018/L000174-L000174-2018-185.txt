 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 8, 2018]                 It's on Republicans To Stop a Shutdown                          (By Bernie Sanders)       I do not know why President Trump and the Republican      Party--which controls the White House, the Senate and the      House--are so willing to shut down the government. Maybe they      think it will be good for them politically. Maybe they      believe the chaos created by a government shutdown would be a      welcome distraction from the ongoing Russia investigation      being conducted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.      Whatever the motives of the Republican leadership, one thing      is clear: A government shutdown would be disastrous for the      American people.       A shutdown would harm tens of millions of working-class      families who would be unable to access vital services. It      would disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal      employees who would not receive the paychecks they expected.      It would endanger members of the U.S. military who are      putting their lives on the line defending our nation.       Congress has a responsibility to the American people to      prevent a shutdown and work in a bipartisan manner to reach a      fair budget agreement that addresses the very serious      problems facing the working people of our country.       Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-     Ky.) ratcheted up threats of a government shutdown last week      by insisting on ending the long-standing, bipartisan      agreement over parity for defense and non-defense spending.      This principle of parity is enormously important for working      families and is something that cannot be terminated. If we do      not act, funding for education, child care, health care,      nutrition assistance, affordable housing and other important      domestic programs will be at a 40-year low as a percentage of      our economy.       As the middle class continues to shrink, cuts to non-     defense spending would cause even worse economic pain to      working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the      most vulnerable. Meanwhile, as Trump and the Republicans      demand an unbelievable $100 billion increase in military      spending over the next two years, the Defense Department has      been inoculated from budget cuts over the past several years      because of the Overseas Contingency Operations loophole--a      special account not subject to spending caps established by      Congress in 2011.       Providing parity in these budget negotiations means, among      other things, fully funding--without offsets--the Children's      Health Insurance Program for 9 million kids and community      health centers for 27 million Americans. It means increased      funding for the Social Security Administration and the      Veterans Administration so they can provide guaranteed      benefits to seniors and veterans who have earned them. It      means keeping our obligations to more than 1.5 million      workers and retirees who are about to lose a large part of      the pensions they were promised. It means addressing the      crisis of student debt, expanding child care, improving our      crumbling infrastructure in rural America and protecting our      national parks. It means providing help in the national      struggle against opioid and heroin addiction.       Furthermore, as part of the budget negotiations, we must      also provide adequate disaster relief to Texas, Florida,      Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as assistance to      the Western states recovering from terrible wildfires.       Finally, Trump added even more fuel to the fire when he      decided to use 800,000 ``dreamers'' as a bargaining chip for      an $18 billion wall that the overwhelming majority of      Americans do not want. These dreamers are young people who      have lived in this country for almost their entire lives.      They go to school. They work. They serve in the U.S.      military. The United States is their home; they know no      other. For Trump and the Republican leadership to allow their      legal status to expire, and to subject them to deportation,      would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history.      It must not be allowed to happen.       This is not just my viewpoint. It's what the American      people want. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that      77 percent of the American people, including a large majority      of Republicans, support providing legal protections for the      dreamers. The Republican Congress must act. A clean Dream Act      must be signed into law as part of any budget agreement.       The American people are increasingly disgusted with a      government that protects the interests of the wealthy and the      powerful, while ignoring the needs of the vulnerable. The      U.S. government must do more than provide huge tax breaks to      billionaires, callously deport young people, greatly expand      military spending, end net neutrality, deny the reality of      climate change and threaten to cut Social Security, Medicare,      Medicaid, education and nutrition programs. We must pass a      budget agreement that addresses the needs of Americans and      not just billionaire campaign contributors.
