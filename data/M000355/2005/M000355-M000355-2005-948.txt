 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:45 a.m., Tuesday, July 12. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then resume consideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party luncheons.
