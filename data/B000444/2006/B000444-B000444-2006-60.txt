 President, today I am introducing a resolution along with my colleague Senator DeWine urging the President to take immediate action to avert a looming tragedy in Darfur, Sudan. The government of Sudan has launched an all-out military offensive in Darfur that could result in hundreds of thousands of additional deaths. The United States must lead the international community to save those lives. It is urgent that we act.  How did we arrive at such a situation? And what must we do to stop it?  Over the past two years the situation in Sudan has remained dire. As many as 400,000 people may be dead. Two million people have been displaced from their homes, over 200,000 are refugees in Chad, and three million rely on international aid. Those numbers haven't diminished over time, they have gotten worse. And now, they may be on the brink of becoming even more catastrophic.  In May of this year, the government of Sudan and rebels in Darfur--specifically the Minni Minnawi faction of the Sudan Liberation Army, SLA,--signed a peace agreement. Rather than improving the security situation, the Darfur Peace Agreement has made things worse. The agreement never had the support of the entire SLA, or the other major rebel movement in Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement. Nor did it have the support of people living in displaced camps in Darfur. In the days and weeks after news of the agreement spread, violence in camps increased either because people misunderstood what was in the agreement, or they felt the agreement was flawed. And violence on the ground became worse, as the rebel factions split and fighting erupted between those who had signed the Darfur Peace Agreement and those who had not.  Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in fighting since May--fifty thousand in the last two months alone. Many of them have taken refuge in camps for the internally displaced. Attacks on humanitarian aid convoys have increased by a factor of more than ten compared to this time last year. Twelve humanitarian workers have been killed in the past four months--more than during the previous year. Two hundred internally displaced women have been raped and another two hundred violently assaulted in over the course of the past five weeks.  The United Nations, after months of delay, finally extended the mandate of the U.N. Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) to Darfur at the end of August. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1706 authorizes the deployment of over 17,000 peace keepers and 3000 civilian police to Darfur. Regrettably, however, the government of Sudan has rejected the deployment of the U.N. force, instead launching a military offensive in Darfur. African Union officials have stated that they will not extend the mission in Sudan past the end of this month. And even if the aforementioned impediments did not exist, it would be months before a U.N. mission could fully deploy.  Just to make absolutely sure a peacekeeping force is never deployed, the government of Khartoum has gone on the offensive. If it scorches enough earth--and people--there will be no need for the peacekeeping force because there will be no one left to protect and no peace to keep.  We are at a pivotal moment. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are in camps, vulnerable to aerial and ground attacks from government forces. We cannot stand by and do nothing.  This resolution is straightforward. It calls on the President to undertake three key actions, some of which the Senate has asked him to do before: First, it once again calls on him to pursue the imposition of a no-fly zone through the U.N., NATO or NATO allies. The Senate asked the President to propose that NATO consider how to implement and enforce such a no-fly zone in March of this year. If anything, the need to enforce a no-fly zone has increased.  Second, it asks that the President secure the necessary support from United Nations member states to schedule a special session on Sudan in the United Nations Human Rights Council. The international community must speak out on the atrocities which continue to unfold in Sudan--and it must act.  Third, it asks the President to appoint a Special Envoy to Sudan to head the office that Senator DeWine and Iestablished at the State Department through a provision in the supplemental appropriations bill that was signed into law in June. The administration has avoided doing so for years, and our diplomatic efforts have suffered as a result.  I'm under no illusion that these actions alone will stop the Sudanese government. The international community must put a credible force on the ground as soon as possible. NATO should be prepared to help the AMIS hand-off to the United Nations. It is imperative that the President pick up the phone and talk to our NATO allies about how to do that. He should also call the president of the African Union and the U.N. Secretary General about going to Khartoum to talk to President Bashir about his government's rejection of the U.N. Security Council resolution. And the Secretary of State must get involved in diplomatic efforts to convince the Sudanese to cooperate with the implementation of Security Council resolution. I understand that Assistant Secretary of State Frazer was sent to Khartoum over the Labor Day weekend. She met with President Bashir, but according to all reports, the meeting did not result in any change in Khartoum's posture towards the deployment of U.N. troops. I applaud the administration for sending Dr. Frazer. But with all due respect I think we need to be engaged at higher levels.  It has been 12 years since the international community watched nearly a million people get killed in Rwanda, and 11 years since the world stood by as the massacres in Srebrenica occurred. Since then, President Clinton took decisive action to stop ethnic cleansing act in Bosnia, and then in Kosovo. Both missions were controversial--even unpopular. But the cost of inaction was too high. The cost of inaction in Darfur is too high as well.                          ____________________
