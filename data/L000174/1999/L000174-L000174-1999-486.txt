President, there has been a good debate here by the Senators from Missouri, Iowa, Vermont, Tennessee, and others who have spoken about this. I know these are extremely important amendments, especially to the primary sponsors, and the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Missouri, and the others.  My perspective is that as ranking member and floor manager on this side of the bill, I look at a whole lot of amendments. At one time, we had a couple hundred amendments. We whittled those down. Dozens of Senators on both sides of the aisle have agreed to withhold their amendments. I spent the weekend talking with Senators, asking them to withhold their amendments. And they did. Others we were able to get in a managers' agreement, a managers' package, something I am still waiting to hear back on from the other side. I assume we will get that. Many Senators on both sides will see the bulk of their amendments in the managers' package. But at some point we have to go on.  I suggest, for whatever it is worth, whatever is done, whatever is passed, whether it is the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, or whether it is the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, this issue will be in conference.
