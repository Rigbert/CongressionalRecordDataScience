President, today I introduce the Immunization Improvement Act of 2009. The recent outbreak of H1N1 influenza makes this legislation timelier than ever before. While a vaccine has not yet been developed to protect us against this flu strain, one is currently in the works. This outbreak is a reminder of the important role that immunizations provide in protecting us against harmful or even deadly viruses, like the measles, polio, and seasonal human influenza.  Vaccinations have been proven to be clinically effective in improving health, and providing population-based immunity. Routine childhood immunizations, for example, prevent over 14 million individual cases of disease and over 33,500 deaths over the lifetime of children born in any given year.  However, significant and persistent gaps in public and private health insurance coverage of immunizations remain. Approximately 11 percent of young children and 21 percent of adolescents are underinsured for immunizations. Nearly 2/3 of adults are underinsured for immunizations--17 percent are uninsured. Each year, vaccine-preventable diseases cause the deaths of more than 42,000 people and hundreds of thousands of cases of illness.  Congress will soon embark upon meaningful health care reform. This debate will provide the opportunity for us to eliminate the obstacles--lack of insurance and high cost-sharing--to accessing routine immunizations. We must shift to a system that will make routine preventive care, like immunizations, affordable.  In fact, it is in the best interest of Government and society to ensure coverage of routine vaccinations, as these preventive vaccinations currently result in an annual cost savings of $10 billion in direct medical costs and over $40 billion in indirect societal costs.Expanding immunization coverage will enhance these savings over the long term.  The Immunization Improvement Act would remove barriers to immunization. First, it would enable states to access routine vaccinations for adults at a discount negotiated by the Federal Government. Currently, 36 States and New York City are able to buy vaccines using the Federal discount, but these contracts are about to expire. The Immunization Improvement Act would ensure that states can continue to purchase adult vaccines under CDC contracts. It would also provide for Medicaid coverage of adult immunizations that are recommended for routine use and prohibit any cost-sharing for them.  There are a host of routinely recommended vaccinations for the Medicare population, as well. Unfortunately, Medicare Part B only covers influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis B vaccines. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for additional vaccines that are covered by Part D, but few of these vaccines are covered by prescription drug plans. Moreover, physicians have difficulties billing plans for the incurred costs. As such, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, has recommended that all immunizations recommended for routine use among the Medicare population be covered under Part B. The Immunization Improvement Act would codify that recommendation.  Inadequate reimbursement for administering immunizations also prevents children, adolescents, and adults from receiving necessary vaccinations. According to the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and CDC should review and update the maximum allowable fees for administering routine vaccinations, and publish and update the actual fees for vaccination administration paid by each State--in an effort to encourage consistency across state lines. This legislation would also reimburse providers for administering vaccines to children who are eligible for vaccination through the Vaccines for Children program, but not Medicaid. This would enable both uninsured and underinsured children to become vaccinated in an effort to get all children vaccinated.  Finally, as we look to reform our health care system, we must also hold private health insurers accountable for covering vaccinations recommended for routine use--without any cost-sharing. The Immunization Improvement Act would require this coverage upon the enactment of health reform.  Given the current circumstances, it is evident that vaccinations can and truly do eradicate the spread of preventable diseases. However, we must do more to ensure comprehensive coverage of immunizations. It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1003       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the      ``Immunization Improvement Act of 2009''.       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act      is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.Sec. 2. Findings.Sec. 3. State authority to purchase recommended vaccines for adults.Sec. 4. Demonstration program to improve immunization coverage.Sec. 5. Reauthorization of immunization program.Sec. 6.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Immunizations recommended for routine use have been      proven to be clinically effective in improving health and      preventing the spread of disease. Routine childhood      immunizations prevent over 14,000,000 cases of disease and      over 33,500 deaths over the lifetime of children born in any      given year. In addition to protecting individuals from      disease, immunization provides population-based (herd)      immunity.       (2) An economic evaluation of the impact of seven vaccines      routinely given as part of the childhood immunization      schedule found that the vaccines are cost-effective. Over the      lifetime of children born in any given year, these      immunizations result in an annual cost savings of      $10,000,000,000 in direct medical costs and over      $40,000,000,000 in indirect societal costs.       (3) There are significant and persistent gaps in public and      private health insurance coverage of immunizations. About 11      percent of young children and 21 percent of adolescents are      underinsured for immunizations. Among adults, 59 percent are      underinsured and 17 percent are completely uninsured for      immunizations. According to the Institute of Medicine, even      those with insurance increasingly have to pay higher      deductibles and copayments for immunizations.       (4) Each year, vaccine-preventable diseases cause the      deaths of more than 42,000 people and hundreds of thousands      cases of illness.       (5) In 2003, the Institute of Medicine's Committee on the      Evaluation of Vaccine Purchase Financing made the following      conclusions:       (A) Current public and private financing strategies for      immunization have had substantial success, especially in      improving immunization rates for young children. However,      significant disparities remain in assuring access to      recommended vaccines across geographic and demographic      populations.       (B) Many young children, adolescents, and high-risk adults      have no or limited insurance for recommended vaccines. Gaps      and fragmentation in insurance benefits create barriers for      both vulnerable populations and clinicians that can      contribute to lower immunization rates.     SEC. 3. STATE AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE RECOMMENDED VACCINES FOR                    ADULTS.
