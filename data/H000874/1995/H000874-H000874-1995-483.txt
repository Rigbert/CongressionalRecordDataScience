This substitute is a reasonable and commonsense reform of the Clean Water Act.  Clearly, the present Clean Water Act needs to be reformed. As the reauthorization debate began there were several different approaches to how to best protect our Nation's lakes, streams, estuaries, and coastal waters.  This substitute will provide relief to farmers, industry, and individual landowners from costly and time-consuming mandates. It will also, however, continue many of the programs and provisions which have made the Clean Water Act one of our Nation's most effective environmental statutes.  The Chesapeake Bay, much of which borders my district, is the largest and most productive estuary in North America. Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania experienced first-hand the bay's low point in the mid-1970's.  The habitat, especially the blue crab population, water quality, and the overall economy of the Bay were at an all time low.  Mr. Chairman, thanks to the Clean Water Act, the Bay and its industries made a remarkable comeback. The Chesapeake Bay Program, in conjunction with the Clean Water Act requirements, led the Bay's restoration.  Today, watermen in my district in southern Maryland, earn a living on the Chesapeake Bay. Previously, we have been up to the task of restoring the Bay and protecting their livelihood, and today their families are relying on us to continue our efforts.  I am pleased that the substitute provides funding for this successful partnership between State, local, and Federal Governments.  The substitute also continues the Coastal Zone Management Program which was initiated to implement coastal nonpoint pollution and control programs.  Nonpoint source pollution today provides us with our greatest environmental challenge, as it is the most difficult to detect and control.  Over 10,000 beaches were closed in the last 5 years due to pollution. Sixteen counties, in my home State of Maryland, make up the coastal zone, well over 65 percent of the State.  This substitute recognizes that our Nation's $400 billion a year travel and tourism industry and $55 billion a year fishing industry are directly reliant upon our coasts and continues our commitment to the Coastal Zone Program.  One of the more controversial aspects of clean water reauthorization has been wetlands reform. Clearly, the Federal Government must continue its commitment and environmental obligations to protect our Nations wetlands.  At the same time, however, wetlands policies have resulted in substantial burdens on our Nations farmers, industry, and individual landowners.  The substitute simplifies and expedites the wetlands permitting process by implementing a plan submitted by the National Governor's Association.  The NGA approached Congressman Boehlert in March with their proposal, as they deemed the provisions on wetlands contained in H.R. 961 to be inconsistent with the recommendations of the Nation's Governors.  This proposal will give more authority on wetlands management to the States where action can be more accurate, appropriate, and prompt. It will also make many needed administrative and regulatory changes in the way the system is run.  Mr. Chairman, most Members of this body agree that there are administrative and regulatory problems with the Clean Water Act.  However, the same percentage of Members would also agree about its importance and environmental successes.  This substitute will continue to provide environmental safeguards and promote programs to continue pollution cleanup and prevention well into the 21st century, while also providing regulatory relief to farmers, landowners, and industry.  I urge support for the Boehlert-Saxton-Roemer substitute and support smart, environmentally sound, commonsense reform to the Clean Water Act.  Mr. Chairman, I insert the following correspondence for the Record:                               National Governors Association,                                                   March 28, 1995.     Hon. Sherwood Boehlert,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,          U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We have been greatly encouraged by your      willingness, as well as that of Rep. Shuster and others in      the bipartisan group, to include states in the development of      H.R. 961. We support the intent of that bill to provide      substantially greater flexibility to states and local      governments in our efforts to protect water quality. We      support the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee in      its efforts to expeditiously move this comprehensive      legislation reforming the Clean Water Act.       We have not yet completed our review of all provisions of      the bill. However, as you know, the provisions on wetlands      are not consistent with the recommendations of the nation's      Governors. We raised concerns over this issue in our March 22      letter to Rep. Shuster (copy attached). In response to your      request, we enclose an alternative approach to wetlands      reform developed by the Association of State Wetland      Managers, based on NGA policy recommendations. This proposal      reflects the state perspective on wetlands management and we      urge your consideration of this proposal as a substitute for      the wetlands provisions of H.R. 961.       We look forward to working with you in advancing this      important legislation, and will be in touch shortly      concerning other issues.           Sincerely,                                              Governor Mike Lowry,                            Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.                                           Gov. Terry E. Branstad,     Vice Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.                                                                    ____
