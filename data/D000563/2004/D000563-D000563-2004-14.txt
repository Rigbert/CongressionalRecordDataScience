President, if the Senator will yield, I would like to thank him for his kind words and wish him very well. We have served together for 6 years. Every Thursday morning when we were in session we had free coffee and doughnuts, a tradition that was started by Senator Paul Simon. I believe we were the only two Senators, being Democrat and Republican Senators, offering this opportunity for the visitors who come to Washington to ask a few questions and take a few photographs. But it worked very well. It became a very interesting experience for Illinoisans and others coming to Washington. We did it many times. It reached the point where I would give his answers to the questions and he would give my answers to the questions. We distinguished ourselves as being the only two Senators offering free coffee and doughnuts, which may account for the crowds that showed. But we did that for 6 years. We have worked closely together and effectively and successfully together on the appointment of judges, U.S. attorneys, and many projects that were local to Illinois. We disagreed on some issues but managed to maintain our friendship and warm relationship throughout.  Senator Fitzgerald announced his retirement for the right reasons. He said he wanted to spend more time with his family. That is something which we all admire very much.  I have enjoyed serving with Senator Fitzgerald, and I wish him the very best, whatever the next venture might be, and I hope we will continue to work together.
