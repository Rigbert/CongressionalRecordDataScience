Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the city of Riverside, California, which was recently awarded the distinguished honor of being named an All-America City. The All-America City designation, first awarded 49 years ago, is designed to recognize cities across our nation that have exemplary programs and initiatives that combat problemswithin their own communities. Thirty cities competed to be named one of ten All-America cities by the National Civic League. As a result of the President's Summit for America's Future, organizers of the All-America City program have asked cities to include at least one community youth program as part of their application.  The Mayor of Riverside, Ron Loveridge, credited three of the city's programs as being the key to the victory: the Passport to College Program, which is an innovative business, education, community, and family partnership that will make the dream of a college education possible for every Inland Empire graduate in 2004, the Youth Action Plan under which the city coordinates services for the region's youth; and the University/Eastside Community Collaborative after-school program that has enabled the city to keep at-risk youth away from the lure of gang activity.  Growing up in a neighboring city, I have seen Riverside face the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by the Inland Empire's significant population growth. Today, Riverside thrives with a population exceeding several hundred thousand residents and a diverse economic base. Representing the people of Riverside is truly a privilege. On behalf of all of the residents of the 43rd congressional district, I congratulate Riverside on being named an All-America City and wish them continued success in the future.                          ____________________
