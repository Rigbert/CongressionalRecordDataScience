  We have a responsibility--and I think I speak on behalf of Republicans and Democrats both here. We need to open government. We have disagreements all the time in Congress over different issues. Certainly, we cannot put these people's lives at risk and leave them as pawns in our States. Open up government, and then have a discussion about the issues we disagree on.  I know the Senator from Minnesota expected to be here, but I also see on the floor the Senator from Georgia, who would like to speak. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Georgia be allowed to speak and the Senator from Minnesota, when she returns.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.
