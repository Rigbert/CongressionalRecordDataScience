President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, July 15, the Senate resume consideration of the Daschle amendment numbered 3146 regarding marketing assistance loans. I further ask that there be 3 hours for debate equally divided on the amendment and that, at the conclusion or yielding back of the time, Senator Cochran be recognized to move to table the Daschle amendment. I further ask that no second-degree amendment be in order prior to the vote.
