 As we begin consideration of the bill, Senator Grassley and I are offering a brief managers' amendment. I was just explaining for everybody that it makes two simple technical changes in the bill in order to clarify the original intent of the bill and in order to avoid any ambiguity in the statutory language. It makes sure the bill extends the major fraud statute to all the funds being expended to stabilize and strengthen our banking system.
