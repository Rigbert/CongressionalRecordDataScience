Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Just to remember, Khobar Towers, of course, was perpetrated by Saudi Arabians. The Cole and the embassies were attacked by al Qaeda, which was based in Afghanistan, led by Osama bin Laden, who is still at large and still based in Afghanistan or Pakistan. But I am not going to revisit the debate of last week about Iraq.  What we are going to talk about here is the Constitution and the authority of the United States Congress. There seems to be a new-found respect for that among the Republican leadership, and I appreciate that.  Recently Speaker Hastert said: ``We need to protect the division of powers in the Constitution of the United States. We want to make sure that we protect the Constitution.''  Majority Mr. Leader Boehner said: ``Every 2 years I stand in the well of the House and raise my right hand and swear to uphold and defend the Constitution.''  So there is a new-found and growing respect on that side of the aisle for the Constitution. Unfortunately, all of that umbrage was about a search with a warrant of a Member's office, a Member of Congress who had $90,000 cold cash in his freezer.  Now I don't agree with their concerns and don't feel that it is an abrogation of the Constitution, but I do feel that ceding our war powers is.  In the case of Iraq, the United States Congress, I believe, unconstitutionally ceded its authority. We didn't declare war, we just said the President should do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, however he wanted. And it hasn't worked out real well.  Article I, section 8, is quite specific about the authorities reserved for the Congress. They were worried, the Founders were worried, about the wont of kings to engage in foreign adventures, so they wanted to restrain the king and retain the authority to raise the armies, fund the armies, and declare war to the Congress.  They are very clear in Article II, section 2, which says, ``The President shall be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into actual service of the United States.'' That is, the President had the authority to repel sudden attacks, but not launch a offensive military actions without a declaration of war.  Now, unfortunately, Mr. Gonzales, the President's former counsel, now head of the Justice Department, the Attorney General, has said he finds new inherent powers in the President in times of war, and he says the President has constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, as the sole organ of the Federal Government in foreign affairs, to deploy the Armed Forces of the United States. A formal declaration of war or other authorization from the Congress is not required to enable the President to undertake the full range of actions.  This is a total denial of all previous jurisprudence of the writings around the Constitutional Convention and basically rendering Congress meaningless.  Now, in this House we did have a proud moment after 9/11. On September 14, we voted with near unanimity, one person dissenting, to go after, essentially a declaration of war against the Taliban, the perpetrators of 9/11, al Qaeda, and Osama bin Laden.                              {time}  1945  Now that was a proud moment. And we should look back to that, and we should retain those authorities, and we should safeguard those authorities to this United States Congress. This would not tie the hands of the President in any way that isn't tied by the Constitution of the United States. If there was an imminent attack, if they had a missile on the pad and they were fueling it up to shoot at the United States of America, with a nuclear weapon on it, the President would have authority to repel a sudden attack. But if they are contemplating a preemptive or preventative or whatever they want to call it war, similar to the one launched under false pretenses in Iraq, then they should come and make the case to the people's House, the United States House of Representatives, and to the Senate and get the legal authority in order to conduct those actions.  So I would urge our colleagues to stand up for our constitutional rights here in the United States House of Representatives. I know it is a lot easier to have plausible deniability sometimes and give the President a broad grant of authority; and if in the end it is skewed, then you can say, they really didn't exactly tell us the right stuff when they launched that war. It would be better for us to be very clear about the delineation of these authorities, and the House should approve this amendment.
