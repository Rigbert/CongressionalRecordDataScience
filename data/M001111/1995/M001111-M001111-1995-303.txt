 President, I am proud to join my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, in introducing the James P. Grant World Summit for Children Implementation Act of 1995. I take this opportunity to commend Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this issue, and I am proud to be associated with this effort.  Because the nations of the world have become so interdependent, there can be no doubt that the well-being of children around the globe affects us here in the United States. Children are the foundation of our society, of our economy, of our future.  It seems obvious, then, that we would provide adequately for the world's children, but sadly we do not.  According to UNICEF, every week, more than 250,000 children die of easily preventable illness and malnutrition.  Every day, measles, whooping cough, and tetanus--all of which can be prevented by an inexpensive course of vaccines--kill nearly 8,000 children.  Every day, diarrheal dehydration--preventable at almost no cost--kills almost 7,000 children.  Every day, pneumonia--fully treatable by low-cost antibiotics--kills more than 6,000 children.  And for every child that dies, several more live on with poor growth, ill health, and diminished potential.  The world's political leadership can ill-afford to ignore these statistics. We are all in this together. The success or failure of economies thousands of miles away can directly affect us here at home. This is especially true in my trade-dependent home State of Washington.  As the old saying goes, we are only as strong as our weakest link. If our trading partners in Asia or Latin America cannot provide the necessary education or health care for their children, we will not have strong partners to trade [[Page S4736]] with in the next generation. And in the end, alleviating poverty promotes economic development, which serves us all.  So it is extremely important that we continue to work to implement the plan of action adopted at the 1990 U.N. World Summit for Children, which rightly placed the needs of children at the top of the world's development agenda.  That is why Senator Jeffords and I are introducing the James P. Grant World Summit for Children Implementation Act of 1995, legislation that supports life-saving, cost-effective programs to protect the health and well-being of children worldwide.  The world's children have a right to adequate nutrition, full immunization, education, and health care. The United States must continue to lead the world in promoting that message.  To reach children, of course, we must reach out to the world's women--who are often overlooked in traditional development programs. Fortunately, the World Summit for Children recognized that to improve the lot of the world's children, the status of the world's women also had to improve.  For example, recognizing the important link between child survival and family planning, the world summit for children called for universal access to family planning education and services by the end of this decade.  Family planning saves the lives of both women and children. We know that babies born in quick succession, to a mother whose body has not yet recovered from a previous birth, are the least likely to survive. Increasing funds in this area has been a top priority for me in my work in the U.S. Senate, and is addressed in the legislation we are introducing today.  I realize that in this current political climate, foreign aid is often under attack and misunderstood. While foreign aid has never been popular, it has always served our Nation well. The money needed to support the kinds of programs we are concerned about in this bill is not large in the scope of our budget--indeed, our total foreign aid program represents less than 1 percent of our entire Federal budget. In my view, our foreign aid dollars are best spent when we are investing in programs that strengthen families around the globe, and give a special helping hand to women and children.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Jeffords and me in support of this important legislation.                          ____________________
