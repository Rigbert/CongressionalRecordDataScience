 President, yesterday evening the Senate confirmed the nomination of Michael Chertoff to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I was in Delaware attending a funeral last evening and, accordingly, was unable to attend yesterday's vote on Mr. Chertoff's nomination. I wish to note for the record, however, that I would have voted for Mr. Chertoff's confirmation yesterday, having voted to report favorably his nomination from the Judiciary Committee last month.                          ____________________
