President, I share his concern and desire to put the Government back to work. This is not a thing that is helping anybody. They should be back. I wish him well in his meetings with the President. I have felt, if I might state frankly, that if the issue to be resolved in this budget impasse was left to this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats could come together with the President. It would mean that we would not have a Clinton budget, a Dole budget, a Leahy budget, but we might have the best of all of them and we would have a balanced budget.  I have been in negotiations and conference committees with the distinguished majority leader on everything from agriculture to foreign policy to finance and tax matters. I know that while he is a strong and tough bargainer, I know he also wants the Government to operate. I believe there is the possibility to do this and I hope we might.                          ____________________
