Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jennifer L. Homendy, who recentlyleft the staff of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after more than 14 years of service as the Democratic Staff Director of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials. I had the privilege of working with Jennifer throughout her entire time with the Committee, but most closely since 2015 when I took over as Ranking Member.  Jennifer was born in New Britain, Connecticut, but later moved with her family to the Washington Metro area. For Jennifer, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure was more than just a place to work; it was a second family. Her father, Sante Esposito, served as the Democratic Chief Counsel to the Committee from 1981 to 1998. Through both her father and mother, Jennifer learned the importance of public service at a young age.  As a student at Pennsylvania State University, Jennifer got her first real experience in government interning in Senator Arlen Spector's Harrisburg office. After graduation, she worked for the National Federation of Independent Business and the American Iron and Steel Institute before spending seven years working for transportation labor--first with the Transportation Trades Department and then the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.  She left the Teamsters in 2004 to join the Democratic staff of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, where she developed unrivaled expertise in issues surrounding the railroad industry and its employees, the safety and security of transporting hazardous materials, and the safety of oil and gas pipelines.  Jennifer is a passionate and tireless advocate for transportation safety, which is why it is extremely fitting that Jennifer left the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to become a Board Member at the National Transportation Safety Board. During her tenure as Staff Director, Jennifer guided major pieces of rail, pipeline, and hazmat safety legislation through the legislative process, including: the Norman Y. Mineta Research and Specials Programs Improvement Act of 2004; the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act--A Legacy for Users; the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006; the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008; the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA); the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011; and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) in 2015. Throughout her tenure on the Committee, she was an unwavering defender of the Nation's passenger railroad, Amtrak, and the need for swift implementation of positive train control.  When she is not at work trying to improve the safety of our transportation system, Jennifer spends her time running and training for marathons and triathlons. She is also a devoted mother who spends many weekends traveling with her daughter Alexandra (Lexi) to Irish dance competitions across the country.  I want to thank Jennifer for her many years of service to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. We will miss her, but look forward to working with her in her new role at the NTSB. I wish Jennifer, her husband Mike, and daughter Lexi all the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
