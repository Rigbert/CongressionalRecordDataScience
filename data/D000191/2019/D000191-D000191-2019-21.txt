Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, ``So we can't do it now. We would like to do it another time.'' I have heard that on the floor for the last 6 years when we did the Water Resources Development Act that came bipartisan and unanimous out of the Transportation Committee when the Republicans chaired it and this year when I chaired it, bipartisan out of the committee. ``We will fix it later, because the technical Budget Act is going to be violated and the caps are going to be violated.''  Well, I would observe that I believe the gentleman was here and the gentleman voted for the tax cuts. And in that, when Obama left office, we had a deficit of $587 billion. This year, it is $984 billion due to, principally, the tax cuts.  So waive all the rules when it comes to cutting taxes, but when it comes to taking a tax--and it isn't just collected from the shippers. Every American pays more for every imported good that comes through a port, with the intention, in a bill signed by Ronald Reagan, that that money would be spent to maintain those harbors.  As I pointed out, this has been a bipartisan problem: Clinton, Bush, Obama, all of them. And even the budgets proposed by Mick Mulvaney in the name of the President would further cut harbor maintenance. So we would continue to collect the tax from the American people for harbor maintenance and continue to divert it over here.  How can you increase the deficit in any rational world when you are spending taxes that have already been collected, that are deposited in the Treasury of the United States and can only be spent on harbor maintenance, and you are not spending them? That is increasing the deficit? Seriously? Oh, come on.  Now, I would note that, in a rare moment, we have a list here of 70 organizations who support this legislation, including the Association of General Contractors of America, who are going to key-vote this issue. They realize how critical this is for the future of the American economy, a great maritime nation. The Association of General Contractors will key-vote this issue.  We also have the National Grain and Feed Association and a long list of others on here who support this.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of supporters of H.R. 2440.

Mr. DeFAZIO. So, we can talk a lot about making a major investment in infrastructure. We have been hung up on how are we going to pay for service, transportation; 47,000 bridges need repair or replacement; 40 percent of the National Highway System is deteriorated to the point we have to rebuild it, not just recoat it; and there is a $100 billion backlog in transit just to bring it up to a state of good repair.  Those are just the needs in surface. Then you go to wastewater. Then you go to airports. Then you go to drinking water.  But guess what? For every single one of those things, we are going to have to raise revenues one way or another.  But this one thing, the need to invest in our harbors, we have the money. It is sitting in the bank, and we are being told, because of the budget caps, it can't be spent. Seriously?  The President himself said, when I was there, ``Spend that money.'' So if we get the bill through the House, if they don't derail it and it gets through the Senate, the President will sign it, plain and simple.  This is common sense outside the beltway, but just budget weirdness inside.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
