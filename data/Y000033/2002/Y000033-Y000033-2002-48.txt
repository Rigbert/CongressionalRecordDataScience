Well, Mr. Speaker, I am only going to respond to the gentleman in this way: that we deemed a budget number because we could not get a real budget, and we had to have a top line that the House had previously agreed to. As I pointed out in my remarks, I know a lot of Members did not vote for it. Nevertheless, the House worked its will, and that is the budget number we are now working with.  It would have been much easier for me and for the gentleman from Maryland, as the ranking member on a very important subcommittee, and for the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), as the ranking member on the full committee, and for all of us, if we had a common top number so that we could have then created common 302(b) numbers and we could have been well on our way to conferencing these bills.
