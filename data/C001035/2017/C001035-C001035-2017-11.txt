President, I rise today to bid farewell and to express my gratitude to Senator Luther Strange as he leaves the U.S. Senate. During his too-brief tenure here, he established an admirable reputation for hard work, dedication to his State of Alabama and our Nation, and a commitment to principles.  Senator Strange was appointed to the Senate last February to fill the vacancy created when Senator Jeff Sessions became Attorney General of the United States. From the start, it was clear that Senator Strange's pride in his home State was matched only by his humility at being selected to represent the State he loves.  Building on the reputation he earned as attorney general for Alabama, Senator Strange established himself here as a determined advocate for the rule of law and defender of our Constitution. From preserving the Senate traditions that foster full and open debate to supporting our veterans and strengthening our national security and our economy, Senator Strange has worked on a number of important initiatives.  Senator Strange has met the obligations of his office with energy and dedication, and it has been an honor to serve with him in the U.S. Senate. I wish him and Melissa all the best in the years to come and look forward to many more contributions and accomplishments from this distinguished American.
