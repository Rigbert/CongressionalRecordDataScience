 President, I wish to retain some of my leader time for rebuttal.  Let me just use a moment of my leader time to reiterate the fundamental point. The Director of the FBI thinks this is a problem; he just said so today. I know the Senator from Illinois is a great lawyer and understands all of these matters fully. We think it is important for the relevant Members of Congress to be assured that these terrorists do not have the kind of profile that would warrant their release.  This is not an attack on the current administration. The previous administration mistakenly released a number of detainees who went back to the battlefield. Why should we not learn from the experience of the past and apply it to the future? I hope my amendment will be adopted.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
