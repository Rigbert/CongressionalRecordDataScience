Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  I just wanted to respond to my friend from California to say there is in the bill a mechanism to reimburse individuals who are not admitted to this country. But furthermore, I want to say in regard to the amendment he was referring to, I would distinguish this amendment from the overall group of individuals who might not be admitted by saying that this amendment is specifically to reimburse individuals who were given an erroneous notification by the State Department.  So in this case the State Department made a mistake, and we are simply trying to rectify that. This is a very narrow instance of where we need to bring some equity to bear.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah [Mrs. Waldholtz].
