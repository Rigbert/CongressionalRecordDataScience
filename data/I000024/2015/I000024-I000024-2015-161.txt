President, I wish to recognize the service of LTG John D. Johnson, the director of the Department of Defense's newest combat support agency, the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency, JIDA, who will retire on September 1, 2015, after 38 years of active service.  Lieutenant General Johnson honorably served his country for more thanthree decades. After graduating from the Virginia Military Institute in 1977 as an infantry officer, he commanded troops at every level and is a veteran of multiple deployments to Iraq. As a young officer, he served in Germany, Georgia, California, and the Pentagon. He attained the rank of brigadier general in 2006 and was assigned as the assistant division commander for maneuver of the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea. Upon returning, he was assigned to the U.S. Army Installation Management Command. From there, he became the deputy commanding general, operations, for I Corps and Fort Lewis, WA. He deployed to Iraq serving in that role to the Headquarters for Multi-National Corps--Iraq, where he learned first-hand the atrocities inflicted by improvised explosive devices, foreshadowing his rise to his final position. In his penultimate position, he was the commanding general, Eighth U.S. Army; and Chief of Staff for United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command, and U.S. Forces Korea, preserving readiness for coalition forces across the Korean Peninsula.  As the director of JIDA, Lieutenant General Johnson set the conditions for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, JIEDDO, to become JIDA, a permanent defense agency that will enhance our Nation's capabilities to fight improvised weapons and those who employ them. He has fostered countless cooperative relationships with government agencies, coalition partners, academia, and industry supporters in an effort to find innovative solutions to these pervasive improvised threats. During this challenging transition period for JIEDDO, he led an extensive effort to right-size the workforce and streamline processes while still bestowing a high level of support to the warfighter.  I had the pleasure of personally working with Lieutenant General Johnson during his tenure at JIEDDO. He is an inspiring leader, an admirable mentor, and a fine example for his fellow servicemembers. I am proud to share in the celebration of Lieutenant General Johnson's career, his extraordinary leadership, his distinguished military service and his unwavering dedication to this great Nation. I wish him, his wife Cheryl, and their daughter Elizabeth all the best in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
