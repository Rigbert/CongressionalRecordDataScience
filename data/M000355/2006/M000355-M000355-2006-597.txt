 WARNER. I am happy to yield the floor, if the Senator so desires.  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield for a question, I say to my friend from Virginia: Is the Senator from Kentucky correct that the genesis of the Nelson amendment is a newspaper story quoting a lower level Government official, since dismissed by the Iraqi Government for suggesting that forces who may have killed American or Iraqi troops would be given amnesty? Is it not correct, I ask my friend from Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that that lower level official has since been dismissed from the Iraqi Government?
