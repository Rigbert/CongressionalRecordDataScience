It is against terrorism and the countries that harbor terrorists. In this bill the Republicans have stopped on the Senate floor this morning, the foreign assistance and operations bill which President Bush asked us to pass, which Secretary of State Colin Powell said is important for his operation, the State Department, as he builds this coalition, is it not true we also include in this bill nutrition and health programs for the less fortunate around the world? Is it not also true that many of these programs will be the evidence that many of these people have that the United States is not at war with Islamic people, not at war with a certain religion, that we are, in fact, prepared to help them and help their children?

That is how I see it. I ask the Senator from Nevada if he reaches the same conclusion?
