President, I am really surprised and shocked that apparently there is objection on the Democratic side of the aisle to consideration of this important resolution. I had hoped that we would consider this evening a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate upon the ninth anniversary of the tragic massacre of Chinese students in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.  My resolution, had I been permitted to proceed with it this evening, was cosponsored by the distinguished majority leader, by the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, and by the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham. Regrettably, my colleagues from the Democratic side of the aisle have blocked consideration of this resolution. I would, however, like to take a moment to explain why I consider it to be very important.  Mr. President, 9 years ago, thousands of students were peaceably assembled on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, peacefully protesting their government's refusal to permit them even the most basic freedoms of expression, association, and political activity.  As a symbol of their hopes and aspirations for a democratic China, these students constructed a scale model of our own Statue of Liberty. It was to them, as it is to us and to untold millions around the world, a symbol of freedom's promise for people everywhere. Quoting Thomas Jefferson, these brave Chinese students spoke eloquently of the need for China to develop democratic institutions, and finally to allow a degree of political progress to match its dramatic economic change and development in recent years.  Nine years ago today--today--the excitement and the promise of this Chinese democracy movement were extinguished as troops and armored vehicles were ordered into action against the peaceful students. Mr. President, it may never be known exactly how many died in the resulting bloodbath, but hundreds of Chinese demonstrators were certainly killed and many thousands more were arrested for so-called counterrevolutionary offenses that consisted only of attempting to assert rights that it is the duty of civilized governments everywhere to observe, protect and promote.  I am wearing, Mr. President, a ribbon to commemorate just one of those political prisoners from that very sad period.  I had hoped to introduce and have the Senate pass this resolution to make very clear to everyone in this country and, indeed, around the globe that the U.S. Senate has not forgotten what occurred in Tiananmen Square 9 years ago today.  Mr. President, my resolution sought to do no more than to make clear that what occurred on June 4, 1989, was profoundly wrong and that we should not permit ourselves or our Government ever to forget this. This resolution would have merely expressed the sense of the Senate that our Government should remain committed to honoring the memory and the spirit of the Chinese citizens who died on Tiananmen Square and that assisting China's peaceful transition to democracy should be a principal goal of our foreign policy.  Mr. President, it is important that we remember Tiananmen Square today precisely because we do enjoy increasingly close ties with the regime in Beijing. Relations with the People's Republic of China are--and must--be a continual balancing act. The memory of Tiananmen Square should help us find the appropriate bounds, preventing us from giving way to a wholly unchecked enthusiasm in U.S.-Chinese relations by disregarding the fundamental nature of the regime with which we are dealing. China is not a democracy, after all, and its government still has few qualms about using armed force to suppress the legitimate aspirations of its people for basic liberties.  I do not expect democracy to flower overnight in China. But it is today quite clear that China is capable of democracy. The very strength of the student movement that Communist authorities tried to crush on Tiananmen Square nine years ago attests to the powerful appeal that democracy and human rights have in China. The successes of pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong's recent elections also attest to how strong democratic ideals can be in China when not suppressed by autocrats intent upon preserving their own power and privileges. Most of all, the new and thriving democracy on Taiwan stands as the clearest indication that the phrase ``Chinese democracy'' is not an oxymoron. In fact, the phrase ``Chinese democracy is a ray of hope for a quarter of our planet's population.  This is why it is important always to keep Tiananmen Square in our minds as we pursue our ``engagement'' with China. While we cannot ignore China and its huge population, neither can we ignore the human rights abuses committed by its government. Sound public policymaking is about pragmatism, but it is about the pragmatic pursuit of principles. Without principle, pragmatism is no more than a fraud, a process that lacks a purpose; there is no substitute for an underlying moral compass. This is why I very much wanted to introduce my resolution today: in U.S.-China relations, the memory of Tiananmen Square is one of the cardinal points on our moral compass, without which we cannot navigate.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution I would have introduced be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               S. Res.--       Whereas in the spring of 1989, thousands of students      demonstrated in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in favor of      greater democracy, civil liberties, and freedom of expression      in the People's Republic of China (PRC);       Whereas these students' protests against political      repression in their homeland were conducted peacefully and      posed no threat to their fellow Chinese citizens;       Whereas on the evening of June 4, 1989, these students were      brutally attacked by infantry and armored vehicles of the      People's Liberation Army (PLA) acting under orders from the      highest political and military leadership of the PRC;       Whereas hundreds of these students were killed by the PLA      in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 for offenses no more      serious than that of seeking peacefully to assert their most      basic human, civil, and political rights;       Whereas many of the leaders of the student demonstrations      thus attacked were subsequently imprisoned, sought out for      arrest, or otherwise persecuted by the Government of the PRC;       Whereas during or shortly after the brutal assault of June      4, 1989, at least 2,500 persons were arrested for so-called      ``counter-revolutionary offenses'' across China and dozens of      persons were executed;       Whereas the Chinese government has never expressed regret      for its actions on June 4, 1989, still imprisons at least 150      persons in connection with the Tiananmen Square      demonstrations, and has continued to deny its citizens basic      internationally-recognized human, civil, and political      rights;       Whereas the Government of the PRC, as detailed in      successive annual reports on     human rights by the United States Department of State, still      routinely and systematically violates the rights of its      citizens, including their rights to freedom of speech,      assembly, worship, and peaceful dissent; and       Whereas the Tiananmen Square Massacre has become indelibly      etched into the political consciousness of our times as a      symbol both of the impossibility of forever denying a      determined people the right to control their own destiny and      of the oppressiveness and brutality of governments that seek      to do so: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That, in the interest of expressing support for      the observance of human, civil, and political rights in China      and around the world, it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the United States Government should remain committed to      honoring the memory and spirit of the brave citizens of China      who suffered and died in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 for      attempting to assert their internationally-recognized rights;      and       (2) supporting the peaceful transition to democratic      governance and the observance of internationally-recognized      human, civil, and political rights and the rule of law in      China should be a principal goal of United States foreign      policy.       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy      of this resolution to the President.                          ____________________
