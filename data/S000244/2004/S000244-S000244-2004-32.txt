Speaker, today S. 2042, for the relief of Rocco Trecosta, is being considered by unanimous consent by the House. I have agreed to move this private bill outside the regular private bill process for two reasons: a substantially similar bill passed the House under regular order in the 104th Congress; and this bill only arrived in the House yesterday from the Senate, making it impossible to move the bill through the normal process before this Congress adjourns. It is only because of these unusual circumstances that I am making this exception to the regular order.  In the 104th Congress, a substantially similar bill, H.R. 2765, was introduced by then Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, Representative Lamar Smith. Pursuant to the Meritorious Claims Act, the Comptroller General recommended that Congress enact legislation to treat Mr. Trecosta as a member of the plaintiff class in March v. United States. According to the GAO: ``we believe his situation is extraordinary and contains such elements of equity as to be deserving of the consideration of Congress.'' Because there is generally no controversy on cases referred under the Meritorious Claims Act, the House quickly passed the bill under the normal private bill process, however, it did not pass the Senate.  This bill pays Mr. Trecosta, a former teacher in the Department of Defense Overseas Dependent Schools, backpay he would have been awarded if he had been a member of the March plaintiff class. In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals held that DOD had not property implemented pay-setting procedures established under a law requiring the Secretary of each military department to fix the basic compensation for teachers and teaching positions in his department at rates equal to the average of the range of rates of basic compensation for similar positions of a comparable level of duties and responsibilities in urban school jurisdictions in the U.S. of 100,000 or more population.  The Court held that DOD violated the statutory requirement and directed DOD to base the salaries on current salaries paid to stateside teachers. The Court also granted the plaintiffs entitlement to recover money damages. A judgment in the District Court on June 30, 1975, provided backpay for the plaintiffs for the period from April 14, 1966, to the date of that judgment.  Out of 23,000 potential plaintiffs, only Mr. Trecosta had previously brought an action in the Court of Claims which was denied. But for his suit, he would have been included in the plaintiff-class in March. Furthermore, he could have been paid administratively. The GAO denied his claim, stating that the matter was res judicata and therefore his final Court of Claims judgment barred any further claim arising out of the matters involved in the case.  No one else is in Mr. Trecosta's position. He was the only teacher who challenged DOD's practices, and was excluded from the class due to that challenge.  When the Senate did not move the House passed bill in the 104th Congress, Mr. Trecosta was encouraged to pursue his bill in the Senate first in subsequent Congresses. In 1999, the Senate referred his claim to the Court of Federal Claims, which determined that he should be paid the back pay as a matter of equity. Only now, after receiving that decision, has the Senate passed S. 2042 for Mr. Trecosta.  First as a private bill objector for many years, and now as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have always insisted on the processing of private bills through regular order and deviate from that policy in this one instance due to the unique details of the situation. This bill previously passed the House under regular order. It was not only a Meritorious Claims Act referral, but it now also has the blessing of the Court of Federal Claims. This man has already been through a lot, for a long time, to have his claim resolved. I have checked with the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, and the Republican and Democratic private bill objectors, Mr. Coble, Mr. Chabot, Mrs. Blackburn, Mr. Boucher, Mr. Schiff, and Mr. Grijalva, and they have all agreed that this procedure is appropriate under these unusual circumstances. I appreciate their cooperation. I urge my colleagues to adopt the bill.  The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
