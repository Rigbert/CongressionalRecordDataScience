 President, I do not want to prolong this debate. I knowthe managers have been here all day long and they want to move to a vote on this amendment.  Let me simply respond to my colleagues from the South and tell them that I understand insect infestation is a key concern in national and private forests.  I know my colleagues from the South face significant insect and disease issues. We certainly face them in the Pacific Northwest. However, I strongly believe we do not need to abandon the old-growth protections in this bill. The bill already allows old-growth stands to be treated for hazardous conditions. They simply must be treated in a manner to protect the old-growth characteristics.  Again, I know in most of the Nation 3 percent of the land is old growth. In the Pacific, it is 18 percent. It is a tremendous part of our heritage. It is something of which I think all of us should be very proud.  We need to be careful we do not take steps this evening with this bill that undo the heritage most of us are very proud of in this country.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know my colleague from Idaho wants to move forward with a vote on this matter.
