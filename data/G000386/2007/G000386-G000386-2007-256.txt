 President, it is with great sadness that I announce to the Senate today that SPC David W. Behrle has lost his life in Iraq. David Behrle died in the service of his country, and it is absolutely appropriate that we take this opportunity to salute his patriotism and his sacrifice.  Specialist Behrle died Saturday night, May 19, 2007, after his patrol vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb south of Baghdad. My thoughts, prayers, and sincere condolences go out to his mother, Dixie Pelzer of Tipton, IA, and his father, John Behrle of Columbus, NE, as well as the Tipton community that is now dealing with the loss of their second native son in Iraq. While we try to prepare ourselves for the loss of life that comes with war, it is impossible to prepare for the very personal experience of losing a young life so close to home. David is best described by a former classmate as ``not only our class president, he's now our class hero.'' He served his country with vigor and enthusiasm, and his presence will be missed in both Tipton and our Armed Forces.                          ____________________
