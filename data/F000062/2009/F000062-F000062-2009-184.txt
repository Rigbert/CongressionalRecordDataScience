 President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. He has a very good point and a very good amendment. This was not the intention of the Interior part of the stimulus bill. It is not the intention of this bill. Therefore, I think the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming is completely in order. It has been called up, and our side is prepared to accept it.
