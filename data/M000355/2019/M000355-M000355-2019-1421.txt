 President, today it is my high honor to pay tribute to a genuine Kentucky hero. As a member of the greatest generation, Alvin H. Perry of Wilmore, KY, personifies the greatest values of our Nation. In the Second World War, he fought with the Allied forces of freedom to defeat one of the greatest evils the world has ever known. In doing so, Alvin earned the lasting admiration of his countrymen and the gratitude of the free world.  To commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-day, the largest amphibious invasion in world history, the French Republic will express its thanks and respect to Alvin in a special way. At a ceremony in Wilmore, the Consul General of France responsible for Kentucky Guillaume Lacroix will present Alvin, now 95, with his nation's highest distinction: the Legion of Honor Medal.  The American and French people share a unique bond of friendship. As our consequential ally during the War of Independence, our two countries stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the pursuit of liberty and equality. Years later, millions of American soldiers would fight in France to defend those same principles. More than 100,000 of them would make the ultimate sacrifice there, and tens of thousands of our heroic fallen rest in French soil forevermore.  There is perhaps no better display of this brotherhood among nations than the events during Operation Overlord. On the beaches of Normandy and across the French countryside, American forces once more came to the defense of our friends and our shared ideals. It was during the Battle of Normandy that PFC Alvin Perry and his 331st Infantry Regiment, 83rd Infantry Division, took their first steps onto the European continent fighting for the liberation of France.  During the battle, Alvin was wounded, struck with a bullet in his shoulder. He was unable to receive proper medical attention and, along with other members of his unit, was later captured by the enemy. Alvin spent the following 10 months as a prisoner of war near Munich, where he endured brutal conditions and forced labor in a Nazi camp. He struggled each day, relying upon aid parcels for survival. But through all his hardships, Alvin never faltered or resigned to defeat. At long last, it was the sight of an Allied tank that finally meant liberation for this brave soldier. It also marked the end of his wartime service. Like his father and brother who also served in uniform, Alvin bravely defended our democracy and our American way of life.  When Alvin returned home to Kentucky, he was adorned with the Prisoner of War Medal, the Purple Heart Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal for his intrepid service in France. Now, after more than seven decades, Alvin will add another well-deserved decoration.  Originally founded by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, the National Order of the Legion of Honor is bestowed only on those who render the highest levels of service to the French Republic and her people. Receiving the honor, Alvin joins a distinguished membership that includes Secretary of State Colin Powell, General George C. Patton, and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.  Our Nation's veterans deserve our utmost respect and gratitude, and I am grateful for the chance to honor this particular hero. So, it is my sincere privilege to congratulate Alvin for receiving this impressive distinction. Through his service and sacrifice, he has made us all quite proud. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me, the people of Kentucky, and the French Republic in thanking Alvin Perry for his service to the cause of human freedom.                          ____________________
