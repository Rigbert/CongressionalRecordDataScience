Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 409 resolves that Congress recognizes with humble gratitude the more than 16 million veterans who served in the United States Armed Forces during World War II and the Americans who supported the war effort on the home front and celebrates the completion of the National World War II Memorial on the National Mall in the District of Columbia.  The National World War II Memorial on the National Mall in the District of Columbia will be the first national memorial to both recognize the courage, bravery, and unselfish dedication of the members of the United States Armed Forces who served in World War II and those who served on the home front and acknowledge the commitment and achievement of the entire American people in that conflict. Many of my family and friends that served in World War II suggested to me some kind of a National World War II memorial. I join with my friend Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur of Ohio who introduced legislation to establish the memorial in the District of Columbia to honor members of the Armed Forces who served in World War II and to commemorate the participation of the United States in that war.  Congress authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission to design and construct the memorial. The location selected as the site for the memorial, the Rainbow Pool site on the National Mall at the east end of the Reflecting Pool between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, was dedicated on November 11, 1995. In an open competition, the American Battle Monuments Commission selected Friedrich St. Florian as the design architect for the memorial, and his final architectural design was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, the National Capital Planning Commission, and the Secretary of the Interior.  The late Representative Bob Stump of Arizona, who served as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, sponsored several measures to expedite the funding and construction of the memorial, which were enacted. After 8 years of planning, 6 years of public deliberation, and 4 years of fund raising, construction began on the memorial in September 2001.  The memorial would not have been possible without the efforts and dedication of National Chairman Senator Robert J. Dole and National Co-Chairman Frederick W. Smith, who were instrumental in raising over $194,000,000 for the construction of the memorial. These generous contributions came from hundreds of thousands of individual Americans, as well as corporations, foundations, veterans groups, fraternal and professional organizations, States, communities, and schools. Actor Tom Hanks, the Advertising Council, and the History Channel played a key role in increasing public awareness of the heroic achievements of American World War II veterans and the war effort and in raising support for the memorial. President George W. Bush will formally dedicate the memorial on May 29, 2004.  The memorial will be a monument to the selfless sacrifice and undaunted courage of the members of the United States Armed Forces who served in World War II as well as a tribute to their families and most Americans that joined in the war effort. It is a place of remembrance to honor the more than 400,000 American servicemen and servicewomen who died in that conflict defending the United States. The memorial will be a source of inspiration for current and future generations of Americans, giving visitors to the memorial a new appreciation for the accomplishments of America's World War II generation, which united in the quest to free the world from tyranny.  It is with great respect that I strongly support this resolution.                Smith Announces Veterans History Project       Washington, DC.--Congressman Nick Smith announced a special      initiative today,     encouraging citizens to participate in the Veterans History      Project, which is an effort by Congress and the Library of      Congress to collect audio- and video-taped interviews of      veterans, or civilians who served in support of the war      effort, along with other first-hand materials such as      photographs, diaries, and letters.       ``As we approach Memorial Day, I would like to invite all      of my constituents to get involved in the Veterans History      Project,'' Smith said. ``I encourage families, friends,      historians, teachers, senior care workers, and students to      participate and volunteer to interview a veteran.''       On Monday, Congressman Smith sat down with James Cox, a      WWII veteran, to conduct an interview for the Veterans      History Project. Cox served with the famed 30th Infantry      Division. The 30th opened the way for General Patton's 3rd      Army to drive into Brittany and on to Brest, and was kept in      the forefront all the way into Belgium, Holland and Germany.      The interview is being aired on cable public service      channels. Congressman Smith will be interviewing someone from      each county in the 7th District to raise awareness about the      Veterans History Project.       ``The Veterans History Project is important, not only to      preserve the experiences and memories of our nation's      veterans, but also to bring families and communities      together. Grandchildren should interview their grandparents,      students should interview community members, and veterans      should interview each other.''       The Veterans History Project was enacted in October of      2000. Oral histories and documents collected through this      project will be part of the national Veterans History Project      Collection at the Library of Congress.       Interview kits are available at Congressman Smith's office      in Battle Creek and Jackson. People who have questions about      the Veterans History Project should contact the Congressman's      office or go to the home page of Congressman Smith's Web site      at: www.house.gov/nicksmith, which has a link to the Veterans      History Project in the ``Quick Links'' section. Completed      interviews can then be sent to Congressman Smith's office      which will then be submitted to the Library of Congress.
