Two decent Americans are leaving the service of the people's House at the end of this year. This House will be a lesser body for their departure. Alabama will have suffered a significant loss.  Each of us individually in this House will have lost good friends. Glen Browder is a relative newcomer relative to Mr. Bevill but then again, most of us are relative newcomers relative to Mr. Bevill. Glen Browder, as Spence Bachus indicated, is someone who cares about people, who is a capable, able, regular guy that you would be proud to have as your dad or your brother or your uncle or as your Congressman. I have been honored to serve with him.  Tom Bevill is a giant. Tom Bevill helped America invest in its future. One of the first votes I cast was on the Tennessee-Tombigbee when I came here to Congress. It was a controversial vote. It was the right vote. Tom Bevill stood and said if America is to grow, if we are to create jobs, if we are to have economic viability and be competitive in world markets, we need to invest in America.  Tom Bevill is my friend and he is an historic figure in this body. Few Members who have ever served in this House will be able to look back on their record of making America better. That is Tom Bevill's. God bless you, Tom.
