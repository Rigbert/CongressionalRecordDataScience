Speaker, I rise in support of normal trade relations with China and in opposition to this resolution of disapproval. I have grave concerns about the Chinese Government. Their policy and practice include religious persecution, stealing our national secrets, unfair trade practices, and military intimidation of their neighbors.  Let us be clear. The Chinese government is no friend of the United States or democracy. However, I would subscribe to Ronald Reagan's philosophy on dealing with potential adversaries: contain them militarily, engage them diplomatically, and flood them with Western goods and influence.  Sadly, the Clinton-Gore administration has failed on the military front, is suspect on the diplomatic front; yet on the trade front where Congress has a say, we should not fail. Maintaining normal trading relations is important to the Chinese people, but it is also important to California farmers. These hard-working farmers support 1.4 million jobs in California, have led the Nation in production since 1948. California's agricultural exports to China have risen nearly 50 percent since 1993 and now total over $2.4 billion annually.  With all these exports to China, California sent an equal amount of American ideals, moral values, and capitalism.
