Speaker, we rise to pay tribute to a hero from my congressional district, Senior Airman Michael J. Hinkle II. Today we ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died while serving our country.  Hinkle grew up in my hometown, Corona, California, with his father Michael Hinkle Senior and stepmother Cynna Hinkle. He spent summers in Michigan with his mother and stepfather, Robert Jakowinicz.  Senior Airman Hinkle followed in his father's footsteps joined the Air Force in December of 2005 and his first overseas post was in Okinawa. In 2008, Hinkle reenlisted with the Air Force and was stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, SD, in November of 2008. Airman Hinkle deployed to the 386th ECS from the 28th Communications Squadron at Ellsworth in November. At a memorial service held by the members of the 386th Air Expeditionary Wing for a fallen Marauder on March 19, Hinkle's fellow service members paid tribute to his constant smile and easy going attitude. Major James Hewitt, 386th ECS commander, stated:       ``Even though Mike's life was short, it was full of      accomplishments and honor. Mike joined (the Air Force) and      immediately headed off to become a cyber transport systems      journeyman. There could not have been a better career field      for Mike to join. Mike loved computers, networking and      gaming. He loved being a COMM geek.  Airman Hinkle's fellow Airmen fondly remembered him for his positive attitude; Hinkle was known for stepping up to the plate and helping out whenever he was needed. Airman Hinkle accomplished so much during his short time and he will be dearly missed by his unit and all who knew him. He was buried in Michigan earlier this week. Airman Hinkle was 24 years old. He is survived by his father, mother, stepfather, stepmother, five stepsiblings and a brother.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Senior Airman Hinkle, who bravely chose an honorable life ofmilitary service. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. The day the Hinkle family learned of the death of their son and brother was probably the hardest day they have ever faced and our thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude go out to the family and friends of Airman Hinkle. There are no words that can relieve their pain and what words we can offer only begin to convey our deep respect and highest appreciation.  Senior Airman Hinkle's family have all given a part of themselves in the loss of their loved one and we hope they know that his service and the goodness he brought to this world will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
