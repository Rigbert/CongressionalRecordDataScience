President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Knoll Motel in Barre, VT, a pioneer establishment of the VT tourism industry.  In April 2000, the Knoll Motel celebrated its 50th anniversary of offering warm and courteous hospitality to visitors of the Green Mountain State. Founded in April of 1950, it is the State's first and longest operating motel.  During the period following World War II, the number of Americans traveling for recreational purposes increased dramatically. As more and more citizens traveled the country's expanding network of highways, the touring public were in need of economical and conveniently located overnight accommodations. Responding to this trend, the American tourist industry established motels that catered to the needs of family highway travelers.  Recognizing the economic potential associated with the growing tourist industry in Vermont, Stanley and Minnie Sabens established the Knoll Motel on 1015 North Main Street in Barre. Located near the State Capital, Montpelier, and what eventually became Interstate 89, the original eight-room facility became a model for the motel industry in Vermont, where tourism is vital to the success of the state's economy.  Keeping with Vermont's proud tradition of family-owned businesses, Stanley Sabens II has assumed the management of the Knoll Motel, ensuring that future generations of visitors to Vermont will be able to enjoy the Sabens' hospitality for years to come.  I congratulate the Sabens family and the Knoll Motel for their many years of service to Vermont and its visitors, and I wish them success in the future.                          ____________________
