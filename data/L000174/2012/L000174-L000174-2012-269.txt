He shouldn't engender any serious objection; he is too good for that. He is the kind of nominee who, as my years here in the Senate demonstrate, normally receives unanimous support. It would usually not even require a roll call vote, because he has the qualifications, the judgment, and the ability. Maybe some were concerned that he was too well qualified or relatively young, and so some feared he might some day be nominated to a still higher court so they wanted to avoid voting on his nomination as they did when Elena Kagan was nominated to the D.C. Circuit by President Clinton, or when they delayed a vote as they did with Judge Sonia Sotomayor when she was nominated to the Second Circuit by President Clinton.  I strongly disagree with those who seek to nitpick this man's legal career. Since his service as a Federal prosecutor, he has worked at a highly respected Los Angeles law firm on a wide variety of matters. He has always represented his clients ethically and to the best of his legal ability.  The distinguished Presiding Officer, who has been an attorney general of his State, knows that lawyers are supposed to give their best counsel and their best effort to those whom they are representing. That is what lawyers are supposed to do. In my case, I defended criminals in private practice. I then prosecuted criminals as a prosecutor. In both cases, I knew what my role in the legal system was. As I said, that is what lawyers are supposed to do. Actually, that is what Republicans used to argue to defend the Federalist Society and corporate lawyers that were being nominated by a Republican President.  As Chief Justice Roberts noted during his confirmation hearing, lawyers represent clients. They do not stand in their client's shoes and they should not have their client's legal positions used against them.  Let's abandon the crude and inaccurate litmus tests being applied to President Obama's nominees. Let's stop the caricaturing. If not, no lawyer could ever be confirmed to the Federal bench. When we have a lawyer who has actually been active in his or her practice, of course they are going to represent some people others disagree with. Of course, they are going to represent some issues where others may, as individual Senators, feel they would rather be on the other side of the issue. But how quickly would our legal system break down if lawyers could only represent one side of an issue, or when a matter comes to court we can only hear from one side and not from the other? One of the most valued legal systems in the world would disintegrate.  As an attorney in private practice Paul Watford has advocated positions well within the mainstream of legal argument. There were only two cases on which he worked as a lawyer among the hundreds and possibly thousands in which he has been involved, that were criticized by Committee Republicans.  In one, the well-known law firm with which he is affiliated represented groups challenging the controversial Arizona immigration law, and won a preliminary injunction against certain provisions for violating the Constitution. In his role as an attorney he was consulted by others working on the case to review and edit their preliminary injunction motion. That motion contains arguments based on Federal preemption, due process, and other constitutional rights that are well within the mainstream of legal advocacy and that were raised, as well, by the U.S. Department of Justice in its filings. That a Senator might disagree with the position he assisted in developing on behalf of his firm's clients in this case is hardly a reason to oppose his nomination. I did not oppose Chief Justice Roberts' nomination because he helped and advised the challenge resulting in Bush v. Gore. Paul Watford's legal work at Munger, Tolles was professional, principled and not out of the mainstream.  The other case on which critics have fastened as if to justify their opposition was his legal advocacy on behalf of clinical ethicists and critical care providers challenging a specific lethal injection protocol. He did not challenge the death penalty as unconstitutional. The legal challenge was to the manner in which it was being administered. In fact, in direct and express answers to questions from Senator Grassley, the nominee wrote that he does not have any personal conviction or religious beliefs that would impact the way he would rule in a death penalty case and that he would have no difficulty rulingfairly and impartially in cases involving the death penalty. He also answered that he believes the death penalty an acceptable form of punishment and that he would have no difficulty faithfully applying the Supreme Court's precedent in that regard. How this record can be seen as justifying opposition is beyond me.  Our legal system is an adversary system that is predicated upon legal advocacy from both sides. No nominee should be disqualified for representing clients zealously. Go back in history. John Adams, one of the most revered Founders and later President of this country, wrote that his representation of the British soldiers in the controversial case regarding the Boston Massacre was ``one of the most gallant, generous, manly and disinterested actions of my whole life, and one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country.''  Did he agree with the British in holding the colonies subservient? Of course not. Did he agree with the efforts of us in this country to be free people--free from alliance with Great Britain? Of course he did. That is what he did when he helped and when he served as one of the Founders of this country and when he became President. But he also knew our whole system broke down if somebody within a court did not have adequate representation on both sides, and that is why he represented British soldiers in the case involving the Boston Massacre--not because he was supportive of what the British were doing and not because he wanted anything other than to have us as a free people, but because he wanted to make sure that in a free country, in a free United States of America, when someone goes before our courts, they are going to have representation on both sides, and that is the way it should be.  At his confirmation hearing to become the Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts made the point:       [I]t's a tradition of the American Bar that goes back      before the founding of the country that lawyers are not      identified with the positions of their clients. The most      famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the      British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that      for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution      in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule      of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.       Our Founders thought that they were not being given their      rights under the British system to which they were entitled,      and by representing the British soldiers, he helped show that      what they were about was defending the rule of law, not      undermining it, and that principle, that you don't identify      the lawyer with the particular views of the client, or the      views that the lawyer advances on behalf of the client, is      critical to the fair administration of justice.  That has always been our tradition. I hope it always will be our tradition, but I am concerned that some feel it should change. This litmus test that would disqualify nominees because as a lawyer they represented a side in a case on which we disagree is dangerous and wrong. Almost every nominee who has actually been a practicing attorney who has had more than one client in their life is going to fail such a test. They are going to be disqualified, because if they are practicing law, if they are doing what they are supposed to do, if they are making sure that someone is adequately represented in court no matter how unpopular that case may be, then of course they are going to take on some cases we might not like. The distinguished Presiding Officer was the chief prosecuting officer of his State. I was the chief prosecuting officer of my county. I prosecuted some people whom I wanted to go to jail for as long as possible. But the last thing I wanted was for them not to have a good and adequate lawyer on the other side. I wanted them to have the best of counsel on the other side, because that way, society is protected. That way, our court system is protected. That way, it meant that if any one of us came in and were innocent and were being charged, we would know there was an example of always having representation.  Republican obstruction of this nomination is particularly damaging given the dire need for judges on the Ninth Circuit. With three times the number of cases pending as the next busiest circuit and twice the caseload of the judges on other circuits, the Ninth Circuit cannot afford further delay filling its emergency vacancies. The 61 million people served by the Ninth Circuit are not served by this delay. I have been asked for months that the Senate expedite consideration of this nomination and that of Justice Hurwitz of Arizona to fill these judicial emergency vacancies.  The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan appointee, along with the members of the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit, wrote to the Senate months ago emphasizing the Ninth Circuit's ``desperate need for judges,'' urging the Senate to ``act on judicial nominees without delay,'' and concluding ``we fear that the public will suffer unless our vacancies are filled very promptly.'' The judicial emergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit are harming litigants by creating unnecessary and costly delays. The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly five months longer for the Ninth Circuit to issue an opinion after an appeal is filed, compared to all other circuits. The Ninth Circuit's backlog of pending cases far exceeds other Federal courts. As of September 2011, the Ninth Circuit had 14,041 cases pending before it, far more than any other circuit.  When Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to the D.C. Circuit for positions she took while representing the State of New York, they contended that their underlying concern was that the caseload of the D.C. Circuit did not justify the appointment of another judge to that Circuit. I disagreed with their treatment of Caitlin Halligan, their shifting standards and their purported caseload argument. But if caseloads were really a concern, Senate Republicans would not have delayed action on this nomination to a judicial emergency vacancy on the overburdened Ninth Circuit for more than 3 months.  There is no justification for refusing to address the needs of the Ninth Circuit. A few years ago the Senate was forced to invoke cloture to overcome Republican filibusters of President Clinton's nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit. That obstruction is being repeated.  We did not engage in tit for tat when the presidency changed. During the Bush administration, the Senate proceeded to confirm seven of the nine Ninth Circuit nominees of President Bush. Four of President Bush's Ninth Circuit nominees were confirmed during his first 4-year term: Judge Richard Clifton, Judge Jay Bybee, Judge Consuelo Callahan, and Judge Carlos Bea.  By contrast, Senate Republicans have been opposing our moving forward to consider and confirm Paul Watford and Andrew Hurwitz, who are both strongly supported by their home State Senators, to fill judicial emergency vacancies. Senate Republicans have already successfully filibustered the nomination of Goodwin Liu, who also had the strong support of his home State Senators.  I urge Senators to show that we can work together to reduce the vacancies that are burdening the Federal judiciary. Do what some of my friends on the Republican side of the aisle have said to me, which is to move forward to vote for this nominee. They should also help the millions of Americans who rely on our Federal courts who seek justice. We can show we intend to do that. We can start right here by voting to confirm this good man, Paul Watford, who is a highly qualified nominee to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and say to the American people, we believe in justice for everybody here.

Re Paul Watford.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Hart          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: We write to provide our enthusiastic support      for Paul Watford's nomination to serve on the United States      Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.       We have known Paul personally and professionally for nearly      twenty years, having met him in 1994 when we served together      as clerks to Judge Kozinski on the Ninth Circuit. One of us      also spent a second year working with Paul during the year he      spent as clerk to Justice Ginsburg at the United States      Supreme Court.       During the crucible those intense years, we learned a lot      about Paul's approach to legal issues, his attitudes about      legal rules and precedents, and perhaps most importantly his      demeanor when confronted with competing views of what the law      is or should be. Paul is intelligent, thoughtful, balanced      and fair. He is moderate, not extreme, in his views. As a      serious student of the law, his instinct is to look for the      answer dictated by precedent, not his personal views. And      even in the face of heated debate, he maintains an even keel,      demonstrating a temperament that is well-suited to the act of      judging.       Others can and no doubt will speak to Paul's obvious      qualifications, including his demonstrable intelligence and      distinguished professional career. We can speak, from both      sides of the political aisle (one registered Democrat, one      registered Republican), to the personal qualities and      temperament that make Paul not only qualified but uniquely      well-suited to the position to which he has been nominated.      We could go on (and on) with our praise for Paul, but the      simple fact is that he will make an excellent judge.       We urge you to bring Paul's nomination to a vote, and to      vote to confirm.           Very truly yours,     Sean W. Gallagher,     Mark S. Ouweleen.                                  ____                                                     May 15, 2012.       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell, We      write in strong support of Paul Watford's nomination to be a      Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth      Circuit. All of us served as law clerks at the Supreme Court      during the same year that Paul clerked for Justice Ruth Bader      Ginsburg (the October 1995 Term of the Court). During that      time, some of us worked with Paul directly in Justice      Ginsburg's chambers; others of us worked directly with Paul      on cases that we were assigned to in common; and all of us      got to know Paul as a colleague. Based on what we saw then,      and what we know of Paul's career in the years since, we      believe that Paul is a superb choice to be a Judge on the      Ninth Circuit. We encourage you to support his nomination and      to bring it to a vote expeditiously.       Paul came to the Supreme Court after clerking for Circuit      Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan appointee, and after attending      UCLA Law School. His path to a Supreme Court clerkship      reflected his work ethic and his legal acumen. At the Supreme      Court, Paul brought those qualities to bear in analyzing      difficult legal problems and finding ways to explain them      clearly and sensibly. In so doing, Paul won respect from      everyone he worked with. Paul invariably got along well with      his peers, was always a superb listener, and treated everyone      with kindness and respect. Those of us who clerked with Paul      for Justice Ginsburg know that she praised his work as      exemplary and that she is a tough judge of legal talent.       After leaving the Court, Paul has had a distinguished legal      career in public service and private practice. At the United      States Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, Paul was a standout      lawyer in the criminal division and appeared regularly before      the Ninth Circuit. For many years, Paul has been a partner at      Munger, Tolles & Olson, where he helps lead that firm's      appellate practice and has represented a wide range of      commercial clients in important and complex appellate      matters. Paul has been a lawyer representative to the Ninth      Circuit Judicial Conference, and has achieved distinction in      the profession. Given his experience as a law clerk, as a      federal prosecutor, and as a lawyer in private practice, Paul      has an ideal background for the position of a Circuit Judge.       The group below is composed of individuals with very      different political viewpoints and represents clerks from the      chambers of every Justice on the Supreme Court during the      OT95 term. We are unanimous in our view that Paul possesses      all the qualities characteristic of the most highly regarded      jurists: powerful analytical abilities, a readiness to listen      to and consider fairly all points of view, a calm      temperament, and a prodigious work ethic. We respectfully      request that the Senate bring Paul's nomination to a vote and      confirm him to the Ninth Circuit.           Sincerely,         Julia Ambrose, David Barron, Stuart Benjamin, Yochai            Benkler, Steve Chanenson, Nancy Combs, Jeff Dobbins,            Charlie Duggan, Ward Farnsworth, Lisa Beattie            Frelinghuysen, Shawn Fagan, Sean Gallagher, Heather            Gerken, Craig Goldblatt, Mark Harris, Julie Katzman,            Joseph Kearney, Steve Kinnaird, Kelly Klaus, Laurie            Allen Mullig, Eileen Mullen, Kate Moore, Jennifer            Newstead, Gretchen Rubin, Kevin Russell, Maria Simon,            Simon Steel, Ted Ullyot, Phil Weiser, Mike Wishnie,            Michael Wong, Ernie Young.                                  ____     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 522 Hart Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 433          Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 361A Russell Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 135          Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell,      Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Grassley: We write in      support of the nomination of Paul J. Watford to the United      States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Like Mr.      Watford, we have all clerked for the Honorable Alex Kozinski      of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and we      wish to echo the strong support that Chief Judge Kozinski has      given to Mr. Watford.       All of us believe that Mr. Watford has the ability and      character to be an excellent federal appellate judge. Mr.      Watford has a stellar reputation in the legal community. He      is known not only for his intelligence, but also for his      collegiality and even temperament. For those of us who know      Mr. Watford personally, his graciousness, sincerity and      brilliance are immediately apparent.       Mr. Watford's legal career confirms that he has the      experience, skills and demeanor well-suited for the bench. He      clerked for two distinguished jurists, then-Judge Kozinski on      the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Justice      Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court of the United      States. He served in the Department of Justice as an      Assistant United States Attorney in the Central District of      California. Mr. Watford is currently a partner in the Los      Angeles office of Munger, Tolles, & Olson LLP, a well-     respected law firm. He also has taught a course on judicial      writing for prospective law clerks at USC's Gould School of      Law. In his experiences in public service and private      practice, Mr. Watford has gained the respect and admiration      of his peers. At every stage of his career, he has      demonstrated a strong work ethic, a judicious temperament,      unquestionable 1 integrity, a collaborative and respectful      manner, and a deeply thoughtful approach to each and every      issue that has crossed his desk.       As a close family of Kozinski clerks, we share Chief Judge      Kozinski's strong faith in Mr. Watford's abilities. We      believe he has the necessary qualifications and      characteristics to make an exemplary federal appellate judge.      Based on his record and personality, we have no doubt that      Mr. Watford would approach each case with an open mind and      make thoughtful judgments based on the law. Accordingly, we      recommend him for this position without hesitation or      reservation.           Sincerely,       Jerry L. Anderson, Drake University Law School, Judge Alex      Kozinski (1986 1987); Fred A. Bernstein, Judge Alex Kozinski      (1996 1997); James Burnham, Judge Alex Kozinski (2009 2010);      Steven A.

Re Nomination of Paul J. Watford as Circuit Judge of the U.S.          Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write      to express our support for the nomination of Paul J. Watford      to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and urge      that the Committee promptly and favorably act to send his      nomination to the floor for confirmation. We are General      Counsels of a broad spectrum of American businesses.      Everything we know about Mr. Watford, both from the direct      contact some of us have had to others who have only seen his      work, indicates that he would be a superb addition to the      bench.       For the last 11 years of private practice at one of the      nation's premier law firms, Mr. Watford has represented a      broad spectrum of clients, both in private industry as well      as in the public sector. In doing so, he has demonstrated an      understanding of the legal and economic challenges faced in      both spheres, and an appreciation for the importance of fair,      consistent application of the rules of law that govern      business. The jobs, goods and services that constitute our      economy require exactly that objective and impartial approach      to deciding the important legal principles that come before a      court such as the Ninth Circuit. We have every confidence      that Mr. Watford has the right experience, intellect and      character for such an important role in the judiciary.       It also is noteworthy that Mr. Watford's experiences prior      to joining private practice demonstrate the same even-handed      perspective. He served as a law clerk on the Ninth Circuit      and on the Supreme Court to jurists who are known to come at      issues from very different places and often end at very      different conclusions. Working closely with such diverse      intellects is emblematic of Mr. Watford's own capabilities      and temperament, and his legal talents are reflective of      their skills as well. He is a superb writer, a keen      intellect, a strong oral advocate, and someone with a genuine      appreciation for the real interests on all sides. He is      exactly the kind of individual that any plaintiff or      defendant--person, business or government--would welcome      deciding their case, and would trust would do so fairly.       We urge the Committee to swiftly and favorably act on Mr.      Watford's nomination.           Respectfully,         Alan J. Glass, Vice President, General Counsel &            Secretary, CIRCOR International, Inc.; Randal S. Milch,            Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Verizon            Communications Inc.; Bob Normile, Executive Vice            President and Chief Legal Officer, Mattel, Inc.; Kent            Walker, Senior Vice President and General Counsel,            Google, Inc.                                  ____                                                 Mattel, Inc.,                                 El Segundo, CA, January 31, 2012.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, 224 Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, 224 Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I write this      letter in support of the nomination of Paul Watford to the      United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I have      known Paul on a professional basis for a number of years, and      can personally attest to his reputation for being remarkably      intelligent, insightful and evenhanded. He is highly regarded      within his firm, amongst his clients, and within the wider      legal community for his exceptional skills as an appellate      practitioner. More importantly, he is remarkably sincere and      friendly, and working with him is always a pleasure.       Paul enjoys an exemplary record as an attorney: UCLA Law      Review Editor, clerk to Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth      Circuit, clerk to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the U.S.      Supreme Court, Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, and      currently, a partner at the esteemed firm of Munger, Tolles &      Olson. Paul has had significant, substantive involvement in      bar association activities; most notably, he served as the      Chair of the ABA Litigation Section's Appellate Practice      Committee, and on the ABA's Amicus Curiae Committee. In      addition, Paul shares his talent and time with the broader      community, serving on the board of a non-profit legal      services provider for low income clients and teaching upper-     division legal writing at USC. Certainly, Paul's resume is      testament to his stellar qualifications and his dedication to      the law.       Paul has assisted Mattel with several appellate matters.      His analysis, reasoning and writing is of the highest      caliber. His performance as a ``judge'' on a moot court      panel, however, is what stands out most in my mind. His      questions went right to the core issues, his follow-up      questioning was quick and insightful, and his discussion of      legal nuances and distinctions came easily and naturally. As      always, his demeanor was thoughtful, attentive and      respectful. Paul has all the hallmarks of an excellent      jurist, and I highly endorse his appointment to the Ninth      Circuit.           Sincerely,                                                   Jill E. Thomas.
