Barton has just said, if you want an example of a truly great legislator, a legislator who has year after year sat down with both sides of the aisle, with all the different interest groups that are represented in this Congress, and worked together to bring consensus to quality legislation, you could have no better example than John Dingell.  So I am pleased to rise, Mr. Dingell, and express great admiration, respect, and deep affection for you, which I know is shared by all of your colleagues.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:        This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Defense      Appropriations Act, 2012''.
