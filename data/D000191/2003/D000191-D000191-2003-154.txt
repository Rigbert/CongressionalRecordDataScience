Chairman, I commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) on his fierce advocacy on this issue and the fact that we are beginning to see some movement on the part of the Port Authority. It is astounding they have not undertaken such a study. I want to continue to work with the gentleman and the Chair and others to see that we begin to move ahead on this issue.
