Speaker, what have Members been hearing in their districts? I will tell Members what I have been hearing: There is a constant uproar and anguish about the gas prices across this country.  One of the home builders that I met with earlier this week, it cost him $94 to fill up his pickup. Sadly, I do not see that price going down any time soon. This is a long-term, not a short-term, problem.  Worldwide, we consume what we produce. This country uses 25 percent of the world's energy, yet we have only 2.5 percent of the world's energy reserves. And in fact in Alaska, we are getting 50 percent of what we got only 7 years ago.  The energy bill signed in August will help us in the long term, but it will not help us in the short term. This bill will help us in the long term, not in the short term.  We have heard the arguments. We have fewer refineries than we had 30 years ago. We have not built a new refinery in a generation. We need more, and this bill will bring that about.  We have dozens of boutique fuels, 45 different blends of gasoline to serve this country. That means we have a different blend for St. Louis than Milwaukee than Detroit than Los Angeles than Houston than Philadelphia than Washington. It is crazy.                              {time}  1130  This bill is going to reduce that from 45 blends to no more than six or eight.  The bottom line is if we are not happy with $3 gas, we need to vote ``yes'' on this bill. We need to send it to the Senate. I will remind my colleagues that this bill passed by a voice vote after 16 hours of markup, and I applaud the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), my chairman, for making sure we did it in a bipartisan way.
