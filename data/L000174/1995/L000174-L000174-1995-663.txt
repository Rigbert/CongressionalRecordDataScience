President, today the USDA issued a report analyzing the effects of the House Republican Personal Responsibility Act (H.R. 4), which is part of the Contract With America. All States including Vermont are big losers. I suggest that all Senators read this report which I am inserting into the Record.  My home State of Vermont alone will lose $10 million in Federal nutrition aid in 1996 according to the USDA report.  H.R. 4 will increase malnutrition among children and the elderly. This Contract With America bill is antichild, antifamily, and it is false advertising. It promises block grants, but delivers not even a penny.  The report also concludes that this bill could reduce retail food sales by as much as $10 billion, reduce gross farm income by as much as $4 billion, and cost the economy as many as 138,000 jobs.  It could reduce the income of the average dairy farmer in Vermont by as much as $2,000 per year and could also double the cost of the dairy program nationwide.  This is a double whammy--it will force dairy farmers to apply for food assistance just when that assistance is slashed.  Nutrition funding nationwide will be cut by almost $31 billion over the next 5 years.  It eliminates the Meals on Wheels Program which provides food to the homebound elderly.  Seventy-five percent of the school children in Vermont will be thrown off the School Lunch Program. Nutrition standards for healthy school lunches are eliminated. And the cuts in child nutrition in Vermont exceed the total size of our School Breakfast Program and the Summer Food Service Program.  As bad as this is, I am worried that the USDA report issued today greatly understates the harm that will be caused by the Contract With America. The report in many respects assumes that the block grants will be fully funded. I believe that in a couple years, they will be only funded at a fraction of the full amount authorized.  America's Governors will be stunned when they read the fine print and realize they have to come to Washington each year and plead for money.  States will be forced to reduce the number of people served, cut benefits or somehow make up for the loss with State funds.  The effect would be even worse during a recession. Under current law, programs such as school lunch, food stamps, and the Child Care Food Program, automatically give States more money to respond to increased needs during periods of higher unemployment.  This Contract With America bill changes all that and says to the States, ``tough luck, next time don't have a recession.''  According to the USDA report, if that bill had been in effect over the last 5 years, the block grant in 1994 would have been over $12 billion less than the food assistance actually provided--a reduction of about one-third.  They are proposing a massive Federal experiment on America's children. If it works, I admit that Federal costs will be reduced.  If it doesn't, and funding is not provided, millions of children, the elderly, and pregnant women will go hungry. Medical costs will skyrocket as more and more children are born disabled, and more and more children become handicapped in their efforts to learn.  Before we have a wholesale dismantling of every major nutrition program under the guise of welfare reform, we ought to take a look at how this will affect hungry children.  This is not welfare reform. Do not be fooled by this bill. It implies that States will get block grants to fund food assistance programs. But as I said earlier, not one penny is provided to states or communities by the bill--separate legislation would have to pass each year to provide funding.  Let us not forget what happened in early 1981--hasty cuts were made in child nutrition programs. Those programs were cut by 28 percent. The cuts resulted in 3 million fewer children receiving school lunches.  I stand ready to work with responsible Members of both parties to encourage work, to cut costs, to punish abuse, but I will not sacrifice the nutrition of America's children for legislation by bumper sticker.  I ask unanamous consent that the USDA report be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [From the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Jan. 17, 1995] The Nutrition, Health, and Economic Consequences of Block Grants for           Federal Food Assistance Programs--Executive Summary        The proposed Personal Responsibility Act, a key component      of the Contract with America, would make sweeping changes      that alter the very character of the existing food assistance      programs. Specifically, the Personal Responsibility Act, if      enacted, would:       Combine all USDA food and nutrition assistance programs      into a single discretionary block grant to States;       Authorize an appropriation of $35.6 billion in fiscal year      1996 for food and nutrition assistance;       Eliminate all uniform national standards;       Give States broad discretion to design food and nutrition      assistance programs, provided only that no more than 5      percent of the grant support administration, at least 12      percent support food assistance and nutrition education for      women, infants, and young children, and at least 20 percent      support school-based and child-care meal programs; and       Eliminate USDA's authority to donate commodities; USDA      could only sell bonus commodities to States.       The consequences of these changes on the safety net of food      assistance programs, the nutrition and health of low-income      Americans, the food and agriculture economies, and the level      and distribution of Federal support to States for food      assistance are significant.       The Personal Responsibility Act would significantly reduce      federal support for food and nutrition assistance.       Federal funding for food and nutrition assistance would      fall by more than $5 billion in fiscal year 1996 and nearly      $31 billion over 5 years (Table 1).       All food and nutrition assistance would be forced to      compete for limited discretionary funds. States' ability to      deliver nutrition benefits would be subject to changing      annual appropriation priorities.       Programs would be unable to respond to changing economic      circumstances. During economic downturns, funding would not      keep up with rising poverty and unemployment. The demand for      assistance to help the poor would be greatest at precisely      the time when state economies are in recession and tax bases      are shrinking.       For example, if the Personal Responsibility Act had been in      place over the last five years--a period marked by both      economic recession and recovery--the block grant in 1994      would have been over $12 billion less than the food      assistance actually provided, a reduction of about one-third      (Table 2).       States would be forced to reduce the number of people      served, the benefits provided, or some combination of both.      The bill could lead to the termination of benefits for 6      million food stamp recipients in fiscal year 1996.       The reduced investment in food and nutrition assistance      programs and elimination of the authority to establish      nutrition standards will adversely affect the nutrition and      health of low-income families and individuals.       The scientific link between diet and health is clear. About      300,000 deaths each year are linked to diet and activity      patterns.       Low-income households are at greater risk of nutrition-     related disorders and chronic disease than the general U.S.      population. Since the nationwide expansion of the Food Stamp      Program and the introduction of WIC, the gap between the      diets of low-income and other families has narrowed.       The incidence of stunting among pre-school children has      decreased by nearly 65 percent; the incidence of low      birthweight has fallen from 8.3 percent to 7.0 percent.       The prevalence of anemia among low-income pre-school      children has dropped by 5 percent or more for most age and      racial/ethnic groups.       The Personal Responsibility Act would eliminate all federal      nutrition standards, including those in place to ensure that      America's children have access to healthy meals at school.      Even small improvements in average dietary intakes can have      great value. The modest reductions in fat, saturated fat, and      cholesterol intake due to the recent food labeling changes      were valued by the Food and Drug Administration at $4.4      billion to $26.5 billion over 20 years among the U.S. adult      population.       [[Page S959]] The Act would also threaten the key      components of WIC--a tightly prescribed combination of a      targeted food package, nutrition counseling, and direct links      to health care. Rigorous studies have shown that WIC reduces      infant deaths, low birthweight, premature births, and other      problems. Every dollar spent on WIC results in between $1.77      and $3.13 in Medicaid savings for newborns and their mothers.       By reducing federal support for food assistance and      converting all remaining food assistance to a block grant,      the Personal Responsibility Act would lower retail food      sales, reduce farm income, and increase unemployment.       Under the proposed block grant, States could immediately      cash-out any and all food assistance programs in spite of      evidence that an in-kind benefit is more effective in      stimulating food purchases than a similar benefit provided in      cash.       In the short-run, the bill could reduce retail food sales      by as much as $10 billion, reduce gross farm income by as      much as $4 billion, increase farm program costs, and cost the      economy as many as 138,000 jobs.       In the long run, the bill could reduce employment in farm      production by more than 15,000 jobs and output by more than      $1 billion. The food processing and distribution sectors      could lose as many as 83,000 jobs and $9 billion in output.       The economic effects would be felt most heavily in rural      America. In both the short- and long-run, rural areas would      suffer disproportionate job losses.       Every $1 billion in added food assistance generates about      25,000 jobs, providing an automatic stabilizer in hard times.       The proposed basis for distributing grant funds would      result in substantial losses for most States.       If Congress appropriates the full amount authorized, all      but 8 States would lose federal funding in fiscal year 1996.      California could gain about $650 million; Texas could lose      more than $1 billion (Table 3).       Although some States initially gain funding, all States      would eventually fare worse than under current law. Over      time, the initial gains will erode because the block grant      eliminates the automatic funding adjustments built into the      existing Food Stamp and Child Nutrition programs.
