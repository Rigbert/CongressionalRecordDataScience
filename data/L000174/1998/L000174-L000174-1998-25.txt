President, there are currently 21 qualified nominees on the Senate calendar who have been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. Ten of those nominations would fill judicial emergency vacancies, which have been without a judge for over 18 months. We have been trying for days, weeks, months and in some cases years to get votes on these nominees.  The Majority Leader has yet to call up the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. That nomination was first received by the Senate back in January 1996, almost three years ago. His nomination was delayed at every stage and this is now the judicial nomination that has been pending the longest on the Senate Executive Calendar this year, seven months. Over the last few days the Majority Leader has repeatedly indicated that he would be calling up this nomination, but he has not done so.  I have heard rumors that some on the Republican side planned to filibuster this nomination. I cannot recall a judicial nomination being successfully filibustered. I do recall earlier this year when the Republican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I noted how improper it would be to filibuster a judicial nomination. During this year's long-delayed debate on the confirmation of Margaret Morrow, Senator Hatch said: ``I think it is a travesty if we ever start getting into a game of filibustering judges.'' Well, it appears that travesty was successfully threatened by some on the Republican side of the aisle and kept the Majority Leader from fulfilling his commitment to call up the nomination for a confirmation vote.  Like the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division, it appears that some on the Republican side have decided to take the Paez nomination as a partisan trophy and to kill it--and to do so through obstruction and delay rather than allowing the Senate to vote up or down on the nomination.  Judge Paez and all 21 judicial nominations recommended to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee deserve better. They should be cleared for confirmation without further delay. I note that of the 21 judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, 19 were reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee over the last five months. Those judicial nominations which cannot be cleared by unanimous consent ought to be scheduled for debate and a confirmation vote without further delay.  Let me put this in perspective: Most Congresses end without any judicial nominations left on the Senate Executive Calendar. The Senate calendar is usually cleared of such nominations by a confirmations vote. Indeed the 99th, 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses all ended without a single judicial nomination left on the Senate calendar. The Democratic Senate majority in the two Congresses of the Bush Administration ended both those Congresses, the 101st and 102nd, without a single judicial nomination on the calendar.  By contrast, the Republican Senate majority in the last Congress, the 104th, left an unprecedented seven judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar at adjournment without Senate action. And today, this Senate still has 21 judicial nominations on its calendar. The goal should be to vote on all judicial nominations on the calendar. To leave as many as seven judicial nominations without action at the end of this Congress is shameful; to be toying with the prospect of 21 is irresponsible.  In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focused again on the problem of ``too few judges and too much work.'' He noted the vacancy crisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency vacancies and observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.''  That is good advice. That is what this Senate should do, take up these nominations and vote them up or vote them down. I believe that if the Senate were given an opportunity to have a fair vote on the merits of the nomination of Judge Richard Paez or Timothy Dyk or any of the 21 judicial nominations pending on the Senate Executive Calendar, they would be confirmed. Perhaps that is why we are not being allowed to vote.  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the number of judicial vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.'' I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and work to fulfil our constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are harming the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.  We began this year with the criticism of the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court ringing in our ears: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.'' Nonetheless, instead of sustained effort by the Senate to close the judicial vacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays continued and unjustified and anonymous ``holds'' become regular order.  To date, the Senate has actually been losing ground to normal attrition over the last two years. When Congress adjourned in 1996 there were 64 vacancies on the federal bench. In the last 24 months, another 87 vacancies have opened. And so, after the confirmation of 36 judges in 1997 and 48 so far this year, there has still been a net increase in judicial vacancies. The Senate has not even kept up with attrition. There are more vacancies in the federal judiciary today than when the Senate adjourned in 1996.  This is without regard to the Senate's refusal to consider the authorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary to deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources bythe Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created judgeships during a Republican presidential administration. Last year the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S. 678, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have 120 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past two years. In that light, the judicial vacancies crisis continues unabated.  In order to understand why a judicial vacancies crisis is plaguing so many federal courts, we need only recall how unproductive the Republican Senate has been over the last three years. More and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for longer periods of time. The President has sent the Senate qualified nominees for 23 of those judicial emergency vacancies, nominations that are still pending as the Senate prepares to adjourn.  When the American people consider how the Senate is meeting its responsibilities with respect to judicial vacancies, it must recall that as recently as 1994, the last year in which the Senate majority was Democratic, the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the Republican Senate three years to reach the century mark for judicial confirmations--to accomplish what we did in one session.  Unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be attributed to newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the vacancies crisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move quickly to consider nominees to longstanding vacancies.  No one should take comfort from the number of confirmations achieved so far this year. It is only in comparison to the dismal achievements of the last two years that 48 judicial confirmations could be seen as an improvement. I recall that in 1992, during a presidential election year and President Bush's last year in office, a Democratic Senate confirmed 66 of his nominations.  I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace. Instead, the Senate has confirmed only 48 judicial nominees instead of the 84 judges the Senate would have confirmed had it maintained the pace it achieved at the end of last year. The Senate has acted to confirm only 48 of the 91 nominations received for the 115 vacancies the federal judiciary experienced this year.  I know that some are still playing a political game of payback for the defeat of the nomination of Judge Bork to the Supreme Court and other Republican judicial nomination over the last decade. I remind the Senate that the Senate voted on the Bork nomination and voted on the nomination of Clarence Thomas and did so in each case in less than 15 weeks. To delay judicial nominations for months and years and to deny them a vote is wrong.                          ____________________
