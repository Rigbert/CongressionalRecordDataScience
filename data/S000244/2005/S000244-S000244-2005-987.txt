Speaker, the motion to recommit is not germane to the original text of the House Joint Resolution 10.  House Joint Resolution 10 proposes an amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. The material proposed to be inserted in the motion to recommit, sections 2 and following, has nothing to do with the subject of prohibiting the physical desecration of the flag and, thus, is not germane under the rules of the House.
