The difference, of course, the $20.3 billion, or $21 billion, for reconstruction. I concede we have to add to our deficit and borrow from the trust fund to support the troops. I will do that and go home and defend it. But when it comes to the $20 billion for reconstruction, this administration is asking 15 or 16 times more than they were asking 6 months ago.  So let's be very clear to the American people. The reconstruction of Iraq, with a total cost of $60 billion, is just getting started with this bill. We are in for the long haul, if we pass this bill as written.  Senator Byrd has an appropriate amendment he offered in committee. Let's separate it. Let's vote for the support of troops. Let's make that clear and get it done. But then, to go on beyond that and the reconstruction, let's address that in the specific terms it deserves.  I yield the floor.
