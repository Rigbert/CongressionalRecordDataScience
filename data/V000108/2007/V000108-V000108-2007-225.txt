On Friday, June 1, 2007, the Lake County Electricians Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (JATC) will honor the class of 2007 at their annual Apprentice Completion Banquet, which will be held at the Avalon Manor Banquet Hall in Merrillville, Indiana.  This year, the Lake County Electricians JATC will be recognizing and honoring the following graduates, who have completed the apprentice training: Angel Alvarez, Gregory Breitzke, Ryan Cleveringa, Justin Copak, Christopher Curatolo, Matthew Deering, Sr., Steven Dodd, Brandon Fritzsche, Ryan Gregory, Brion Grooms, Dustin Hall, Daniel Kanelopoulos II, Michael Keilman, Antonio Kendrick, Christopher Levenson, Christopher Nighbert, Carlos Reices, Raymond Rodriguez, Jose Sanchez, Micah Schantz, Matthew Summers, Billy Thomas, Dave Waffler, Ryan Williams, and Robert Willis, Jr.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen.

They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their commitment, hard work, and selfless sacrifice.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these committed, hardworking individuals. Along with the other extraordinary men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have contributed in many ways to the growth and development of the economy in Indiana's First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
