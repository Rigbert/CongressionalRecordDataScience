  Mr. President, this amendment is designed to close several loopholes in laws that allow juveniles to obtain big guns. The amendment will ban juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault weapons. It will ban juvenile possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines. It will ban future importation of large-capacity ammunition magazines, and it makes the transfer of a handgun, semiautomatic assault weapon or high-capacity clip to a juvenile a felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison.  It increases the maximum penalty for transferring a handgun to a juvenile, with knowledge that it will be used to commit a crime, from 10 to 20 years. It does that same thing for transfer of a semiautomatic assault weapon to a juvenile.  I think we have had a good discussion on the first part of the amendment with Senator Ashcroft's legislation; that is, the amendment banning juvenile possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon. Current law already prohibits any person under the age of 18 from owning or possessing a handgun, with certain very limited exceptions. Yet, the law does nothing to prevent a juvenile from possessing the deadliest of assault weapons, those banned by our legislation of 1994. This would close that loophole.  Secondly, the amendment bans juvenile possession of large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices.  Now, what is a large-capacity ammunition-feeding device? It is something like this, where 30 rounds go into this clip. The clip goes up into the weapon, and you can use the weapon and spray fire, having a large number of bullets. Most assault weapons come standard with 20- or 30-round clips. These big drums or clips are the tools that allow a person to rapidly fire shot after shot after shot with no opportunity to be disarmed.  As I said earlier, they have no sporting purpose. Anybody who sees somebody deer hunting with one of these, root for the deer because you don't have much of a hunter if it takes 30 bullets in an assault weapon to take down a deer.  For both of these two provisions, the ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons and high-capacity clips, there are two exceptions. A juvenile may still use or possess a handgun, assault weapon, or high-capacity ammunition magazine if he or she is a member of the Armed Forces or the National Guard, and the use of such items is in the line of duty. Secondly, a juvenile may still use or possess a handgun, assault weapon, or high-capacity ammunition if these items are temporarily being used to defend a home. So, in other words, if there is one in the home and the home is invaded by a number of masked gunmen, the youth can certainly legally pick up that weapon to defend himself or herself. Throughout my amendment, a juvenile is defined as a person under the age of 18.  The third provision I have offered would finally stop the importation of large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices, and that is what the other side of the aisle wants to permit to continue to happen. As I mentioned earlier when we passed the legislation in 1994, a grandfather clause was in it to permit those shipments that have bills of lading on them to come into the country. What a mistake I made at that time. I should have fought it tooth and nail. It was then expanded, and you have the loophole that exists today. It has now been more than 4 years, and I believe anybody who has made pre-1994 assault weapons and clips has had an opportunity to import them into this Nation. My goodness, BATF, in 6 months, approves permits for 8.6 million of them. Now, look at the number of years that have gone by already. If you multiply every 6 months by 8.6 million, you will get a sense of the number that are coming in.  Let me say, once again, it is illegal to manufacture them domestically, sell them domestically, and possess them domestically, if they were made after the ban. The problem is, BATF has no way of knowing whether the clip, once it is in, was made before or after the ban because BATF can't go to Austria, or Great Britain, or Italy, or Zimbabwe, or Czechoslovakia, or East Germany, or any of these other places where these big clips are made and brought into this country.  Last year, the President stopped the importation of most copycat assault weapons into this country with an executive order. The Justice Department has advised that the President doesn't have the authority to ban the big clips and close the loophole. That is why the legislation is before us today.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled ``Firearms and Explosives Import Branch, High-Capacity Magazine Import Totals, 3/98 to 7/98'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES IMPORTS BRANCH, HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINE IMPORT                 TOTALS, BY COUNTRY OF
