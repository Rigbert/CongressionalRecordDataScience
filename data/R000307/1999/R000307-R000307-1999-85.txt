President, there is strong bipartisan support to address the problem of unequal quorum call time charges. We simply cannot let this injustice go on. Let us take action. So to rectify this situation, I now suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.
