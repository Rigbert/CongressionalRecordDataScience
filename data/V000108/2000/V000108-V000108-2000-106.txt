Speaker, I apologize for my absence recently from the House of Representatives on June 13, 2000.  On June 13, 2000, I was unavoidably detained at a school event for my youngest son, and unfortunately missed one recorded vote. Had I been present, I would have voted Aye for Roll Call vote 265.                          ____________________
