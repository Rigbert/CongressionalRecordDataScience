President, tomorrow the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General. I look forward to those hearings and hope to ask some questions about his plans--if he, in fact, is confirmed as our next Attorney General--to repair some of the damage that has been done at the Justice Department. I am concerned that progress really isn't going to be possible without some significant changes there. In particular, I think we need new leadership at the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.  Today, I am joined by Senators Ted Kennedy and Russ Feingold in sending a letter to President Bush calling on him to withdraw the nomination ofSteven Bradbury to be head of the Office of Legal Counsel and to submit another nominee.
