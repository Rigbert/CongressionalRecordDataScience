 President, since 1963, the month of May has helped the nation focus on the contributions and achievements of America's older citizens. Fewer people over the age of 65 require nursing home care and more are living on their own, with little or no outside help. Older Americans increasingly redefine modern maturity, re-shape cultural boundaries and dispel age-related stereotypes associated with getting older. They are leaders in our families, in our workplaces and in our communities.  One of these leaders is a 76-year-old man from Mechanicsville, IA. John Sauer understands the value of helping others. Through his initiative, compassion and commitment, he has touched the lives of many in his community.  Mr. Sauer began volunteering with the local seniors group in 1992. At that time, he responded to a request from a friend to help out with the group for a short time. Today, not only does he continue to volunteer in Cedar County, but he also serves seniors in six other counties as chairman of the advisory council of the Heritage Area Agency on Aging.  Although Mr. Sauer has always been active in the community service, he took on many of his current activities after he retired from farming in 1994. At that time, Mr. Sauer became increasingly involved with county senior citizens groups. He joined the transportation board of the Cedar County Senior Citizens task force and began providing transportation for older people in his area who were unable to drive. Two or three times a week, Mr. Sauer drives seniors to and from doctor and hospital visits in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, both 25 miles away from Mechanicsville. The service Mr. Sauer provides is invaluable to those people who otherwise would have no way to make those important visits.  Mr. Sauer is also committed to serving the visually impaired. For 37 years, Mr. Sauer has been an active member of Lions Club International, a service organization recognized for their help to the blind and visually impaired. In 1994, Mr. Sauer became an Iowa district director for the organization. In that position, he traveled around the United States and Canada representing the state at various meetings and events for the service club.  In addition, Mr. Sauer has volunteered in the Opthamology Department at the University of Iowa Hospitals for the past 4 years. He greets people from across the Midwest who come to the hospital for care and guides them to their appointments. Mr. Sauer says he enjoys volunteering at the hospital because he likes meeting new people from various locations.  Mr. Sauer also enjoys learning new things. Three years ago, he became a member of the Eastern Iowa Mutual Insurance Board. Although his background was not in insurance, Mr. Sauer accepted the challenge of serving on the board and has enjoyed learning about the industry. He's also been active in the local schools, serving as a member of the school board and most recently on the school foundation. In addition, Mr. Sauer is an active member in his church and in the American Legion.  A devoted family man, Mr. Sauer has been married to his wife Kathleen for 51 years. The couple has three children and five grandchildren.  I want to thank Mr. Sauer for his contributions to the people of Cedar County. His initiative and compassionate concern for others is an example to us all that we should always be willing to contribute, no matter what our age.                          ____________________
