Carver who died on October 30, 2007 of wounds sustained when enemy forces engaged his unit with small-arms fire and an improvised explosive device in Baghdad, Iraq.  Born June 23, 1988, Cody joined the Army in November 2006. Upon completing basic training he returned to Oklahoma to serve as a hometown recruiter. He was then assigned to 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Benning, GA where he was deployed to Iraq on September 28, 2007.  Cody's father, Darrell Lee Carver, was wounded during the Vietnam war. That, along with the September 11, 2001 attacks was his motivation for joining the Army, his mother said. ``He had talked about joining the Army since the ninth grade. I guess it was about the same time 9/11 happened. That bothered him so bad, he just wanted to go and make it right,'' she said.  A memorial service was held on November 10, 2007 at Coweta High School, with burial at the Vernon Cemetery in Coweta, OK.  His mother remembers him as very much a single man with a huge sense of humor. ``I asked him at Valentine's Day if there was anyone he wanted me to send flowers to,'' said his mother. ``He said, `Mom, that would be too many flowers. You couldn't afford it.' ''  Cody is survived by his parents Darrel and Pam Carver of Haskell, OK, brothers Lee and Jake Carver of Haskell, OK, and his grandparents Charles Orsburn and Barbara Phillippe of Wagoner, OK, and Ronald and Edna Carver of Coweta, OK.  Today we remember Army PFC Cody M. Carver, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                  Sergeant First Class David R. Hurst
