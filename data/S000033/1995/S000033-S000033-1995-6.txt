 So, if a large company contributes a large amount of money to a party, and occasionally to the Democratic Party, and what they end up getting is major tax decreases, if the rich pay less in taxes, it is a pretty good investment.  Why not contribute a thousand dollars and pay $5,000 less in taxes?   Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, and that is, of course, what is going on.  What I would like to do with the gentleman's indulgence for a moment is to provide an alternative point of view as to where we should be going as a country, and let me just touch on a number of issues that I think this Congress should be dealing with tomorrow. Instead of cutting Medicare, and Medicaid, and student loans, let us look, in fact, what a Congress that was responsive to the needs of middle-class Americans and working people might be doing:  No. 1, raise the minimum wage. We cannot continue to have a minimum wage of 4-and-a-quarter an hour and have people working 40 hours a week and still living in poverty. The new jobs that are being created are low-wage jobs. Raise the minimum wage to at least $5.50 an hour.  Second, when we talk about welfare reform, and welfare does need to be reformed, we need jobs, we need jobs rebuilding America. There are so many needs, I am sure in Hawaii, and in Vermont, and all over this country. Our infrastructure is falling apart. We need help in improving our environment. Instead of laying off teachers, we need more teachers, we need more people going out to prevent disease. We can put large numbers of people to work at meaningful, important jobs at decent-paying wages instead of spending a hundred billion dollars a year defending Europe and Asia against a nonexistent enemy.  Let us rebuild America and put our people to work doing so.
