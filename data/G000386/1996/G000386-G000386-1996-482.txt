 President, in recent weeks we have seen a variety of events in Colombia that raise serious doubts about the extent to which the Government of Colombia is taking the steps necessary to ensure full cooperation with the United States on the issue of drugs. We are now approaching the annual period for certification. Under U.S. law, the President is required to certify annually whether major drug trafficking and producing countries are cooperating fully with the United States to end drug production, trafficking, and related drug activities.  Last year, we saw the Government of Colombia--facing the possibility of congressional sanctions--take more vigorous action to arrest several key figures in the Cali cocaine empire. Until that point the Government of Colombia had done little to arrest or prosecute these individuals. This was true even though their whereabouts was commonly known and they were frequently strutting around the streets of Colombia's major cities. I, among others of my colleagues, was encouraged by the steps taken to finally put these thugs behind bars.
