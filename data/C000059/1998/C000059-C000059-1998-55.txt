Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference report to H.R. 1757, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. This conference report accomplishes three important international goals by authorizing assistance to the democratic opposition in Iraq; reforming and consolidating the State Department; and most importantly, denying funding to foreign organizations that perform or promote abortions.  There is no justification for using our federal money to perform or promote abortions overseas, or here at home for that matter. This bill also takes an important step in consolidating two out of three international affairs agencies back into the State Department. And, it is important for the U.S. to support the democratic opposition in Iraq. The problems in the Middle East have continued for too long. It is time to put an end to Saddam Hussein's reign of terror.  I do not like the provision authorizing U.S. arrearages to the United Nations. I am no fan of the United Nations, and do not trust that institution to respect American sovereignty. It is our job as constitutionally elected representatives of the American people to protect our sovereignty. I am disappointed that this provision was included in such important legislation.  Again, I strongly support three out of the four key provisions of this bill, particularly regarding no U.S. funds being used to perform or promote foreign abortions. American foreign policy should not include promoting abortions, and no federal funding should be authorized abroad or domestically to pay for abortions. I urge President Clinton to do the right thing and sign this important legislation.
