Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman, Mr. Space, to express my appreciation for the concern he has for his constituency, as well as the gentlelady from West Virginia, and my colleague on the committee, Mr. Aderholt, who also raised an amendment in the full committee.  Again, I appreciate their work and their concern for the people in economic development of not only their individual constituencies, but their region, and certainly would pledge to continue to work with them to address their concerns.  Having said that, I would ask my colleague from Ohio to withdraw his amendment.                              {time}  1300
