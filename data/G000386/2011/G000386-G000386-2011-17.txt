 President, I want to speak about one of the votes we are going to have this afternoon, and it has nothing to do with Mr. Eisen's job as Ambassador. It is about why he has not been confirmed to this point.  The President announced Mr. Eisen's nomination to be Ambassador to the Czech Republic on June 28, 2010. On September 20, 2010, I provided public notice of my intention to object to the nomination. In other words, as I always do when I put a hold on something--a bill or a nomination--I put a reason in the Congressional Record so that everybody knows it is me. I am not a secret-holds guy.  The reason for my objection is not related to the substance of his duty as Ambassador; I object to his nomination because of the way Mr. Eisen handled the controversial firing of Gerald Walpin and the congressional inquiry into that firing. Mr. Walpin was the inspector general at the Corporation for National Community Service, AmeriCorps. Mr. Eisen was at the White House Counsel's office at the time.  Any attempt to undermine the independence and integrity of inspectors general raises serious concerns with me, and anybody ought to know that about this Senator. An inspector general who does his or her job runs the risk of losing friends at any agency as well as maybe the White House. The Congress must not sit idly by when an inspector general is removed improperly.  After the President abruptly removed Inspector General Walpin from office, there were allegations that he was fired for political reasons. So I started the investigation. There was evidence that the removal may have been motivated by a desire to protect a friend and political ally of the President, mayor of Sacramento Kevin Johnson.  The inspector general and CNCS management were clashing over an inquiry into misuse of Federal grant money at a charity run by Johnson. There were allegations that the grant money was used to pay for personal services for Johnson such as maybe washing his car. There seemed to be evidence of that. There were allegations that the grant money has been used to pay for political campaign work. So what would you expect an inspector general to do?  The IG was pushing aggressively to require Johnson to repay the Federal grant money that his charity could not account for. The inspector general was also pushing to have Johnson prohibited from receiving future Federal grant funds. This caused, as you might expect, a political uproar because some people feared that might prevent the city of Sacramento from receiving Federal stimulus dollars during the financial crisis.  All of this background cried out for further investigation. I also learned that Mr. Eisen personally delivered an ultimatum to Inspector General Walpin. He demanded the inspector general resign or be terminated within 1 hour. At the time he delivered the ultimatum, no notice had been given or provided to Congress as is legally required under the Inspector General Reform Act.  The IG Act requires the President to tell Congress the reasons for removal of an inspector general 30 days before taking action. That is what the law requires. Now, ironically, I cosponsored this provision with Senator Obama before he became President Obama. Thegoal of that provision is to make sure Congress is aware of why an inspector general is being removed.  We need independent inspectors general. They should not be removed for political reasons. So we need to make sure Congress is informed of the reasons for getting rid of an inspector general. Mr. Eisen's 1-hour ultimatum was an attempt to avoid that provision of law. If the inspector general had resigned under that pressure, Congress would not have received any notice and the reasons for his removal would have remained a secret, but Inspector General Walpin did not resign, and the President began the process of removing him with a 30-day notice. At first the notice merely said he had lost confidence in the inspector general. Senators from both political parties agreed that was too vague. So Mr. Eisen provided a second more detailed explanation. The second explanation said the inspector general had been ``confused and disoriented'' at a board meeting on May 20, 2009. It essentially implied that he might be senile.  So my staff met with Mr. Eisen to try to learn more. So here I give you another reason for my hold on Mr. Eisen. During that interview with the congressional staff on June 17, 2009, Mr. Eisen refused to answer at least 12 very direct questions. I wrote to the White House Counsel's office immediately after the interview. I listed the 12 questions he refused to answer and asked for written answers.  I never got a satisfactory reply. So I had to gather the facts independently. So Mr. Eisen did provide some information during this interview that very day in 2009. The problem is, the information turned out to be not true. Eisen tried to assure the staff that the firing was not politically motivated. He claimed the agency's bipartisan board of directors unanimously supported the removal of Inspector General Walpin before the President decided to remove him. He also claimed the White House conducted ``an extensive review'' in response to concerns raised by the board about Walpin's fitness for that office. He said this review was prompted by that incident at the May 20, 2009, board meeting where it appeared that the inspector general was disoriented.  When congressional investigators interviewed eyewitnesses, however, their accounts differed slightly. At a minimum, all agreed the inspector general lost his train of thought during the presentation. Others described it as being a more serious episode.  The chairman of the board of directors suggested telling the White House about what happened. No one on the board objected. So he went and met with Mr. Eisen in the White House Counsel's office.  Now, think about that, would you, please. If you think the inspector general might be suffering from some mental incapacity or illness, why would you run straight to the White House Counsel's office? It seems to me you would talk to his family or the people who worked with him every day about your concerns. That would be the only way to find out if there had been similar incidents or if it was only a one-time occurrence.  Instead, the chairman of the board asked Mr. Eisen at the White House Counsel's office to look into it. According to Mr. Eisen, he conducted ``an extensive review'' which then formed the basis for the President's decision to remove Walpin from office. However, our investigation finds no evidence that Mr. Eisen's review consisted of anything more than simply asking the CNCS management to describe their complaints about Mr. Walpin. Unlike the congressional review, Mr. Eisen did not interview each of the board members present at the May 20 meeting. He also did not interview the other Office of Inspector General employee who was present with Mr. Walpin during that board meeting where they said he was disoriented. Instead, Eisen merely collected from the agency details about various routine disagreements with the inspector general.  Now, get this. None of the evidence the agency provided to the White House related to Mr. Walpin's mental capacity to serve, even though that was the question that supposedly prompted the review in the first place. Mr. Eisen accepted the agency's version of those disagreements without even giving the inspector general a chance to respond.  Obviously, any agency is going to have some clashes with an inspector general, at least if that office operates as a truly independent and aggressive watchdog. Mr. Eisen did not provide Mr. Walpin or anyone else in the Office of Inspector General an opportunity to reply or give their side of the story. Mr. Eisen took action based upon incomplete information provided only by agency officials who had adversarial relationships with that inspector general.  He told Congress the May 20 incident was the reason for removing the inspector general. But Mr. Eisen failed to give Inspector General Walpin or anyone close to him a chance to tell his side of the story. To put it as simply as possible: That is just not fair.  On June 17, 2009, I wrote to White House counsel Gregory Craig listing 12 specific direct questions that Eisen refused to answer that day. Question No. 4 was this: Which witnesses were interviewed in the course of Mr. Eisen's review?  This question followed a more general question about what Mr. Eisen did in the course of his review. His answer to that prior more general question included the claim that he conducted witness interviews of the board members. However, he refused to specify which witnesses or how many witnesses he interviewed. Then he resorted to talking points rather than answering specific questions.  He replied along these lines: No. 1, we did an extensive review; No. 2, I am not going to get into the details; and, No. 3, all of the board members agreed, including the Republican board members.  Mr. Eisen clearly led the staff to believe that the President's decision was based in part on the unanimous agreement of the board that the inspector general should go. That was false. The account of Eisen's interview is based on memories of both House and Senate staff present at that time. Also present was a career law enforcement agent from the executive branch on temporary detail to my oversight and investigations staff whose recollections confirm this account as well.  In short, Mr. Eisen's lack of candor and cooperation cannot be mistaken for a misunderstanding or a miscommunication. There was no miscommunication. Attempts to remove an IG must be evaluated with strict scrutiny. When administration officials are asked to provide information to Congress, I expect to rely on those officials to provide the unvarnished truth. Evidence that a witness may have misled Congress is extremely serious.  Just last month, Mr. Eisen finally admitted his earlier statements were not true. He sent me a letter, and I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                November 20, 2011.       Dear Senator Grassley: Thanks very much for meeting with      me. I know how busy you are and I very much appreciate you      and your staff taking the time to talk about my service as      Ambassador to the Czech Republic. I also appreciate the      opportunity to discuss your concerns about my interactions      with staff relating to the removal of Gerald Walpin as the      Inspector General of the Corporation for National Community      Service (CNCS).       With respect to the Walpin matter, you have asked me to      clarify certain steps that were taken by the Administration      prior to my June 10, 2009 phone call with Mr. Walpin about      the President's decision to remove him from office. On May      20, 2009, the Chair of the CNCS Board, Alan Solomont,      notified the White House that the Board had serious concerns      about Mr. Walpin's performance. I personally spoke with Mr.      Solomont and obtained his independent recollection of the      events of the May 20 Board meeting. To be clear, at that      time, CNCS Board Members did not express to the White House,      verbally or otherwise, unanimous support for the removal of      Mr. Walpin. I believe that, on or about June 8 or 9, 2009,      White House personnel also communicated with a Republican      Board member, Vice-Chair Goldsmith. I do not recall any other      conversations with Board members prior to the removal.       Thanks again for seeing me and for allowing me to convey my      apology in connection with my June 17, 2009 meeting with      Congressional staff. It is now my understanding that I      answered a few of the questions inaccurately, although at the      time I thought they were accurate. Of course, it was not my      intent to mislead staff in any way, but to the extent that I      was unclear in my responses, or that my declining to answer      questions created confusion, I regret it and I sincerely      apologize. I have tremendous respect for the role that you      and your staff have played in     supporting the Inspector General community. I look forward to      working with you in the future on items of mutual interest.           Sincerely yours,                                                  Norman L. Eisen.
