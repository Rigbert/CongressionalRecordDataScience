Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of the City of Perris is exceptional. The City of Perris has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. John Denver is one of these individuals.  On January 26, 2001, John Denver was honored as the outgoing 1999-2000 President of the Perris Valley Chamber of Commerce. Most significantly, John's leadership over the past two years as President of the Perris Valley Chamber of Commerce led to tremendous strides in reunifying the Chamber. Additionally, Mr. Denver put enumerable hours into the Perris community's re-development, Student of the Month and Wake Up Perris programs.  John Denver's dedication to promoting the businesses, schools and community organizations of the Perris Valley make me proud to call him a community member and fellow American. I know that all of Perris Valley are grateful for his contribution to the betterment of the community and salute him as he departs the Perris Valley Chamber of Commerce after two years of service. I look forward to continuing to work with him for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
