Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again may I congratulate those that are offering these amendments. If we did not have this fragile house of cards put together, this would be very attractive because my State is owned right now 94 percent by the Federal Government. By the way, I do not think any land is being bought by the Federal Government, although there are some that do want to sell to the Federal Government. The money is not available. They are inholdings. Of course some of the inholdings very frankly do not want to sell and I am supporting them because I do not think the government ought to purchase those lands from an unwilling seller. But I do know I have those Members within some of our parks that were created by this Congress which I opposed and refuges that want to sell, and the appropriators do not appropriate the money to purchase the lands. I do not think that is fair because those people that own those inholdings do not have an opportunity to develop the lands, and they do not have the opportunity to really sell their lands, because nobody wants to buy them. I think we ought to appropriate the money and CARA would allow that.  I am telling the gentleman that the amendment for my State might make sense. But as a whole I do not think we ought to be involved in setting up separate States that say that 50 percent, then there is no land that can be purchased under this bill because there are willing sellers within my State. I know other States that would like to at that time get rid of their land and the only money available is from the Federal Government.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
