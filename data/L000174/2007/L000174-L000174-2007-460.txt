President, 75 years ago today, President Herbert Hoover signed a proclamation officially establishing the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont.  This was the result of significant effort on the part of the State of Vermont and several of the State's leading conservationists and legislators of the time. While a number of Vermonters had proposed a national forest in the State just after the turn of the 20th century, it took a sustained effort over the next three decades for this vision to become a reality.  In 1925, the Vermont General Assembly passed the enabling act to allow the Forest Service to purchase land in Vermont. Many would argue just 2 years later that the devastating impact of the 1927 flood showed the need for sound forest management practices in the Green Mountains. It was fitting that the initial land purchases for the southern half of Vermont's national forest were from the estate of Marshall J. Hapgood, who, years earlier, had advocated for a National Forest in the Green Mountains. Hapgood was a practitioner of scientific forestry on his own lands and saw the value of a sustainable timber resource and watershed protection.  From that initial Hapgood acquisition of just over 1,000 acres, the Green Mountain National Forest has grown to more than 400,000 acres today, and it includes in the northern half of the forest many of the lands conserved by another conservation pioneer, Joseph Battell.  The Green Mountain National Forest today is fulfilling the vision of those early forestland stewards by protecting watersheds, providing forest products, forest management demonstration and recreational opportunities. The Green Mountain forest hosts segments of the Long and Appalachian Trails, alpine ski areas, several wilderness areas and two national recreation areas, one of which is now named in honor of our late colleague, Robert T. Stafford.  As one of Vermont's Senators, I am proud to have been able to play a role in the growth of the national forest in my State, in both land area and with its facilities. I am also grateful to the dedicated, professional staff of the Green Mountain National Forest who recently completed the new land and resource management plan for the forest and who were particularly helpful to the congressional delegation during our recent wilderness deliberations.  As we celebrate its 75th anniversary, we are also proud that the Green Mountain National Forest will be providing the 2007 Capitol christmas tree for the National Mall, and the companion trees for many of our public buildings in Washington a tangible example of how the Green Mountain National Forest is being shared by all Americans.                          ____________________
