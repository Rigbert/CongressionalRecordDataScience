Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for being such a great sport and a representative of such a great team with such a great coach with Mike Davis, their coach handling himself so well. We are proud of the job he did.  Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago President Bush and congressional Republicans promised us that we could have it all. They said we could afford the largest tax cut in a generation and still be able to invest in domestic priorities, strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and pay off our publicly held debt. When we Democrats questioned whether we could afford the President's $1.7 trillion tax cut, and that is absent the additional interest we have to pay, which the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner) talked about, and still pay down the debt, our Republican colleagues responded there was a danger in paying off the publicly held debt too quickly.  Well, worry no more because we are not in any hurry to pay off any debt. In fact, we are in a hurry to incur a lot more debt. The OMB now projects that our national debt, which includes publicly held and intergovernmental debt, will approach $7.8 trillion by the end of 2007. That is $275 billion more debt than was projected at the beginning of last year. Just this month after congressional Republicans again rebuffed the request of the Secretary of Treasury, Mr. O'Neill, to increase the statutory debt limit of $5.59 trillion by $750 million, the administration was forced to borrow Federal employee retirement funds to ensure that the government meets its obligations. In other words, Federal employees' pension dollars are now funding government. The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill) spoke of that earlier in his remarks.  Do Members remember the last time that happened? It was back in 1995, and the GOP was blocking an increase in the debt ceiling in an attempt to get President Clinton to sign their budget. Treasury Secretary Rubin used the same short-term device that Secretary O'Neill is using to avoid a default. How did congressional Republicans respond? They reprimanded him. They threatened to impeach the Secretary of Treasury, and former Speaker Gingrich derided the tactic as ``looting.'' The gentleman referred to stealing Social Security funds. Mr. Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, said that what Bob Rubin was doing so we would not default in the payment of the monies that the richest Nation on the face of the earth owed, that he was prepared to say that he was looting the Treasury.  I have not heard one Republican come to this floor and say that Secretary Paul O'Neill is looting the Treasury. Now, I represent 58,000 Federal employees. I do not think we ought to be doing this policy; but frankly, we have an obligation to pay it back, and I think we are going to do that. But the fact of the matter is if Secretary O'Neill did not do it, this government would default on its debt. If that happened, the finances of the world would be put at risk.  Republicans, when Secretary O'Neill did it, neither criticized the administration for doing precisely the same thing that Secretary Rubin had done,and which sent them in orbit 7 years ago, nor accede to an increase in the debt ceiling. In other words, they do not want to make sure that we do not default, and they do not want to raise the debt. That is the definition of irresponsibility. That is the definition of pretending you are doing something when you are doing just the opposite.  My good friend, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner) said it exactly right. If we defaulted, interest rates would skyrocket. Average people, no matter how deeply their taxes were cut, could not afford their mortgage payment, particularly if they were an ARM, an adjustable mortgage. They could not afford to buy consumer goods with interest because interest rates would skyrocket. That would be an irresponsible policy, but it is the policy that we are pursuing today.  In what can only be described as a perverse twist, House Republicans intend to bring legislation to the floor in 2 days that will make last year's tax cut permanent and drive us even deeper into the fiscal ditch.  Mr. Speaker, I am not a Blue Dog; but I support much of what the Blue Dogs support, particularly as it relates to fiscal policy. Why? Because it is fundamental that if we do not manage our finances responsibly, we will not manage anything else responsibly. In just 15 months, our Nation has experienced the worst fiscal reversal in the history of the world; $5 trillion in projected surpluses have evaporated. Think of that. President Bush stood at this podium 12 months ago in February of 2001 and predicted, he said he was assured we were going to have a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. We said you better be careful. That is a long projection to make. You ought not to mortgage the farm based on what you think your income is going to be 6, 7, 8 years from now.  A month ago President Bush came to that same podium, presented a budget, and lo and behold the surplus he now projects over that same 10 years is $1.6 trillion. That is $4 trillion less. What he does not factor into that is because we have less surplus and are going into debt, we are going to have an additional $1 trillion in interest. We heard the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner) talking about that, which means we have lost $5 trillion in 12 months.  I wish Ross Perot would start having infomercials on that issue. It is critical. We cannot operate this great Nation with our responsibilities to our own citizens, and in the international community, operating as fiscally irresponsibly as that. Five trillion dollars. Our debt is climbing again, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, our on-budget accounts will be in deficit every year for the next 10 years, producing a total on-budget deficit of nearly $2 trillion.  Now, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill) talked about our policies in the 1990s. They are instructive because in 1992 we had a $292 billion annual operating deficit. We could not, nor should we have sustained that. So we came in in 1993, and we adopted a program. It cut spending deeply and it raised taxes. Some people would say that is an awful thing to do. What does raising taxes mean? I do not mean raising them in terms of increasing them. It means this generation is committed to paying for what it buys.  My position is if we do not want to pay for it, we ought not to buy it. I do not mean that we ought not to buy an aircraft carrier that we can amortize over 40 years. It is like buying a house, you mortgage it and pay it over time. We ought not to be paying for salaries that are used this year with borrowed money. That is how New York went bankrupt and we had to bail them out. We need to be responsible.  There is an extraordinary American sitting on the floor with us. He is the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Osborne), one of the greatest football coaches in the history of this country. He taught his young people fundamentals. He did not teach them to make some hail Mary pass, he hoped that would happen from time to time. What he taught them was how to block, how to tackle, how to run, how to watch what the other fellow was doing, how to learn your plays. He taught the fundamentals. He was convinced if those young people knew the fundamentals, they would win games. Because, as Gary Williams knows, as Coach Smith knows, if you teach young people the fundamentals, they will win games because they will do it right. And sometimes, yes, they will do something spectacular.  But a nation, a nation needs to pay attention to its fundamentals as well. Do any of my colleagues in this Chamber remember what the majority leader said last July? I talked about the President 12 months ago. Last July the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), majority leader of this House: ``We must understand that it is inviolate to intrude against either Social Security or Medicare; and if that means foregoing, or as it were paying for tax cuts, then we will do that,'' said the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey).  We are now some 9 months later. On Thursday, we are not going to do that. In our budget that we passed, not with my vote, just a few weeks ago, we did not do that. We preached fundamentals, but we are not playing fundamentals. And the losers will not be, frankly, any of us who sit on this floor. It will be our children and grandchildren, and it will be the fiscal integrity of this great Nation.  That promise turned out to be as empty as the GOP's lockbox stunt last year. The rally is that the Republican tax cut is the single largest factor in erasing our surpluses. Do we need to pay for the war on terrorism? Absolutely. Is it going to cost us more money than we expected? Yes. Should we follow that policy? Of course we should. We are in lock step with our President in confronting those who would undermine our security and safety in this land, and, very frankly, in other lands as well.  However, the Social Security and Medicare surpluses which were critical, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey) said, and would not be touched, are in fact going to be used 100 percent.  I have some other things to say about this policy, but I want to close with this. David Stockman in 1981 became director of the Office of Management and Budget.                              {time}  2145  He came in with a roar, like March, I suppose, and he was going to see that this budget was balanced. In fact, Ronald Reagan, when he signed the Reagan program in 1981 said the budget is going to be balanced by October of 1983. Or perhaps it was 1984.  In any event, it did not happen. Mr. Stockman, of course, was the director of OMB the same year I was elected to Congress. His mandate, sell President Reagan's supply side economic program. President Reagan assured us, as I said, that by fiscal 1984 we were going to balance the budget. We did not. Instead of producing increased revenue, the Reagan tax program threw us into fiscal freefall. The budget deficit, just under $79 billion in 1981, exploded until, as I said before, peaking at $290 billion in 1992. As David Stockman himself later admitted, and I quote, David Stockman, OMB director, ``I knew that we were on the precipice of triple digit deficits, a national debt in the trillions and destructive and profound dislocations throughout the American economy.''  David Stockman, in his book, looked back on his service with lament because he knew where we were going. My friends, it is clear where we are going if we continue to pursue these policies. What the Blue Dogs are saying is that we need to work together, not Republicans and Democrats, but 435 of us, elected by our people, to responsibly manage their country, their dollars, their hard-earned wages. We need to commit ourselves to doing that. I commend the Blue Dogs for their leadership on this most critical fundamental responsibility of this Congress.
