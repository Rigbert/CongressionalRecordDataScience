President, I thank you.  I welcome and commend Senator Kaufman as he succeeds Senator Joe Biden.  I particularly want to say a few words about Joe Biden. He has had an extraordinary career in the Senate, and he is going to be an extraordinary asset for President-elect Barack Obama.  Senator Obama, the President-elect, said very clearly why he chose Joe Biden. He said that when the tough decisions come, and they will come quickly and often, Joe Biden is the guy he wants in the room with him. And I think that choice was extraordinarily inspired because no one can bring the breadth of knowledge and experience, not only with respect to the Senate but with respect to domestic policy and indeed international policy, as Joe Biden.
