CRAIG. In these categories where people have found themselves immune if they do the following things--background check, through the registrant, under the conditions--it is important, do not think beyond the box. Think of the box of a gun show and gun show activities and the definitions therein of a special registrant and a new licensee. I am suggesting that we are trying to encourage people to become active in background checks and become increasingly legal by that.
