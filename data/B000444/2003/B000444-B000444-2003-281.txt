 Res. 40       Whereas in 1972, Congress enacted title IX of the Education      Amendments of 1972 (referred to in this resolution as ``title      IX''), the Federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination in      education;       Whereas title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in      11 areas of education, including admissions, financial aid,      academic programs, student services, classroom assignments,      vocational education, and athletics;       Whereas since the passage of title IX, opportunities for      women and girls in organized sports have dramatically      increased;       Whereas the number of female college athletes has increased      nearly 5-fold from fewer than 32,000 prior to enactment of      title IX to over 150,000 since enactment of title IX;       Whereas women currently constitute more than 40 percent of      all college athletes, compared with 15 percent in 1972;       Whereas female athletes have higher graduation rates than      female nonathletes;       Whereas a 2002 nationwide survey found that 82 percent of      women business executives played organized sports after      grammar school, including sports on school, intramural, or      recreational teams;       Whereas there has been a marked increase in the number of      female professional sports and athletes since enactment of      title IX;       Whereas at the high school level, almost 3,000,000 girls      are playing competitive sports today, while fewer than      300,000 girls played competitive sports prior to the      enactment of title IX;       Whereas today girls are entering high schools sports at      almost twice the rate of boys, as evidenced by the fact that      there were 108,208 new female high school athletes in 2000-     2001 versus 59,230 new male athletes in that year;       Whereas girls' participation in organized sports provides      opportunities for leadership, teamwork, and competition,      contributes to positive body image and good health, and      offers critical personal contact with adult role models;       Whereas girls who participate in sports are less likely to      take drugs, drink alcohol, smoke, or become pregnant than      their nonparticipating peers;       Whereas female athletes often serve as role models both at      school and within their communities;       Whereas while the past successes of title IX are      impressive, girls and women still need the full protections      of the Federal law;       Whereas in schools that participate in Division I of the      National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this      resolution as ``Division I schools''), women represent 53      percent of the student body, but they receive only 43 percent      of the total athletic scholarship dollars, 32 percent of the      recruiting dollars, and 36 percent of the operating budget      dollars;       Whereas in 2000, at Division I schools, for every $1 being      spent on women's sports, almost $2 was being spent on men's      sports;       Whereas from 1992 to 1997, men's athletic operating budgets      increased by 139 percent while women's athletic operating      budgets increased by only 89 percent;       Whereas compliance with title IX does not require schools      to eliminate men's sports teams, nor does title IX impose      strict quotas; and       Whereas all the Federal courts of appeals that have      considered the constitutionality of title IX have upheld the      regulations and requirements issued under title IX: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) reaffirms its commitment--       (A) to ending all discrimination against women and girls in      elementary, secondary, and higher education; and       (B) to equal opportunities for women and girl in athletics;       (2) recognizes the continued importance of title IX in      providing needed protections for women and girls;       (3) expresses its concern that rolling back title IX      regulations and compliance requirements may jeopardize the      extraordinary progress of women and girl athletes; and       (4) requests that the President maintain the integrity of      title IX by rejecting any attempts to weaken current      regulations and interpretations.
