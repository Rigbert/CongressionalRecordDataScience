Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I want to tell the gentleman from New York, and I want to tell the Members, that I know the gentleman is worried that he may not be on the floor when it comes up. I will protect the gentleman from New York on this and we will have a vote on it, because I will protect him if, per chance, he is not on the floor to make the point of order at that time.
