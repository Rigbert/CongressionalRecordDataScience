Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me time, and I rise in very strong support of H. Res. 393. I want to commend its sponsor and all of the Members who are taking part in this very important debate.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday, along with the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), who is on the floor and will be speaking momentarily, we returned back from the OSCE, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Parliamentary Assembly.  Every year, parliamentarians from the 55 nations that comprise the OSCE meet to discuss issues of importance. This year the focus was on terrorism, but we made sure that a number of other issues, because certainly anti-Semitism is inextricably linked to terrorism, were raised in a very profound way.  Yesterday, two very historic and I think very vital things happened in this debate. I had the privilege of cochairing a historic meeting on anti-Semitism with a counterpart, a member of the German Bundestag, Professor Gert Weisskirchen, who is a member of the Parliament there, also a professor of applied sciences at the University of Heidelberg, and we heard from four very serious, very credible and very profound voices in this battle to wage against anti-Semitism.  We heard from Abraham Foxman, the National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, who gave a very impassioned but also very empirical speech, that is to say he backed it up with statistics, with information about this rising tide of anti-Semitism, not just in Europe, but in the United States and Canada as well.  He pointed out, for example, according to their data, 17 percent of Americans are showing real anti-Semitic beliefs, and the ugliness of it. Sadly, among Latinos and African Americans, it is about 35 percent. He pointed out in Europe, in the aggregate, the anti-Semitism was about 30 percent of the population.  Dr. Shimon Samuels also spoke, who is the Director of the Wiesenthal Center in Paris. He too gave a very impassioned and very documented talk. He made the point that the slippery slope from hate speech to hate crime is clear. Seventy-two hours after the close of the Durban hate-fest, its virulence struck at the strategic and financial centers of the United States. He pointed out, ``If Durban was Mein Kampf, than 9/11 was Kristalnacht, a warning.  ``What starts with the Jews is a measure, an alarm signalling impending danger for global stability. The new anti-Semitic alliance is bound up with anti-Americanism under the cover of so-called anti-globalization.''  He also testified and said, ``The Holocaust for 30 years acted as a protective Teflon against blatant anti-Semitic expression. That Teflon has eroded, and what was considered distasteful and politically incorrect is becoming simply an opinion. But cocktail chatter at fine English dinners,'' he said, ``can end as Molotov cocktails against synagogues.  ``Political correctness is also eroding for others, as tolerance for multi-culturism gives way to populous voices in France, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Portugal and in the Netherlands. These countries' Jewish communities can be caught between the rock of radical Islamic violence and the hard place of a revitalized Holocaust-denying extreme right.  ``Common cause,'' he concluded, ``must be sought between the victimized minorities against extremism and fascism.''  I would point out to my colleagues one of those who spoke pointed out, it was Professor Julius Schoeps, that he has found that people do not say ``I am anti-Semitic;'' they just say ``I do not like Jews,'' a distinction without a difference, and, unfortunately, it is rearing itself in one ugly attack after another.  I would point out in that Berlin very recently, two New Jersey yeshiva students, after they left synagogue, they left prayer, there was an anti-American, anti-Israeli demonstration going on, and they were asked repeatedly, are you Jews? Are you Jews? And then the fists started coming their way and they were beaten right there in Berlin.  Let me finally say, Mr. Speaker, that yesterday we also passed a supplementary item at our OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. I was proud to be the principal sponsor. The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) offered a couple of strengthening amendments during the course of that debate, and we presented a united force, a U.S. force against anti-Semitism.  I would just point out this resolution now hopefully will act in concert with other expressions to wake up Europe. We cannot sit idly by. If we do not say anything, if we do not speak out, we allow the forces of hate to gain a further foothold. Again, that passed yesterday as well.  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to become much more aware that this ugliness is rearing its ugly face, not just in the United States, but Canada, in Europe, and we have to put to an end to it. Hate speech and hate crimes go hand in hand.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the resolution.  United States Helsinki Commission--Anti-Semitism in the OSCE Region       The Delegations of Germany and the United States will hold      a side event to highlight the alarming escalation of anti-     Semitic violence occurring throughout the OSCE region.

The Resolution urges      Parliamentary Assembly participants to speak out against      anti-Semitism.                    12:30 pm-2:00 pm, Monday, 8 July       The Representation of Lower Saxony In der Ministergaerten      10 10117 Berlin--approximately a 15-minute walk from the      Bundestag and across from the Holocaust Memorial construction      site.

Smith, USA]       1. Recalling that the OSCE was the first organization to      publicly achieve international condemnation of anti-Semitism      through the crafting of the 1990 Copenhagen Concluding      Document;       2. Noting that all participating States, as stated in the      Copenhagen Concluding Document, commit to ``unequivocally      condemn'' anti-Semitism and take effective measures to      protect individuals from anti-Semitic violence;       3. Remembering the 1996 Lisbon Concluding Document, which      highlights the OSCE's ``comprehensive approach'' to security,      calls for ``improvement in the implementation of all      commitments in the human dimension, in particular with      respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms,'' and urges      participating States to address ``acute problems,'' such as      anti-Semitism;       4. Reaffirming the 1999 Charter for European Security,      committing participating States to ``counter such threats to      security as violations of human rights and fundamental      freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience,      religion or belief and manifestations of intolerance,      aggressive nationalism, racism, chauvinism, xenophobia and      anti-Semitism;''       5. Recognizing that the scourge of anti-Semitism is not      unique to any one country, and calls for steadfast      perseverance by all participating States;       The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly:       6. Unequivocally condemns the alarming escalation of anti-     Semitic violence throughout the OSCE region;       7. Voices deep concern over the recent escalation in anti-     Semitic violence, as individuals of the Judaic faith and      Jewish cultural properties have suffered attacks in many OSCE      participating States;       8. Recognizes the danger of anti-Semitic violence to      European security, especially in light of the trend of      increasing violence and attacks region wide;       9. Declares that violence against Jews and other      manifestations of intolerance will never be justified by      international developments or political issues, and that it      obstructs democracy, pluralism, and peace;       10. Urges all States to make public statements recognizing      violence against Jews and Jewish cultural properties as anti-     Semitic, as well as to issue strong, public declarations      condemning the depredations;       11. Calls upon participating States to ensure aggressive      law enforcement by local and national authorities, including      thorough investigation of anti-Semitic criminal acts,      apprehension of perpetrators, initiation of appropriate      criminal prosecutions and judicial proceedings;       12. Urges participating States to bolster the importance of      combating anti-Semitism by holding a follow-up seminar or      human dimension meeting that explores effective measures to      prevent anti-Semitism, and to ensure that their laws,      regulations, practices and policies confirm with relevant      OSCE commitments on anti-Semitism; and       13. Encourages all delegates to the Parliamentary Assembly      to vocally and unconditionally condemn manifestations of      anti-Semitic violence in their respective countries and at      all regional and international fora.
