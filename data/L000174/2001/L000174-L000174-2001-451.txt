President, this week I had the pleasure of attending the raising of the old Jones Brothers granite shed in Barre, Vermont. This historic wooden building built in 1895 will be raised four feet off the ground for several months while a new foundation is poured and the building is secured. Once one of the largest granite manufacturing plants in the world, this building will soon be home to the Vermont Granite Museum, a tribute to one of Vermont's oldest and proudest industries. As the grandson of a stonecutter I cannot think of a better way to honor this heritage than a world class museum and learning center in the heart of Vermont. I would like to share with my colleagues the comments of my fellow Vermonters, Edwin Granai and Marsha Davis, who spoke eloquently of this building, its history and what the museum will mean to our state.  I ask consent that the statements of Edwin Granai and Marcia Davis be printed in the Record.  The statements follow:                        Remarks of Edwin Granai       ``In Italia,'' my grandmother used to say, ``Una volta un      portiere sempre un portiere (Once a porter always a      porter).'' At the beginning of the last century in Italy      those born into poverty lived a life of poverty. The rigid      class structure of the monarchy would prevail in Italy for      another half century. My grandparents did not have a half      century to wait, so they came America, the ``Promised Land.''      My grandfather emigrated from the quarries of Carrara, Italy,      to the quarries of Barre, Vermont to find work and above all      opportunity.       The Promised Land did not materialize for him. His earnings      never rose above subsistence level and he lost his health at      mid-life. He died in his forties with empty pockets and dust-     filled lungs. My father, after completing the fourth grade at      Brook Street School, went to work at the age of ten years in      1907 in this very building to help support his family. In      time America did become the Promised Land for my father and      for his children, of which I am one. But my grandfather died      as he came, poor.       Other immigrants made it in the first generation. Last Fall      I stayed an extra day in Washington to visit the recently      completed National Cathedral. It is one of the world's great      churches. Roger Marigi was the Master Carver for a quarter      century during the completion years. His grandfather came to      Barre at the same time mine did. Marigi says: ``My      grandfather came to America from Italy in 1890 . . . He went      to Barre, Vermont, because all the Italian stone carvers were      up there. That's where you got your job . . . You went up to      Barre because that's where the work was. Granite. You stayed      there and learned . . .''       The work was here because we have Barre Gray, the durable      and aesthetically pleasing stone that adorns memorials,      buildings, and plazas throughout the world. And we had the      skilled quarriers, artisans and sculptors to extract and      shape that stone. They came from Italy, Scotland, Sweden,      England, Spain, France, Canada, and around the world to      Barre.       The work is still here for the same reasons. We have a      4500-year supply of Barre Gray. And we still have the finest      quarriers, manufacturers, artisans and sculptors shaping that      stone. Sculptors from all over America and around the world      come to Barre today to learn from and work with Barre stone      artisans.       These assets--the stone and skilled workers--are like the      foundation we dedicate today. This foundation is the starting      point for the restoration of this historic building. Our      granite and our skilled workers are both out heritage and the      starting point for the renewal of Barre's granite industry.       At the beginning of this new century we live in a very      different world from that of our fathers. The citizens of      Barre City and Barre Town recognized this when they gathered      in 1994 to brainstorm their vision for the future. They saw      the challenge of the global marketplace. They recognized that      in today's world economy our granite industry is in fierce      competition with lesser quality stone and inferior artistry.      In the vision of the Vermont Granite Museum they recognized      the value of combining and displaying the wisdom of the past      with a modern learning environment that will create a      dynamic marketing force for the industry. The educational      programs of the museum will invigorate the worldwide      learning connection. The tourist benefit, 90,000 people      per year, will infuse six million dollars annually into      the central Vermont economy. More importantly together      they will create a new level of awareness for the beauty,      function and utility of Barre Gray in all its uses, and a      new level of appreciation for stone finishing and carving      as both art and vocation.       This is an ambitious project and it is happening thanks in      large part to everyone here assembled. I grew up in Barre and      maintain strong family and community ties. I have never seen      such a strong focus and wide spread support for a community      project. The scale requires it.       I had never been in this building until I toured it with      Marcia a year and a half ago. I came to see what we were      starting with and to imagine what it could become. I was not      prepared for what happened to me within minutes of my entry.      Suddenly and unexpectedly I was keenly aware of the ghost of      my deceased father working here as a child and young man. His      presence was so real it penetrated my heart and threatened my      composure. It took my breath away. And, when I got my breath,      I then thought of my grandfather and said a silent prayer of      thanks to Coriolano for his courage to leave his homeland to      come to America.       I will never forget that moment. It profoundly deepened my      connection to my heritage here in Barre, to my father and      grandfather through the work that they did and the sacrifices      they made. It connected me in a new way to their courage and      spirit, and in so doing strengthened my determination to put      my shoulder to this project. The pay-off of this project      began for me on that day when the rehabilitation of this      building had barely begun. I can only imagine the impact of      the finished museum. If I seem enthused about this project it      is because I am. And my enthusiasm increases each step of the      way.       As we dedicate this foundation of what is to be a world      class museum and learning center we are half way to our      twelve million-dollar goal. That is remarkable. But just as      remarkable is the energy that has emerged around this      project. It is the kind of energy that will create a new      prosperity for this community and region. The glass is half      full--enough to toast the courage and fortitude of our      ancestors and to say with certainty to our heirs that the      future of Barre is as solid as the rock--Barre Gray--upon      which it is build.                                  ____Remarks of Marcia A. Davis, Executive Director, Vermont Granite Museum                                 of Barre       Welcome.       We are here today to celebrate Vermont's granite industry:      its past, present and future.       The Jones Brothers granite shed represents the industry's      distinguished past. Built in 1895, with Douglas Fir timbers,      brought by rail from the Pacific Northwest, this building was      one of the first straight shed designs to be constructed in      Barre to house water powered overhead cranes.       Who were the Jones Brothers?       The Jones Brothers were sons of Hugh Jones, whom at age 2      immigrated to America with his parents from Wales, and      settled in Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. When the Civil War broke      out, Hugh Jones enlisted and became the first Union soldier      to be killed at the Battle of Fort Stedman, Virginia, in      1865, leaving behind a widow and six children all under the      age of 13.       Fifteen years later, the two older Jones Brothers,      Marshall, and Seward, ``imbued with faith in an industry, in      themselves, in their friends, and in a nation'', opened their      own wholesale monumental business in 1882 in Boston,      Massachusetts. Marshall was 29 years old. Seward was four      years younger.       Their monument dealership dealt in light pink and gray      granite from Scotland, darker granites from Sweden, Norway,      and Finland, and native granite from Quincy, Massachusetts.       Later on two younger brothers, Dayton and Hugh Jones,      joined the company, and they opened an office in Aberdeen,      Scotland in 1884.       While searching for granites in New England, the Jones      Brothers were introduced to Barre Gray granite. They      described it as having a ``color and texture far surpassing      the gray Scotch in beauty and quality''.       In 1886, they decided to expand again, purchasing a dark      gray granite quarry on Millstone Hill, Barre, and leased a      granite manufacturing shed from Mackie & Simpson, on 46      Granite Street, the very same site of the Socialist Block,      now known as the Old Labor Hall.       The Jones Brothers Company also owned and operated the      Wells Lamson Quarry in Barre Town.       The Jones Brothers Company was the first granite enterprise      to advertise finished granite monuments nationally in 1927.       The Jones Brothers Company employed as many as 500 people      on this very site.       The Jones Brothers Company was referred to as the largest      and oldest granite manufacturing plant in the world. The      business closed in 1975.       The company's trademark, registered in 1926, portrays an      angel with arms and wings outstretched above a rectangular      memorial which says ``Guardian Memorials of Everlasting      Beauty. To mark the place with beauty forever.''       And they did.       Thousands of monuments, family mausoleums, memorials, and      buildings were designed, commissioned and produced on this      very site for eighty years.       Some of the more notable structures located throughout the      country are:     The Green Beret Memorial, dedicated by John Wayne, in Fort          Bragg, No. Carolina     The Beacon Monument for the Massachusetts State House, in          Boston, Massachusetts     Sixteen Massive Pillars in the nave of St. John the Divine          Cathedral, in New York City (Eight of which were six feet          in diameter, 38 feet high, weighing 100 tons each, and          took a year to produce, transport and set them prior to          construction of the cathedral itself.)     The Brigham Young Memorial in Salt Lake City, Utah     The Shevchenko Memorial in Washington, DC     The Coal Miners Memorial in West Virginia     The U.S. President William Henry Harrison Memorial     And mausoleums for the Woolrich, Firestone, Heinz, Hood,          Hershey, Ringling and Webb families.       With technological advances in power, transportation, and      machinery came the ``boom years'' of the granite industry.      Between 1880 and 1900, in Barre alone, the population grew      from 2060 to 11,754. Montpelier, Northfield, Woodbury,      Hardwick, Bethel and South Ryegate were full of granite sheds      and quarries.       Waves of immigrants came from Scotland, Italy, England,      Ireland, France, Spain, Canada, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark      to work in Vermont's stone industry. They came through Ellis      Island, Boston and other ports of entry, many of them having      to leave their families behind, yet full of hope for a better      life in America.       These men cut, hauled, shaped, lettered and carved stone      with a passion for their families, and for Vermont,      ultimately becoming Americans.       Even under extremely difficult working conditions, these      men and this industry not     only survived, but flourished, transforming this country's      landscape as we know it today.       Today, granite countertops are to be expected in luxury      homes and offices. NASA's subcontractors use granite      precision surface plates to check for flaws or aberrations in      the shuttle's engine parts, as do numerous other      manufacturers for products that require the most stable and      accurate conditions are required for manufacturing.       No one can predict the future, however, we do know the      granite industry is up for whatever challenges may come its      way, and that will become a new exhibit.                          ____________________
