 President, today I rise to introduce--along with Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, and many other Senators--legislation which will be a key cornerstone of the Senate Democrats anti-crime, anti-drug focus for the new Congress.  Our thrust is clear and straight-forward:  We must continue the successes of the 1994 Biden crime law.  And, at the same time, we must take up the new challenge of confronting crime and drug abuse among our youth with a commonsense strategy balancing tough sanctions, certain punishment and protecting literally millions of kids from the criminals and drug pushers who can target any kid from any family whose parents are at work when the school day ends.  We must continue the success of the 1994 crime law.  While I give the credit first and foremost to the police officers on our Nation's streets, the verdict from the FBI's national crime statistics is that since the 1994 crime law, violent crime is down and down significantly:  1996 is projected to have the lowest murder toll since 1988--and a murder rate that is lowest since 1971;  1996 is projected to have the lowest violent crime total since 1990; and  the murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at the hands of their ``intimates'' fell to an 18-year low in 1994--and is lower still in 1995.  This is a record of success which should convince the Senate to extend the 1994 crime law.  Adding 25,000 more police by extending the 100,000 cops program for two more years.  Extending the Violence Against Women Act funding to shelter 400,000 more battered women and their children and continuing to help States arrest and prosecute batterers. Providing an additional $5 billion to build up to 80,000 more prison cells for violent criminals--we also propose to give States greater flexibility with these dollars to speed the prosecution of violent criminals and increase the use of drug testing. Provide $1 billion to extend such proven law enforcement programs as the Byrne anti-drug grants to State and local law enforcement. And, extend the crime law trust fund to fund all these initiatives from the cost-savings from downsizing the Federal Government--without increasing the Federal budget deficit.  The bottom line--this bill calls on the full Senate to continue the successes of the 1994 Biden crime law.  But, this legislation does not stop there. In the face of rising teen drug abuse and rising youth violence--despite some recent hopeful news--we must undertake a comprehensive effort to target these problems. This legislation offers just such a comprehensive effort:  First, we propose to reform the juvenile justice system to crack down on violent youth by:  Making some key changes to Federal law that respond to legitimate concerns which create the pressure to take the unwise step of prosecuting kids in our overburdened adult courts. Specifically, providing greater access to juveniles records and raising the mandatory release age for juveniles from 21 to 26--so juveniles will face up to 11 years in prison even if they are prosecuted as juveniles.  Providing $1 billion to help States build prisons for violent juveniles as well as additional prosecutors and other improvements to State juvenile justice systems (including certain, graduated punishment for first-time and minor juvenile offenders).  Creating special juvenile ``gun'' courts where juvenile gun offenders are tried and sentenced on an expedited basis.  These are essential to controlling juvenile crime because, as every mother knows, immediate and certain punishment is the key to disciplining kids.  Second, we must target one of the primary sources of youth violence--street gangs.  We propose aggressive steps to:  Target gang paraphernalia by boosting the penalties for criminals who arm themselves with bullet-proof body armor and deadly accurate laser-sighting devices. And, as Senator Leahy has identified, we must make some commonsense reforms to speed law enforcement access to the numeric pagers so often used by youth gang criminals.  Create a new crime of interstate franchise spread of street gangs--a step which better targets Federal law enforcement resources than simply federalizing ever more State crimes and encroaching upon the State's traditional handling of juvenile crime.  Cracking down on street gangs also means that we should increase the penalties for witness intimidation, a favored tactic of criminal street gangs. This is a proposal outlined by the President just this weekend.  Third, we must redouble our efforts to treat and prevent youth drug abuse.  For the past several months, you have heard me modify one of the key arguments of the President's 1992 campaign by stating--``it's drugs, stupid, it's drugs.''  This statement is--unfortunately--necessary in the face of rising drug abuse among our children. While drug abuse among adults is holding steady, all the surveys tell us that more and more children are falling prey to drugs.  We propose a multi-prong response, because drugs need to be fought not only in our communities, but also in our scientific laboratories where important breakthroughs are being made into medicines to treat drug addiction--we propose additional funding for the Federal Medications Development Program and to provide incentives to the private sector to develop new medicines to treat heroin and cocaine addiction.  We must also expand drug courts to cover 50,000 children--a vast improvement on the no drug testing, no treatment, and no threat of punishment system which typifies too many juvenile courts today.  As I proposed last year, we must tighten controls on the club drug--ketamine--that is popular with too many children today.  Funding drug treatment for 600,000 drug-addicted children is also key--particularly as our Nation stands on the edge of a baby-boomerang wave that will mean more teenagers--and more teen addicts.  Reauthorizing the drug director's office as well as the Safe & Drug-Free Schools Program which is the core of Federal drug prevention efforts are two other necessary steps.  In addition, and in response to the recent passage of so-called medical marijuana initiatives, we seek a measure which should be supported even by their proponents--a simple study to determine if drug abuse among children rises in these two States.  Fourth, we call for a renewed effort to prevent youth violence.  No where has the crime policy debate been subject to more distortions and misunderstandings than on a goal all of us should share--let's prevent kids from getting involved in crime, violence and drugs in the first place.  To get past all the misunderstanding, we propose to call upon the prestigious, non-partisan National Academy of Sciences to answer the questions--can we prevent youth crime? And, if so, how do we do so in the most efficient way possible?  Let me repeat a challenge I offered last week--I will live by the results of this study, if those who oppose prevention efforts will as well. If the national academy says we can't figure out this task, so be it, I will not seek appropriations for any funds we authorize through this legislation. But, if the national academy of sciences says that we can, I challenge all to support full funding for these crime prevention efforts.  But, in the meantime, it seems to me that we do know at least one thing about preventing youth crime and drug abuse--my mom summarized what we know in the simple phrase used by mothers everywhere: ``Idle hands are the devil's workshop.''  This refers to the commonsense notion that if we can just get kids off the streets and into supervised programs during the after school hours when kids are likely to be the victims of gangs and criminals or the customers of drug pushers--if we can just do that simply thing, with boys and girls clubs or many other proven efforts, we can make important in-roads against drug abuse and crime among children.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 15       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 215. CERTAIN PUNISHMENT AND GRADUATED SANCTIONS FOR                    YOUTH OFFENDERS.       (a) Findings and Purposes.--       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (A) youth violence constitutes a growing threat to the      national welfare requiring immediate and comprehensive action      by the Federal Government to reduce and prevent youth      violence;       (B) the behavior of youth who become violent offenders      often follow a progression, beginning with aggressive      behavior in school, truancy, and vandalism, leading to      property crimes and then serious violent offenses;       (C) the juvenile justice systems in most States are ill-     equipped to provide meaningful sanctions to minor, nonviolent      offenders because most of their resources are dedicated to      dealing with more serious offenders;       (D) in most States, some youth commit multiple, nonviolent      offenses without facing any significant criminal sanction;       (E) the failure to provide meaningful criminal sanctions      for first time, nonviolent offenders sends the false message      to youth that they can engage in antisocial behavior without      suffering any negative consequences and that society is      unwilling or unable to restrain that behavior;       (F) studies demonstrate that interventions during the early      stages of a criminal career can halt the progression to more      serious, violent behavior; and       (G) juvenile courts need access to a range of sentencing      options so that at least some level of sanction is imposed on      all youth offenders, including status offenders, and the      severity of the sanctions increase along with the seriousness      of the offense.       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide      assistance to State and local juvenile courts to expand the      range of sentencing options for first time, nonviolent      offenders and to provide a selection of graduated sanctions      for more serious offenses.       (b) Definitions.--In this section--       (1) the term ``first time offender'' means a juvenile      against whom formal charges have not previously been filed in      any Federal or State judicial proceeding;       (2) the term ``nonviolent offender'' means a juvenile who      is charged with an offense that does not involve the use of      force against the person of another; and       (3) the term ``status offender'' means a juvenile who is      charged with an offense that would not be criminal if      committed by an adult (other than an offense that constitutes      a violation of a valid court order or a violation of section      922(x) of title 18, United States Code (or similar State      law)).       (c) Grant Authorization.--       (1) In general.--The Attorney General may make grants in      accordance with this section to States, State courts, local      courts, units of local government, and Indian tribes, for the      purposes of--       (A) providing juvenile courts with a range of sentencing      options such that first time juvenile offenders, including      status offenders such as truants, vandals, and juveniles in      violation of State or local curfew laws, face at least some      level of punishment as a result of their initial contact with      the juvenile justice system; and       (B) increasing the sentencing options available to juvenile      court judges so that juvenile offenders receive increasingly      severe sanctions--       (i) as the seriousness of their unlawful conduct increases;      and       (ii) for each additional offense.
