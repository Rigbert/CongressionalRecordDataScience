 President, I rise today to introduce a piece of legislation that I worked on for the last several years. As time has passed, I believe my arguments for the legislation in the first instance are even more relevant today than they were then.  This legislation will replace the War Powers Resolution of 1973, and it is designed to provide a framework for joint congressional-Executive decisionmaking about the most solemn decision that a nation can make: to send women and men to fight and die for their country.  Decades ago, a noted scholar, Edwin Corwin, characterized constitutional provisions regarding the foreign policy of the Nation as an invitation to struggle--a struggle between the executive branch and the legislative branch.  Professor Corwin's maxim accurately describes over 200 years of constitutional history--two centuries of tension between the executive and the legislative branches regarding the war power.  But over the past four decades, what was intended as a healthy struggle between the executive and legislative branches has become an extremely excessively divisive and chronically debilitating struggle.  The primary cause, in my view, is that Presidents have pushed the limits of Executive prerogative, Democratic Presidents as well as Republican Presidents. Their rationale has been the supposed burden of Presidential responsibility imposed by the stresses and dangers of the cold war.  The era began in 1950, when President Truman deployed forces to defend South Korea without any congressional authorization.  With elaborate legal argument, Truman asserted an inherent Presidential authority to act unilaterally to protect the broad interests of American foreign policy.  A nearly lone voice of concern, Senate minority leader--Mr. Republican--Robert Taft--known, as I said, as Mr. Republican--declared that the President had usurped authority, in violation of the laws and the Constitution.  But Taft's pronouncements availed him little, a fate that would often befall similar Executive attempts to restrain Executive aggrandizement.  The dissenters were overwhelmed by the proponents of a thesis: The thesis that in the nuclear age--when the fate of the planet itself appeared to rest with two men thousands of miles apart--Congress had little choice, or so it was claimed, but to cede tremendous authority to the Executive.  By the beginning of the 1970's, that thesis had become doctrine.  In 1970, when President Nixon sent United States forces into Cambodia with neither congressional authorization nor even consultation, his accompanying assertions of autonomous Presidential powers were so sweeping and so extreme that the Senate began a search--a search led by Republican Senator Jacob Javits and strongly supported by Democratic Senator and hawk John Stennis--the Senate began a search for some means of rectifying what was now perceived as a dangerous constitutional imbalance in favor of the Executive.  The result was the enactment, in 1973--my first year in the U.S. Senate--of the War Powers Resolution over a Presidential veto.  Today, over two decades later, few would dispute that the War Powers Resolution has failed to fulfill its intent and has been, to state it quite simply, ineffective.  It is commonly said that every President has disputed the constitutionality of the War Powers Act, but that is not wholly true. President Ford took no issue with the act while he was in office.  And President Carter explicitly vowed to comply with its provisions, declaring that he would neither endorse nor challenge its constitutionality.  Moreover, the Carter Justice Department conducted a detailed analysis of the resolution and declared, quite explicitly, that its most critical mechanism--the timetable for congressional authorization of use of force abroad--is fully and unambiguously constitutional.   [[Page S3970]] Unfortunately, under the Ford and Carter administrations, no body of practice under the resolution developed, because the only two military actions of that period--the Mayaguez incident under President Ford and Desert One under President Carter--were over almost before they began.  Then came President Reagan and President Bush, who dealt with the resolution pragmatically while declaring their blanket opposition to its provisions.  Their assertion of the doctrine of broad Executive powers--what I call the monarchist viewpoint--is best exemplified by President Bush's statement on the eve of the gulf war.  With half a million American forces standing ready in Saudi Arabia, President Bush petulantly declared that he did not need permission from some old goat in the Congress to kick Saddam out of Kuwait.   Although Mr. Bush eventually sought congressional support in the gulf, he did so reluctantly, and continued to assert that he sought only support, refusing to concede that congressional authorization was a legal necessity.  More recently, the notion of broad Executive power was claimed on the eve of the invasion of Haiti--an invasion that, thankfully, was averted by a last-minute diplomatic initiative.  Last summer, Clinton administration officials characterized the Haiti operation as a mere police action, a semantic dodge designed to avoid the need for congressional authorization.  Some of my Democratic colleagues suggested that the war clause of the Constitution was entirely ceremonial and that the President had virtually unlimited discretion to order an invasion of Haiti. These were some of the same Democrats who stood here on the floor and said President Bush did not have the authority to act in the gulf without congressional assent; proving the axiom that Senators and Congressmen tend to pick what side of their issue they are on depending on the partisan need.  We have the interesting phenomena, Republicans on the floor who said there was a broad range of congressional authority, but when it came to Clinton exercising it, saying, no, he did not have the authority; and Democrats who were on the floor telling President Bush he did not have the authority but saying, no, President Clinton does. To be sure, there were some of my Republicans and Democratic friends who were consistent--who may have questioned the President's policy in Haiti but did not question the right to deploy those troops in the absence of congressional consent.  In my view, the assertions expressed during the Haitian crisis underscore that the doctrine asserted by President Nixon 25 years ago still grips the executive branch. More alarming, the congressional viewpoints I summarized suggest that the legislative surrender of the war power continues, based in part on whether or not the man or woman in power is a man of your party and whether you agree with him on the substance of the action.  With all respect to my colleagues and the administration, I believe this President, the last President, and the Presidents under whom I have served have misread the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 11, grants to the Congress the power ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.''  To the President, the Constitution provides in article II, section 2, the role of ``Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.'' It may fairly be said that with regard to many constitutional provisions, the framers' intent was ambiguous, but not on the war power. Both the contemporaneous evidence and the early construction of these clauses, in my view, do not leave much room for doubt.  The original draft of the U.S. Constitution would have given the Congress the power to ``make war.'' At the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, a motion was made to change to ``make war,'' to ``declare war.''  The reason for the change is very instructive. At the convention, James Madison and Elbridge Gerry argue for an amendment solely in order to permit the President the power ``to repel sudden attacks.'' They were fearful if you said it was the power of the Congress to make war, that could be read to deny the President the authority without congressional power to repel sudden attacks.  Just one delegate at the convention, Pierce Butler of South Carolina, suggested that the President should be given the power to initiate war. All others disagreed. Only one to suggest that the President had the power to initiate war. The rationale for vesting the power to launch war in the U.S. Congress was quite simple: The framers knew their history. The framers' thoughts were dominated by their experience with the British king who had unfettered power to start wars and spend the treasure and blood of his nation. Such powers the framers were determined to deny the President of the United States.  George Mason, for example, explained that he was opposed to giving the power to initiate war to the President because the President, the Executive, he believed, was not to be safely trusted with that power. Even Alexander Hamilton, a staunch advocate of Presidential power, emphasized that the President's power as Commander in Chief would be ``much inferior'' to the British kings, amounting to ``nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces,'' while that of the British king ``extends to the declaring of war and the raising and regulation of fleets and armies--all which [by the U.S.] Constitution would appertain to the legislature.''  It is frequently contended by those who favor vast Presidential powers that Congress was granted only ceremonial power to declare war, in effect, a designation to provide fair notice to the opposing States, and legal notice to neutral parties. At least that is what they argue.  But the framers had little interest, it seems, in the ceremonial aspects of war. The real issue was congressional authorization of war. As Hamilton noted in Federalist 25, ``The ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse.'' Indeed, by one historian's account, just 1 war in 10 was formally declared in the years between 1700 and 1870--1 in 10.  The proposition that Congress had the power to initiate all wars except to repel attack on the United States is also strengthened in view of the second part of the war clause. That is the power to ``grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal.''  Now, most Americans, I daresay most Members of Congress, I daresay most members of Government, do not even know what the ``power to grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal'' means and why it is in the Constitution. An anachronism today, letters of marque and reprisals were licenses issued by governments, usually to private citizens, but on occasion to government agents, empowering these private citizens or government agents to seize enemy ships or take action on land, short of all-out war.  In essence, it was the 18th century version of what we now regard as limited war or police actions. That is what letters of marque and reprisal were. If you are having trouble with pirates off the coast, you are not looking to declare war. The Federal Government, in this case the Congress, could go out and hire out, give permission to, give a letter of marque and reprisal to a local. Think of it in terms of a local security agency that comes by and patrols your neighborhoods. You could give letters of marque or reprisal and say, ``You are authorized under the law, through the Congress, to go seize those pirate ships.''  That is what it was about. A leading commentator of the day--that is, the late 1700's--a leading commentator of the day on international law explained the distinction this way: ``A perfect war is that which entirely interrupts the tranquility of the state. An imperfect war, on the contrary, is that which does not entirely interrupt the peace. Reprisals are that imperfect kind of war.''  So, when we hear people talk about imperfect wars, it is used as a term of art as it was used back in the late 1700's. The framers undoubtedly knew that reprisals or imperfect wars could lead to general or all-out wars. England, for example, had fought five wars between 1652 and 1756 which were preceded by public naval reprisals.   [[Page S3971]] That is, if you gave these letters of marque to someone or a group of people to go out and seize shipping, it was acknowledged that that could lead to a larger war. If the nation from which those ships came decided that it was not in their interest, they may very well send a larger armada and you are at war. You move from that imperfect war to the so-called perfect war--an odd phrase, ``perfect war.''  Surely, those who met at Philadelphia, all learned men, knew and understood this history of marque and reprisals. Given this understanding, the only logical conclusion that the framers intended by vesting the power to grant these letters of marque and reprisal authorizing imperfect war in the Congress, could be that it was designed to grant to Congress the power to initiate all hostilities, even limited wars.  To review for a second, they changed from ``make'' to ``declare" in the Constitution for the purpose of allowing the President not to initiate a war, perfect or imperfect, large or small, but for the purpose of allowing the President to respond to a sudden attack.  Then to be sure everyone understood what they meant, they said, ``And by the way, we are going to vest in the section of the Constitution that relates to congressional power the exclusive power to the Congress of issuing these letters of marque and reprisal.''  So they not only said Congress can only initiate war and the President can only respond, but even limited war only the Congress can initiate.  A comparison of the war clause to related constitutional provisions suggest that this interpretation is the correct one. Unlike other foreign affairs provisions in the Constitution which grant to the President and the Senate the shared power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors, when it comes to the war power the Constitution provides a role for the Senate and the House of Representatives--but not a shared responsibility between the branches.  The inclusion of the House, in particular, suggests a determination to mandate that public consensus be achieved before the initiation of a war.  Think about it. If the Founders thought that they should not give the power to raise taxes to the Senate because we were more like the House of Lords, and that all taxes must be initiated in the House of Representatives, why did they do that? They did that because they knew that taxation could affect people's lives so drastically that it should be a democratic decision and it should be made first and foremost in the people's house, that group of legislators who stand for election every 2 years and are immediately answerable to the public.  If they thought it was so important and so critical that taxes should be determined by the people's house because it had such an impact on the lives of the average citizen, what do you think they thought about the power of a Government to take your son or daughter and send them to war and die? It is illogical to me, and those who say that the President has this exclusive authority, to suggest that they would worry about taxation but not worry about taking a nation to war, which can cost them their lives, their monetary treasure, their lifeblood.  The inclusion of the House in the decision to go to war was because the House was designed to be closely attuned to the views of the Nation and thereby would provide a means for gauging and ensuring public support for any war.  Moreover, with both Chambers involved in the decision to go to war, the initiation of war could necessarily be slowed by the simple fact that securing passage of statutory authorization or a declaration of war through both Houses is potentially a time-consuming and cumbersome process. That is what it was intended to be, because when one goes to war, you cannot say, short of surrender, 2 weeks into it or 1 month into it, ``By the way, we made a mistake, we're passing legislation to correct it.'' You can do that with taxes. You can pass a tax bill and 2 months later, 3 months later say, ``We made a mistake and rescind it.'' You do not rescind a war.  So it was intended--it was intended--in the Constitution that decision to go to war--not to repel attack, to go to war--to initiate war, to alter the state of peace, it was intended that it should be a process that consumed some time.  It is bordering on the irrational, in my view, to suggest that the framers thought the appointment of ambassadors, although an important task, but not of the same consequence as war, that the appointment of ambassadors was so critical that they gave the Senate a veto power over it, but they considered the war powers so trivial that the decision to send Americans to fight and die was left deliberately vague so as to permit the Executive reasonable discretion to launch hostilities at his or her whim.  I think that is irrational for anyone to think that is what the Framers thought, that who we have as Ambassador to England is so important that we are not going to leave it to a President alone, we are going to require the Senate to go along with it, but going to war with England was so trivial that we did not have to consult the United States Senate or did not have to consult the people's House before a President could take us to war. That is, in my humble opinion, an irrational view.  In the same vein, I am continually amazed that many of my colleagues who zealously guard the Senate's power to advise and consent to treaties and to ambassadorial appointments, so cavalierly cede the war power to the Executive. I find that fascinating. What more can impact on the life of the average American than taking the Nation to war? Why would they possibly have left that to the President alone but said, ``By the way, when you want to stop a war, when you want to have a treaty, the President has no authority to do that. He has to come to us and get a supermajority.''  Does that make any sense? Talk about tortured logic. Yet, we have people on this floor, in the 22 years I have been here--and when I got here, the Vietnam war was still going on; that is one of the reasons I ran for the Senate in the first place--we have Members in both political parties with whom I have served and have great respect saying, ``War is up to the President, but who the Ambassador is, you better check with me.'' War is up to the President. But whether there is a peace treaty, you better check with me.  I would respectfully suggest the reason that many have adopted that position is they do not have the political courage to take a stand on whether or not we should go to war.  In sum, to accept the proposition that the war power is merely ceremonial, or applies only to big wars, is to read much of the war clause out of the U.S. Constitution. And such a reading is supported neither by the plain language of the text or the original intention of the Framers of the Constitution.  In describing the Framers' intent, I hasten to add a caveat. We should always be cautious about our ability to divine the intentions of those who came 200 years before us, particularly when the documentary record is not at all voluminous.  But any doubt about the wisdom of relying on original intent alone, in my view, is dispelled in view of the actions of the early Presidents, early Congresses, and early Supreme Court decisions.         Early practice--shedding light on the Framers' intent  Let me speak to that a minute. Advocates of Executive power often assert that Presidents have used force throughout our history without congressional consent. But with all due respect, history does not support that claim.  Indeed, our earliest Presidents, who were involved in the ratification of the Constitution, were extremely cautious about encroaching on Congress' power under the war clause.  Our first President, George Washington, adhered to the view that only Congress could authorize offensive action. Writing in 1793, President Washington stated that offensive operations against an Indian tribe, the Creek Nation, depended on congressional action alone.  Let me quote from what Washington wrote. Washington as President said:       The Constitution vests the power of declaring war with the      Congress; therefore, no offensive expedition of importance      can be undertaken until after they have deliberated upon the      subject, and authorized such a measure.  That was George Washington.   [[Page S3972]] During the Presidency of John Adams, the United States engaged in an undeclared naval war with France. These military engagements were clearly authorized by the Congress in a series of incremental statutes.  The naval war with France also yielded three important Supreme Court decisions regarding the scope of the war power.  In 1799, Congress authorized the President to intercept any United States vessel headed to France. President Adams subsequently ordered the Navy to seize any ship traveling to or from France. The Supreme Court declared the seizure of a United States vessel traveling from France to be illegal, thus ruling that Congress had the power not only to authorize limited war but also to limit Presidential power to take military action.  The Court ruled in two other cases bearing on the question of limited war. Wars, the Court said, even if ``imperfect,'' are nonetheless wars.  In still another case, Chief Justice Marshall opined that:       The whole powers of war [are] by the Constitution . . .      vested in the Congress . . . [which] may authorize general      hostilities . . . or partial war.  Now, modern monarchists, those who lean and tilt so far to the President on this, refer habitually to the actions of our third President, Thomas Jefferson, in coping with the Barbary pirates. But Jefferson's actions provide little solace to advocates of that position.  In May of 1801, President Jefferson deployed a small squadron of ships to the Mediterranean to deter attacks against American shipping. Acting under the authority of an act of Congress which mandated that six frigates be maintained in the Navy during peacetime, Jefferson instructed the naval commander that if he arrived and found that the Barbary powers had declared war against the United States, to take action if necessary ``to protect commerce.''  But when he learned that the leader of Tripoli had, in fact, declared war, Jefferson referred the matter to the Congress.  Reporting on a small skirmish won by a U.S. ship, Jefferson noted that the American ship was authorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense, and thus the U.S. commander did not take possession of the ship or retain its crew as prisoners of war.   Jefferson sought further guidance from Congress about the next step, and I quote:       The legislature will doubtless consider whether, by      authorizing measures of offence also, [Congress] will . . .      place our forces on an equal footing [with the Tripolitan      forces].  Congress promptly enacted a statute empowering Jefferson to protect U.S. shipping, and to seize vessels owned by the Tripoli regime. The legislation passed 2 years later gave explicit support for ``warlike operations against Tripoli or other Barbary powers.''  I believe this episode, and the historical record of actions taken by other early Presidents, has significantly more bearing on the meaning of the war clause than the record of Presidents in the modern era.  The reasons should be obvious. The men who were at Philadelphia and wrote the Constitution--or, as in Jefferson's case, participated in the ratification debates in the States--had a much better understanding of the intended meaning of the constitutional provisions than those of us 200 years later have. They participated.  Their actions while in office should, therefore, be given great weight in interpreting the constitutional clauses in question. As Chief Justice Warren once wrote, ``The precedential value of [prior practice] tends to increase in proportion to the proximity'' to that Constitutional Convention.                  Restoring the Constitutional balance  Unfortunately, this constitutional history seems largely forgotten, and the doctrine of Presidential power that arose during the four decades of the cold war continues to remain in vogue--even, to my dismay, among many of my colleagues in the Congress.  To accept this situation requires us to believe that the constitutional imbalance serves our Nation well. But it can hardly be said that it does.  As matters now stand, Congress is denied its proper role in sharing the decision to commit American troops, and the President is deprived of the consensus he needs to help carry that policy through.  Only by establishing an effective war powers mechanism can we ensure that both of these goals are met. More importantly, we will guarantee that the will of the American people will stand behind the commitment of U.S. forces.  The question then is this: How to revise the War Powers Resolution in a manner that gains bipartisan support as well as the support of the Executive?  In the past two decades, a premise has gained wide acceptance that the War Powers Resolution is fatally flawed. Indeed, there are flaws in the resolution, but they need not have been fatal.  For that law was designed--by legislators who were statesmen of a markedly conservative stripe--to embody constitutional principles and to set forth practical procedures.  Ironically, a law designed to improve executive-legislative branch comity on the war power has instead contributed to frequent squabbles about the minutiae of the law's provisions.  In 1988, determining that a review of the War Powers Resolution was in order, the Foreign Relations Committee established a special subcommittee to assume the task.  As chairman of the subcommittee, I conducted an exhaustive series of hearings, the most extensive hearings held in recent times on this subject.  Over the course of 2 months, the subcommittee heard from many distinguished witnesses: Former President Ford, former Secretaries of State and Defense, former Joint Chiefs of Staff, former Members of Congress who drafted the law, and many constitutional scholars.  At the end of that process, I produced a lengthy law review article describing how the War Powers Resolution might be thoroughly rewritten to overcome its actual and perceived liabilities.  I envisaged its replacement by a new act entitled ``The Use of Force Act''--which would aim to achieve, at long last, the goal of its predecessor: To restore the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches regarding the war power for purposes of complying with the intent and will of the American people as well as the Constitution.  That effort provided the foundation for the legislation I introduce today. The bill that I offer has many elements; I will briefly summarize the most important.  First, it bears emphasis that my bill would replace the War Powers Resolution with a new version. But I should make clear that I retain its central element: A time-clock mechanism that limits the President's power to use force abroad.  That mechanism, I should repeat, was found to be unambiguously constitutional in a 1980 opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice.  It is often asserted that the time-clock provision is unworkable, or that it invites our adversaries to make a conflict so painful in the short run so as to induce timidity in the Congress, forcing the President to remove troops.  But with or without a war powers law, American willingness to undertake sustained hostilities will always be subject to democratic pressures. A statutory mechanism is simply a means of delineating procedure.  And the procedure set forth in this legislation assures that if the President wants an early congressional vote on a use of force abroad, his congressional supporters can produce it.  Recent history tells us, of course, that the American people, as well as Congress, rally around the flag--rally around the President--rally around the Commander in Chief--in the early moments of a military deployment.  Second, my bill defuses the specter that a timid Congress can simply sit on its hands and permit the authority for a deployment to expire.  As noted above, it establishes elaborate expedited procedures designed to ensure that a vote will occur. And it explicitly defeats the timid Congress specter by granting to the President the authority he has sought if these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote.  Thus, if the President requests authority for a sustained use of force--one outside the realm of emergency--  [[Page S3973]] and Congress fails to vote, the President's authority is extended indefinitely.  Third, the legislation delineates what I call the going-in authorities for the President to use force.  One fundamental weakness of the War Powers Resolution is that it fails to acknowledge powers that most scholars agree are inherent Presidential powers, such as the power to repel an armed attack upon the United States or its Armed Forces, or to rescue Americans abroad.  My legislation corrects this deficiency--and thus avoids the endless dispute over where the exact location of the line between what the President already possesses independently and what Congress was bestowing upon him by legislation--where that line rests.  The bill enumerates five instances where the President may use force:  First, to repel attack on U.S. territory or U.S. forces;  Second, to deal with urgent situations threatening supreme U.S. interests--i.e. the Cuban missile crisis;  Third, to extricate imperiled U.S. citizens;  Fourth, to forestall or retaliate against specific acts of terrorism; and  Fifth, to defend against substantial threats to international sea lanes or airspace.  It may be that no such enumeration can be exhaustive. But it is worth noting that the circumstances set forth would have sanctioned virtually every use of force by the United States since World War II.  This concession of authority is circumscribed by the maintenance of the time-clock provision. After 60 days have passed--2 months--the President's authority would expire, unless 1 of 3 conditions had been met:  First, Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory authorization; or  Second, the President has requested authority for an extended use of force but Congress has failed to act on that request, notwithstanding the expedited procedures established by this act--that is, Congress, if he asks to continue the force must act to tell him he cannot or it is presumed he can continue--or;  Third, the President has certified the existence of an emergency threatening the supreme national interests of the United States; in which case he can continue the force in place.  The legislation also affirms the importance of consultation between the President and Congress and establishes a new means to facilitate that consultation.  To overcome the common complaint that Presidents must contend with ``535 secretaries of state''--that is 535 Members of Congress--the Use of Force Act establishes a congressional leadership group with whom the President is mandated to consult on the use of force.  Another infirmity of the War Powers Resolution is that it fails to define ``hostilities.'' Thus, Presidents frequently engaged in a verbal gymnastics of insisting that ``hostilities'' were not ``imminent.'' Even when hundreds of thousands of troops were positioned in the Arabian desert opposite Saddam's legions, President Bush argued that they were not in an area of hostilities and, even if they were, there was no prospect of imminent hostilities. Therefore the War Powers Act would not be triggered and engaged.  Therefore, my legislation includes a more precise definition of what constitutes the use of force. And this definition contains two elements:  First, a new commitment of U.S. forces, and second, the deployment is aimed at deterring a specific threat, the forces deployed have incurred or inflicted casualties, or are operating with a substantial possibility of incurring or inflicting casualties.  If those conditions are met then there is a use of force as defined in the law.  Finally, to make the statutory mechanism complete, the Use of Force Act provides a means for judicial review.  Like many of my colleagues, I am reluctant to inject the judiciary into decisions that should be made by the political branches. Therefore, the provision is extremely limited: It empowers a three-judge panel to decide only whether the time-clock mechanism has been triggered.  I have no illusions that enacting this legislation will be easy. The experience of the War Powers Resolution gives witness to the difficulty of finding the proper balance between the executive and legislative branches on war powers.  But I am determined to try. The status quo, with Presidents asserting broad executive powers, and Congress often content to surrender its constitutional powers, serves neither branch, and clearly does not serve the American people.  More fundamentally, it does not serve the men and women who risk their lives to defend our interests. For that, ultimately, must be the test of any war powers law.  Mr. President, some would argue now that the cold war is over there is less need for this delineation of authority, this new set of ground rules. I would argue nothing could be further from the truth. We are more likely to be pulled into hostilities--although not a world war III in all probability. More Americans have been engaged in areas of hostility, have been killed, and have been put on the battlefield since the cold war has ended than all during the cold war but for Korea and Vietnam, in little parts of the world all over the world: Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti. What happens in a decade, a year from now--in the Ukraine, Byelarus, Russia--or any number of places where there might be hostilities and Americans or entire divisions of Americans may be called to action?  So, Mr. President, I think to have an ordered plan to diminish the bickering between the executive and legislative branches on this issue is more needed today than it has been at any time.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill that I have sent to the desk and the accompanying section-by-section analysis be included in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 564       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.       The Congress affirms that--       (1) the provisions of the United States Constitution compel      the President and Congress to engage actively and jointly in      decisions to use force abroad;       (2) joint deliberation by the two branches will contribute      to sound decisions and to the public support necessary to      sustain any use of force abroad; and       (3) a statutory framework, devised to promote consultation      and timely authorization as may be needed for specific uses      of force, can facilitate cooperation between the Congress and      the President in such decisionmaking.     SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.       (a) In General.--The purpose of this Act is to confer and      confirm Presidential authority to use force abroad, to set      forth principles and procedures governing the exercise of      that authority, and thereby to facilitate cooperation between      the President and Congress in decisions concerning the use or      deployment of United States Armed Forces abroad in situations      of actual or potential hostilities.       (b) Exclusivity of Provisions.--Because this Act confirms      all of the President's inherent constitutional authority to      use force abroad and confers additional authority, this Act      applies to all uses of force abroad by the United States.

TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS     SEC. 101. AUTHORITY AND GOVERNING PRINCIPLES.       (a) Authority.--In the absence of a declaration of war or      statutory authorization for a specific use of force, the      President, through powers vested by the Constitution of the      United States and by this Act, is authorized to use force      abroad in accordance with this Act--       (1) to repel an armed attack upon the United States or its      armed forces;       (2) to respond to a foreign military threat that severely      and directly jeopardizes the supreme national interests of      the United States under emergency conditions that do not      permit sufficient time for Congress to consider statutory      authorization or a declaration of war;       (3) to extricate citizens and nationals of the United      States located abroad from situations involving a direct and      imminent threat to their lives;       (4) to forestall an imminent act of international terrorism      directed at citizens or nationals of the United States or to      retaliate against the perpetrators of a specific act of      international terrorism directed at such citizens or      nationals; and       (5) to protect internationally recognized rights of      innocent and free passage in the air and on the seas in      circumstances where the violation, or threat of violation, of      such rights poses a substantial danger to the safety of      American citizens or the national security of the United      States.       (b) Governing Principles.--In exercising the authority set      forth in subsection (a), the President shall, without      limitation on the constitutional power of Commander in Chief,      adhere rigorously to principles of necessity and      proportionality, as follows:       (1) Principles of necessity:       (A) Force may not be used for purposes of aggression.       (B) Before the use of force abroad, the President shall      have determined, with due consideration to the implications      under international law, that the objective could not have      been achieved satisfactorily by means other than the use of      force.       (2) Principles of proportionality:       (A) The use of force shall be exercised with levels of      force, in a manner, and for a duration essential to and      directly connected with the achievement of the objective.       (B) The diplomatic, military, economic, and humanitarian      consequences of such action shall be in reasonable proportion      to the benefits of the objective.     SEC. 102. CONSULTATION.       (a) Prior Consultation Required.--Except where an emergency      exists that does not permit sufficient time to consult      Congress, the President shall seek the advice of the Congress      before any use of force abroad.       (b) Congressional Leadership Group.--(1) To facilitate      consultation between the President and the Congress, there is      established within the Congress the Congressional Leadership      Group on the Use of Force Abroad (hereafter in this Act      referred to as the ``Congressional Leadership Group'').       (2) The Congressional Leadership Group shall be composed      of--       (A) the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the      President pro tempore of the Senate;       (B) the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of the      Senate and the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of the      House of Representatives;       (C) the chairman and ranking minority member of each of the      following committees of the Senate: the Committee on Foreign      Relations, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Select      Committee on Intelligence; and       (D) the chairman and ranking minority member of each of the      following committees of the House of Representatives: the      Committee on International Relations, the Committee on      National Security, and the Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence.       (3) The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the      Majority Leader of the Senate shall each serve as co-chairman      of the Congressional Leadership Group.       (c) Regular Consultations.--(1) Except as the parties may      otherwise determine, whenever Congress is in session,      meetings shall be held, in open or closed session, for the      purpose of facilitating consultation between Congress and the      President on foreign and national security policy, as      follows:       (A) The President shall meet at least once every four      months with the Congressional Leadership Group.       (B) The Secretary of State shall meet at least once every      two months with the Committee on Foreign Relations of the      Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the      House of Representatives.       (C) The Secretary of Defense shall meet at least once every      two months with the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate      and the Committee on National Security of the House of      Representatives.       (D) The Director of Central Intelligence shall meet at      least once every two months with the Select Committee on      Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee      on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.       (2) Such consultation shall have, among its primary      purposes--       (A) identifying potential situations in which the use of      force abroad might be necessary and examining thoroughly the      advisability and lawfulness of such use of force; and       (B) in those instances in which a use of force abroad has      already been undertaken, discussing how such use of force      complies with the objectives and the authority required to be      cited in the appropriate Use of Force Report and the      governing principles set forth in section 101(b).       (d) Emergency Consultations.--Under emergency circumstances      affecting United States national security interests, the      President should meet promptly with the Congressional      Leadership Group on his own initiative or upon receipt of a      special request from its co-chairmen that is made on their      own initiative or pursuant to a request from a majority of      the members of the Congressional Leadership Group.     SEC. 103. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND REFERRAL OF REPORTS.       (a) Use of Force Report Required.--Not later than 48 hours      after commencing a use of force abroad, the President shall      submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to      the President pro tempore of the Senate a report stating--       (1) the objective of such use of force;       (2) in the absence of a declaration of war or specific      statutory authorization for such use of force, the specific      paragraph or paragraphs of section 101(a) setting forth the      authority for such use of force; and       (3) the manner in which such use of force complies, and      will continue to comply with, the governing principles set      forth in section 101(b).     Any such report shall be known as a Use of Force Report and      shall state that it is submitted pursuant to this subsection.       (b) Periodic Reporting Required.--Whenever force is used      abroad, the President shall, so long as the United States      Armed Forces continue to be involved in the use of force,      report to Congress periodically on the status, scope, and      expected duration of such use of force. Such reports shall be      submitted at intervals to be determined jointly by the      President and the Congressional Leadership Group.       (c) Referral of Reports.--Each report transmitted under      this section shall be immediately referred to the Committee      on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on      International Relations of the House of Representatives.

SEC. 104. CONDITIONS FOR EXTENDED USE OF FORCE.       The President may continue a use of force abroad for longer      than 60 calendar days after the date by which the appropriate      Use of Force Report is required to be submitted only if--       (1) Congress has declared war or provided specific      statutory authorization for the use of force abroad beyond      such period;     [[Page S3975]]   (2) the President has requested that      Congress enact a joint resolution constituting a declaration      of war or statutory authorization under section 105(a) but      such joint resolution has not been subject to a vote in each      House of Congress, notwithstanding the expedited procedures      to which such joint resolution would be entitled; or       (3) the President has determined and certified to the      Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro      tempore of the Senate that an emergency exists that threatens      the supreme national interests of the United States and      requires the President to exceed such period of limitation.     SEC. 105. MEASURES ELIGIBLE FOR CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITY                    PROCEDURES.       (a) Eligible Joint Resolutions.--A joint resolution shall      be entitled to the expedited procedures set forth in section      201--       (1) if such resolution--       (A) is introduced in a House of Congress by a Member of      Congress pursuant to a request by the President made in      writing to that Member, or       (B) is introduced in a House of Congress and satisfies the      cosponsorship criteria set forth in subsection (c); and--       (2) if such resolution--       (A) constitutes a declaration of war or specific statutory      authorization within the meaning of this Act, or       (B) requires the President to terminate, limit, or refrain      from a use of force abroad.       (b) Eligible Concurrent Resolutions.--A concurrent      resolution shall be entitled to the expedited procedures set      forth in section 201 if such resolution satisfies the      cosponsorship criteria set forth in subsection (c) and      contains a finding that--       (1) a use of force abroad began on a specific date or that      a Use of Force Report was required to be submitted;       (2) a use of force abroad has exceeded the period of      limitation set forth in section 104;       (3) the President has acted outside the authority of      section 101(a) or abused the authority of section 104(3); or       (4) a use of force is otherwise being conducted in a manner      inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.       (c) Cosponsorship Criteria.--A joint resolution described      in subsection (a)(1)(B) or a concurrent resolution described      in subsection (b) is a resolution for purposes of section 201      if such resolution has been cosponsored--       (1) by a majority of the members of the Congressional      Leadership Group who are members of the House of Congress in      which it is introduced; or       (2) by 30 percent of the membership of the House of      Congress in which it is introduced.     SEC. 106. FUNDING LIMITATIONS.       (a) Prohibition.--No funds made available under any      provision of law may be obligated or expended for any use of      force abroad inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.       (b) Point of Order.--(1) Whenever the Congress adopts a      concurrent resolution making a finding under paragraph (2),      (3), or (4) of section 105(b), it shall thereafter not be in      order in either House of Congress to consider any bill or      joint resolution or any amendment thereto, or any report of a      committee of conference, which authorizes or provides budget      authority to carry out such use of force.       (2) Any committee of either House of Congress that reports      any bill or joint resolution, and any committee of conference      which submits any conference report to either such House,      authorizing or providing budget authority which has the      effect of providing resources to carry out any such use of      force, shall include in the accompanying committee report or      joint statement, as the case may be, a statement that budget      authority for that purpose is authorized or provided in such      bill, resolution, or conference report.     SEC. 107. JUDICIAL REVIEW.       (a) Standing.--(1) Any Member of Congress may bring an      action in the United States District Court for the District      of Columbia for declaratory judgment on the grounds that the      provisions of this Act have been violated.       (2) A copy of any complaint in an action brought under      paragraph (1) shall be promptly delivered to the Secretary of      the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and      each House of Congress shall have the right to intervene in      such action.       (b) Three-Judge Court.--Any action brought under subsection      (a) shall be heard and determined by a three-judge court in      accordance with section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.       (c) Justiciability.--(1) In any action brought under      subsection (a), the United States District Court and the      United States Supreme Court, if applicable, shall not refuse      to make a determination on the merits based upon the doctrine      of political question, remedial discretion, equitable      discretion, ripeness, or any other finding of non-     justiciability, unless such refusal is required by Article      III of the Constitution.       (2) Notwithstanding the number, position, or political      party affiliation of any party to an action brought under      subsection (a), it is the intent of Congress that the United      States District Court and, if applicable, the United States      Supreme Court infer that Congress would disapprove of any use      of force inconsistent with the provisions of this Act and      find that an impasse exists between Congress and the      Executive which requires judicial resolution.       (d) Judicial Remedies.--If the United States District      Court, in an action brought under subsection (a), finds that      a Use of Force Report was required to have been submitted      under this Act but was not submitted, it shall issue an order      declaring that the period set forth in section 104 has begun      on the date of the United States District Court's order or on      a previous date, as may be determined by the United States      District Court.       (e) Appeal to Supreme Court.--Notwithstanding any other      provision of law, any order entered by the United States      District Court in an action brought under subsection (a),      including any finding that a Use of Force Report was or was      not required to have been submitted to the Congress, shall be      reviewable by appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the      United States. Any such appeal shall be taken by a notice of      appeal filed within 10 days after such order is entered, and      the jurisdictional statement shall be filed within 30 days      after such order is entered. No stay of an order issued      pursuant to an action brought under this section shall be      issued by a single Justice of the Supreme Court.       (f) Expedited Judicial Consideration.--It shall be the duty      of the District Court for the District of Columbia and the      Supreme Court of the United States to advance on the docket      and to expedite, to the greatest possible extent consistent      with Article III of the Constitution, the disposition of any      matter brought under this section.     SEC. 108. INTERPRETATION.       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed as      requiring any use of force abroad.       (b) Specific Authorization Required.--Authority to use      force may not be inferred--       (1) from any provision of law, unless such provision states      that it is intended to constitute specific statutory      authorization within the meaning of this Act; or       (2) from any treaty heretofore or hereafter ratified unless      such treaty is implemented by a statute stating that it is      intended to constitute specific statutory authorization      within the meaning of this Act.       (c) Status of Certain Congressional Actions.--The      disapproval by Congress of, or the failure of Congress to      approve, a measure--       (1) terminating, limiting, or prohibiting a use of force;      or       (2) containing a finding described in section 105(b);     may not be construed as indicating congressional      authorization or approval of, or acquiescence in, a use of      force abroad, or as a congressional finding that a use of      force abroad is being conducted in a manner consistent with      this Act.     SEC. 109. SEVERABILITY.       (a) Severability.--Except as provided in subsection (b), if      any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any      person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the      Act and the application of such provision to any other person      or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.       (b) Exception.--If section 101(b), 103, 104, or 106 of this      Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance      is held invalid, section 101(a) of this Act shall be deemed      invalid and the application thereof to any other person or      circumstance shall be null and void.     SEC. 110. REPEAL OF THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION.       The War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.; Public      Law 93-148), relating to the exercise of war powers by the      President under the Constitution, is hereby repealed.                     TITLE II--EXPEDITED PROCEDURES     SEC. 201. CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITY PROCEDURES.       (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--       (1) the term ``resolution'' means any resolution described      in subsection (a) or (b) of section 105; and       (2) the term ``session days'' means days on which the      respective House of Congress is in session.       (b) Referral of Resolutions.--A resolution introduced in      the House of Representatives shall be referred to the      Committee on International Relations of the House of      Representatives. A resolution introduced in the Senate shall      be referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the      Senate.       (c) Discharge of Committee.--(1) If the committee to which      is referred a resolution has not reported such a resolution      (or an identical resolution) at the end of 7 calendar days      after its introduction, such committee shall be discharged      from further consideration of such resolution, and such      resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the      House of Congress involved.       (2) After a committee reports or is discharged from a      resolution, no other resolution with respect to the same use      of force may be reported by or be discharged from such      committee while the first resolution is before the respective      House of Congress (including remaining on the calendar), a      committee of conference, or the President. This paragraph may      not be construed to prohibit concurrent consideration of a      joint resolution described in section 105(a) and a concurrent      resolution described in section 105(b).       (d) Consideration of Resolutions.--(1)(A) Whenever the      committee to which a resolution is referred has reported, or      has been discharged under subsection (c) from further      consideration of such resolution, notwithstanding any rule or      precedent of the Senate,       [[Page S3976]] including Rule 22, it is at any time      thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the      same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the      respective House of Congress to move to proceed to the      consideration of the resolution and, except as provided in      subparagraph (B) of this paragraph or paragraph (2) of this      subsection (insofar as it related to germaneness and      relevancy of amendments), all points of order against the      resolution and consideration of the resolution are waived.      The motion is highly privileged in the House of      Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is not      debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone.      A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed      to or disagreed to shall be in order, except that such motion      may not be entered for future disposition. If a motion to      proceed to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to,      the resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the      respective House of Congress, to the exclusion of all other      business, until disposed of, except as otherwise provided in      subsection (e)(1).       (B) Whenever a point of order is raised in the Senate      against the privileged status of a resolution that has been      laid before the Senate and been initially identified as      privileged for consideration under this section upon its      introduction pursuant to section 105, such point of order      shall be submitted directly to the Senate. The point of      order, ``The resolution is not privileged under the Use of      Force Act'', shall be decided by the yeas and the nays after      four hours of debate, equally divided between, and controlled      by, the Member raising the point of order and the manager of      the resolution, except that in the event the manager is in      favor of such point of order, the time in opposition thereto      shall be controlled by the Minority Leader or his designee.      Such point of order shall not be considered to establish      precedent for determination of future cases.       (2)(A)(i) Consideration in a House of Congress of the      resolution, and all amendments and debatable motions in      connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 12      hours, which, except as otherwise provided in this section,      shall be equally divided between, and controlled by, the      Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, or by their      designees.       (ii) The Majority Leader or the Minority Leader or their      designees may, from the time under their control on the      resolution, allot additional time to any Senator during the      consideration of any amendment, debatable motion, or appeal.       (B) Only amendments which are germane and relevant to the      resolution are in order. Debate on any amendment to the      resolution shall be limited to 2 hours, except that debate on      any amendment to an amendment shall be limited to 1 hour. The      time of debate for each amendment shall be equally divided      between, and controlled by, the mover of the amendment and      the manager of the resolution, except that in the event the      manager is in favor of any such amendment, the time in      opposition thereto shall be controlled by the Minority Leader      or his designee.       (C) One amendment by the Minority Leader is in order to be      offered under a one-hour time limitation immediately      following the expiration of the 12-hour time limitation if      the Minority Leader has had no opportunity to offer an      amendment to the resolution thereto. One amendment may be      offered to the amendment by the Minority Leader under the      preceding sentence, and debate shall be limited on such      amendment to one-half hour which shall be equally divided      between, and controlled by, the mover of the amendment and      the manager of the resolution, except that in the event the      manager is in favor of any such amendment, the time in      opposition thereto shall be controlled by the Minority Leader      or his designee.       (D) A motion to postpone or a motion to recommit the      resolution is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote      by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is in      order, except that such motion may not be entered for future      disposition, and debate on such motion shall be limited to 1      hour.       (3) Whenever all the time for debate on a resolution has      been used or yielded back, no further amendments may be      proposed, except as provided in paragraph (2)(C), and the      vote on the adoption of the resolution shall occur without      any intervening motion or amendment, except that a single      quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in      accordance with the rules of the appropriate House of      Congress may occur immediately before such vote.       (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the      application of the Rules of the Senate or the House of      Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure      relating to a resolution shall be limited to one-half hour of      debate, equally divided between, and controlled by, the      Member making the appeal and the manager of the resolution,      except that in the event the manager is in favor of any such      appeal, the time in opposition thereto shall be controlled by      the Minority Leader or his designee.       (e) Treatment of Other House's Resolution.--(1) Except as      provided in paragraph (2), if, before the passage by one      House of a resolution of that House, that House receives from      the other House a resolution, then the following procedures      shall apply:       (A) The resolution of the sending House shall not be      referred to a committee in the receiving House.       (B) With respect to a resolution of the House receiving the      resolution, the procedure in that House shall be the same as      if no resolution had been received from the sending House,      except that the resolution of the sending House shall be      considered to have been read for the third time.       (C) If the resolutions of the sending and receiving Houses      are identical, the vote on final passage shall be on the      resolution of the sending House.       (D) If such resolutions are not identical--       (i) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of      the sending House, with the text of the resolution of the      receiving House inserted in lieu of the text of the      resolution of the sending House;       (ii) such vote on final passage shall occur without debate      or any intervening action; and       (iii) the resolution shall be returned to the sending House      for proceedings under subsection (g).       (E) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the      other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the      resolution originated in the receiving House.       (2) If one House receives from the other House a resolution      before any such resolution is introduced in the first House,      then the resolution received shall be referred, in the case      of the House of Representatives, to the Committee on      International Relations and, in the case of the Senate, to      the Committee on Foreign Relations, and the procedures in      that House with respect to that resolution shall be the same      under this section as if the resolution received had been      introduced in that House.       (f) Treatment of Identical Resolutions.--If one House      receives from the other House a resolution after the first      House has disposed of an identical resolution, it shall be in      order to proceed by nondebatable motion to consideration of      the resolution received by the first House, and that received      resolution shall be disposed of without debate and without      amendment.       (g) Procedures Applicable to Amendments Between the Houses      of Congress.--The following procedures shall apply to dispose      of amendments between the Houses of Congress:       (1) Upon receipt by a House of Congress of a message from      the other House with respect to a resolution, it is in order      for any Member of the House receiving the message to move to      proceed to the consideration of the respective resolution.      Such motion shall be disposed of in the same manner as a      motion under subsection (d)(1)(A). Such a motion is not in      order after conferees have been appointed.       (2)(A) The time for debate in a House of Congress on any      motion required for the disposition of an amendment by the      other House to the resolution shall not exceed 2 hours,      equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover of the      motion and manager of the resolution at each stage of the      proceedings between the two Houses, except that in the event      the manager is in favor of any such motion, the time in      opposition thereto shall be controlled by the Minority Leader      or his designee.       (B) The time for debate for each amendment to a motion      shall be limited to one-half hour.       (C) Only motions proposing amendments which are germane and      relevant are in order.       (h) Procedures Applicable to Conference Reports and      Presidential Action.--(1) Either House of Congress may      disagree to an amendment or amendments made by the other      House to a resolution or may insist upon its amendment or      amendments to a resolution, and request a conference with the      other House at anytime. In the case of any disagreement      between the two Houses of Congress with respect to an      amendment or amendments to a resolution which is not resolved      within 2 session days after a House of Congress first amends      the resolution originated by the other House, each House      shall be deemed to have requested and accepted a conference      with the other House. Upon the request or acceptance of a      conference, in the case of the Senate, the President pro      tempore shall appoint conferees and, in the case of the House      of Representatives, the Speaker of the House shall appoint      conferees.       (2) In the event the conferees are unable to agree within      72 hours after the second House is notified that the first      House has agreed to conference, or after each House is deemed      to have agreed to conference, they shall report back to their      respective House in disagreement.       (3) Notwithstanding any rule in either House of Congress      concerning the printing of conference reports in the      Congressional Record or concerning any delay in the      consideration of such reports, such report, including a      report filed or returned in disagreement, shall be acted on      in the House of Representatives or the Senate not later than      2 session days after the first House files the report or, in      the case of the Senate acting first, the report is first made      available on the desks of the Senators.       (4) Debate in a House of Congress on a conference report or      a report filed or returned in disagreement in any such      resolution shall be limited to 3 hours, equally divided      between the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, and      their designees.       (5) In the case of a conference report returned to a House      of Congress in disagreement, an amendment to the amendment in      disagreement is only in order if it is germane and relevant.      The time for debate for such an amendment shall be limited to      one-half       [[Page S3977]] hour, to be equally divided between, and      controlled by, the mover of the amendment and the manager of      the resolution, except that in the event the manager is in      favor of any such amendment, the time in opposition thereto      shall be controlled by the Minority Leader or his designee.       (6) If a resolution is vetoed by the President, the time      for debate in consideration of the veto message on such      measure shall be limited to 20 hours in each House of      Congress, equally divided between, and controlled by, the      Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, and their designees.       (i) Rules of the Senate and the House.--This section is      enacted by the Congress--       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate      and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is      deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but      applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed      in that House in the case of a resolution, and it supersedes      other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with      such rules; and       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of      either House to change rules (so far as relating to the      procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and      to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that      House.     SEC. 202. REPEAL OF OBSOLETE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.       Section 1013 of the Department of State Authorization Act,      Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 1546a), relating to      expedited procedures for certain joint resolutions and bills,      is repealed.                                                                    ____             Use of Force Act--Section-by-Section Analysis       Section 1. Short Title. The title of the bill is the ``Use      of Force Act (UFA).''       Section 2. Table of Contents.       Section 3. Findings. This section sets forth three findings      regarding the need to provide a statutory framework to      facilitate joint decisionmaking between Congress and the      President regarding decisions to use force abroad.       Section 4. Statement of Purpose. The key phrase in this      section is ``confer and confirm Presidential authority.'' The      Use of Force Act is designed to bridge the long-standing--     and, for all practical purposes, unresolvable--dispute over      precisely what constitutes the President's ``inherent''      authority to use force. Whereas the War Powers Resolution      purported to delineate the President's constitutional      authority and to grant no more, the Use of Force Act sets      forth a range of authorities that are practical for the      modern age and sufficiently broad to subsume all presidential      authorities deemed ``inherent'' by any reasonable      constitutional interpretation.       Section 5. Definitions. This section defines a number of      terms, including the term ``use of force abroad,'' thus      correcting a major flaw of the War Powers Resolution, which      left undefined the term ``hostilities.''       As defined in the Use of Force Act, a ``use of force      abroad'' comprises two prongs:       (1) a deployment of U.S. armed forces (either a new      introduction of forces, a significant expansion of the U.S.      military presence in a country, or a commitment to a new      mission or objective); and       (2) the deployment is aimed at deterring an identified      threat, or the forces deployed are incurring or inflicting      casualties (or are operating with a substantial possibility      of incurring or inflicting casualties.                      title i--general provisions       Section 101. Authority and Governing Principles. This      section sets forth the Presidential authorities being      ``conferred and confirmed.'' Based on the Constitution and      this Act, the President may use force--       (1) to repel an attack on U.S. territory or U.S. forces;       (2) to deal with urgent situations threatening supreme U.S.      interests;       (3) to extricate imperiled U.S. citizens;       (4) to forestall or retaliate against specific acts of      terrorism;       (5) to defend against substantial threats to international      sea lanes or airspace.       Against a complaint that this list is excessively      permissive, it should be emphasized that these are the      President's initial authorities to undertake a use of force--     so-called ``going in'' authorities--and that the ``staying      in'' conditions set forth in section 104 will, in most cases,      bear heavily on the President's original decision.       This section also sets forth two governing principles;      necessity and proportionality. Although unavoidably imprecise      in definition, these principles set important criteria      against which any use of force can be evaluated.       Section 102. Consultation. Section 102 affirms the      importance of consultation between the President and Congress      and establishes a new means to facilitate it. To overcome the      common complaint that Presidents must contend with ``535      secretaries of state,'' the UFA establishes a Congressional      Leadership Group with whom the President is mandated to      consult on the use of force.       A framework of regular consultations between specified      Executive branch officials and relevant congressional      committees is also mandated in order to establish a ``norm''      of consultative interaction and in hope of overcoming what      many find to be the overly theatrical public-hearing process      that has superseded the more frank and informal consultations      of earlier years.       Note: An alternative to the Use of Force Act is to repeal      (or effectively repeal) the War Powers Resolution and leave      in its place only a Congressional Leadership Group. (This is      the essence of S.J. Res. 323, 100th Congress, legislation to      amend the War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Byrd,      Warner, Nunn, and Mitchell in 1988.) This approach, which      relies on ``consultation and the Constitution,'' avoids the      complexities of enacting legislation such as the UFA but      fails to solve chronic problems of procedure or authority,      leaving matters of process and power to be debated anew as      each crisis arises. In contrast, the Use of Force Act would      perform one of the valuable functions of law, which is to      guide individual and institutional behavior.       Section 103. Reporting Requirements. Section 103 requires      that the President report in writing to the Congress      concerning any use of force, not later than 48 hours after      commencing a use of force abroad.       Section 104. Conditions for Extended Use of Force. Section      104 sets forth the ``staying in'' conditions: that is, the      conditions that must be met if the President is to sustain a      use of force he has begun under the authorities set forth in      section 101. A use of force may extend beyond 60 days only      if--       (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory      authorization;       (2) the President has requested authority for an extended      use of force but Congress has failed to act on that request      (notwithstanding the expedited procedures established by      Title II of this Act);       (3) the President has certified the existence of an      emergency threatening the supreme national interests of the      United States.       The second and third conditions are designed to provide      sound means other than a declaration of war or the enactment      of specific statutory authority by which the President may      engage in an extended use of force. Through these conditions,      the Use of Force Act avoids two principal criticisms of the      War Powers Resolution: (1) that Congress could irresponsibly      require a force withdrawal simply through inaction; and (2)      that the law might, under certain cricumstances,      unconstitutionally deny the President the use of his      ``inherent'' authority.       To defuse the specter of a President hamstrung by a      Congress too timid or inept to face its responsibilities, the      UFA uses two means: first, it establishes elaborate expedited      procedures designed to ensure that a vote will occur, second,      it explicitly defeats the ``timid Congress'' specter by      granting to the President the authority he has sought if      these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote. Thus, if      the President requests authority for a sustained use of      force--one outside the realm of emergency--and Congress fails      to vote, the President's authority is extended indefinitely.       The final condition should satisfy all but proponents of an      extreme ``monarchist'' interpretation under which the      President has the constitutional authority to use force as he      sees fit. Under all other interpretations, the concept of an      ``inherent'' authority depends upon the element of emergency:      the need for the President to act under urgent circumstances      to defend the nation's security and its citizens. If so, the      UFA protects any ``inherent'' presidential authority by      affirming his ability to act for up to 60 days under the      broad-ranging authorities in section 101 and, in the event he      is prepared to certify an extended national emergency, to      exercise the authority available to him through the final      condition of section 104.       Section 105. Measures Eligible for Congressional Priority      Procedures. This section establishes criteria by which joint      and concurrent resolutions become eligible for the expedited      procedures created by Title II of the UFA.       A joint resolution that declares war or provides specific      statutory authorization--or one that terminates, limits, or      prohibits a use of force--becomes eligible if it is      introduced: (1) pursuant to a written request by the      President to any one member of Congress; (2) if cosponsored      by a majority of the members of the Congressional leadership      Group in the house where introduced; or (3) if cosponsored by      30 percent of the members of either house. Thus, there is      almost no conceivable instance in which a President can be      denied a prompt vote: he need only ask one member of Congress      to introduce a resolution on his behalf.       A concurrent resolution becomes eligible if it meets either      of the cosponsorship criteria cited above and contains a      finding that a use of force abroad began on a certain date,      or has exceeded the 60 day limitation, or has been undertaken      outside the authority provided by section 101, or is being      conducted in a manner inconsistent with the governing      principles set forth in section 101.       While having no direct legal effect, the passage of a      concurrent resolution under the UFA could have considerable      significance: politically, it would represent a clear,      prompt, and formal congressional repudiation of a      presidential action; within Congress, it would trigger      parliamentary rules blocking further consideration of      measures providing funds for the use of force in question (as      provided by section 106 of the UFA); and juridically, it      would become a consideration in any action brought by a      member of Congress for declaratory judgment and injunctive      relief (as envisaged by section 107 of the UFA).       Section 106. Funding Limitations. This section prohibits      the expenditure of funds for any use of force inconsistent      with the UFA.       [[Page S3978]] Further, this section exercises the power of      Congress to make its own rules by providing that a point of      order will lie against any measure containing funds to      perpetuate a use of force that Congress, by concurrent      resolution, has found to be illegitimate.       Section 107. Judicial Review. This section permits judicial      review of any action brought by a Member of Congress on the      grounds that the UFA has been violated. It does so by--       (1) granting standing to any Member of Congress who brings      suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia;       (2) providing that neither the District Court nor the      Supreme Court may refuse to make a determination on the      merits based on certain judicial doctrines, such as political      question or ripeness (doctrines invoked previously by courts      to avoid deciding cases regarding the war power);       (3) prescribing the judicial remedies available to the      District Court; and       (4) creating a right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court      and encouraging expeditious consideration of such appeal.       It bears emphasis that the remedy prescribed is modest, and      does not risk unwarranted interference of the judicial branch      in a decision better reposed in the political branches. The      bill provides only that the court may declare that the 60-day      period set forth in Section 104 has begun.       Section 108. Interpretation. This section clarifies several      points of interpretation, including these: that authority to      use force is not derived from other statutes or from treaties      (which create international obligations but not authority in      a domestic, constitutional context); and that the failure of      Congress to pass any joint or concurrent resolution      concerning a particular use of force may not be construed as      indicating congressional authorization or approval.       Section 109. Severability. This section stipulates that      certain sections of the UFA would be null and void, and      others not affected, if specified provisions of the UFA were      held by the Courts to be invalid.       Section 110. Repeal of WPR. Section 110 repeals the War      Powers Resolution of 1973.                     title ii--expedited procedures       Section 201. Priority Procedures. Section 201 provides for      the expedited parliamentary procedures that are integral to      the functioning of the Act. (These procedures are drawn from      the war powers legislation cited earlier, introduced by      Senator Robert Byrd et al. in 1988.)       Section 202. Repeal of Obsolete Expedited Procedures.      Section 202 repeals other expedited procedures provided for      in existing law.
