Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me just relate that a leading supporter of this piece of legislation, a minister, is sending out fund-raising literature, seeking tax-deductible contributions to support the church's efforts in lobbying the Congress to pass H.R. 2357. What this minister really wants and gets under the bill is the ability to use unreported, unlimited charitable contributions to defeat or elect someone in Congress or some place else.  Is this what we want happening in November, on November 5, or some other time? Of course not. Churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques are houses of worship. Let us keep them that way and not let politics get in the way. Let us keep a separation of church and State. Keep that wall solid and strong. If churches, synagogues, mosques and temples want to go out and raise money and have their leaders preaching from the pulpit, then they should form another organization or group. I ask Members to vote against this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
