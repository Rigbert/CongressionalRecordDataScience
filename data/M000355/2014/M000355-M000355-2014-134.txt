 President, it is with great grief and a heavy heart that I report to my fellow Senators the passing of Mrs. Nelda Barton-Collings. A native of my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Nelda was an accomplished businesswoman, a dedicated public servant, and a joy to all of those who have had the pleasure of knowing her. She died in her home last Friday at the age of 85.  Nelda was born and raised in Providence, KY, and she graduated from college just a few counties over at Western Kentucky University. After graduation she began what was to be a successful career in business. Among her many achievements, she expanded her family's nursing home business by opening new homes across the State and founded several community banks that were eventually consolidated into the Lexington-based Forcht Bank.  Nelda's pursuits were not limited to business ventures, however. She exhibited a passion for public service and was heavily involved in the Republican Party throughout her life. She was the first woman to chair the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, and she served for 28 years as Kentucky's Republican National Committeewoman. She worked tirelessly to better the lives of her fellow Kentuckians--a quality that elevated her to the national stage. In 1980, she spoke at the Republican National Convention, and in 1996, she called to order that year's convention.  Word of Nelda's dedication to public service reached all the way to the Oval Office, and she was appointed to the Federal Council on Aging and the Council for International Affairs during President Ronald Reagan's administration, as well as President George H.W. Bush's Council on Rural America.  At this time, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in paying tribute to the wonderful life of Nelda Barton-Collings. She will be deeply missed.  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an obituary for Mrs. Barton-Collings. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, June 14, 2014]Nelda Barton-Collings, Leader in Business and Republican Politics, Dies                             in Corbin at 85                           (By Jack Brammer)       Nelda Barton-Collings, who served 28 years as Republican      National Committeewoman for Kentucky and was the first woman      to be chair of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, died Friday      at her home in Corbin. She was 85.       Her death elicited comments from several of Kentucky's top      Republican officials.       U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Louisville said, ``As a      pioneer in business and politics in Kentucky, Nelda was a      fantastic force for good and gave the state she loved a      lifetime of service. Her determination to improve our      Commonwealth and nation was outmatched only by her charm and      benevolent optimism.''       U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers of Somerset said Barton-Collings ``was      a woman ahead of her time, pioneering new avenues in the      business world and proclaiming her dedication to conservative      principles.       ``She captivated crowds with her dynamic personality and      Southern charm, yet took the time to guide and mentor      individuals of all ages and social status.''       State Senate President Robert Stivers of Manchester called      Barton-Collings ``a true stateswoman who, until the end,      battled for the betterment of Kentucky'' and said her legacy      will be her ``passion for public service and her      determination to improve the Commonwealth.''       State House Majority Leader Jeff Hoover of Jamestown said      Barton-Collings' ``compassion and dedication to improving the      lives of all Kentuckians through her public service is an      example that more of us should strive to follow.''       A native of Providence in Webster County, Barton-Collings      was a successful businesswoman in banking, nursing homes,      newspapers and other small-business ventures in partnership      with Terry Forcht.       Besides her involvement with the Republican National      Committee, she was a delegate to several Republican national      conventions.       Barton-Collings also was a member of President Reagan's      Federal Council on Aging and Council for International      Affairs and President George H.W. Bush's Council on Rural      America.       Her portrait hangs in the Kentucky Capitol for a Kentucky      Women Remembered Award by the Kentucky Commission on Human      Rights.       Visitation will be from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday at the      O'Neil Lawson Funeral Home in Corbin.       Services will be at Grace on the Hill United Methodist      Church in Corbin at 11 a.m. Wednesday.       Donations may be made in her honor to Hospice of the      Bluegrass.                          ____________________
