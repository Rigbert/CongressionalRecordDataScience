 President, since 2010 I have sponsored a State of the Union essay contest for Vermont students. The contest, now in its sixth year, is an opportunity for Vermont's high school students to articulate what issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United States. A panel of Vermont teachers reviewed all of the essays submitted and selected the top 20. I am proud to say that nearly 800 students wrote essays for this year's State of the Union contest.  I would like to congratulate each and every finalist and to specifically acknowledge Meredith Holbrook as this year's winner of the contest. I would also like to recognize Vivian Huang for placing second and Ryan Racicot for placing third. I ask to have printed in the Record copies of the winning essays.  The material follows:             Meredith Holbrook, Milton High School (Winner)       My fellow Americans, today the United States has the      strongest military in the world. Our nation has the number      one economy. We have the longest running democratic      government in history. If we want to be considered the      greatest in the world, the home of the free, the land of      opportunity, then we must face the challenges before us.       In 2014, 48.1 million Americans lived in food insecure      homes, of this, 15.3 million were children. This equates to      14 percent of households being food insecure. How can the      wealthiest nation in the world be unable to feed its hungry?      We have the full capability of providing for those in need.      We should not allow politics to stop us from caring for our      citizens in need. It is impossible to expect the people of      this country to be functioning members of society without      adequate nourishment. The solution to this problem is simple:      feed America's hungry. I believe that if we were to create a      cabinet level agency dedicated specifically to food-     insecurity, we would be bettering the common good of America.      Devoting ten billion dollars from the federal budget would      make a tremendous improvement in the number of food-insecure      homes. It may be a bold move to make, but our nation cannot      move forward until our people are no longer hungry.       Alongside hunger is homelessness. On one given night in      America, about 560,000 citizens are homeless, and about      200,000 of those people are in families. It should be the      basic right of our people to have shelter and security. The      wound of homelessness cannot be solved with night time      shelters. Homeless people must be provided with long-term      shelters if they are ever to be productive members of      society. In order to solve this issue, we must invest in job      counseling. Many homeless citizens are homeless due to the      inability to acquire a job. If people had the chance to have      a clean interview outfit, as well as proper interview      instruction, there would not be as many people sleeping on      the streets. In order to make this happen, we must have more      people trained in the expertise of job counseling, and more      programs helping to aid homeless citizens. Again, this would      mean funding such programs. A small cost to pay to get      Americans off the streets.       How a nation treats its elderly says a lot about its      character. We will not be a nation that ignores the needs of      its senior citizens. Today, many seniors cannot comfortably      retire. They are often forced to choose between     paying for food or, paying for medication. They will go      without heat because they cannot afford to buy fuel. The      source of this issue is Social Security. Although this      retirement system has benefited many Americans, it needs to      be changed. Social Security often does not change with      inflation, or does not change enough to account for increased      prices. While prices are rising, Social Security is not      keeping up. This leaves seniors to make difficult choices      regarding spending. Every year, Social Security should be      assessed, and changed accordingly to inflation. To pay for      this, we would need to raise the Social Security tax      percentage to seven percent. This would allow America to      adequately pay for the needs of our elderly.       This nation is nowhere near perfect. We have many issues we      must address, domestic and foreign. We cannot expect to      properly address issues overseas, until we fix the home we      live in. We must fix America from within. Once we do this, we      will truly be able to call ourselves the greatest nation in      the world.       Vivian Huang, South Burlington High School (Second Place)       The year of 2015 has been historic for the United States of      America. We have signed a landmark agreement on climate      change, enacted marriage equality, and become economically      sound--marking greater economic growth rates than predicted      and reaching a five percent unemployment rate. Still, we      enter the year of 2016 with two pressing issues remaining on      the global and the national scale: terrorism and healthcare.      As we tackle these issues, we must remind ourselves that the      United States of America is truly one nation, indivisible,      with each citizen carrying responsibilities to support our      nation's values, as well as one another.       First, following recent acts of terror around the world, it      is top-priority for the United States to defeat the threat of      ISIS. Enough is enough. Rest assured that rather than sending      our troops to combat zones in Iraq and Syria, we will take an      active role in helping our European allies lead the battle.      America must provide rigorous train-and-assist programs for      Kurdish forces, exert a tight grip on ISIS-controlled      territory, cut off supply lines, and implore the Gulf States      to combat terrorism. Furthermore, previous experiences in      Iraq and Afghanistan have revealed that merely destroying one      source of terrorism will not suffice. To ultimately render      counterterrorism and military action unnecessary in Iraq and      Syria, we plan on developing political, economic, and      educational reforms that will effectively respond to complex      sectarian and ethnic divisions in the region.       Let's make it clear that the United States is not declaring      a war against religion, but rather against the violence of      extremism. As human beings, it is our responsibility to help      the innocent Syrian families fleeing ISIS and Assad's brutal      regime. Now is not the time to turn our backs, but to provide      humanitarian aid and shelter, even though it requires extreme      vigilance. Additionally, every American must confront the      problem of bigotry, which only becomes exploited by ISIS for      its own recruitment. We all have the duty to stand up against      discriminatory rhetoric and hostile actions. We all have the      duty to uphold the country's values by supporting each      other--our friends, neighbors, co-workers, and fellow      community members--with tolerance and respect.       Second, an important issue on the domestic front continues      to be healthcare. Physical and mental wellness is a      fundamental need for the American people. Over the past year,      the Affordable Care Act has improved access to this basic      human right for the uninsured. However, there is more to      accomplish in 2016. Until completely comprehensive universal      healthcare--namely, a single-payer system--is set into place,      Medicaid must be expanded in 20 remaining states and      community health clinics must be placed in underserved      locations.       The Department of Health and Human Services must address      the chief drivers of healthcare costs; hospital expenditures,      physician and clinical services, and skyrocketing drug prices      escalate the national health spending. To target this broad      problem, a single-payer healthcare system will minimize      unnecessary spending by requiring hospitals to operate on      government-approved standardized billing procedures. Hence,      hospitals and pharmaceutical companies will not be able to      overcharge patients and run extortionate monopolies on      essential medications.       Indeed, American citizens' rugged bravery, wise judgment,      and drive for excellence have made this country great. But we      can always progress forward, as long we stand united.      Therefore, we will tackle the urgent issues of terrorism and      healthcare not only with confidence, but also with the      ambition to remain one nation, indivisible, with liberty and      justice for all.             Ryan Racicot, Milton High School (Third Place)       The most pressing and immediate danger of today's society      is the rapidly changing climate. The scientific community      agrees virtually unanimously, that climate change is a very      real and imminent concern. Continuation down the current path      at this pace will eventually result in the ultimate demise of      the human race.       This issue is not the United States' to tackle alone. In      order to fully reverse the effects of climate change, it will      take a worldwide collaborative effort unlike anything the      world has ever faced before. The United States' role going      forward is to set an example for other first world countries.      The United Nations' conference this year in Paris was a step      in the right direction. But the United States needs to agree      to a binding commitment to reduce emissions. Without a whole-     hearted promise to abide to these reductions, the United      States will not be taken seriously on this issue.       The United States government cannot expect corporations to      make eco-friendly movements unprovoked, it is simply not      worth the financial burden. The federal government needs to      incentivize eco-friendly waste management for businesses, by      making eco-friendly business more profitable than      environmentally irresponsible business. As it stands now, no      company has motivation to protect the environment. Doing so      only hurts production and makes them less competitive. To      reverse this trend, the federal government needs to enforce      pre-existing environmental laws and spend more on      environmental saving measures.       To convert all factories to updated standards for      emissions, a large amount of money will be needed initially,      but over time, a system in which clean energy is valued more      than profit will result in a much more sustainable economy.      Companies who destroy the environment and experience greater      profit as a result will be forced to pay for their own      pollution management systems. Greatly increasing taxes on      environmentally irresponsible corporations will make clean      energy more fiscally appealing than polluting means of      energy. This is not stealing money from the American people      or a redistribution of wealth. This is using money made by      multi-billion dollar companies at the expense of the      environment to help fix the problem they themselves helped to      create. Also, by taking the charge on creating      environmentally friendly products and machinery, the      potential for the United States to make a profit is huge. By      incentivizing other countries to go eco-friendly, and selling      the materials and means to do so creates jobs and income,      which boosts the U.S. economy, all without destroying the      environment.       Unlike many other issues troubling the state of Vermont,      the nation, and the world, climate change affects every      single person. Regardless of race, gender, sexuality,      socioeconomic status, religion, education or political      affiliation, climate change affects all, especially the most      disadvantaged. Because of this, it is everyone's personal      responsibility to do their part in saving the planet. One      cannot stand idle and expect other people do all of the dirty      work. Helping to save the earth is not about how you can      benefit, it is about how you can help the greater cause. We      can no longer allow large corporations to prioritize making a      profit over responsible waste management. The short-term      profits for the rich are vastly outweighed by the long-term      environmental consequences felt by all.                          ____________________
