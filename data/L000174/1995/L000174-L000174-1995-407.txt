President, there has been a lot said about Internet, and about proposals to regulate indecent or obscene content in the Internet. There has been a lot of articles about so-called cyberporn and things of that nature.  I have had some interest in the way the legislation is proceeding. I believe I was probably the first Senator to actively hold town meetings on the Internet. I have it in my own home, as many do now, and use it continuously, when I am here in my office in Washington, in my office in Vermont, in my home in Vermont, and in the residence here.                          ____________________
