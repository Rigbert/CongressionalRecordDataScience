  I rise to speak on the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime and the decision that is before the Senate on how to respond to such inhumanity. I also come to the floor with the hope that the use of military force will not prove necessary and that the proposal to place Syria's chemical weapons program under United Nations control will, in fact, be successful.  Last night, in my view, the President delivered a strong, straightforward speech that directly outlined the current situation in Syria. He asked that a vote by the Congress to authorize military force against the Asad regime be delayed so that a strategy could be developed with Russia and the United Nations Security Council that would eliminate Syria's deadly chemical weapons program. I believe this is the appropriate path forward, and I appreciate very much the majority leader's holding off on bringing this resolutionfor a vote so that negotiations can continue. Here in the Senate, there are discussions going on about how to amend the resolution passed by the Foreign Relations Committee to provide time for diplomacy.  I would also like to take a minute to give Russia credit for bringing forward this plan for a negotiated solution to the conflict. I disagree with the Senator from Texas. As the Russian Ambassador described to me on Monday of this week, he said Russia is sincere, wants to see a United Nations resolution, and supports the Geneva II process which would accompany a negotiated settlement to Syria's civil war. Based on my conversation with Ambassador Kislyak, I believe Russia's goal is now, in fact, to eliminate these weapons, and I would point out that is also our goal.  So I very much hope that the path to settlement--although complicated, no doubt, but if well-intentioned by all participants, it can be accomplished, and I deeply believe that. If the United Nations Security Council can agree on a resolution to put this proposal into practice, it would put the world's imprimatur on an important plan to safeguard and then to destroy Syria's chemical weapons program.  Russia's responsibility to get this done is enormous, and they must move with all deliberate speed. I think Russia and Syria must understand that the only way to forestall a U.S. strike on Syria is for there to be a good-faith agreement and process underway to put all of Syria's chemical weapons--including munitions, delivery systems, and chemicals themselves--under international control for eventual demolition.  Syria's chemical weapons program is maintained and stored across Syria in more than three dozen sites. There are indications that Syria currently has chemical weapons loaded and ready for immediate use in bombs, artillery, and rockets and already loaded on planes and helicopters. All of it needs to be inventoried, collected, and then destroyed as soon as possible if the effort is to succeed. This will be a large and complicated process, and the agreement may take some time to put in place. But if it can be done, we should take the time to get it done right. At the same time, we cannot allow there to be so much delay and hesitation, as has characterized some arms control efforts in the past.  It is clear to me that the United States is moving quickly already. Tomorrow Secretary Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will meet in Geneva to discuss the specifics of how to move forward.  I cannot stress enough the importance of this process. Not only is it a possible solution to the specter of future use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime and a way to ensure that extremist elements of the opposition do not gain control of these weapons, but it also sets an important precedent for the United Nations to act to resolve conflict before there is large military confrontation.  But it should be clear by now that the Asad regime has repeatedly used chemical weapons. So I would like to speak as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and lay out some of the unclassified intelligence that shows the regime was indeed behind this largest use of chemical weapons in more than two decades. The unclassified assessment is based on classified intelligence we have seen on the Intelligence Committee and it has been available to all Senators. So here is the case.  The intelligence community assesses today, with ``high confidence,'' that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons--specifically sarin--in the Damascus suburbs in the early morning of August 21. This assessment is supported by all 16 of our intelligence agencies as well as other countries, including the United Kingdom and France.  The Obama administration has publicly laid out its case at an unclassified level, and I have carefully reviewed the classified information that supports those findings.  First, there is intelligence indicating that the Asad regime--specifically its military and the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, which manages its chemical weapons program--has used chemical weapons roughly a dozen times over the past year.  On June 13, 2 months before this latest attack, the administration stated that it had completed a review of all available intelligence and had concluded that the intelligence community had ``high confidence'' that the Asad regime used chemical weapons, ``including the nerve agent sarin, on a small scale against the opposition multiple times.'' This followed similar assessments by France, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Turkey earlier this year. In some of these cases the regime may have been testing its delivery vehicles or various amounts of chemical agents. Some were small-scale tactical uses against the opposition. Perhaps Asad was just trying to find out how the world would react to his use of chemical weapons.  It has been more than a year since top intelligence officials learned of Syrian preparations to use sarin in large quantities. Since then, at numerous other briefings and hearings, the Intelligence Committee has followed this issue closely. On September 11, 2012--exactly a year ago--while protests against our Embassy in Cairo were underway and the attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi was imminent, I was again briefed on the administration's plans should Asad conduct such an attack.  So the attack on August 21 in Damascus was not a first-time use, rather it was a major escalation in the regime's willingness to employ weapons long held as anathema by almost the entire world population.  Let me lay out the intelligence case that the Asad regime used chemical weapons on August 21. Much of this is described in a four-page August 30 unclassified document entitled ``U.S. Government Assessment of the Syrian Government's Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21, 2013.''  I ask unanimous consent that the document be printed in the Record.  We know that 3 days before the attack of August 21, Syrian officials involved in the preparation and use of chemical weapons and associated with the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center were ``preparing chemical munitions'' in the Damascus suburb of Adra. That is according to the intelligence community.  The intelligence specifically relates to an area in Adra that the regime has used for mixing chemical weapons, including sarin. The Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating and present there from August 18 to the early morning of August 21, and finished their work shortly before the attack began.  Some of the intelligence collected on the preparations for the attack is highly sensitive. So the details of the Syrian actions cannot be described publicly without jeopardizing our ability to collect this kind of intelligence in the future. But in numerous classified briefings over the past 2 weeks, Members of Congress have been provided with additional detail on the names of the officials involved and the stream of human signals and geospatial intelligence that indicates that regime was preparing to use chemical weapons. So we actually have names.  It is from the specificity of this intelligence reporting that the intelligence community has drawn its high level of confidence that the regime was behind the use of chemical weapons. The strike began in the early morning hours on Wednesday, August 21. It is beyond doubt that large amounts of artillery and rockets were launched from regime-controlled territory in Damascus and rained down on the opposition-controlled areas of the Damascus suburbs. There is satellite imagery actually showing this, as well as thousands of firsthand accounts that began showing up on social media sites at around 2:30 a.m.  The barrage continued for 5 days, though the use of chemical weapons appears to have been deliberately suspended by the regime after the first few hours. Since the attack, physical samples from the area have been analyzed. The intelligence community assesses with high confidence that ``laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals revealed exposure to Sarin.''  More than 100 videos were posted online showing the effects of the chemical weapons on hundreds of men, women and, most troubling, sleeping children who were dead or showing thesigns of exposure to the nerve agent. At my request, the intelligence community compiled a representative sample of 13 videos which have been corroborated and verified. According to the intelligence community, ``At least 12 locations are portrayed in the publicly available videos, and a sampling of those videos confirmed that some were shot at general times and locations described in the footage.''  These videos clearly show the suffering and death caused by these weapons. The intelligence committee has posted these videos on our Web site, www.intelligence.senate.gov. I would urge all Americans to look at this. They are absolutely horrendous and should shock the conscience of all humanity.  The videos show the physical manifestations of a nerve agent attack: foaming mouth, pinpointed and constricted pupils, convulsions, gasping for breath, all happening as the nervous system begins to shut down.  One video shows a lifeless toddler receiving emergency respiratory assistance. Another shows a young boy struggling to breathe, gasping while his eyes are swollen shut and covered in mucous. A third heinous video shows rows and rows of bodies lined up in an improvised morgue. Another shows a man foaming at the mouth and convulsing, both indications of sarin exposure. It goes on and on.  Last night, the President urged all Americans to watch these videos to see how hideous the use of these chemicals actually is. Seeing these images firsthand makes clear why chemical weapons have been banned and why Asad must be prevented from using them again.  What truly affected me was a video I saw of a little Syrian girl with long dark hair who was wearing pajamas. The little girl looked just like my daughter at that age--same hair, same pajamas, same innocence, except the little Syrian girl was lifeless. She had died from exposure to sarin, a chemical the world has essentially outlawed. For me, watching the videos shows the abhorrence of chemical weapons. It shows why we must do something. Fired into densely populated areas such as cities, they have an indiscriminate effect, killing everyone in their path and causing suffering and eventual death to others nearby.  We have evidence that the chemical attack was premeditated and planned as part of the regime's heinous tactics against the rebels. Specifically, there is intelligence that Syrian regime personnel were prepared with gas masks for its people in the area, so it could clear these areas in the Damascus suburbs that were attacked in order to wrest control from the opposition. Additional intelligence collected following the attacks includes communications from regime officials that confirms their knowledge that chemical weapons were used.  Let me repeat that. Additional intelligence following the attack includes communications from regime officials that confirms their knowledge that chemical weapons were used. The official unclassified intelligence assessment distributed by the administration states: ``We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence.'' On the afternoon of August 21, we have intelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to ``cease operations.'' This is specific evidence.  To sum up the intelligence case, I have no doubt the regime ordered the use of chemical weapons on August 21. I also have no doubt the use of these weapons by the military and under the guidance of Syria's chemical weapons team, Branch 450, operates under the command and control of the regime, under the ultimate leadership and responsibility of President Asad.  Let me move now from the intelligence case of Syria's use of sarin on August 21 to the question before the Senate of how to respond. As I said in the beginning, it would be my strong hope that the United States and Russia can come to an agreement with other U.N. Security Council members on a way to resolve this situation peacefully.  Not only is a peaceful solution preferred to the use of force, but if Syria's chemical weapons program, including all of its precursors, chemicals, equipment, delivery systems, and loaded bombs, can be put in the custody of the United Nations for its eventual destruction, that would provide a much stronger protection against future use.  It also sets an important precedent for the future for the world to settle other disputes of this nature. I have urged the Obama administration to take all possible steps to make this proposal work. I appreciate the President's decision to ask us to delay any use-of-force resolution so diplomacy can be given a chance. However, the Senate may still face a resolution to authorize the use of force in the event that all diplomatic options fail. Many of my colleagues have noted that the threat of force has helped push forward the diplomatic option.  The Asad regime has clearly used chemical weapons to gas its own people. I believe it will most likely do so again, unless it is confronted with a major condemnation by the world. That now is beginning to happen.  The regime has escalated its attacks from small scale ones that killed 6 or 8 to 10 people with sarin to an attack that killed more than 1,000. We know the regime has munitions that could kill tens of thousands of Syrians in Aleppo or Homs. If the world does not respond now, we bear the responsibility if a larger tragedy happens later.  Of course, it is not only Syria who is looking at preparing and using weapons long banned by the international community. Iran is watching intently what the world will do in Syria and will apply the lessons it learns to its current development of nuclear weapons.  North Korea, which has refrained from using both the nuclear weapons it has and the chemical weapons stockpile that actually dwarfs that of Syria, may well use the Asad example to fire on South Korea. Remember, we have 28,000-plus troops right over the border of the DMZ, within a half hour.  More generally, countries around the world will see the United States as a paper tiger if it promises to take action but fails to do so. Former Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates, whom I have great respect for, who worked in both the Bush and Obama administrations, said exactly that when he came out in support on the resolution for use of force against Syria.  Gates said this:       I strongly urge the Congress, both Democrats and      Republicans, to approve the President's request for      authorization to use force. Whatever one's views on the      current United States policy towards Syria, failure by      Congress to approve the request would, in my view, have      profoundly negative and dangerous consequences for the United      States, not just in the Middle East, but around the world      both now and in the future.  I strongly believe the major powers in the world have a responsibility to take action when a country not only slaughters 100,000 of its own citizens, makes millions homeless within Syria, and makes millions into refugees in Turkey and Jordan, but especially when it is willing to use weapons against them that have been banned as an affront to all humanity because they are outlawed by a treaty joined by 189 nations representing 98 percent of the world's population.  If the United Nations does not act in such cases, I believe it becomes irrelevant. If nothing is done to stop this use of chemical weapons, they will be used in future conflicts. I am confident of that.  American servicemen in World War I were gassed with their allied partners. In our briefings over the past week, the military has made clear to us that if we allow the prohibition on chemical weapons use to erode, our men and women in uniform may again suffer from these weapons on the battlefield.  Chemical weapons are not like conventional weapons. Consider for a moment how sarin, for example, can kill so indiscriminately. The closer you are to the release, such as from a mortar or an artillery shell, the more certain you are to death. It spreads over a wide geographic area. It can shift from one neighborhood to another if the wind shifts.  During World War I, chemical weapons, primarily chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas were used by both sides of the war. They caused an estimated 100,000 fatalities and 1.3 million injuries, 1,462 American soldiers were killed, and 72,807 were injured by chemical weapons, which represented one-third of all U.S. casualties during World War I.  Since World War I, not a single U.S. soldier has died in battle from exposure to chemical weapons. However, according to the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, ``since World War I, chemical weapons have caused more than 1 million casualties globally.''  During World War II, Nazi Germany used carbon monoxide and pesticides such as Zyklon B in gas chambers during the Holocaust, killing an estimated 3 million people.  An additional document will be printed in the Record that details the history and uses of chemical weapons around the world since World War I.  These past uses of chemical weapons make clear that they should never be used again and that the entire world must stand up and take action if they are.  In Syria, the intentional use of chemical weapons on civilians, on men, women, and children gassed to death during the middle of the night while they were sleeping, is a travesty that reflects hatred and increasing desperation of the Asad regime. I also believe there are other chemical weapons that have been mixed and loaded into delivery vehicles with the potential to kill thousands more.  Think about that. If Asad can slaughter 100,000 of his own people without a second thought, what is he going to do next if we do nothing to hold him accountable? What is he going to do next if the United Nations does nothing? What is he going to do next if this effort to reach consensus on the Security Council doesn't work? He will use them again. I believe they are ready to go.  Why would the Asad regime load bombs with chemical weapons and not use them?  If the United States does nothing in the face of this atrocity, it sends such a signal of weakness to the rest of the world that we are, yes, a paper tiger. That is going to be the conclusion in Iran and in North Korea.  The answer is we cannot turn our backs. The use of chemical weapons is prohibited by international law and it must now be condemned by the world with action.  Albert Einstein said in a well-known quote: ``The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.''  For more than 90 years, our country has played the leading role in the world in prohibiting the atrocities of World War I and then World War II. We are the Nation that others look upon to stop repressive dictators and massive violations of human rights. We must act in Syria. We cannot withdraw into our own borders, do nothing, and let the slaughter continue.  I hope military force will not be needed, that we will allow the time for the United Nations and the parties on the Security Council to put an agreement together, and that the threat of force will be sufficient to change President Asad's behavior.  If these diplomatic efforts at the U.N. fail, I know we are going to be back here on the floor to consider the authorization for use of military force, but I sincerely hope it won't be necessary.  When the Ambassador from Russia described Russia's intentions to me on Monday, he told me it was sincere. Now the ball is in Russia's court. Russia and the United States will need to come together, bring the other parties together, and make it possible for the United Nations to act so the United States won't have to.  I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Government Assessment of the Syrian Government's Use of Chemical                        Weapons on August 21, 2013       The United States Government assesses with high confidence      that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons      attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21, 2013. We further      assess that the regime used a nerve agent in the attack.      These all-source assessments are based on human, signals, and      geospatial intelligence as well as a significant body of open      source reporting. Our classified assessments have been shared      with the U.S. Congress and key international partners. To      protect sources and methods, we cannot publicly release all      available intelligence--but what follows is an unclassified      summary of the U.S. Intelligence Community's analysis of what      took place.         Syrian Government Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21       A large body of independent sources indicates that a      chemical weapons attack took place in the Damascus suburbs on      August 21. In addition to U.S. intelligence information,      there are accounts from international and Syrian medical      personnel; videos; witness accounts; thousands of social      media reports from at least 12 different locations in the      Damascus area; journalist accounts; and reports from highly      credible nongovernmental organizations.       A preliminary U.S. government assessment determined that      1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack,      including at least 426 children, though this assessment will      certainly evolve as we obtain more information.       We assess with high confidence that the Syrian government      carried out the chemical weapons attack against opposition      elements in the Damascus suburbs on August 21. We assess that      the scenario in which the opposition executed the attack on      August 21 is highly unlikely. The body of information used to      make this assessment includes intelligence pertaining to the      regime's preparations for this attack and its means of      delivery, multiple streams of intelligence about the attack      itself and its effect, our post-attack observations, and the      differences between the capabilities of the regime and the      opposition. Our high confidence assessment is the strongest      position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short      of confirmation. We will continue to seek additional      information to close gaps in our understanding of what took      place.                               Background       The Syrian regime maintains a stockpile of numerous      chemical agents, including mustard, sarin, and VX and has      thousands of munitions that can be used to deliver chemical      warfare agents.       Syrian President Bashar al-Asad is the ultimate decision      maker for the chemical weapons program and members of the      program are carefully vetted to ensure security and loyalty.      The Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC)--     which is subordinate to the Syrian Ministry of Defense--     manages Syria's chemical weapons program.       We assess with high confidence that the Syrian regime has      used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition      multiple times in the last year, including in the Damascus      suburbs. This assessment is based on multiple streams of      information including reporting of Syrian officials planning      and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory      analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of      individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin. We assess that      the opposition has not used chemical weapons.       The Syrian regime has the types of munitions that we assess      were used to carry out the attack on August 21, and has the      ability to strike simultaneously in multiple locations. We      have seen no indication that the opposition has carried out a      large-scale, coordinated rocket and artillery attack like the      one that occurred on August 21.       We assess that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons      over the last year primarily to gain the upper hand or break      a stalemate in areas where it has struggled to seize and hold      strategically valuable territory. In this regard, we continue      to judge that the Syrian regime views chemical weapons as one      of many tools in its arsenal, including air power and      ballistic missiles, which they indiscriminately use against      the opposition.       The Syrian regime has initiated an effort to rid the      Damascus suburbs of opposition forces using the area as a      base to stage attacks against regime targets in the capital.      The regime has failed to clear dozens of Damascus      neighborhoods of opposition elements, including neighborhoods      targeted on August 21, despite employing nearly all of its      conventional weapons systems. We assess that the regime's      frustration with its inability to secure large portions of      Damascus may have contributed to its decision to use chemical      weapons on August 21.                              Preparation       We have intelligence that leads us to assess that Syrian      chemical weapons personnel--including personnel assessed to      be associated with the SSRC--were preparing chemical      munitions prior to the attack. In the three days prior to the      attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial      intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess      were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons      attack.       Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating in the      Damascus suburb of Adra from Sunday, August 18 until early in      the morning on Wednesday, August 21 near an area that the      regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin. On      August 21, a Syrian regime element prepared for a chemical      weapons attack in the Damascus area, including through the      utilization of gas masks. Our intelligence sources in the      Damascus area did not detect any indications in the days      prior to the attack that opposition affiliates were planning      to use chemical weapons.                               The Attack       Multiple streams of intelligence indicate that the regime      executed a rocket and artillery attack against the Damascus      suburbs in the early hours of August 21. Satellite detections      corroborate that attacks from a regime-controlled area struck      neighborhoods     where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred--including      Kafr Batna, Jawbar, Ayn Tarma, Darayya, and Mu'addamiyah.      This includes the detection of rocket launches from regime      controlled territory early in the morning, approximately 90      minutes before the first report of a chemical attack appeared      in social media. The lack of flight activity or missile      launches also leads us to conclude that the regime used      rockets in the attack.       Local social media reports of a chemical attack in the      Damascus suburbs began at 2:30 a.m. local time on August 21.      Within the next four hours there were thousands of social      media reports on this attack from at least 12 different      locations in the Damascus area. Multiple accounts described      chemical-filled rockets impacting opposition-controlled      areas.       Three hospitals in the Damascus area received approximately      3,600 patients displaying symptoms consistent with nerve      agent exposure in less than three hours on the morning of      August 21, according to a highly credible international      humanitarian organization. The reported symptoms, and the      epidemiological pattern of events--characterized by the      massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the      origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and      first aid workers--were consistent with mass exposure to a      nerve agent. We also received reports from international and      Syrian medical personnel on the ground.       We have identified one hundred videos attributed to the      attack, many of which show large numbers of bodies exhibiting      physical signs consistent with, but not unique to, nerve      agent exposure. The reported symptoms of victims included      unconsciousness, foaming from the nose and mouth, constricted      pupils, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing. Several of      the videos show what appear to be numerous fatalities with no      visible injuries, which is consistent with death from      chemical weapons, and inconsistent with death from small-     arms, high-explosive munitions or blister agents. At least 12      locations are portrayed in the publicly available videos, and      a sampling of those videos confirmed that some were shot at      the general times and locations described in the footage.       We assess the Syrian opposition does not have the      capability to fabricate all of the videos, physical symptoms      verified by medical personnel and NGOs, and other information      associated with this chemical attack.       We have a body of information, including past Syrian      practice, that leads us to conclude that regime officials      were witting of and directed the attack on August 21. We      intercepted communications involving a senior official      intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that      chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was      concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence. On the      afternoon of August 21, we have intelligence that Syrian      chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations.      At the same time, the regime intensified the artillery      barrage targeting many of the neighborhoods where chemical      attacks occurred. In the 24 hour period after the attack, we      detected indications of artillery and rocket fire at a rate      approximately four times higher than the ten preceding days.      We continued to see indications of sustained shelling in the      neighborhoods up until the morning of August 26.       To conclude, there is a substantial body of information      that implicates the Syrian government's responsibility in the      chemical weapons attack that took place on August 21. As      indicated, there is additional intelligence that remains      classified because of sources and methods concerns that is      being provided to Congress and international partners.                                  ____                     Chemical Weapons Usage Since                               World War I       1,462 American soldiers were killed and 72,807 injured by      chemical weapons in World War I, one-third of all U.S.      casualties during the war. No Americans have died in battle      from chemical weapons since World War I.       According to the United Nations Office for Disarmament      Affairs, ``Since World War I, chemical weapons have caused      more than one million casualties globally.''       1914-1918--During World War I, chemical weapons (primarily      chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas) were used by both sides      and caused an estimated 100,000 fatalities and 1.3 million      injuries.       During the war, Germany used 68,000 tons of gas, the French      used 36,000 tons, and the British used 25,000.       April 1915--Germany used chlorine gas at the Battle of      Ypres. This is the first significant use of chemical weapons      in World War I.       September 1915--The British used chlorine gas against the      Germans at the Battle of Loos.       February 1918--Germans used phosgene and chloropicrin      artillery shells against American troops. This is the first      major use of chemical weapons against U.S. forces.       June 1918--The United States employed a wide variety of      chemical weapons against Axis forces using British and French      artillery shells.       1918-1921--The Bolshevik army used chemical weapons to      suppress at least three uprisings following the Bolshevik      revolution.       1919--The British Air Force used Adamsite gas, a vomiting      agent, against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War.       1921-1927--Spanish forces used mustard gas against Berber      rebels during the Third Rif War in Morocco.       1936--Italy used mustard gas during its invasion of      Ethiopia.
