 President, I rise today to commend three Vermonters who will be representing the United States in the Olympic Games in London. One hundred years ago Albert Gutterson of Springfield, VT, won Olympic Gold in the broad jump. This year, Lea Davison, Trevor Moore and Andrew Wheating are the latest in a long line of Vermonters to compete in the world's most prestigious athletic competition.  Lea Davison won the first mountain bike race she ever entered when she was 17 years old. A native of Jericho, VT, Lea competed in cross country and was a Division I alpine ski racer at Middlebury College before becoming the youngest woman to join the professional mountain biking tour. Lea has become one of the dominant forces in professional women's mountain biking but still takes time to give back to the community, running a summer camp for girls from Vermont who are interested in cycling.  Trevor Moore began sailing with his father and brother at a very young age. When he moved to North Pomfret, VT, as a teenager his passion for competition led him to play for Woodstock Union High's tennis and soccer teams. At Hobart College, Trevor was an accomplished sailor and a three-time All American, in addition to being named the 2007 College Sailor of the Year. He will be competing with Erik Storck in the 49er category in London.  London will mark Andrew Wheating's second Olympic Games. He competed for the track team in the 800 meter race at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Andrew is originally from Norwich, VT. Recruited by the University of Oregon, he was the NCAA champion in the 800 meters in 2009 and 2010 and in the 1600 meters in 2010. Andrew is renowned for his ability to come from behind in races and will be competing in the 1600 meters in London.  Vermont is proud of Lea, Trevor, and Andrew, and I and the citizens of my State wish them the best of luck at the 2012 Olympic Games.                          ____________________
