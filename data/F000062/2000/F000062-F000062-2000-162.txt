 President, in all too many places and in all too many conflicts in recent years we have witnessed the use of rape and sexual torture as instruments of war. I am sad to say, some incidence of rape has always accompanied war and turmoil in human history, but the record of the past few years, with the use of organized, systematic campaigns of rape to terrorize civilian populations, suggests a new chapter in the barbarity of human history has been opened.  It was disturbing to learn there are serious and credible allegations that rebel forces used systematic rape as an instrument of terror in the eight-year civil war in Sierra Leone.  While statistics are not yet available, there is clear and credible evidence that thousands of girls and women, ranging from ages 5 to 75, were abducted during the civil war and gang raped. Many were used as sex slaves and forced labor. And it is possible many are still being held captive, subject to the depravations of their inhuman captors.  This horrific story was detailed in an article in yesterday's Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent to have the article, entitled ``A War Against Women'' from the April 11, 2000, Washington Post printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks.  The civilized world must send a strong, unambiguous message that rape and sexual torture are not acceptable under any circumstances and will not be tolerated. The United States must be at the forefront of efforts to help the Government of Sierra Leone bring to justice those responsible for the systematic rape and sexual torture that took place during the civil war.               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 11, 2000] A War Against Women--Sierra Leone Rebels Practiced Systematic Sexual                                  Terror                           (By Douglas Farah)       Blama Camp, Sierra Leone--The women slip one at a time into      a bamboo hut in this displaced persons camp, and most begin      to cry quietly as they tell of being gang-raped and held as      sex slaves by rebels who had sought to overthrow the      government of Sierra Leone.       One 25-year-old woman said she had delivered a still-born      baby the day before rebels of the Revolutionary United Front      attacked her village in 1998. She was unable to flee with      most of the other villagers, and five rebels took turns      raping her, she said. When her husband tried to intervene,      they killed him.       ``I thought at first I was dealing with human beings, so I      said I was sad and confused because I had just delivered a      dead baby, I was bloody and weak,'' she said between sobs.      ``But they were not human beings. After they left I gave up,      and I wanted to die. I had no reason to live anymore.''       Human rights workers says the woman, who was rescued by a      patrol of government troops, is one of thousands who were      raped by insurgent forces and other armed gangs during the      nation's eight-year civil war. While statistics are not yet      available, rights workers said the rebels' rape campaign was      as widespread and systematic as similar assaults in the 1992-     1995 Bosnian war but has received far less attention.       Unlike at least some of the perpetrators in Bosnia, those      responsible here likely will never be tried because of a      blanket amnesty that was part of the accord that ended the      conflict last July. Even more worrisome, U.N. officials and      government officials say, is that the rebels may still hold      thousands of women in remote strongholds despite the fact      that the peace accord required them to free all captive      civilians.       ``The [rebels] perpetrated systematic, organized and      widespread sexual violence against girls and women,'' the New      York-based group Human Rights Watch said in a recent report.      ``The rebels planned and launched operations in which they      rounded up girls and women, brought them to rebel command      centers and then subjected them to individual and gang rape.      Young girls under 17, and particularly those deemed to be      virgins were specifically targeted. While some were released      or managed to escape, hundreds continue to be held in sexual      slavery after being `married' to rebel combatants.''       Rose Luz, a physician with the International Rescue      Committee, said that what is most shocking about the hundreds      of rape cases she is documenting is the ages of the victims.      Most were under 14 or over 45--many of whom were too slow or      too infirm to flee. Luz said the youngest victim documented      so far was 5; the oldest was 75.       ``It is the ones who could not get away,'' Luz said. ``They      raped whomever they stumbled across.''       With the consent of the women involved, Rescue Committee      officials arranged for a reporter to be present during some      interviews. It was agreed that no names would be used or      photographs taken. The interviews were conducted at this      camp--about 160 miles southeast of the capital, Freetown--     which shelters 22,500 people who were driven from their homes      in eastern Sierra Leone by insurgent forces.       If the rebels considered a woman attractive or physically      fit enough to work, she would likely be taken along with      them--not just to be a sex slave, but a domestic servant as      well, Luz and other aid workers said. Often, they said, a      captive woman would try to attach herself to one leader to      avoid repeated gang rape. In a culture in which rape victims      are often ostracized, such wholesale assaults were effective      not only in spreading terror, but in breaking apart      communities, social workers said.       The first victims began telling their stories to the Rescue      Committee when the aid group started reproductive health      classes here several months ago, said counselor Dolly      Williams. Last month, in an effort to refer the women for      urgently needed medical attention and help them cope with      their shame and humiliation, the Rescue Committee began      documenting their stories. As word of the program spread,      hundreds of women have come forward, waiting their turn      patiently while Williams and Luz record the accounts of other      victims.       ``Child and women abductees and victims of gender violence      are far too numerous, and we do not yet even have a clear      picture as to how many there really are,'' said U.S.      Ambassador Joseph H. Melrose Jr., who is trying to arrange      for U.S. funds to help the victims. ``What is clear is that      these victims and their injuries, both physical and      psychological, must not be ignored. If these injuries do not      heal, they will have implications for future generations of      Sierra Leoneans and the success of the peace process.''       Williams said the rate of sexually transmitted diseases      such as syphilis and gonorrhea among the women is extremely      high, a reflection of the 92 percent infection rate found      among demobilized rebels. Neither the combatants nor the      women are tested for AIDS or HIV infection because the cost      is too great and there are no resources to treat anyone who      tests positive.       The first woman to arrive at the palm-thatched interview      room one day last week was a 60-year-old who came to tell how      she was grabbed in her village by a group of raiders because      she was unable to outrun them. When they could not find any      other women, she said, they raped her.       ``I begged them not to,'' she said. I told them I was old.      I could be their grandmother,'' but they did not listen; they      just laughed at me. Afterward they let me go because I was      old and useless. Now I have pain when I urinate. I have      sores; I can't sleep.''       A 35-year-old woman said she had been abducted and raped by      four rebels in 1997. When they had finished, she said, they      took her to their commander, who decided to keep her. She      finally escaped three years later, during a firefight between      the rebel unit and government troops.       ``I can't have a man again,'' she told the interviewer. ``I      have lost my life.''                          ____________________
