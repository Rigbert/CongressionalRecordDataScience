President, first, if I might, I wish to compliment my colleague and neighbor from across the Connecticut River, Senator Sununu of New Hampshire. He has laid out very clearly and eloquently the reasons we should not be rushed into a bad bill. It is not because any of us here have any love of terrorists. Of course none of us do; no Americans do.  On a September morning 4 years ago, nearly 3,000 lives, American lives, were lost--not in a foreign nation but on our own soil. Our lives as Americans changed in an instant. There is not a person within this Chamber who does not remember exactly where he or she was when they heard the news of the attacks of 9/11. In the aftermath of those attacks, Congress moved swiftly to pass antiterterrorism legislation. We moved as a Congress, as a Senate, as a House--not as Republicans or as Democrats, but as Americans, united in our efforts. The fires were still smoldering at Ground Zero in New York City when the USA PATRIOT Act became law on October 30, 2001, just 6 weeks after the attacks.  I know how hard we worked. I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. Many of us here in the Senate today worked together in that spirit of bipartisan unity. We resolved to craft a bill that would make us safer as a nation.  Freedom and security are always in tension in our society, especially so in those somber weeks after the attacks. We tried our best to strike the right balance between freedom and security.  The Senator from New Hampshire quoted Benjamin Franklin. As one reads the history of the founding of this Nation and what the Founders went through, his quote stands out so much. Benjamin Franklin, like the other Founders, knew that had our new country not worked, had the Revolution not worked, most of them would have been hanged for trying to break away from our mother country. When he spoke of a people who would give up their liberties for security deserving neither, he knew of what he spoke. And he set a key idea for the fledgling democracy of America, and it is one that I like to think through the generations we have strengthened. During my years in the Senate, I have done everything possible to strengthen that balance to maintain our liberties because if we do not maintain our liberties, at the best we have a false security. It is not a real security.  One of the fruits of the bipartisanship of the PATRIOT Act, in trying to work out this balance, was the sunset provisions. Those key provisions set an expiration date of December 31, 2005, on certain Government powers that had great potential to affect the civil liberties of the American people. We are just weeks away from that date now.  Some may wonder how these sunset provisions worked their way into the PATRIOT Act. They were put there by the Republican leader of the House, Dick Armey of Texas, and myself. We have entirely different political philosophies, but we agreed on one thing: If you are giving great powers to our Government, you want to make sure there are some strings attached. It makes no difference whether it is a Republican administration or a Democratic administration, you want to make sure there are strings attached. Leader Armey and I insisted on these sunsets to ensure that Congress would revisit the PATRIOT Act within a few years and consider refinements to protect the rights and liberties of all Americans more effectively, and we prevailed on that point.  Sadly, the administration and some in the leadership in the House and Senate have squandered key opportunities to improve the PATRIOT Act. The House-Senate conference report filed last week by Republican lawmakers falls short of what the American people expect and deserve from us. The bipartisan Senate bill, which the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Senate adopted unanimously, struck a better balance.  If I might, I wish to compliment the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Arlen Specter, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, and those Republicans and Democrats in this body who worked with him, as I did, to put together a fair and balanced bill which was able to go through our committee, which is sometimes heavily divided on issues. Instead, it went through the Judiciary Committee unanimously and passed the Senate unanimously. We worked together on that because we understand that thereauthorization of the PATRIOT Act has to have the confidence of the American people.  Think for a moment. Governments can limit the rights of the people in their countries really in only two ways: they can do it by force of arms, by oppression and repression, as we have seen with totalitarian governments, or, if they have done it right, they can do it with the consent of the governed.  As we are limiting some of these rights, as we are giving greater powers to our Government, we want to do it in a way where the American people--all of the nearly 300 million people in this great country--would have confidence in what we have done, because we do not enforce our laws in this country by force of arms, by dictatorship; we do it with the consent of the governed.  I believe what we passed in the Senate and in the Senate Judiciary Committee would have the confidence of the American people. But now we have pushed forward and changed that to flawed legislation which will not have that confidence and respect of the American people. The Congress should not rush ahead to enact flawed legislation to meet a deadline that is within our power to extend. We owe it to the American people to get this right. America can do better than this flawed legislation.  The way forward to a sensible, workable, bipartisan bill is clear. It is very clear, as Senator Sununu said on the floor earlier this morning and as I have suggested. Yesterday, Senator Sununu and I introduced a bill to extend the sunset for the expiring PATRIOT Act powers until March 31, 2006. Give us until March 31 to get this right, give us until March 31 to have a bill that would have not only the respect of the American people but especially the confidence of the American people. Our laws work if we have confidence in them, and they fail if we do not have confidence in them.  In offering this bill, Senator Sununu and I have been joined by Senators Craig, Rockefeller, Murkowski, Kennedy, Hagel, Levin, Durbin, Stabenow, Salazar, and others. It is a bipartisan effort to extend this deadline. A deadline which Congress imposed to ensure oversight and accountability should not now become a barrier to achieving bipartisan compromise and the best bill we can forge together.  This is a vital debate. It should be. These are vital issues to all Americans. If a brief extension is needed to produce a better bill that would better serve all of our citizen then by all means, let us give ourselves that time. We want to give tools to prosecutors. I spent 8 years of my life as a prosecutor. Some of the finest people on my staff are former prosecutors. We know the needs, especially in the electronic age. But we can do better, and America can do better if given the time.  I thank Senator Sununu and all of our cosponsors in coming together in a bipartisan way to advance what is a commonsense solution.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some recent editorials on this matter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 12, 2005]                          A Better Patriot Act       The conference report on the USA Patriot Act      reauthorization bill contains one major improvement over the      previous version and a few minor ones. The new bill contains      strong ``sunset'' provisions, under which the three most      controversial provisions would lapse again after four years,      not the seven of the earlier draft. This is no small win for      civil liberties. The sunset provisions in the original      Patriot Act have given Congress leverage over the past few      years to extract information from an administration not known      for openness concerning its use of the powers Congress gave      it. Insisting that the administration justify itself again      relatively soon ensures that Congress will be able to adjust      and refine the law as need be.       Yet the conference report remains far from perfect. A      bipartisan group of senators is still objecting that it does      too little to protect civil liberties, and they are      threatening a filibuster, though it is not clear whether they      have the votes to sustain one. Some of the changes they are      seeking are reasonable and constructive. While the bill does      not contain the worst excesses of the House version, which      was larded with irrelevant and often terrible policy changes,      it still has a fair number of extraneous sections. Some are      silly, some ugly.       What makes all this so frustrating is that a consensus bill      was surely possible. Indeed, it happened. The Senate version      of the bill passed on a unanimous vote, representing broad      agreement to grant government authorities the powers they      legitimately need while ensuring accountability in their      use--and it didn't contain a raft of irrelevant laws      unrelated to intelligence. The members balking at the current      bill would do a service if they forced a cleaner, more      accountable Patriot Act reauthorization.       Debate over the conference report has focused on a narrow      array of civil liberties issues, all quite technical. The      rhetoric from civil libertarians makes the stakes here seem      greater than they really are. The differences between the      various proposals are not huge in practical terms. They are,      however, significant. The conference report contains weaker      controls on secret warrants for business records in national      security cases than the Senate bill did. It also does too      little to get a handle on the use of national security      letters--a form of administrative subpoena that the FBI uses      in national security cases to obtain records of certain      business transactions. These problems are not unsolvable, and      it's hard to believe the government is today getting much      data through uses of these powers that would be forbidden      were they written more accountably.       What's more, sift through the bill and you'll find      provisions dealing with tobacco smuggling, establishing civil      immunity for folks who donate firefighting equipment to fire      departments, establishing new crimes--some punishable by      death--related to marine navigation, creating a new national      security division in the Justice Department, letting Secret      Service forensics experts help out in finding missing kids,      combating methamphetamine abuse and making life more      miserable for people challenging state convictions in federal      court. None of this, needless to say, has much to do with      protecting America from al Qaeda.       The Patriot Act cannot be allowed to lapse at year's end,      and the current bill is much improved over earlier versions.      But it could still be a lot better. Precisely because the      administration cannot afford to let its powers expire,      further improvement should still be possible.                                  ____                  [From the Fresno Bee, Dec. 12, 2005]                             Take the Time       Fresno, CA.--Barring an unlikely successful filibuster, the      USA Patriot Act is likely to be renewed this week, mostly in      the form it was given in 2001. That's when Congress, in the      wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, rushed to give law      enforcement broader powers of investigation. That's still      justified up to a point. Law enforcement and intelligence      agencies should not be hamstrung, for instance, by a now-     lapsed ban on sharing information.       But it's risky to give blanket authority to government      agencies to bypass the courts, as this law partly does. It's      too tempting to look into every nook and cranny just to be      sure there isn't something amiss there.       After lengthy debate behind closed doors, a House-Senate      conference committee agreed on compromise language that      congressional negotiators say will include more protection      for individuals. But if that's true, why do six senators--     three Democrats and three Republicans--still oppose the      measure? (One of them--Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin,      the only senator to vote against the original law--is      threatening to filibuster the revised version on the Senate      floor.)       The principal objection of these lawmakers, and those of us      who cherish individual liberty, is that the law sets too low      a threshold for justifying the need to examine private      records, including medical, financial and employment. And      they are not persuaded--nor are we--that requiring      authorities to show that their investigation has some      relevance to an anti-terror investigation is enough.       These secret searches should be limited to specific      individuals and not be so broad as to allow ``fishing      expeditions.''       Supporters of the revised law say action is necessary now      because 16 provisions of the original act are set to expire      Dec. 31. That's true. But there's a way to avoid undue haste      without tying the hands of law enforcement: Adopt a proposal      by Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary      Committee, to extend the law for three months, allowing time      for public debate on a law that could be used as much to harm      individuals as to catch terrorists.       The compromise bill would make all but two of the 16      expiring provisions permanent. The other two are to be      extended for only four years, rather than the 10 years sought      by House Republicans. That's small comfort to those whose      privacy will be at risk in the meantime.       House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, a proponent      of quick action, claims it's needed to aid law enforcement in      detecting terrorists before they strike. But that sense of      urgency extends only so far. Former members of the 9/11      Commission have just scorched Congress and the White House      for failing to protect the country in many ways, including      the misallocation of resources to states or localities based      on political clout instead of risk.       Americans would be no less safe if Congress were to      postpone a final vote and allow time for an open and honest      debate.                                  ____               [From the Kansas City Star, Dec. 12, 2005]                 More Time Needed To Forge Better Bill       Kansas City, MO.--A shaken Congress passed the Patriot Act      with almost no debate in the wake of the 2001 terrorist      attacks.       Since then politicians across the spectrum have joined      librarians, city councils and other groups in raising alarms      about the law's intrusions on the privacy of American      citizens.       With the act set to expire Dec. 31, lawmakers are      scrambling to reach a compromise that would allow most of the      provisions to be renewed permanently. Time is short, but it's      essential for Congress to give Americans a better balance      between national security and civil liberty.       The House and Senate this week will consider a compromise      agreement reached by negotiators. The package makes a good-     faith attempt to address some of the problems. But it      continues to give law enforcement agencies too much leeway to      search people's homes and examine their records without first      obtaining permission from judges.       Provisions in the proposed law instruct judges to presume      federal agents' requests for records are valid, unless the      targeted people can prove the government acted in bad faith.      That places citizens at a serious disadvantage. Judicial      oversight doesn't mean much if the judges merely serve as      rubber stamps for law enforcement agents.       The compromise also does little to curb the burgeoning use      of ``national security letters,'' which the FBI uses to make      sweeping requests for records from libraries, telephone      companies and Internet providers.       Former Attorney General John Ashcroft used to sneer and      scoff at librarians who raised concerns about these requests,      implying they were rare. But The Washington Post has reported      that the FBI issues 30,000 such letters a year.       Senators from both political parties are raising valid      concerns about the proposed new law. Democratic Sen. Patrick      Leahy proposed renewing the existing act for 90 days to give      lawmakers more time to write a better bill.       Leahy's idea has merit. National security and individual      freedoms are too important to be compromised in haste.                                  ____                 [From the Morning Call, Dec. 12, 2005]                          The War on Terrorism       Allentown, PA.--An unusual coalition of conservatives and      liberals, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the      American Civil Liberties Union, merits attention. It's rare      for groups so far apart along the usual political spectrum to      agree on something. But they are united in their concern that      a compromise reached by Senate and House negotiators Thursday      won't sufficiently protect Americans' civil liberties. They      have reason for concern.       Sen. Arlen Specter, the Republican chairman of the Senate      Judiciary Committee, said the compromise legislation is ``not      a perfect bill, but a good bill.'' House and Senate      negotiators came up with a plan to permanently extend 14 of      16 provisions set to expire at the end of the year. Of      particular note: When a law enforcement agent seeks access to      records, by order of a secret court established under the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the agent must provide      a ``statement of fact'' proving it is relevant to an anti-     terrorism investigation.       But the coalition's concerns about fishing expeditions got      a boost last week when a bipartisan group of six senators      issued a statement critical of the compromise: Republican      Sens. Larry E. Craig of Idaho, John E. Sununu of New      Hampshire and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Democratic      Senators Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, Richard J. Durbin      of Illinois and Ken Salazar of Colorado.       The primary concern is that restrictions in the Patriot Act      haven't gone far enough since its passage in the wake of 9/11      to prevent government officials from going on so-called      ``fishing expeditions.'' The Washington Post reported in      October that the FBI used provisions of the act regarding      records-gathering to annually issue more than 30,000      specialized subpoenas, or national security letters, seeking      information from businesses.       The letters don't require the government to demonstrate a      link between the information being sought and a suspected      terrorist. They only attest that the records sought are      relevant to a terror investigation. This provision of the      Patriot Act must be tightened before the anticipated House      and Senate votes this week.       Or, if such an agreement cannot be reached, both chambers      should take the advice of Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont.      The ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who didn't      agree to the compromise, has proposed a three-month extension      of the Patriot Act, past its year-end expiration date.       Sen. Feingold, the only senator to vote against the      original legislation in 2001, has threatened to filibuster      the bill extending Patriot Act provisions because it lacks      sufficient safeguards to protect constitutional freedoms.      Sixty votes would be required to block a vote on final Senate      passage.       A three-month extension is preferable, however, to a bitter      partisan battle on the Senate floor.                                  ____                 [From the Times Union, Dec. 12, 2005]                             True Patriots       Albany, NY.--There's scant comfort in the compromise      reached by House-Senate conferees late last week on renewing      the USA Patriot Act. While it is welcome news that House      negotiators failed in their attempt to have the most      controversial provisions of this law extended for seven      years, rather than four, as the Senate insisted upon, and      which is now part of the compromise, there is no      justification to put basic civil liberties at risk for even      four minutes, let alone four years.       Fortunately, a bipartisan group of six senators is vowing      to filibuster the accord, which is scheduled to be voted upon      this week. They are the true patriots. Their demands are      hardly burdensome. To the contrary, they want any final      legislation to include checks and balances against possible      abuse of power by government agencies acting under the      surveillance powers of the Patriot Act. That means some      monitoring of, say, FBI demands for reading, financial and      other personal information on American citizens. Former Rep.      Bob Barr of Georgia, who now heads a group called Patriots to      Restore Checks and Balances, sums up the issue this way:       ``Lawmakers could have easily fixed these controversial      record search provisions by simply adopting the Senate-passed      amendment to Section 215, requiring the government to show a      connection between records sought and a suspected foreign      terrorist, and by applying a similar requirement to the NSL      (National Security Letters) powers. The decision of some      lawmakers to rush this flawed Patriot Act legislation to a      vote may allow them to leave a little earlier for the      holidays this year, but it will also leave the civil      liberties of their constituents in jeopardy for years to      come.''       Supporters of the compromise argue that it does offer      safeguards against government abuses by requiring some      judicial overview. But a close reading of these oversight      requirements shows that investigators would have no trouble      meeting the loose standards for initiating searches.       No one, least of all Mr. Barr, is suggesting that the      government shouldn't be able to track down suspected      terrorists. But the broad surveillance powers granted under      the Patriot Act open the way for possible abuses, such as      collecting information on law-abiding Americans without      notifying them or allowing them the opportunity to challenge      the searches.       Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who refused to sign the      compromise, suggests a reasonable solution: Rather than rush      the vote, extend the current act for three months and use the      extra time to forge a better bill. ``We owe it to the      American people to get this right,'' Sen. Leahy says. It's a      debt that should not be taken lightly.                                  ____                [From the Sacramento Bee, Dec. 11, 2005]             Patriot Act Renewal: Take Time to Do It Right       Sacramento, CA.--Barring an unlikely successful filibuster,      the USA Patriot Act is likely to be renewed this week, mostly      in the form it was given in 2001.

On Oct. 26, 2001, President Bush signed the Uniting and      Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required      to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act. The      House of Representatives passed this grab bag of police-state      tactics by a 357-66 vote with almost no debate.       Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold was the only senator to      vote no. At the time, Feingold called the Patriot Act a      ``truly breathtaking expansion of police power.''       A fearful Congress was stampeded into approving, almost      sight unseen, one of the broadest assaults on civil liberties      in our nation's history. Despite assorted court challenges,      the expansion of police power continues--an expansion which      has done little to capture the masterminds of the Sept. 11      attacks or to prevent future attacks. But this expansion has      done much to undermine our hard-won Constitutional rights.       What has happened to our legal rights since then? Here's a      refresher:       You've lost your freedom of association. The federal      government can now monitor the doings of religious and      political organizations, even if there's no reason to suspect      that illegal activity is going on.       You've lost your freedom from unreasonable searches. The      federal government may search and seize your papers and      effects without probable cause and without a court warrant.      It can also question librarians and booksellers about your      reading habits, and threaten them with jail if they reveal to      anyone that you're being investigated.       You've lost your right to a speedy and public trial. The      federal government can now jail you indefinitely without you      being charged with a crime and can do so without holding a      trial and without allowing you to confront your accusers.      This is what you can expect if you are deemed to be a      ``terrorist'' or are deemed to be ``assisting a terrorist      group.'' The definition of ``terrorist'' and ``terrorist      group'' is purely up to the government, of course.       You've lost your right to legal representation.      Conversations between attorneys and clients can now be      monitored in federal prisons. That is, if you're fortunate      enough to have an attorney. The federal government now has      the right to deny you legal representation too.       In short, the federal government can arrest virtually      anyone it deems to be a danger to national security, even      without a formal criminal charge, and jail them indefinitely.      It can deny you a lawyer or even a trial, public or secret.      And all of this can happen without your family or friends and      relatives ever knowing what happened.       This is what the so-called war on terrorism has done to our      Constitutional rights. This is why the current debate in      Congress over extending the provisions of the Patriot Act is      important.       To keep the Patriot Act as it is means more secrecy, more      disinformation and more repression. It is quite frankly, un-     American. It is behavior straight out of a totalitarian      state; tactics not worthy of the world's greatest democracy.       The average American thinks he or she is safe. But history      has shown us that when a regime has absolute power, it's only      a matter of time before anyone and everyone is subject to      official intimidation and attack.       Security and ``fighting terrorism'' are not suitable      pretexts for destroying more than two centuries of American      jurisprudence. The rule of law as enshrined in the      Constitution is supposed to still mean something in America.       It's time to demand that Congress and the Bush      administration respect our civil liberties. There shouldn't      be a discussion to modify or extend the Patriot Act.       Instead, Congress should be working to repeal it.
