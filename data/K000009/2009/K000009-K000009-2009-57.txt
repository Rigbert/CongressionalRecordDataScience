Speaker, tonight as General Motors, Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers struggle with the imposed government deadlines that will determine their survival, I wish to share with you Harold Meyerson's article ``Break Up the Banks'' from The Washington Post last Friday.  You see, what has been holding up the deal to save the American auto industry, save America's jobs, and breathe life into communities where wealth is actually created and not just traded away is something not much talked about, and that is the megabanks, centered, yes, on Wall Street, again.  Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase that were huge Treasury bailout recipients, billions and billions and billions of dollars, who turned a profit this year, by the way, are the leading culprits for the rest of the banks in slowing down or impeding the Obama administration's efforts to restructure Chrysler. Currently, Chrysler's bonds found on the books of Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase are trading at 15 cents on the dollar. Despite increasingly better offers than that, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase insist that they and their fellow banks are entitled to more, more of your money. More of our money. That is greed in its purest form. More, more, and more for them and their cronies, and less and less and less for everyone else. They have bilked America on the front end and then on the back end.  First, the front end by restricting the availability of credit to consumers looking to purchase cars and car dealers looking to finance their showrooms. Just squeeze them down out of existence by shutting off their credit. And now at the back end by denying the restructuring of GM and Chrysler's debt. Yes, they keep America's cash but then deny us the ability to access it in the marketplace to buy cars and furnishing dealers' showroom floors. Very clever. It's a tourniquet at both ends.  Wall Street's idea is to bleed Chrysler retirees, Fiat, and the American taxpayers dry. They care for their own interest at the expense of the national interest.  The American automobile industry is just one victim of Wall Street's meltdown. The industry is the lifeblood of so many communities, and they were just on the cusp of a new green engine era, and they have been forced to their knees.  Of course, the banksters bail out their friends, firms like AIG. Beyond mere life support, they were handed over $70 billion. That's putting all the auto bailout together and multiplying it times five. Not only does AIG have special access to policymakers and your tax dollars; they didn't have to take any haircuts.  Compare that to what is being asked of autoworkers: first, give up your job, move out of your community, cut your wages and your health benefits too, and, oh, by the way, we want to go after your retirement benefits, even the widows and retirees out of those firms.  Meanwhile, AIG pensioners, well, they're alive and well. Their health care benefits are not threatened. Their counterparties are kept whole. While hardworking blue collar America is squeezed dry, they're just as happy as clams.  Right now it's Wall Street versus the American people. Surely those that work hard and make things with their hands and end up with all the injuries to prove it, with bodily wear and tear, don't they deserve some regard? Don't they have some rights for three decades in an auto plant? Well, Citigroup, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase, HSBC, Wells Fargo, and the rest of the high fliers up there on Wall Street, they want to deny these folks the right to their hard-earned benefits and wages.  American workers built and continue to build America, while Wall Street destroys not just capital; they destroy industries. They destroy communities. They destroy people's lives. Now, we can see who has that power. But that isn't what America was supposed to beall about. When you work hard and you build something real for the Nation's might, you expect a fair deal. And that was supposed to be the American Dream, for the many, not just the privileged few. Today a real industry, auto production, gets stomped on, chewed up, spit out because Wall Street robbed the kitty. They stole our hard-earned money and continue to beg, borrow, and steal from American citizens. Sales in business after business, including the auto industry, have gone down because the bailout recipients didn't make loans. Credit is frozen. People can't buy cars. The Big Three is suffering. So what does Wall Street do? It gets its friends, its shills, on the op-ed pages and other media to shift the blame.  So who gets the blame for the strangled auto industry? Is it Detroit that's the problem? No, my friends. It's Wall Street that's the problem. And it's time that we put America back on its feet again. And as Mr. Meyerson suggests in his very last sentence, pass the anti-trust laws we need in order to scale down these banks and give America back to the American people.               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 2009]                           Break Up the Banks                          (By Harold Meyerson)                          This week in banking       Our leading financial institutions announced that they had      actually made a profit in the year's first quarter through      the creative manipulation of rules and regulations, lobbied      Congress to preserve their ability to raise credit card      interest rates just for the heck of it and opposed the      administration's plan for restructuring Chrysler, which would      save some jobs and honor pension obligations, in the hope      that they can redeem the company's bonds at a higher level      than they're trading at just now. And, to round out the      picture, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that      lending at the 19 largest TARP recipients was 23 percent      lower in February--by which time these banks had received      hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds intended to      enable them to lend more--than it had been in October, before      the floodgates of tax dollars had been fully opened.       This is what our major banks are up to at a time when it is      our largess that is keeping them afloat.       The week began with a burst of creative accounting.      Citigroup, into which we've sunk more dough than any other      company, with the possible exception of AIG, claimed a profit      for the first quarter of this year because its bonded debt      has lost value, which under the rules of accountancy enabled      it to register a one-time gain equal to that lost value,      because Citi could, in theory, buy back its own bonds for      less. J.P. Morgan Chase, whose fire-sale purchase of Bear      Stearns we taxpayers backed, declared a similar profit      because of a similar decline in the value of its bonds.       As events would have it, the very same Citigroup and J.P.      Morgan Chase are the lead negotiators for the banks that are      objecting to the Obama administration's efforts to      restructure Chrysler. Chrysler's bonds, which these banks      hold, are trading at 15 cents on the dollar, the amount the      government offered to pay the banks in its initial proposal      to restore the company to viability. Yesterday, the      government upped that amount to 22 cents, plus a 5 percent      equity share in the company. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase,      however, insist that they and their fellow banks are entitled      to more, though that ``more'' could only come at the expense      of Fiat (the auto company that is providing the new car lines      and technology without which Chrysler will fold) or the      company's retirees (to whose health-care fund Chrysler is      legally obligated) who built the company, or the taxpayers      who are keeping Chrysler alive.       Instead of playing Scrooge (and a publicly subsidized      Scrooge, at that), what the banks should do is lend Chrysler      their accountants. Maybe they'd show that the company turned      a profit last year.       The banks' lobbyists, meanwhile, have been hard at work,      too. Bills to limit credit card fees and penalties--my      favorite fee is the one banks charge some customers for      making (not missing, making) a payment--are moving through      both houses of Congress, but the Senate version has yet to      receive any support from Republicans. A bill that would      enable bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage terms has also      hit a wall in the Senate, with Republican leaders claiming      the backing of all 41 of their members to filibuster the bill      when it comes to the floor.       President Obama told representatives of the major banks      yesterday that he backs the limits on credit card charges.      The question here is whether the administration and      congressional Democrats will use this issue to go after the      Republicans, whose decision to align themselves with the      banks, particularly on the issue of credit card fees, is      incomprehensibly dumb even by their standards. Socially      liberal bankers may be a financial mainstay of the new-model      Democratic Party, but if the Democratic Senate and House      campaign committees don't run against the Republicans for      backing the moral sewer and economic disaster that is our      modern banking industry, they will be derelict in their      political duties.       And that should just be the beginning. The Democrat in the      White House and the Democrats on the Hill are committed to      legislation that regulates our dysfunctional wards in the      banking industry, but regulations by themselves won't solve      the problem of the banks being too big to fail--and so big      that they dominate campaign finance and, with it, much of the      business of lawmaking. We need to amend our antitrust laws so      we can scale down banks to the point that they no longer      imperil our economic and political systems. As things stand      now, it's we who are serving their needs, not they who are      serving ours. It's time to turn that around.                          ____________________
