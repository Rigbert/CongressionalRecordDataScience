 President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Biden in introducing a bi-partisan resolution designating September 24, 2001 as ``Family Day: A Day to Eat Dinner With Your Children.'' This resolution recognizes the benefits of eating dinner as a family, especially as a way to keep children from using illegal drugs, tobacco, and alcohol.  Many of us here in this Chamber are parents, and some of us are even grand parents. We know the trials and difficulties of raising children. But we also know the rewards, as a father, one of my proudest moments is seeing the success of my children as they raise their own families. What I know, what many parents have come to realize, and what we are trying to emphasize through Family Day, is spending time with your children, having dinner with them regularly, is one of the best ways to develop and maintain a healthy family, and encourage our children to make healthy choices.  Senator Biden spoke about the most recent survey from the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. And those are scary numbers, but also hopeful ones. Kids listen. Teens do recognize what their parents say. They see what their parents do. Communication is the key to all of this, and communication at the dinner table is a wonderful place for this to happen. All of this shows how essential it is for parents to get involved in their children's lives.  The family unit is the backbone of this country. Solutions to our drug problems involve all of us working together. Parents and communities must be engaged and I am committed to help making that happen. Parents need to provide a strong moral context to help our young people know how to make the right choices. They need to know how to say ``no,'' that saying no is okay, that saying no to drugs is the right thing to do--not just the safe or healthier thing, but the right thing.  I am pleased to join with Senator Biden, the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, and the National Restaurant Association in designating September 24, 2001, as ``Family Day: a Day to Eat Dinner With Your Children.'' I urge our colleagues to join us.                          ____________________
