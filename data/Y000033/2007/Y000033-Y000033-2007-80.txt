Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) for bringing this bill forth, and Mr. Oberstar, the chairman of the full committee. This was our bill. We worked on this jointly. Some people say, Why do you need a technical corrections bill?  If you remember, every highway bill we have ever passed has gone through a series of technical correction adjustments because when we write a bill, sometimes it is misinterpreted by highway departments and municipalities. This is purely a technical corrections bill. It adds nothing; it takes nothing away.  Again, we passed a good piece of legislation 2 years ago. It has been implemented, but it will be implemented in a better way with these corrections.  I have talked with the gentleman from Oregon and all he has to say is ``yes'' or ``no.'' Regarding Providence Hospital of Anchorage, we are looking for a solution to a problem. I agree that we shouldn't be paying for something that is already done, but I would like to have those moneys available to improve the transportation to the center hub of health care in the city of Anchorage. It is my understanding that the gentleman has agreed to work with me in conference to try to solve that problem.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
