I thank him for responding to those questions. I have reservations, as he does, about committing ground troops. I certainly believe, as he does, that the Congress should make that decision and not the President unilaterally. He has promised to come to us for that decision to be made. I hope Mr. Milosevic and those who follow this debate don't take any comfort in this. We are speaking only to the question of the authority of Congress, not as to any actual decision of whether we will ever commit to ground troops. I think that is the sense of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I thank him for offering the amendment, and I support this important amendment.
