Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this is truly a great day for the users of our Nation's transportation infrastructure. Today, I bring before you for consideration the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, which will for the future be known as SAFETEA-LU.  Mr. Speaker, the conference report is a result of a great deal of extremely hard work on the part of many people, including the leadership of the House and the Senate, our committee members, and all other committees of jurisdiction and our great staff.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3 provides a funding level of $286.45 billion in guaranteed funding over 6 years for Federal highways and transit programs, as well as highway safety and motor carrier safety programs.  This legislation will strengthen this country's ability to move people, and especially freight. The American people need to know that SAFETEA-LU increases funding for constructing and improving our Nation's highways by 30 percent over TEA-21. This legislation improves transportation products delivery by ensuring better cooperation among State departments of transportation and Federal permitting agencies.  It improves the rate of return and scope for donor States and donee States, has a minimum growth of not less than 19 percent over TEA-21. It improves highway safety with a new program designed to increase safety belt use.  In the area of transit, we have created a new freedom initiative to give more mobility to the disabled and increase the transit funding over TEA-21 by 36 percent. We have dramatically improved the Federal motor carriers commercial driver's license system, and funding is increased for motor carrier safety.  This bill results in safer roads, which are built faster and last longer. Mostsignificantly, H.R. 3 will put Americans to work by creating the kinds of jobs that support families and increase our tax base. This is much-needed legislation that will move our country toward a stronger economy.  Mr. Speaker, before I close, as usual, I want to take a moment to thank all of the Members of the House. I wanted to thank the staffs that worked so hard on this conference report with the other body. I especially want, and unfortunately he is not here and hopefully will get here, my ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), who has been unwavering in his support and working in cooperation with this chairman.  The chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit and Pipelines, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri), who has been a driving force behind much of the policy of this bill, the gentleman has taken his subcommittee around the country to investigate the infrastructure needs of the United States as well as I.  Also the subcommittee ranking member, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), who is with us today, has made an enormous contribution of time and energy to this legislation.  I especially owe much thanks to the gentleman from California (Chairman Thomas) of the Ways and Means Committee for his constant support and for his ability to make law.  I would like to recognize the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) from the Committee on the Budget, who has worked hard with me to accommodate the increase in authorization needs to produce this legislation. I want to thank the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), for helping us find solutions to some of the very difficult problems.  Last but not least, I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), the Speaker of the House, for the countless hours he spent working with us to keep this process moving. Without his support, we would not be here today prepared to pass this outstanding piece of legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank one of the main staffers for the Speaker, Bill Hughes, who has been able to put pieces together when things were falling apart to make sure that we are able to do what we have to do, as well as Jack Victory with the majority leader's office. Without their support this would not happen.  And I personally want to thank the hard-working staff of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure who have been here many nights, sometimes as much as 36 hours in a row and weekends drafting this legislation.  This subcommittee staff who made this happen most of all are Graham Hill, Jim Tyman, Joyce Rose, Derek Miller, Suzanne Newhouse, Bailey Edwards, Will Bland, Debbie Gephart, Patrick Mullane from the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri's) staff.  In addition, my chief of staff, Lloyd Jones, chief counsel Liz Megginson, Chris Kennedy, Charles Zieglar, Mark Zachares, Fraser Verusion, Debbie Callis, Andrew Forbes, Jason Rosa, and Phillip Maxwell.  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar's) staff. This has been a bipartisan effort. They worked equally hard with my staff: Davis David Heymsfeld, chief counsel; Ward McCarragher; as well as Kathy Zern; Art Chan; Ken House; Eric Vanschyndle; Stephanie Manning; Kathie Dedrick of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio's) staff.  Last but not least, I want to express my appreciation for the legislative counsel who over and over had to write this bill. Also, last but not least, my appreciation goes to David Mendelsohn, Curt Haensel, and Rosemary Gallagher.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my wife for putting up with me for the last 3\1/2\ years making this bill. That has been the most difficult thing she has had to do.  Mr. Speaker, it is a good bill. It should be passed. Again, I want to thank this body for bringing this to fruition. It is a good piece of legislation for this Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. At long last no more, well, one extension, only so we can properly celebrate the adoption of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I want to join with the gentleman from Alaska (Chairman Young). I first want to thank the gentleman and other leaders on the Republican side for their extraordinary fairness in this process and recognizing that transportation, transportation efficiency is not a partisan issue; it serves all Americans. It serves all business in blue States, red States, Democratic, Republican, Independent.  We are here today gathered to make an extraordinary investment in the future of our country. I do not think there is anything this Congress could do more definitively to put people back to work, to stimulate our economy, to increase our efficiency, our competitiveness, both nationally and internationally than this legislation.  And the wonderful thing, at this time in our Nation's history, about this legislation is we are not borrowing the money to do it. We are spending taxes paid by all Americans at the gas pump: individuals, passenger car drivers, and commercial drivers and businesses.  And we are going to take that money, and we are going to invest it in ways that benefit this Nation for decades to come. We are going to help mitigate congestion, and congestion is at the top of my list, because the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) should have been here to join in this effort, but he is stuck in traffic. And hopefully by the time we finish spending the money in TEA-LU, the gentleman and other Americans will be able to get to work more readily in the future, in addition to benefiting business and other aspects of our country.  Mr. Speaker, particularly I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) for his mentorship, his leadership on our side, his friendship, his advocacy, his knowledge, his history. I learned a lot during this bill. It was an extraordinary process for me. And he has been wonderful and helpful.  The gentleman also came to my State to recognize that my State has an extraordinary problem that transcends the boundaries of our State, something I started campaigning for a couple of years ago, to recognize that Interstate 5 is the lifeline of the western United States, joining the fifth largest economy in the world, California, to Oregon and Washington, two foreign nations, Mexico and Canada, serving the busiest port in the Nation, and a number of other very busy ports, the third busiest truck route in America.  Oregon has an extraordinary problem on Interstate 5, through an accident of history, having built our interstate before other States. Our bridges are virtually reaching simultaneous failure because we used an old 1950s and pre-1950s technology, where States who built the interstate later, California and others, used a very different technology, and they do not have the bridge problems we have.  My State has raised fees and licenses and bonded a tremendous amount of money to deal with this problem, but we are still short. And this bill will go a long way toward filling that gap and completing Interstate 5 so you will not have trucks detouring up over the Cascade Mountains, down the far side and back onto I-5.  But that is probably one of the many issues this bill will deal with. Other projects of national significance, something pioneered by the chairman of this committee and the House, which the Senate only tagged onto in the end, is going to make tremendous investments in the Alameda Corridor, other critical areas in California that are suffering from huge growth, and congestion all across the Nation.  We will be making very significant investments with major projects there, and then down the Missouri River Bridge all the way to the east coast and some of the problems dealing with freight movement across New York Harbor from New Jersey into New York. This is not everything we needed, but it is a tremendous and meaningful down payment.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again all who joined in this effort. I want to join the chairman in thanking the Republican staff. He has done an able job of that. I would like to name a few folks on our side, and there have been a lot of sleepless nights.  First and foremost, my staff: Kathie Dedrick, who yesterday was her birthday, probably one she will never forget. She got all 24 hours out of it, because she did not sleep. So that is, I guess, one way to approach that.  I want to thank the Highway Subcommittee staff, Ken House, Art Chan, Stephanie Manning, Eric VanSchyndle, Jennifer Esposito, Jackie Schmitz, Homer Carlisle.  I particularly want to thank David Heysfeld, who brings almost as much history and knowledge to these issues as the ranking member and sometimes remembers some details that the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) has forgotten.  Ward McCarragher, Kathie Zern, Jen Walsh, Dara Schlieker, an administrative assistant without whom we never would have got through to people and coordinated things.  I want to thank some folks downtown, actually, at the Federal Highway Administration, Susan Binder, Rosi Crighton, because they spent an incredible amount of time analyzing what it was we were doing, because there are times when you start moving pieces around in this formula, we are not quite sure where it is all headed and who is going to be impacted.  Sometimes at 3 or 4 in the morning, they were doing analysis that was critical to the committee completing this bill in a fair way.  So I want to thank the chairman. I want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri) and his staff. He has just been wonderful to me as chairman. I am proud to serve under him as ranking member.                              {time}  1030  I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) because he and I may disagree over a number of things, but we found common cause here in investing in the future of this country. And he played an absolutely critical role in negotiating with the Senate, which is one of the most confounding processes, I do not know if you can even call it a process, that I have ever dealt with. I do not know that it is that organized.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
