Chairman, I just wanted to take a few seconds to say that if the Chair were to sustain the gentleman's point of order, it would mean that in that act, the Chair sanctions illegal goods coming into the United States with revenue being collected on those goods against the intent of our law. It would also mean that the U.S. Customs Service is breaking the law.  Finally, it would mean that the question for the Member making the point of order is, what illegal goods are coming in and how much revenue is being collected? It is aimed at enforcing current law, which is well-defined in terms of prison labor, child labor, and slave labor. It is merely meant to send a very strong signal to the customs agency that it is time to enforce the laws on the books and the two memoranda of understanding and statements of cooperation with China.
