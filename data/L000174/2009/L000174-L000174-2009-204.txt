President, I wish to congratulate St. Albans VT, native John LeClair for being chosen as a 2009 inductee into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.  John LeClair had a remarkable amateur and professional hockey career. The first American-born player to record three consecutive 50-goal seasons in the National Hockey League, LeClair played 16 years in the NHL--with stops in Montreal, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh--and he helped the Montreal Canadiens capture the Stanley Cup in 1993. He registered 406 goals and 413 assists for 819 points in 967 career games, which ranks him 13th on the NHL's alltime points list among American-born players. LeClair also was a 2-time Olympian, where he netted 34 career points, 22-12, 31 games in a Team USA uniform.  Most hockey fans remember LeClair for his dramatic two game-winning goals in overtime during the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, for being a member of the dreaded ``Legion of Doom'' line with the Philadelphia Flyers, and for leading Team USA to a Silver Medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics.  Vermonters. though, go further back with their native son. After his high school graduation from Bellows Free Academy in St. Albans, the Montreal Canadiens drafted LeClair with the 33rd pick in the 1987 entry draft. Instead of immediately going to the NHL, LeClair chose to attend the University of Vermont, where he thrilled Catamount fans for four, exciting seasons. Less than a week after playing his final collegiate game, LeClair signed with Montreal and hit the ice with the Canadiens right away.  While LeClair quickly went on to stardom and fame in the NHL, he always enjoyed a loyal following back home. Many Vermonters are naturally Canadiens fans because Montreal is so close to Vermont, but it was amazing to see how many people converted to Flyer fans when LeClair moved to Philadelphia and Penguin fans when he moved to Pittsburgh. I remember that no matter whether it was hockey season or not, it seemed like you couldn't walk down the street in St. Albans or Burlington or Rutland without seeing someone wearing some sort of Flyers paraphernalia, which stood out because of the team's distinguishing orange and black colors.  Once again, I congratulate John LeClair on this high honor of being selected as a member of the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame. I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of a July 29 article from the Burlington Free Press printed in the Record.  The material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 29, 2009] LeClair to Enter U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame--St. Albans Native is Among                               Class of '09       Colorado Springs, Colo.--Former University of Vermont and      NHL star John LeClair of St. Albans, Vt., will be inducted      into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.       USA hockey's 2009 class was announced Tuesday, and it also      includes former NHL players Tony Amonte and Tom Barrasso, the      1998 U.S. Olympic women's team and the late Frank Zamboni,      inventor of the storied ice resurfacing machine.       The date of the induction ceremony will be announced in      August.       During an NHL career that included five seasons with the      Montreal Canadians, 10 with the Philadelphia Flyers and two      as a Pittsburgh Penguin, LeClair registered 406 goals and 413      assists for 819 points in 967 career games.       The winger helped Montreal win the Stanley Cup in 1993, was      the first American-born player with three straight 50-goal      seasons from 1995 to 1998, and was on USA's silver-medal team      at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.       LeClair is also a member of UVM's Hall of Fame. He netted      56 goals and 60 assists in four years as a Catamount.       Amonte scored the winning goal against Canada in the      deciding game of the first World Cup of Hockey in 1996.       Barrasso won two Stanley Cups as a goalie for the      Pittsburgh Penguins.       The 1998 U.S. Olympic Women's team won the gold medal at      the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.                          ____________________
