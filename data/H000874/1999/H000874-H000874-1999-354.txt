Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the St. Mary's County Chamber of Commerce on their twenty-fifth anniversary.  Their initial meeting was held in April, 1974 by combining the Leonardtown and Lexington Park Chambers. A board of directors was installed and George Sparling was elected president. Eddie Bailey, Rubye Beaman, Eddie Burroughs, Robert Dudley, Bert Fenwick, Jack Fletcher, Joe M. Gough, Stewart Hobbs, Jim Kenney, Richard Lubbers, Charles Mason, Bill Raley, Buzzy Ridgell, Mary Salisbury, Les Shaw, Harry Lee Smith,Leroy Thompson, Jr., Elliot Weisman, and Rocky Willis served as the board of directors.  The chamber had 150 charter members. Office space was two rooms on the second floor of the First National Bank of St. Mary's in Leonardtown, courtesy of Joe M. Gough. They occupied those offices until 1988 when the chamber moved to Mechanicsville. Not only has the chamber grown in membership with 400 members today, but also in service to the community, with members serving on a number of county and state boards and local committees.  Over the years, the chamber has supported county events such as the Oyster Festival and Maryland Day. The Trade Fair was started in 1983 to give local businesses the chance to show their wares and to promote county businesses. As a result of a good working relationship with county government, state government and the Southern Maryland Congressional delegation, major accomplishments of direct and indirect services to the business community have been achieved. The chamber lobbied for five years to have the commercial inventory tax reduced, which affected 80% of the county's wholesale and retail businesses.  In 1976, the chamber operated the tourist information center at Charlotte Hall. In 1980, the Tourist Information Center found its permanent home at the chamber office in Mechanicsville. Over the years the chamber has evolved into a vital entity of St. Mary's County. Despite its growth, one thing has not changed; the original core values to promote local business and empower local citizens.  Mr Speaker, I ask you and the remainder of my colleagues to join with me in applauding the service and sacrifice of the St. Mary's County Chamber of Commerce.                          ____________________
