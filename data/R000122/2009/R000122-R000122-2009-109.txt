This is not the first time he has ushered a bill on this topic from committee to the Senate floor. I am confident that my colleagues, in recognition of the tremendous, hazardous effects that tobacco has on children, adolescents, adults, and seniors, will join me in fulfilling one of chairman Kennedy's wishes, and mine, of finally seeing this bill signed into law.  I would also like to thank Senator Dodd for his dedication in carrying out the aggressive schedule of the HELP Committee set forth by the chairman so we can bring this legislation to the floor.  As a cosponsor of this legislation, I firmly believe that we cannot afford to wait another day for it to be enacted. This is not the first time that I have risen to speak on the importance of regulating the sale of tobacco products, but I am hopeful that with this legislation we will take a giant leap toward eradicating the use of nicotine, by discouraging our youth from ever lighting-up, and chip away at skyrocketing smoking-related healthcare costs.  Every year that passes, and this legislation is not enacted, another 4,700 children in Rhode Island try a cigarette for the first time--that amounts to 1,400 children in my State alone becoming regular, daily smokers each year.
