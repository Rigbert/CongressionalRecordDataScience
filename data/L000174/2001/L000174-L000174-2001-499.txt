President, I am pleased that we finally adopted the amendments in the managers' package to improve this bill. I thank the efforts of Senators Hatch, Daschle, Grassley, and Reid.  For the information of my colleagues, we adopted the following amendments to improve this bill.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Baucus to resolve an ambiguity regarding involuntary bankruptcies.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Boxer to provide that public education expenses are treated equally with private education expenses in the bill's means-test.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Feinstein regarding bankruptcy petition preparers.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Jack Reed calling for a General Accounting Office review of the bill's reaffirmation provisions.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Feingold to make Federal Election Commission fines and judges non-dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding.  We adopted another amendment by Senator Feingold to clarify that the Federal Election Commission has jurisdiction over insolvent Political Action Committees.  We adopted an amendment that I offered to clarify the definition of current monthly income in the bill's means-test to prevent unnecessary litigation.  We adopted another Leahy amendment to allow a person who has successfully completed a chapter 13 plan and paid off all her creditors to file another chapter 13 plan if some unforeseen economic disaster--such as a job loss or high medical expenses--hits that person within two years of the first chapter 13 completion.  We adopted a third Leahy amendment to modify the requirements for debtors to file tax returns to only Federal returns or transcripts to streamline the process and reduce unnecessary court storage costs.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Schumer and Senator Grassley on corporate business reorganizations to prevent a single creditor from alleging fraud to delay the reorganization and to clarify that debts from violations of the False Claims Act are non-dischargeable in bankruptcy.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Wellstone to clarify that the companies in bankruptcy must fulfil their legal obligations as sponsors and administrators of health care and other benefit plans.  We adopted an amendment by Senators Reid and Ensign to authorize a bankruptcy judgeship for Nevada the fastest growing state in the nation.  We also adopted, at the request of Senators Biden and Carper, an authorization for an additional bankruptcy judgeship for the District of Delaware, which has the heaviest caseload of bankruptcy cases in the country.  We accepted a colloquy between Senator Levin and Senator Grassley to ensure that spikes in gasoline prices will be taken into account in the bill's means-test.  We adopted an amendment by Senators Kohl and Kennedy to require that back pay awards are given the same priority as regular wages in bankruptcy proceedings.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Gramm, which Senator Sarbanes has cleared as the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, making corrections to the bill's financial contract provisions.  We adopted an amendment by Senators Bond and Kerry to improve the bill's small business provisions.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Kennedy to include health insurance costs in the bill's means-test.  We adopted an amendment by Senator Collins and Senator Kerry on family fisherman protection in bankruptcy.  We adopted an amendment by Senators Sessions, Leahy, Specter, and Biden regarding appeals of bankruptcy cases.  I am glad we made these important bipartisan changes to improve this bill and add more balance and fairness to it.                 Amendment No. 59, As Further Modified
