But I rise this morning with my friend and colleague, Senator Gordon Smith, to speak not of division but of bipartisanship and of the hopes we share for our home State of Oregon and for our country.  This morning marks the fifth time Senator Smith and I have unveiled what we call our bipartisan agenda for our home State. It has been our privilege and our pleasure at the beginning of each Congress to travel together around Oregon to listen to our fellow Oregonians and to find common ground on issues that matter to our citizens around their dining room tables and in their kitchens.  We suspect that what we hear in our joint townhall meetings is what other Members of the Senate hear as well. Oregonians, and all Americans, now struggle with health care--families and farmers and business owners and health care providers. Oregonians and all Americans are struggling to make ends meet in this economy, and this means workers and employers. Oregonians and all Americans want opportunities--educational opportunities, job opportunities, opportunities so their children have better lives.  Oregon has two U.S. Senators--a Democrat and a Republican--but we realize that for the most part, our citizens are not interested first in Republican solutions or Democratic solutions; they want solutions that work for Oregon and for our country.
