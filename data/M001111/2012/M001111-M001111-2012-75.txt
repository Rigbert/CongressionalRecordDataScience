 President, I wish to congratulate Northwest Kidney Centers on its 50th anniversary and to commemorate the organization's service and dedication to kidney patients in my home State of Washington.  In 1960, Dr. Belding Scribner, a University of Washington researcher, created the Teflon shunt, a medical device that allowed patients suffering from kidney disease access to ongoing dialysis treatments. This invention paved the way for the creation of the Northwest Kidney Centers, the first out-of-hospital dialysis organization in the world.  Since opening its doors on January 8, 1962, the Northwest Kidney Centers has grown into a national leader in the field of patient care, education, research, and prevention. It is now the largest community-based, nonprofit dialysis provider in the country--providing approximately 25 percent of Washington State's dialysis patients in 14 centers and 12 local hospitals in King and Clallam Counties. Last year Northwest Kidney Centers served nearly 1,500 patients and trained and supervised 200 patients in self-treatment athome. All together, the organization provided 226,000 dialysis treatments in our home State.  The organization regularly outperforms the Nation in clinical quality, with higher survival rates, more kidney transplants, and lower hospitalization rates. Moreover, Northwest Kidney Centers founded and still operates the Nation's first nonhospital retail pharmacy specializing in medications for kidney patients. The organization also manages unique special care units for very frail patients, thus avoiding hospitalizations and reducing costs.  Northwest Kidney Centers is a shining example of what it means to be a community-based organization. Each year Northwest Kidney Centers invests millions of dollars in the community with a variety of programs: charity care and uncompensated dialysis; training of kidney physicians; and services for predialysis patients and transplant recipients.  Finally, as we celebrate this historic 50-year milestone, I would like to recognize the entire Northwest Kidney Centers community--patients, staff, donors, supporters, and volunteers--for their dedication and commitment to improving the lives of kidney patients in our State. I salute them for their remarkable achievements and successes and look forward to the next 50 years of outstanding service and patient care.                          ____________________
