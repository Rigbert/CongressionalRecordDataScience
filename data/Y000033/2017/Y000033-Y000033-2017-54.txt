Madam Speaker, under the decorum of the House, I won't call it bull. I will just say it is a lot of misinformation and outright story tales, the information conveyed to these gentlemen and the ladies from The Humane Society. That is what it is.  There is no sport hunter who is going to be shooting cubs and sows. In fact, there is no one in the State who does not support my resolution of organized hunters, viewers. I have not had any of that.  Yes, you got some letters. And I believe the best way to judge is, if they don't like what I am doing, don't elect me. I am speaking for the people from my State, not Virginia, not a used car salesman. I am speaking for my people.  The second false claim is it allows aerial shooting and gunning of bears. That is not what this is about. It is about the law, and we will win it in court. But I don't want to win it in court. I want to establish the fact that an agency does not have the right to break the law.  As far as Dan Ashe goes, well, did he have any specialists? No. He did this because of interest groups, governing by interest groups, not the hunters, not the Alaskans, not the gunmen of Alaska, but The Humane Society that put out all of this propaganda.  Denning of wolves--and, by the way, I have to remind people. We used to den wolves. I have done it myself. I got paid 50 bucks for every wolf I got. You know who paid me? Uncle Sam did when we were a territory. And when we became a State, we did not allow that.  So let us do our job as a State, instead of having this Congress try to stop it with an agency.  So I am asking my colleagues to vote for the law, as you should uphold as you took your oath for this office, the law.  And if you continue this misinformation, I feel sorry for you, and I feel sorry for the interest groups.  So, Madam Speaker, I do urge a ``yes'' vote on this resolution. =========================== NOTE ===========================     February 16, 2017, on page H1267, the following appeared: So, Madam Chairman, I do urge a    The online version has been corrected to read: So, Madam Speaker, I do urge a ========================= END NOTE =========================
