 Madam Speaker, H.R. 3926, introduced by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Weller), amends the Illinois and Michigan National Heritage Corridor Act of 1984 to increase the amount authorized to be appropriated to the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor Commission from $250,000 to $1 million.  The Illinois and Michigan Canal Heritage Corridor was established in 1984 to protect the resources associated with the canal. The canal was built in the mid-1800s and rapidly transformed Chicago into a critical Mid-Western transportation and business center. The Heritage Corridor currently contains many significant historical and cultural resources along with a much-used recreational trail.  The commission has been instrumental in making the Heritage Corridor a success. This bill would authorize appropriations to match the levels currently enjoyed by other Heritage Corridors and areas. This is a small but important bill.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3926.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
