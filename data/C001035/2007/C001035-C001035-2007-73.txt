President, I shall be very brief, not only because the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia has done a superb job of describing the initiative we have brought before the Senate but also because I have a commitment to testify very shortly before another committee on yet another important issue. But I do wish to comment briefly on one of the provisions that is included in Senator Warner's proposal, a provision I consulted with many of our colleagues on and brought forth to the senior Senator from Virginia and suggested be included. He agreed and has placed it within his amendment.  This provision conditions the release of reconstruction funds to progress on the benchmarks that are included in the Warner-Collins amendment.
