 Most everybody in this body supports the LIHEAP program. I have had an opportunity to vote for that even in recent days. But we have to make sure we do it in the right way. I have even tried to get oil companies to contribute to the low-income fuel fund. But here we have the Senator resurrecting the old nonworkable windfall profits tax. As Senator Domenici said in previous debate, this is one way of raising the price of gasoline and other fuels.  I ask you to oppose this amendment, and I would raise the point that the amendment is not germane.
