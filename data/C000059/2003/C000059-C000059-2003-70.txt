Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to several organizations whose patriotism, dedication and contributions to the troops deploying out of March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California are exceptional. As our troops have been preparing to deploy to the Middle East many local organizations have taken it upon themselves to provide an outpouring of support and assistance. The local organizations involved have been the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, Moreno Valley Chamber of Commerce, American Red Cross, Salvation Army and Community Foundation, March Canteen and Harvest Christian Fellowship.  March Air Reserve Base has a long history of honorable service to our country and once again it will hold a place in U.S. military history. The substantial airlift of 6,500 tons of cargo and the movement of 26,400 Marines headed for overseas has been helped by public donations of food and $30,000. The volunteers have handed out fruit, potato chips, cookies and paperback books to each Marine passing through the Marine deployment terminal. The Marines were also given personal items in order to provide a measure of comfort during their stay in the Middle East.  The groups and individuals involved in the volunteer effort expressed nothing but appreciation and admiration for the men and womenwho have answered their call to duty. Their organization, determination, and work on behalf of our military are an example for every citizen of the United States of America. Their own call to the duty of volunteerism represents compassion and caring through organization. As our soldiers carry out their mission in Iraq, those last acts of generosity, kindness, support and love will be remembered as our troop's face what may be the most difficult time in their lives.  The Veterans of Foreign Wars, Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, Moreno Valley Chamber of Commerce, American Red Cross, Salvation Army and Community Foundation, March Canteen, Harvest Christian Fellowship and others have shown their patriotism and I am proud of the work they have done for our troops. I am honored to have such dedicated community organizations in my congressional district as well as a military base that contributes to the national security of our country and the liberation of the Iraqi people.                          ____________________
