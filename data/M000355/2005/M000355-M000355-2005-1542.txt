 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, the Senate adjourn until 10 a.m. on Monday, March 14. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate begin consideration of the budget resolution, as under the order.
