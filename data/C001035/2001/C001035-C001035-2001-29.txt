President, I rise today to bring to the attention of our distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee an issue that we must consider as potential military action is taken to address our national crisis. There are many aspects to consider in taking care of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who are sent into harm's way. However, there is an immediate and critical area that may not seem like a high priority in these times of deployment and mobilization of our armed forces, an area that in times of war becomes absolutely necessary in preserving their well-being. I am speaking of medical technology and research as it concerns the battlefield.  I have recently been made aware of two efforts that could dramatically improve the current medical challenges involved in blood and tissue preservation. These programs would aim to develop stable blood products, organs, and wound-repairing tissues that could enhance human survivability under conditions of trauma, shock, anoxia and other extreme conditions that are common in combat.
