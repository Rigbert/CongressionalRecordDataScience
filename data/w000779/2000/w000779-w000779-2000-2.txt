I thank him for the extraordinary bipartisan approach he has taken throughout this session.  I think 18 months ago, when the session began and we were tackling the county payments question, particularly rural schools and roads, nobody thought we could put together a bipartisan coalition. Two sides were completely dug in. One side said we should totally divorce these payments from any connection to the land; others went the other way and said let's try to incentivize a higher cut. I believe the Senator from Idaho, in giving me the opportunity that he has as the ranking Democrat on the forestry subcommittee, has shown that we can take a fresh approach on these natural resources issues--in particular, timber.  I appreciate my colleague yielding me the time. I am looking forward to working with him again next session because it was an exhilarating moment to have the first major natural resources bill in decades come to the floor of the Senate, as our legislation did.  I thank my colleague for letting me intrude on his time. I have had a chance to be part of a historic effort with my friend from Idaho, and it has been a special part of my public service. I thank him for that.
