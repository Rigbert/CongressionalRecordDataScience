 Lugar, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hagel, Mr.         Domenici, and Mr. Feingold):  S. 871. A bill to provide for global pathogen surveillance and response, to the Committee on Foreign Relations.  Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce today the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance Act''.  Last year, this bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on August 1st, but died when the House of Representatives failed to take timely action.  The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act authorizes $150 million over the next two years to help developing nations improve global disease surveillance.  That will go a long way to prevent and contain both biological weapons attacks, if, God forbid, it happens, and naturally occurring infectious disease outbreaks around the world.  I'm happy to announce that Senators Lugar, Kennedy, Hagel, Domenici, and Feingold are joining me in co-sponsoring this bill.  The mysterious global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, is an unfortunate reminder of why this bill is so important. We've heard a lot about it. We don't know much about it yet.  We know it's a contagious respiratory illness which apparently originated in the Guangdong province of China last November, has stricken more than 2600 individuals in 17 countries, taking the lives of at least 100 individuals.  The World Health Organization is concerned. They've issued a rare global health alert and discouraged travel to certain nations as authorities struggle to determine the cause of this flu-like illness and what viral or infectious agent is involved.  The WHO has not ruled out bioterrorism as a potential cause for the epidemic, although it is unlikely that a disease with only a 4 to 5 percent mortality would be used.  What's so scary about this outbreak is that doctors and nurses taking care of sick patients have fallen ill themselves; initial tests have not revealed evidence of infection with any previously known virus or bacterial agent; and patients are not being cured by standard treatments, although the vast majority do recover.  How would better disease surveillance have helped in dealing with this kind of crisis?  Experts suspect this epidemic first originated in the Guangdong province in southern China in November, but peaked in early February.  A comprehensive surveillance network might have picked up the unique symptoms of this epidemic earlier . . . might have led to quicker diagnosis and better containment measures.  We would have had a better chance to keep this epidemic contained within China, before the pathogen spread to neighboring nations, and now to Canada and the United States.  Over the last eighteen months, Americans have become all too familiar with the threat of bioterrorism and the army of deadly agents capable of spreading death and disease--anthrax, Ebola, and smallpox are only the most sensational examples.  We've had to strengthen our homeland defenses--not just against terrorists armed with bombs and explosives--but against shadowy figures carrying vials of deadly pathogens.  But all in all, this country is making important advances on the domestic front in bioterrorism defense.  Last year, the President signed into law the Bioterrorism Prevention Act of 2002, a comprehensive domestic initiative co-sponsored by Senators Kennedy and Frist.  In January, the Centers for Disease Control announced an initiative to establish electronic surveillance systems in eight American cities as the cornerstone of an eventual national network.  In Delaware, we're developing the very first, comprehensive, state-wide electronic reporting system for infectious diseases.  It'll serve as a prototype for other states by enabling much earlier detection of infectious disease outbreaks.  But a domestic defense against biological weapons isn't sufficient alone.  Biological weapons are a global threat with no respect for borders. A dangerous pathogen released on another continent can quickly spread to the United States in a matter of days, if not hours.  A terrorist group could launch a biological weapons attacks in Mexico in the expectation that the epidemic would quickly spread to the United States.  A rogue state might experiment with new disease strains in another country, intending later to release them here.  And international trade, travel, and migration patterns offer unlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across national borders and to move from one continent to another.  We should make no mistake: in today's world, all infectious disease epidemics, wherever they occur and whether they are deliberately engineered or are naturally occurring, are a potential threat to all nations, including the United States. Such a threat need not begin in the United States to reach our shores.  For that reason, our response cannot be limited to the United States alone.  Global disease surveillance, a systematic approach to tracking disease outbreaks as they occur and evolve around the world, is essential to any real international response.  Why is disease surveillance so important? A biological weapons attack succeeds partly through the element of surprise.  As Dr. Alan P. Zelicoff of the Sandia National Laboratory testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last spring, early warning of a biological weapons attack can prevent illness and death in all but a small fraction of those infected.  A cluster of flu-like symptoms in a city or region may be dismissed by doctors as just the flu when in fact it may be anthrax, plague, or another biological weapon.  But armed with the knowledge that a suspicious epidemic has emerged, doctors and nurses can examine their patients in a different light and, in many cases, effectively treat them.  Disease surveillance is a fancy phrase for a comprehensive reporting system to quickly identify and communicate abnormal patterns of symptoms and illnesses that can quickly alert doctors across a region that a suspicious disease outbreak has occurred.  Epidemiological specialists can then investigate and combat the outbreak.  And if it's a new disease or strain, we can begin to develop treatments that much earlier.  An effective disease surveillance system helps even in the absence of biological weapons attacks. Bubonic plague is bubonic plague, whether it is deliberately engineered or naturally occurring.  Just as disease surveillance can help contain a biological weapons attack, it can also help contain a naturally occurring outbreak of infectious disease.  According to the World Health Organization, thirty new infectious diseases have emerged over the past thirty years; between 1996 and 2001 alone, more than 800 infectious disease outbreaks occurred around the world, on every continent.  The SARS epidemic is only the most recent such outbreak. With better surveillance, we can do a better job of mitigating the consequences of these disease outbreaks.  A good surveillance system requires trained epidemiological personnel, adequate laboratory tools for quick diagnosis, and working communications equipment to circulate information.  Even here, in the most advanced Nation in the world, many States and cities rely on old-fashioned pencil and paper methods of tracking disease patterns.  Thankfully, the comprehensive bioterrorism legislation enacted into law last year is beginning to correct that.  Now, it is vitally important that we extend these initiatives into the international arena.  In 2000, the World Health Organization established the first truly global disease surveillance system, the Global Alert and Response Network, to monitor and track infectious disease outbreaks everywhere.  The WHO has done an impressive job so far with this initiative, working on a shoestring budget. But this global network is only as good as its components--individual nations.  Unfortunately, developing nations--those nations most likely to experience rapid disease outbreaks--simply don't have the trained personnel, the laboratory equipment, or the public health infrastructure to do the job. . . to track evolving disease patterns or detect emerging pathogens.  According to a January 2000 report by the National Intelligence Council, developing nations in Africa and Asia have established only rudimentary systems, if any at all, for disease surveillance, response, and prevention.  The World Health Organization reports that more than 60 percent of laboratory equipment in developing countries is either outdated or non-functioning.  This lack of preparedness can lead to tragic results. In August 1994 in Surat, a city in western India, a surge of complaints about flea infestation and a growing rat population was followed by a cluster of reports about patients exhibiting the symptoms of pneumonic plague.  But authorities were unable to connect the dots and warn people until the plague had spread to seven states across India, ultimately killing 56 people and costing the Indian economy $600 million.  Had the Indian authorities possessed better surveillance tools, they may well have contained the epidemic, limited the loss of life, and avoided the panic that led to economically disastrous embargoes on trade and travel.  Thanks to improved surveillance, an outbreak of pneumonic plague in India last year was detected more quickly and contained with only few deaths--with no costly panic.  In short, developing nations are the weak links in any comprehensive global disease surveillance network.  Unless we take action to shore up their capabilities to detect and contain disease outbreaks, we leave the entire world vulnerable to a deliberate biological weapons attack or a virulent natural epidemic.  It's for these reasons that I'm reintroducing the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act. This bill will authorize $150 million in FY 2004 and FY 2005 to strengthen the disease surveillance capabilities of developing nations.  First, the bill seeks to ensure in developing nations a greater number of personnel trained in basic epidemiological techniques.  It offers enhances in-country training for medical and laboratory personnel and the opportunity for select personnel to come to the United States to receive training in our Centers for Disease Control laboratories and Master of Public Health programs in American universities.  Second, it provides assistance to developing nations to acquire basic laboratory equipment, including items as basic as microscopes, so they can quickly diagnose pathogens.  Third, it enables developing nations to obtain communications equipment to quickly transmit data on disease patterns and pathogen diagnoses, both inside a nation and to regional organizations and the WHO.  Again, we're not talking about fancy high-tech equipment, but basics like fax machines and internet-equipped computers.  Finally--to create a real incentive for nations to promptly report suspicious disease outbreaks and offer international health authorities prompt access--the bill gives preference to those countries that agree to let international health experts investigate any suspicious disease outbreaks.  If passed, the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act will go a long way in ensuring that developing nations acquire the basic disease surveillance capabilities to link up effectively with the WHO's global network.  It's an inexpensive and common sense solution to a problem of global proportions--the dual threat of biological weapons and naturally occurring infectious diseases.  Make no mistake--this bill will contribute to our homeland security. The funding authorized is only a tiny fraction of what we will spend domestically on bioterrorism defenses, but this investment will pay enormous dividends in terms of our national security.  In a report released only last month on global infectious disease, the National Academies' Institute of Medicine said, ``The United States shouldtake a leadership role in promoting the implementation of a comprehensive system of surveillance for global infectious diseases that builds on the current global capacity of infectious disease monitoring.'' By introducing this bill, I hope that our nation can begin to assume that mantle of leadership in this critical area.  Let me close with an excerpt of testimony from a Foreign Relations Committee hearing held on September 5, 2001. Dr. D.A. Henderson, the man who spearheaded the successful international campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970's, most recently served as the principal advisor to Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson in organizing the nation's defenses against bioterrorism.  Dr. Henderson, who at the time of the hearing was a private citizen, was very clear on the value of global disease surveillance: ``In cooperation with the WHO and other countries, we need to strengthen greatly our intelligence gathering capability.  A focus on international surveillance and on scientist-to-scientist communication will be necessary if we are to have an early warning about the possible development and production of biological weapons by rogue nations or groups.''  Dr. Henderson is exactly right. We cannot leave the rest of the world to fend for itself in combating biological weapons and infectious diseases if we are to ensure America's security.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance Act'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 871       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance      Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to      the United States. The insidious nature of the threat, the      likely delayed recognition in the event of an attack, and the      underpreparedness of the domestic public health      infrastructure may produce catastrophic consequences      following a biological weapons attack upon the United States.       (2) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon      and developed, tested, produced, or released in another      country can quickly spread to the United States. Given the      realities of international travel, trade, and migration      patterns, a dangerous pathogen released anywhere in the world      can spread to United States territory in a matter of days,      before any effective quarantine or isolation measures can be      implemented.       (3) To effectively combat bioterrorism and ensure that the      United States is fully prepared to prevent, diagnose, and      contain a biological weapons attack, measures to strengthen      the domestic public health infrastructure and improve      domestic surveillance and monitoring, while absolutely      essential, are not sufficient.       (4) The United States should enhance cooperation with the      World Health Organization, regional health organizations, and      individual countries, including data sharing with appropriate      United States departments and agencies, to help detect and      quickly contain infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorism      agents before they can spread.       (5) The World Health Organization (WHO) has done an      impressive job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks      around the world, including the recent emergence of the      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic,      particularly with the establishment in April 2000 of the      Global Outbreak Alert and Response network.       (6) The capabilities of the World Health Organization are      inherently limited by the quality of the data and information      it receives from member countries, the narrow range of      diseases (plague, cholera, and yellow fever) upon which its      disease surveillance and monitoring is based, and the      consensus process it uses to add new diseases to the list.      Developing countries in particular often cannot devote the      necessary resources to build and maintain public health      infrastructures.       (7) In particular, developing countries could benefit      from--       (A) better trained public health professionals and      epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of      pathogens;       (C) disease reporting is based on symptoms and signs (known      as ``syndrome surveillance''), enabling the earliest possible      opportunity to conduct an effective response;       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in syndrome      surveillance capabilities and real-time information      dissemination to public health officials; and       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information      technology to efficiently transmit information and data      within national and regional health networks, including      inexpensive, Internet-based Geographic Information Systems      (GIS) and relevant telephone-based systems for early      recognition and diagnosis of diseases.       (8) An effective international capability to monitor and      quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks will offer      dividends not only in the event of biological weapons      development, testing, production, and attack, but also in the      more likely cases of naturally occurring infectious disease      outbreaks that could threaten the United States. Furthermore,      a robust surveillance system will serve to deter terrorist      use of biological weapons, as early detection will help      mitigate the intended effects of such malevolent uses.       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To enhance the capability and cooperation of the      international community, including the World Health      Organization and individual countries, through enhanced      pathogen surveillance and appropriate data sharing, to      detect, identify, and contain infectious disease outbreaks,      whether the cause of those outbreaks is intentional human      action or natural in origin.       (2) To enhance the training of public health professionals      and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in      advanced Internet-based and other electronic syndrome      surveillance systems, in addition to traditional epidemiology      methods, so that they may better detect, diagnose, and      contain infectious disease outbreaks, especially those due to      pathogens most likely to be used in a biological weapons      attack.       (3) To provide assistance to developing countries to      purchase appropriate public health laboratory equipment      necessary for infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis.       (4) To provide assistance to developing countries to      purchase appropriate communications equipment and information      technology, including, as appropriate, relevant computer      equipment, Internet connectivity mechanisms, and telephone-     based applications to effectively gather, analyze, and      transmit public health information for infectious disease      surveillance and diagnosis.       (5) To make available greater numbers of United States      Government public health professionals to international      health organizations, regional health networks, and United      States diplomatic missions where appropriate.       (6) To establish ``lab-to-lab'' cooperative relationships      between United States public health laboratories and      established foreign counterparts.       (7) To expand the training and outreach activities of      overseas United States laboratories, including Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Defense      entities, to enhance the disease surveillance capabilities of      developing countries.       (8) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing      regional health networks and, where appropriate, seed money      for new regional networks.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
