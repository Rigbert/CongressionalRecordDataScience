President, I rise to speak about the issue of interchange fee reform. Last year, Congress enacted landmark reform of the swipe fees that Visa and MasterCard impose on the debit card system. An amendment I offered to Wall Street reform passed the Senate with 64 votes--47 Democrats, 17 Republicans--and was later signed into law. It was the first amendment out of the first 26 on that bill that was held to a 60-vote standard. Every other amendment before was held to a simple majority. But I was lucky enough, when I offered the amendment, that there was an insistence that we had to reach 60 votes. We did it, 47 Democrats and 17 Republicans. It was a great victory, and one that came as a surprise to Wall Street, because Main Street--the retail merchants, the restaurants, the convenience stores, and many others--had worked hard for this amendment.  Never before had Visa and MasterCard, the duopoly of credit cards, and their big bank allies lost a vote such as this in Congress. Normally, the credit card companies and the big banks are used to getting their way in this town. Visa and MasterCard have such power that they control over 75 percent of all credit and debit card transactions in America. Last year, $1.39 trillion was transacted on Visa and MasterCard debit cards. According to the American Bankers Association, the U.S. banking industry is a $13 trillion industry. That is trillion with a ``t.''  Many Members in this body are being lobbied right now by banks and card companies to repeal this law, to undo the interchange reform Congress passed last year. It is one of the most active lobbying efforts I have ever seen.  I want to explain why interchange reform is so important, not just for the concepts of competition and transparency but also for the people and businesses affected, for small businesses and consumers and the American economy.  A little background on the debit card industry: Debit cards are simply a way for accountholders to access funds stored in an account. They are the electronic version of a check.  Debit cards are issued by banks, such as Bank of America, where the account is held. The cards are also part of a card network such as Visa or MasterCard, which set certain fees and rules about using their cards.  The banks that issue the debit cards can make money in several ways. They make loans based on deposits and earn interest. They charge fees to consumers for maintaining and accessing accounts such as ATM, monthly, overdraft, and transfer fees. They also receive interchange fees from merchants every time one of their debit cards is used.  If you look at any bank's Web site, you can find the loan interest rates and the account fees the bank charges customers. Banks compete with one another for this consumer business. That competition keeps their fees in check. It is called the free market. But ask any bank to show you on their Web site where you can find the interchange fees that the bank charges merchants, restaurants, universities, charities, convenience stores, ask them what they charge as an interchange fee for the use of their debit cards, the bank will say: Well, you will have to call Visa or MasterCard.  Card companies such as Visa fix the interchange fee rates received by issuing banks, the banks that have their name on the card next to the Visa symbol. In other words, thousands of banks that compete with one another in all other aspects of business do not compete with one another when it comes to how much in so-called swipe fees or interchange fees they get from merchants. The banks let Visa set the prices for all of them.  Visa has decided that every bank that issues Visa cards will get the same rate as every other bank, no matter how efficient a bank is, no matter how much fraud a bank allows. Rather than a competitive system, this is a system which subsidizes inefficiency. In fact, the only competition in the interchange system right now is the competition between card networks to raise interchange fees. They raise the rates in order to get banks to join the network and issue more of their cards.  It is easy to see why banks and card networks set up this system. It makes the banks happy because they get billions of dollars a year in high fees, and they don't have to worry about competition. It makes the networks happy because they get their own network fee each time a card is swiped, and high interchange means banks will issue more cards.  But it is unfair to those who are receiving the cards--for example, the restaurants, the merchants, the shops, the book stores, universities, charities, convenience stores--because they have no power to negotiate this fee. They can't hold off and say: Wait a minute, if you want us to take Visa at our store, we want to know how much you are going to charge us every time a customer uses a Visa card. There is no way to have any conversation on that. Visa establishes what the swipe fee will be.  It is also unfair to consumers, particularly low-income consumers and those without banking accounts, who pay billions per year in hidden interchange fees that are passed on to them in higher prices for gas and groceries. How about that. I had some people in my office today talking about the price of gasoline. They said: Understand, every time a customer uses a Visa or a MasterCard, they are taking a percentage of that cost on the gallon of gasoline. Their percentage keeps going up, and in order to have a profit, to keep the lights on, we have to keep raising the price of gasoline to keep up with the credit card companies, let alone the national oil companies.  The Federal Reserve estimated that in 2009, about $16.2 billion was charged in debit interchange fees, a massive amount of money that is being paid to the banks by merchants and their customers, about $1.3 billion a month. I will get back to that number in a moment. It didn't used to be that way in America. It isn't that way in many other countries that use Visa and MasterCard.  Back when the debit card system was started several decades ago, debit fees were minimal. It wasn't until Visa entered the market in the 1990s that we started seeing debit card interchange fees that looked like credit card interchange fees.  They are two different worlds. When I use a credit card, ultimately, the bank and credit card company have to collect from me. If I dodge them or don't pay, there is a loss. A debit card comes directly out of my account. There is no question whether the money is there. It is already there.  There is an excellent New York Times article by Andrew Martin from last year titled ``How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market.''  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 5, 2010]      The Card Game--How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market                           (By Andrew Martin)       Every day, millions of Americans stand at store checkout      counters and make a seemingly random decision: after swiping      their debit card, they choose whether to punch in a code, or      to sign their name.       It is a pointless distinction to most consumers, since the      price is the same either way. But behind the scenes, billions      of dollars are at stake.       When you sign a debit card receipt at a large retailer, the      store pays your bank an average of 75 cents for every $100      spent, more than twice as much as when you punch in a four-     digit code.       The difference is so large that Costco will not allow you      to sign for your debit purchase in its checkout lines. Wal-     Mart and Home Depot steer customers to use a PIN, the debit      card norm outside the United States.       Despite all this, signature debit cards dominate debit use      in this country, accounting for 61 percent of all such      transactions, even though PIN debit cards are less expensive      and less vulnerable to fraud.       How this came to be is largely a result of a successful if      controversial strategy hatched decades ago by Visa, the      dominant payment network for credit and debit cards. It is an      approach that has benefited Visa and the nation's banks at      the expense of merchants and, some argue, consumers.       Competition, of course, usually forces prices lower. But      for payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, competition in      the card business is more about winning over banks that      actually issue the cards than consumers who use them. Visa      and MasterCard set the fees that merchants must pay the      cardholder's bank. And higher fees mean higher profits for      banks, even if it means that merchants shift the cost to      consumers.       Seizing on this odd twist, Visa enticed banks to embrace      signature debit--the higher-priced method of handling debit      cards--and turned over the fees to banks as an incentive to      issue more Visa cards. At least initially, MasterCard and      other rivals promoted PIN debit instead.       As debit cards became the preferred plastic in American      wallets, Visa has turned its attention to PIN debit too and      increased its market share even more. And it has succeeded--     not by lowering the fees that merchants pay, but often by      pushing them up, making its bank customers happier.       In an effort to catch up, MasterCard and other rivals      eventually raised fees on debit cards too, sometimes higher      than Visa, to try to woo bank customers back.       ``What we witnessed was truly a perverse form of      competition,'' said Ronald Congemi, the former chief      executive of Star Systems, one of the regional PIN-based      networks that has struggled to compete with Visa. ``They      competed on the basis of raising prices. What other industry      do you know that gets away with that?''       Visa has managed to dominate the debit landscape despite      more than a decade of litigation and antitrust investigations      into high fees and anticompetitive behavior, including a      settlement in 2003 in which Visa paid $2 billion that some      predicted would inject more competition into the debit      industry.       Yet today, Visa has a commanding lead in signature debit in      the United States, with a 73 percent share. Its share of the      domestic PIN debit market is smaller but growing, at 42      percent, making Visa the biggest PIN network, according to      The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.                          The Risk of Refusing       Critics complain that Visa does not fight fair, and that it      used its market power to force merchants to accept higher      costs for debit cards. Merchants say they cannot refuse Visa      cards because it would result in lower sales.       ``A dollar is no longer a dollar in this country,'' said      Mallory Duncan, senior vice president of the National Retail      Federation, a trade association. ``It's a Visa dollar. It's      only worth 99 cents because they take a piece of every one.''       Visa officials say its critics are griping about debit      products that have transformed the nation's payment system,      adding convenience for consumers and higher sales for      merchants, while cutting the hassle and expense of dealing      with cash and checks. In recent years, New York cabbies and      McDonald's restaurants are among those reporting higher sales      as a result of accepting plastic.       ``At times we have a perspective problem,'' said William M.      Sheedy, Visa's president for the Americas. ``Debit has become      so mainstream, some of the people who have benefited have      lost sight of what their business model was, what their cost      structure was.''       Visa officials said the costs of debit for merchants had      not gone down because the cards now provided greater value      than they did five or 10 years ago. The costs must not be too      onerous, they say, because merchant acceptance has doubled in      the last decade.       The fees are ``not a cost-based calculation, but a value-     based calculation,'' said Elizabeth Buse, Visa's global head      of product.       As for Visa's market share, company officials maintain that      it is rather small when considered within the larger context      of all payments, where, for now at least, cash remains king.       While Visa may be among the best-known brands in the world,      how it operates is a mystery to many consumers.       Visa does not distribute credit or debit cards, nor does it      provide credit so consumers can buy flat-screen televisions      or a Starbucks latte. Those tasks are left to the banks,      which owned Visa until it went public in 2008.       Instead, Visa provides an electronic network that acts like      a tollbooth, processing the transaction between merchants and      banks and collecting a fee that averages 5 or 6 cents every      time. For the financial year ended in June, Visa handled 40      billion transactions. Banks that issue Visa cards also pay a      separate licensing fee, based on payment volume. MasterCard,      which is roughly half the size of Visa, uses a similar model.       ``It's a penny here or there,'' said Moshe Katri, an      analyst who tracks the payments industry for Cowen and      Company. ``But when you have a billion transactions or more,      it adds up.''       With debit transactions forecast to overtake cash purchases      by 2012, the model has investors swooning: Visa's stock      traded at $88.14 on Monday, near a 52-week high, while shares      of MasterCard, at $256.84 each, have soared by more than 450      percent since the company went public in 2006.       While there is little controversy about the fees that Visa      collects, some merchants are infuriated by a separate, larger      fee, called interchange, that Visa makes them pay each time a      debit or credit card is swiped. The fees, roughly 1 to 3      percent of each purchase, are forwarded to the cardholder's      bank to cover costs and promote the issuance of more Visa      cards.       The banks have used interchange fees as a growing profit      center and to pay for cardholder perks like rewards programs.      Interchange revenue has increased to $45 billion today, from      $20 billion in 2002, driven in part by the surge in debit      card use.       Some merchants say there should be no interchange fees on      debit purchases, because the money comes directly out of a      checking account and does not include the risks and losses      associated with credit cards. Regardless, merchants say they      inevitably pass on that cost to consumers; the National      Retail Federation says the interchange fees cost households      an average of $427 in 2008.       While the cost per transaction may seem small, at Best Buy,      the biggest stand-alone electronics chain, ``these      skyrocketing fees add up to hundreds of millions of dollars      every year,'' said Dee O'Malley, director of financial      services. ``Every additional dollar we are forced to pay      credit card companies is another dollar we can't use to hire      employees, or pass along to our customers in the form of      savings.''                      Weighing Rules on Merchants       The Justice Department is investigating if rules imposed by      payment networks, including Visa, on merchants regarding      ``various payment forms'' are anticompetitive, a spokeswoman      said. Several bills have been introduced in Congress seeking      to give merchants more ability to negotiate interchange,      which is largely unregulated.       While interchange remains legal despite repeated      challenges, a group of merchants is pursuing yet another      class-action suit, this time in federal court in Brooklyn,      against Visa and MasterCard that seeks to upend the system      for setting fees.       ``Visa and MasterCard have morphed into a giant cookie jar      for banks at the expense of consumers,'' said Mitch      Goldstone, a plaintiff in the case.       Fees were not an issue when debit cards first gained      traction in the 1980s. The small networks that operated      automated teller machines, like STAR, Pulse, MAC and NYCE,      issued debit cards that required a PIN. MasterCard had its      own PIN debit network, called Maestro.       Merchants were not charged a fee for accepting PIN debit      cards, and sometimes they even got a small payment because it      saved banks the cost of processing a paper check.       That changed after Visa entered the debit market. In the      1990s, Visa promoted a debit card that let consumers access      their checking account on the same network that processed its      credit cards, which required a signature.       To persuade the banks to issue more of its debit cards,      Visa charged merchants for these transactions and passed the      money to the issuing banks. By 1999, Visa was setting fees of      $1.35 on a $100 purchase, while Maestro and other regional      PIN networks charged less than a dime, Federal Reserve data      shows. Visa says the fee was justified because signature      debit was so much more useful than PIN debit; at the time,      roughly 15 percent of merchants had keypads for entering a      PIN.       Merchants said they had no choice but to continue taking      the debit cards, despite the higher fees; because Visa's      rules required them to honor its debit cards if they chose to      accept Visa's credit cards.                          A Seven-Year Battle       Wal-Mart, Circuit City, Sears and a number of major      merchants eventually sued. After seven years of litigation,      Visa and MasterCard agreed to end the ``honor all cards''      rule between credit and debit and to pay the retailers a      settlement of around $3 billion, one of the largest in      American corporate history. Visa paid $2 billion, and      MasterCard the remainder.       Since then, only a handful of retailers have stopped      accepting Visa debit cards, an indication that the crux of      the lawsuit was ``much ado about nothing,'' Mr. Sheedy says.       And while some merchants said they thought the lawsuit      would pave the way to a new era of competition, a curious      thing happened instead: while Visa temporarily lowered its      fees for signature debit, it raised the price on PIN debit      transactions and passed the funds on to card-issuing banks,      and its competitors soon followed.       The current class-action lawsuit joined by Mr. Goldstone      contends that Visa's PIN debit network, called Interlink, is      offering banks higher fees as an incentive to issue debit      cards that are exclusively routed over this network.      Interlink, which has raised its PIN debit fees for small      merchants to 90 cents for each $l00 transaction, from 20      cents in 2002, is often the most expensive, especially for      small merchants, Fed data shows.       One large retailer, who requested anonymity to preserve its      relationship with Visa, provided data that showed Interlink's      share of PIN purchases rose to 47 percent in 2009, from 20      percent in 2002, even as its fees steadily increased ahead of      most other networks--to 49 cents per $100 transaction in      2009, from 38 cents in 2006.       Visa officials say its PIN debit network is taking off      despite rising costs because it offers merchants, banks and      consumers a level of efficiency and security that regional      networks cannot match. ``We are motivated as a company to try      to drive value to each one of those participants so that they      accept the card, issue more cards, use the card,'' Mr. Sheedy      said.       At checkout counters, meanwhile, consumers are quietly      tugged in one direction or the other.       Safewasy, 7-Eleven and CVS drugstores automatically prompt      consumers to do a less costly PIN debit transaction. The      banks, however, still steer consumers toward the more      expensive form of signature debit. Wells Fargo and Chase are      among those that offer bonus points only on debit purchases      completed with a signature.       Visa says it does not care how consumers use their debit      card, as long as it is a Visa. But for now at least, the      company says the only way to ensure that a purchase is routed      over the Visa network is to sign.       ``When you use your Visa card, you have a chance to win a      trip to the Olympic Winter Games,'' a new Visa commercial      promises.       The commercial does not explain the rules, but the fine      print on Visa's Web site does: nearly all Visa purchases are      eligible--as long as the cardholder does not enter a PIN.
