Speaker, although I support the inclusion of a $2.7 billion increase for opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery, this funding only nibbles at the edge of the problem. This is a national crisis. It must be reflected in a real plan to meet the crisis, including funding priorities. No matter how many fighters or tanks we have, America will not be strong abroad if vast segments of our own population are dying here at home--more than in traffic accidents, more than from major diseases--from opioid and drug abuse.  This bill is a fair compromise, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' despite some of the major provisions that are not in there that break our hearts.  The American people are counting on us to run our Nation's ship of State. Let's do that today.                             General Leave
