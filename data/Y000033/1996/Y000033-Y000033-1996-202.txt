Mr. Chairman, first let me say I do support the amendment of the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Hayworth]. The Indian housing problems in this Nation are severe. This is a good amendment and I will be supporting it.  Mr. Chairman, I'm offering an amendment to the amendment by Mr. Hayworth, to correct a problem relating to the application of the Davis-Bacon Act to construction of Indian housing.  As written, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona contains language that would effectively prohibit application of the Davis-Bacon Act to construction of Indian housing. I think this is wrong. My amendment changes the language to ensure that the Davis-Bacon Act applies to the construction of 12 or more units of Indian housing.  My amendment will make the gentleman's amendment more consistent with current law, in which the Davis-Bacon Act applies to certain federallysubsidized construction contracts. I realize there is a larger debate concerning Davis-Bacon at issue. However, this is not the place to debate our views on Davis-Bacon, which I happen to support strongly.  Consideration of Davis-Bacon reform or repeal should be considered separately and on its own merits. It should not be modified or repealed in a piecemeal fashion through legislation like this.  I strongly support our effort to give more control and flexibility in operating affordable housing projects to Indians. However, this is not the place to address Davis-Bacon.  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment, and I stress again, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona, if my amendment is adopted, is a good piece of legislation and I urge its passage.
