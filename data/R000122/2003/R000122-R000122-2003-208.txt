This year's national competition will take place on April 26 to 28, 2003.  The ``We the People'' program and competition are administered by the Center for Civic Education. The program is an extensive one, developed to educate students about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The competition is modeled after hearings in Congress and consists of oral presentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on constitutional topics. The students' testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the judges who probe their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.  Our current global situation has increased the importance of initiatives which help young people to understand the fundamental ideals and principles of our government. We cannot take these ideals and principles for granted. Instead, we must hold them as standards in our endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional democracy. It is of vital importance for future generations to understand the convictions that bind us together as a nation.  I believe that these students from West Warwick deserve added recognition. Not only is this their second consecutive State championship, this year's State competition took place just 2 weeks after the tragic fire in West Warwick that injured and took the lives of almost 290 family, friends, and neighbors of these young adults. In spite of their hometown's mourning, these students were able to continue their diligent preparation for the statewide ``We the People'' competition, and win. The West Warwick High School students will be joining 1,200 others from across the United States.  On behalf of all Rhode Islanders, I would like to congratulate the following students: Carly Alvernaz, Linzy Alvernaz, Jennifer Bartley, Stacy Costa, Sara Dalton, Ryan Desrochers, Megan Dougherty, Jillian Drummond, Elizabeth Duggan, Katheryn Flynn, Ashley Iasimone, Thomas Kelly, Paris Legault, Paul Piacitelli, Daniel Politelli, Lisa Powers, Ali Shihadeh, Nicholas St. Germain, Christen Varin, Russell Venditto, and Meaghan Whitford. In addition, I would like to acknowledge their teacher Marc Leblanc, the Rhode Island State coordinator, Michael Trofi, and the district coordinator, Henry Cote, for their dedication to this program over the years. I wish the students from West Warwick High School the best of luck at the ``We the People'' national finals.                          ____________________
