President, I am happy to join my colleague Senator Schumer in introducing the ``Targeted Gun Dealer Enforcement Act of 1999.'' This bill will give law enforcement the tools they need to prevent suspect gun dealers from supplying firearms to criminals and plaguing our communities with gun violence.  Guns kill 34,000 Americans every year--thirteen children every day. They kill more teen-agers than any natural cause.  This bill allows the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to closely monitor those gun dealers who they should be monitoring--the dealers who have had more than 25 crime guns traced to them in the last year.  The facts in Illinois are particularly compelling on this issue. In Illinois, 26 gun dealers account for more crime guns than the remaining 3,700 Illinois federally licensed gun dealers combined.  These figures show that while most gun dealers are law abiding and responsible, some shops have become ``convenience stores'' for criminals. Twenty-six dealers were the source of more than 1,600 crime guns with each dealer responsible for selling at least 25 guns used in crimes in 1998.  This bill will help law enforcement find out why these dealers are the source of guns later used to commit crimes. The bill will require high volume crime dealers to report handgun sales to ATF and local police. Law enforcement can then use these records to more effectively trace crime guns.  The bill will also encourage gun dealers to sell guns more responsively. In the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, ATF found that many guns used by youths to commit crimes are purchased from licensed dealers by individuals acting as ``straw'' purchasers. A ``straw purchaser'' is a person who illegally purchases a firearm for another person, such as a juvenile or a felon.  This bill seeks to address that problem by prohibiting the sale of a firearm when a seller has ``reason to know'' that such firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence or a drug crime. Current law requires actual knowledge on the part of the dealer that the buyer will use the firearm to commit a crime of violence. This change will make it easier for law enforcement to target dealers who they believe are turning a blind eye in supplying guns to buyers under questionable circumstances.  In 1998, Chicago police officers conducted ``Operation Gunsmoke,'' an investigation to target gun-sellers just outside the city limits. Seven undercover officers purchased 171 guns from 12 suburban gun stores in a three month period. Not one dealer refused to sell the agents weapons even as the agents openly violated laws needed to purchase firearms. This investigation was key to the City of Chicago'sgroundbreaking lawsuit against the gun industry on the theory of public nuisance.  We must act now to keep guns from getting into the hands of criminals. I applaud Senator Schumer's leadership on this issue and hope my colleagues will join us in this important effort to make our communities safer. The statistics show most gun dealers are responsible, but a few unscrupulous dealers are supplying criminals with guns that plague our communities.                                 ______                                       By
