 President, let me begin my remarks today by reiterating my strong support for the underlying bill that is before us to reform the Internal Revenue Service. This is a good bill and it is really long overdue. I want to join my numerous colleagues who have complimented Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan and others who have worked very hard and long on this legislation. I have listened to my colleagues all day talk about the benefits of that bill, and I add my comments to that in support of that as well.  Despite my strong support for this underlying bill, I am deeply concerned about title IX of this conference report, because hidden deep within this bill in title IX is language to take some $17 billion from America's veterans. Several of my colleagues have been addressing this issue today, and I associate myself with the remarks of Senator Rockefeller, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Durbin. I know Senator Wellstone has taken quite a bit of time to outline what is in this bill, and I thank him for his words, his comments, and his support.  Title IX is the technical corrections language for the transportation legislation. Hidden within that is a provision that takes away disability benefits from veterans whose illness resulted from smoking. Many of these veterans, as my colleagues know, were encouraged to smoke during wartime service with free cigarettes that were provided by our armed services. I am outraged by this language, and I am sure that many of my colleagues in the Senate are as well. I know Senator Chafee, who is the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has spoken to this issue. I have immense respect for Senator Chafee and for his leadership in crafting the very important TEA 21 legislation, the transportation bill that passed. Transportation is a critical and important issue.  However, let me be very clear. I continue to oppose the veterans offset used to fund the increases in transportation. The chairman argued that this is not a controversial matter, that the Senate has already spoken. With all due respect, I disagree. If this issue is so noncontroversial, why are we debating it within the IRS reform bill? This legislation has nothing to do with the veterans bill. If this issue is truly noncontroversial, then let's have a stand-alone debate on the issue of cutting $17 billion in veterans' benefits. The technical corrections bill is at the desk. We could have a time agreement on that. It could pass very quickly. It does not need to be included in the IRS reform legislation. It has nothing to do with the IRS reform legislation.  I ask, and I believe all of my colleagues should ask the question, Why on Earth is the IRS reform legislation used to take money from our American veterans? It is a very legitimate question. The original Senate version of the IRS reform did, of course, not target veterans, and neither did the House bill, the IRS reform bill. Somehow the conference committee agreed to add the technical corrections for the highway legislation to this bill on IRS reform. I am assuming that this action was taken at the direction of leadership, since I know that the Finance Committee does not have jurisdiction over the veterans funding issue. The IRS bill is viewed as politically popular and a cinch to pass. That, I would guess, is why the veterans cuts were added to this bill. The proponents of this veterans grab want to avoid accountability. That is wrong, and that is why I am opposed to title IX of the underlying bill being included in this bill. The proponents figured that we would just roll over and accept these wrongful cuts because everyone wants to reform the IRS.  I have been fighting this veterans grab all year. It was in the President's budget, and I opposed it. At the Budget Committee, I voted against Democratic and Republican proposals that included these disastrous cuts to veterans health. On the Senate floor, I voted against the budget one final time in opposition to these cuts to veterans. During consideration of the budget, I was pleased to join with Senator Rockefeller and others to fight against these cuts. I voted against the Craig-Domenici amendment to validate the $10 billion cut in veterans funding. Sadly, the Senate budget resolution paved the way for the transportation bill to use the veterans savings to offset the increased transportation funding.  I want to be sure that my colleagues are aware that the technical corrections language punishing veterans that is included in this IRS bill is opposed by virtually every veterans service organization. Many of them have written and contacted me in opposition to the cuts, including the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Disabled American Veterans.  Senators need to know that this issue has touched a nerve with America's veterans. They are deeply offended that the Congress and the administration would divert money targeted to care for sick veterans to pay for other spending priorities. This issue is not going to go away. America's veterans and many in Congress will continue to fight this battle. We simply must revisit this issue and do the right thing for America's veterans, and the time is now. The best way to do that is to remove the language from this nonrelated IRS reform bill and vote on the issue separately.  I ask unanimous consent now to have printed in the Record a letter from the American Legion that I recently received.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          The American Legion,                                     Washington, DC, July 2, 1998.       Dear Senator: The American Legion ask you to recommit the      IRS Restructuring conference report back to the conferees      with instructions to strip out H.R. 3978, the technical      corrections language to the Transportation Equity Act for the      21st Century (TEA 21).       Urge the Senate leadership to allow H.R. 3978 to be debated      on the floor as a stand along bill. Also encourage the Senate      leadership to allow an ``up-or-down'' vote on Senator      Rockefeller's amendment to H.R. 3978 that would strike the      veteran's disability compensation offset included in the TEA      21 highway legislation. The TEA 21 correction bill should not      be part of the IRS Restructuring conference report.       Subsidizing the highway trust fund with $15.4 billion in      offsets from veterans compensation is just plain wrong. This      is a grave injustice to America's disabled veterans who      became addicted to tobacco during military service. The      suggestion that approximately 500,000 veterans would file      tobacco-related claims each year is ridiculous. Since 1993,      approximately 8,000 veterans have filed claims for tobacco-     related illnesses and less than 300 claims have been granted.       The American Legion fully acknowledges that Members of      Congress recognize and appreciate veterans' contributions to      our country. Unfortunately, many legislators have not been      provided an honest opportunity to cast a fair vote with      regard to veterans suffering from tobacco-related illnesses      as demonstrated by the recent vote on the TEA 21.       Once again, The American Legion ask you to recommit the IRS      Restructuring conference report back to the conferees with      instructions to strip out H.R. 3978, the technical      corrections language to TEA 21. Encourage the leadership to      debate H.R. 3978 as a stand alone bill and ask for the      opportunity to have an ``up-or-down'' vote on the Rockefeller      amendment. Veterans and Members of Congress deserve a fair      vote! Thank you for your consideration in this matter.           Sincerely,                                               Steve A. Robertson,                                  National Legislative Commission.
