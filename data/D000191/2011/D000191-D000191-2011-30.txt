Tax cuts solve all problems, especially for the millionaire and billionaire job creators.  We're in the 10th year of the Bush tax cuts: $4 trillion. We're in the third year of the Obama tax cuts: $1 trillion. Now we have to cut programs to continue the tax cuts that don't create jobs.  What's one of the specified targets? Student financial aid. Hey, they don't know anybody at the country club who can't afford to put their kid through medical school, but at the top of their list is cutting student financial aid.  Cutting investments in transportation that could put millions to work. Stopping taxes on the aviation industry, which is, guess what, capturing the money, not lowering prices, and laying off 90,000 people and stopping critical infrastructure jobs for that industry. Tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts.  Let's get real. Let's do things for the American people, put people back to work, and solve the deficit problem.
