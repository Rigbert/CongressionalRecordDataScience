Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and outstanding businesses that enrich the lives of their employees, produce quality products, and help make Riverside a wonderful place to live and work. On Saturday, March 27, 2008, at the 108th Inaugural Dinner, Johnson Machinery will be recognized by the Riverside Chamber of Commerce as the 2007 Business of the Year.  Ruel Johnson purchased Freeland Tractor & Equipment Company in 1940. The country was emerging from the Great Depression and business was slow, however, as the Nation recovered, so did the equipment industry. Agricultural businesses purchased new farming machinery and contractors purchased equipment to build new houses, roads, and freeways.  Over 60-plus years of business, customer equipment needs have changed from primarily agricultural to heavy construction and industrial use. In 1986, the company changed its name to Johnson Machinery Co. to reflect this evolution. The company has grown from the original 12 employees to over 600, and remains dedicated to offering the best quality product and service to its customers. This dedication earned Johnson Machinery the rank of Platinum dealer in 2007, after achieving Gold Level dealer for 3 consecutive years; a first in Caterpillar history. Johnson Machinery is now comprised of five divisions.  The geography of the Inland Empire ranges from mountains with elevation as high as 10,000 feet to deserts. Due to this diversity, the industries served by Johnson Machinery are also wide ranging. Some of the major industries are: residential development, industrial development, underground and infrastructure, landscaping, cement plants, mining, sand and gravel, railroad, agriculture, resort and golf communities, and heavy construction and earth moving.  The power division, Johnson Power Systems, started as Johnson Industrial in 1977, and has nearly doubled in size since 1989. It provides on and off highway, and marine engine service as well as power generations sales, service and rentals.  In 1990, Johnson Machinery Co. acquired Eveready Pacific, a heavy-duty machine shop in the La Sierra area of West Riverside. The increased need for specialized service work caused the operation to outgrow its current facility. In 2000, Ever-Pac was moved to a new, larger facility right behind the home office on East La Cadena in Riverside.  Johnson Machinery Co. entered the material handling market in 1976 and in 1992, the Hyster product line was acquired. To reflect the new acquisition, the division changed its name to Johnson Lift/HYSTER. Johnson Machinery introduced Johnson Rental Services in the fall of 1998 and opened the first rental store in Temecula, CA.  It is my pleasure to recognize Johnson Machinery, Mr. Bill Johnson and his family and their world-class employees for over 67 years of exceptional service as well as thank them for their contributions to the community of Riverside, CA. Johnson Machinery not only provides quality products and services to their customers but also provides a positive place to work. I know that many community leaders are grateful for Johnson Machinery and salute them as they receive this prestigious recognition.                          ____________________
