President, I ask the Senate to join me in recognizing Arlington High School in Oregon and its remarkable career and technical education program. Thanks to the leadership of district staff and the support of the community, students at Arlington High are better prepared for their post high school careers.  Career and technical education provides students of all ages with the academic and technical skills, knowledge, and training necessary to succeed in future careers. Students participating in career and technical education programs graduate high school at higher rates than average and are better prepared to get good-paying jobs beyond the classroom.  The HonkerTech Center at Arlington High School offers many disciplines to its students, based on interests and career choices. These include metal fabrication, digital design and production, and mechanics. Students learn business concepts and skills, like developing a project budget and writing a proposal and using accounting software. Students are accountable and responsible for designing their projects. They also have an opportunity to gain practical, real-world experience working with regional and international customers on custom products. The impact of this program extends beyond the classroom, making sure that students have the skills they need to become lifelong learners, even after they graduate.  I am proud to recognize the career and technical education program at Arlington High School and the good work being done to prepare Oregon students for success after graduation. This is what I call doing things the Oregon way.                          ____________________
