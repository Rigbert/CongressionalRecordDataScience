 President, I commend the Senator from California. I think she has it exactly right. The issue is whether, in the absence of a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the United States will have completely normal relations with Azerbaijan. I would like to see normal relations between our country and Azerbaijan. I would also like to see normal relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. If all the leverage is removed in advance of an agreement, it seems to most of us that it makes the agreement less likely.  So I commend the Senator from California. She is absolutely correct on the merits. We hope the second-degree amendment will prevail.
