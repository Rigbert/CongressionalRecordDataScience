We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of this week.                              {time}  1930  Any votes on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday and the balance of the week, we expect to consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules. Next week we also expect to consider two bills under a rule: H.R. 3193, the District of Columbia Personal Protection Act; and H.J. Res. 106, the Marriage Protection Amendment.  I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I would be glad to answer any questions he may have.
