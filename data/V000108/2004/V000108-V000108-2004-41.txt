Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate St. George Greek Orthodox Church as they join together in celebration of their 75th anniversary. They will be celebrating this very momentous and special occasion October 14-17, 2004.  From their modest beginnings, St. George's has emerged as a cornerstone of the community. St. George was founded by Greek immigrants in October, 1929 in East Chicago, Indiana. In 1982, the parish moved to Schererville and held church services in a chapel. In March 1992, the parish celebrated a ``new beginning'' when a brand new building was constructed and the first services were held in the new church. A community which first started with 25 members has grown to over 500 members. The church stewards reside all across Lake County and the country.  The spiritual Father Reverend Constantine Aliferakis has been St. Georges's leader for the past 16 years. Under Father Aliferakis's guidance, St. George continues to thrive, both in terms of spiritual growth as well as practical improvements. An integral part of the community is the St. George Ladies Philoptochos Society, which spearheads charitable works in and around the community.  The celebration weekend begins on Thursday, October 14, 2004 with church services and the veneration of an actual relic of the body of St. George. On Friday, October 15, 2004 the church will hold a reunion basketball game and homecoming dance at Grimmer Middle School. Saturday, October 16 there will be an Anniversary golf outing at Scherwood Golf Center followed by the Anniversary Gala at the Grand Hall of St. George Greek Orthodox church. The celebration banquet will conclude the festivities on Sunday, October 17, when the church welcomes His Eminence Metropolitan Iakovos, leader of the Greek Orthodox Church of Chicago, for a Hierarchical Service followed by an Anniversary luncheon.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating St. George Greek Orthodox Church on their 75th anniversary. Throughout many hardships and trials, the members of St. George have dedicated themselves to providing a spiritual and guiding light through the protection of the Greek Orthodox faith and traditions for all of Northwest Indiana. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
