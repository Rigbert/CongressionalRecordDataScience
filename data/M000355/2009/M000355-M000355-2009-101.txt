 But it was a truly bipartisan landscape for our country--a landmark, important. It was widely accepted by the American people because of the broad bipartisan support it enjoyed. That is what has been lacking here from the beginning.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of physician organizations that oppose this act, representing nearly one-half million physicians, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Physician Organizations That Oppose Senate's Patient Protection and                           Affordable Care Act       To date over 40 state, county and national medical      societies, representing nearly one-half million physicians,      have stated their public opposition to the Senate healthcare      overhaul bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act      (H.R. 3590). It is time for Congress to slow down, take a      step back, and change the direction of current reform efforts      to ensure that it is done right!

Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Leader Reid: On behalf of the over 240,000 surgeons      and anesthesiologists we represent and the millions of      surgical patients we treat each year, the undersigned 19      organizations strongly support the need for national health      care reform and share the Senate's commitment to make      affordable quality health care more accessible to all      Americans. As you know, we have been working diligently and      in good faith with the Senate during the past year and have      provided input at various stages in the process of drafting      the Senate's health care reform bill. To this end, we have      reviewed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of      2009.       As you may recall, on November 4 our coalition sent you a      letter outlining a number of serious concerns that needed to      be addressed to ensure that any final health care reform      package would be built on a solid foundation in the best      interest of our patients. Since those concerns have not been      adequately addressed, as detailed below, we must oppose the      legislation as currently written.       We oppose:       Establishment and proposed implementation of an Independent      Medicare Advisory Board whose recommendations could become      law without congressional action;       Mandatory participation in a seriously flawed Physician      Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) program with penalties      for non-participation;       Budget-neutral bonus payments to primary care physicians      and rural general surgeons;       Creation of a budget-neutral value-based payment modifier      which CMS does not have the capability to implement and      places the provision on an unrealistic and unachievable      timeline;       Requirement that physicians pay an application fee to cover      a background check for participation in Medicare despite      already being obligated to meet considerable requirements of      training, licensure, and board certification;       Relying solely on the limited recommendations of the United      States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in determining      a minimum coverage standard for preventive services and      associated cost-sharing protections;       The so-called ``non-discrimination in health care''      provision that would create patient confusion over greatly      differing levels of education, skills and training among      health care professionals while inappropriately interjecting      civil rights concepts into state scope of practice laws;       The absence of a permanent fix to Medicare's broken      physician payment system and any meaningful proven medical      liability reforms; and       The last-minute addition of the excise tax on elective      cosmetic medical procedures. This tax discriminates against      women and the middle class. Experience at the state level has      demonstrated that it is a failed policy which will not result      in the projected revenue. Furthermore, this provision is      arbitrary, difficult to administer, unfairly puts the      physician in the role of tax collector, and raises serious      patient confidentiality issues.       This bill goes a long way towards realizing the goal of      expanding health insurance coverage and takes important steps      to improve quality and explore innovative systems for health      care delivery. Despite serious concerns, there are several      provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act      of 2009 that the surgical community supports, strongly      believes are in the best interest of the surgical patients,      and should be maintained in any final package. Specifically      these include: health insurance market reforms, including the      elimination of coverage denials based on preexisting medical      conditions and guaranteed availability and renewability of      health insurance coverage; strengthening patient access to      emergency and trauma care by ensuring the survival of trauma      centers, developing regionalized systems of care to optimize      patient outcomes, and improving emergency care for children;      well-designed clinical comparative effectiveness research,      conducted through an independent institute and not used for      determining medical necessity or making coverage and payment      decisions or recommendations; and the exclusion of ultrasound      from the increase in the utilization rate for calculating the      payment for imaging services.       Further, while redistribution of unused residency positions      to general surgery is a positive step in addressing the      predicted shortage in the surgical workforce, we believe that      the Senate should look more broadly at the issue of limits on      residency positions for all specialties that work in the      surgical setting that are also facing severe workforce      problems.       Finally, we are pleased that you have accepted our      suggestion and removed language which would reduce payments      to physicians who are found to have the highest utilization      of resources--without regard to the acuity of the patient's      physical condition or the complexity of the care being      provided. We thank you for making this important change.       While we must oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable      Care Act as currently written, the surgical coalition is      committed to the passage of meaningful and comprehensive      health care reform that is in the best interest of our      patients. We are committed to working with you to make      critical changes that are vital to ensuring that this      legislation is based on sound policy, and that it will have a      long-term positive impact on patient access to safe and      effective high-quality surgical care.           Sincerely,         American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive            Surgery; American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and           Neck Surgery; American Association of Neurological            Surgeons; American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons;            American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists;            American College of Osteopathic Surgeons; American            College of Surgeons; American Osteopathic Academy of            Orthopedics; American Society of Anesthesiologists;            American Society of Breast Surgeons.

Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid: The undersigned state and national      specialty medical societies are writing you on behalf of more      than 92,000 physicians in opposition to passage of the      ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (H.R. 3590)      and to urge you to draft a more targeted bill that will      reform the country's flawed system for financing healthcare,      while preserving the best healthcare in the world. While      continuance of the status quo is not acceptable, the shifting      to the federal government of so much control over medical      decisions is not justified. We are therefore united in our      resolve to achieve health system reform that empowers      patients and preserves the practice of medicine--without      creating a huge government bureaucracy.       H.R. 3590 creates a number of problematic provisions,      including:       The bill undermines the patient-physician relationship and      empowers the federal government with even greater authority.      Under the bill, (1) employers would be required to provide      health insurance or face financial penalties; (2) health      insurance packages with government prescribed benefits will      be mandatory; (3) doctors would be forced to participate in      the flawed Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) or      face penalties for nonparticipation; and (4) physicians would      have to comply with extensive new reporting requirements      related to quality improvement, case management, care      coordination, chronic disease management, and use of health      information technology.       The bill is unsustainable from a financial standpoint. It      significantly expands Medicaid eligibility, shifting      healthcare costs to physicians who are paid below the cost of      delivering care and to the states that are already operating      under severe budget constraints. It also postpones the start      of subsidies for the uninsured long after the government      levies new user fees and new taxes to cover expanded coverage      and benefits. This ``back-loading'' of new spending makes the      long-term costs appear deceptively low.       The government-run community health insurance option      eventually will lead to a single-payer, government run      healthcare system. Despite the state opt-out provision, the      community health insurance option contains the same      liabilities (i.e., government-run healthcare) as the public      option that was passed by the House of Representatives. Such      a system will ultimately limit patient choice and put the      government between the doctor and the patient, interfering      with patient care decisions.       Largely unchecked by Congress or the courts, the federal      government would have unprecedented authority to change the      Medicare program through the new Independent Medicare      Advisory Board and the new Center for Medicare & Medicaid      Innovation. Specifically, these entities could arbitrarily      reduce payments to physicians for valuable, life-saving care      for elderly patients, reducing treatment options in a      dramatic way.       The bill is devoid of real medical liability reform      measures that reduce costs in proven demonstrable ways.      Instead, it contains a ``Sense of the Senate'' encouraging      states to develop and test alternatives to the current civil      litigation system as a way of addressing the medical      liability problem. Given the fact that costs remain a      significant concern, Congress should enact reasonable      measures to reduce costs. The Congressional Budget Office      (CBO) recently confirmed that enacting a comprehensive set of      tort reforms will save the federal government $54 billion      over 10 years. These savings could help offset increased      health insurance premiums (which, according to the CBO, are      expected to increase under the bill) or other costs of the      bill.       The temporary one-year SGR ``patch'' to replace the 21.2      percent payment cut in 2010 with a 0.5 percent payment      increase fails to address the serious underlying problems      with the current Medicare physician payment system and      compounds the accumulated SGR debt, causing payment cuts of      nearly 25 percent in 2011. The CBO has confirmed that a      significant reduction in physicians' Medicare payments will      reduce beneficiaries' access to services.       The excise tax on elective cosmetic medical procedures in      the bill will not produce the revenue projected. Experience      at the state level has demonstrated that this is a failed      policy. In addition, this provision is arbitrary, difficult      to administer, unfairly puts the physician in the role of tax      collector, and raises serious patient confidentiality issues.      Physicians strongly oppose the use of provider taxes or fees      of any kind to fund healthcare programs or to finance health      system reform.       Our concerns about this legislation also extend to what is      not in the bill. The right to privately contract is a      touchstone of American freedom and liberty. Patients should      have the right to choose their doctor and enter into      agreements for the fees for those services without penalty.      Current Medicare patients are denied that right. By      guaranteeing all patients the right to privately contract      with their physicians, without penalty, patients will have      greater access to physicians and the government will have      budget certainty. Nothing in the Patient Protection and      Affordable Care Act addresses these fundamental tenets, which      we believe are essential components of real health system      reform.       Senator Reid, we are at a critical moment in history.      America's physicians deliver the best medical care in the      world, yet the systems that have been developed to finance      the delivery of that care to patients have failed. With      congressional action upon us, we are at a crossroads. One      path accepts as ``necessary'' a substantial increase in      federal government control over how medical care is delivered      and financed. We believe the better path is one that allows      patients and physicians to take a more direct role in their      healthcare decisions. By encouraging patients to own their      health insurance policies and by allowing them to freely      exercise their right to privately contract with the      physician of their choice, healthcare decisions will be      made by patients and physicians and not by the government      or other third party payers.       We urge you to slow down, take a step back, and change the      direction of current reform efforts so we get it right for      our patients and our profession. We have a prescription for      reform that will work for all Americans, and we are happy to      share these solutions with you to improve our nation's      healthcare system.       Thank you for considering our views.
