 President, the FAA Modernization Act, which we are debating in the Senate today, makes critical improvements that will ensure our aviation system is safe and efficient. That will put us on a path to modernizing our air traffic control system.  Now, in a short while, early this afternoon, the Senate will vote on whether we will finish this bill and send it to conference or whether Republicans are again going to refuse to work with us and force us to take this bill off the Senate floor.  I hope we are going to vote to move forward this afternoon. My colleagues on the Commerce and Finance Committees worked very hard on this important bill because it is critical to our Nation's economy that our aviation system work smoothly. We have some serious problems that we need to address.  Our air travel infrastructure is aging fast. It needs to be updated.
