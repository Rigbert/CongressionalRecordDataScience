Mr. Speaker, the American people want tax relief. They want lower taxes. But, Mr. Speaker, the American people want a tax cut that goes to the people who need it the most, America's working families.  The Republican tax bill is a boom for Wall Street, but a bust for Main Street. The Republican tax bill gives little relief to working people, people struggling to pay their mortgage, pay their car loan, pay their credit card bill and send their kids to college. The Republicans give most of their tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America. Almost 60 percent of the Republican tax breaks go to people earning $250,000 a year or more. That is not right, it is not fair, and it is not just. It is not what the American people want.  The Democrats want and the American people want a tax cut that goes to the middle class, to the hard-working families that need it the most. These are the people who deserve tax relief. Let us not give it away to the yacht owners, the junk bond traders and Rolls Royce drivers. Let us say no to the Republican tax bill.                          ____________________
