 President, to my amazement, we received a letter indicating the President might want to veto the foreign operations appropriations bill, a stunning development, it seems to me, almost inexplicable.  This bill, while not as much as the President requested, is as large as he signed last year and includes a number of items important not only to many of us but to him as well.  For example, if this bill were to ultimately be vetoed, the President would be vetoing--would be stopping--aid to the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union of $735 million; developmental assistance, which was $83 million over his request in this bill that he is threatening to veto; narcotics assistance at $285 million, which is $24 million above last year, the bill that he signed; for AIDS, $180 million to fight AIDS, which is $55 million above the bill that he signed last year; for UNICEF, an important program of the United Nations, there is $110 million in this bill for UNICEF, which is $5 million more than in the bill last year that he signed.  Obviously, we continue the Middle East earmarks to Israel and Egypt. Vetoing this bill would deny $3 billion to Israel. I think it is important to note that The American Israel Public Affairs Committee supports this bill. AIPAC supports this bill. I ask unanimous consent that letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                        AIPAC,                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     United States Senate,     Washington,DC.       Dear Chairman McConnell: We are writing to express our      support for the Conference Report on HR 2606, the FY 2000      Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, which contains      funding for Israel's regular aid package, including      provisions for early disbursal, offshore procurement and      refugee resettlement. The Middle East peace process is moving      forward with both Israel and the Palestinians committed to      resolving issues between them within a year. It is important      that Congress support Israel as this process moves ahead, and      we therefore also hope and urge that Congress find a way to      fund assistance to the Wye River signatories before the end      of this year.           Sincerely,     Lionel Kaplan,       President.     Howard Kohr,       Executive Director.     Brad Gordon,       Legislative Director.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, other items in this bill of interest: Child health, immunization, and education initiatives. For Kosovo--we fought a war there a few months ago--there is $535 million for Kosovo and for some of the countries surrounding Kosovo that were impacted by the war that was fought there. That is $142 million more than the President requested.  In addition, there is money in this bill for the environment, for biodiversity, for tropical rain forests, unique ecosystems initiatives. All of that will be denied if the President vetoes this bill.  For Lebanon and Cyprus, to help in the reconciliation process there, there is $15 million for Lebanon and $15 million for Cyprus.  Infectious diseases, especially polio and TB campaigns, which have been priorities of Senator Leahy, all of that would be vetoed by this bill.  Funds for Georgia, for Ukraine, for Armenia, for Poland--all of which is supported vigorously by Americans of Georgian, Ukrainian, Armenian, and Polish descent--all of that would not go forward if this bill were vetoed. The vote on this bill, when it went through the Senate--and it is not all that different now from the way it was when it cleared the Senate--was 97-2. This is virtually the same bill, at $12.6 billion, which protects virtually all of the Senate priorities passed here at 97-2. On the threat reduction initiative, we have spent $5.9 billion in Russia over the years. There are no restrictions on the $735 million we provide for that area of the world preventing funding of this new $250 million initiative to control the nuclear problem there.  On development assistance, the President claims it is dramatically underfunded. In fact, we not only exceeded last year's level--that is the bill President Clinton signed--we exceeded last year's level of spending and we have exceeded his request for this year. The President requested $83 million less than the conference has provided.  The veto threat to the Senator from Kentucky is inexplicable. It doesn't make any sense, unless this important bill for the assistance of Israel and Egypt and Armenia and Georgia and Ukraine and a number of other worthwhile causes that are supported around the world is somehow being made part of a larger strategy by the administration to veto all of these bills.  This bill enjoys strong support from AIPAC, from Armenian Americans, from Georgian Americans, Polish Americans, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, and Ukranian Americans. They are but a few of the Americans who appreciate this bill.  As I indicated, all of these items are threatened by the President's inexplicable decision to threaten to veto this bill.  Finally, let me say, before turning to my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, I don't know where the President wants to get more money for this bill. Are we going to take it out of the Social Security trust fund to spend on foreign aid? Is that what the President is suggesting we do? Does President Clinton want us to take moneyout of the Social Security trust fund and spend it on foreign aid? I don't think that is something we ought to be doing. I don't think the American people would like that.  I repeat, this is a bill that was supported overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis when it cleared the Senate the first time. It is about the same size as the bill the President signed last year.  I don't think there is any rational basis for the vetoing of this bill. I encourage the Senate to speak once again on a broad bipartisan basis with a large vote to support this important bill which means so much to peace and stability around the world.  With that, Mr. President, I understand we are planning on voting around noon. I yield the floor.
