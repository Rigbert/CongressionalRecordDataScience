Mr. Chairman, the complaints that we have been getting are very much like what the gentleman is talking about. If people called my office and the gentleman's office and other Members' offices seeking basic information about that case that we have under consideration with the IRS or any other Federal bureaucracy, it would be absurd to charge them for that phone call, and that is what this is all about. And let me reiterate again to the Members that the $65 for the passport more than covers. There is a profit there for the State Department, regrettably; it ought to be lower, it should accommodate what does the service cost, and then that is what the cost should be.  So this amendment seeks to do what the IRS and nobody else could even think of doing; that is, having a 900 number to give basic information. We are in the service business. We ought to enhance that service, and an 800 number would do that job, and that is what we are hoping will come out of this.
