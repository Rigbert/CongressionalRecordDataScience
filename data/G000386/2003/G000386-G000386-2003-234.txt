 1 is the money that is available to pay for his amendment, an offset, is the very same amount of money we, Senator Baucus and I, are using to offset the cost of a lot of demonstration projects that colleagues have asked us to do, a lot of minor amendments they have asked us to do. If that money is not there, there cannot be consideration given. That is not a threat; it is just a practical aspect of how the budget law works.  Secondly, remember, these dual eligibles are being taken care of very wellin our underlying legislation. The point being, they will not be taken care of better. It is just it is going to cost the Federal Government more.  I hope you will take those things into consideration and vote down this amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
