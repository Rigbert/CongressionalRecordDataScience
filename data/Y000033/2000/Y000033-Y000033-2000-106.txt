Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1030, a land exchange bill introduced by Senator Enzi of Wyoming.  This bill exchanges 9,480 acres of private land for approximately 20,000 acres of Federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. It is an equal-value exchange. Currently, over 17,000 acres of the public land identified for exchange are completely inaccessible to the public because of surrounding private lands. After the exchange, the resulting block of public land will consist of over 18,660 acres, accessible from a paved highway and located very close to Gillette, Wyoming. The land which will be acquired by the BLM is scenic, recreational land, containing timber, rugged topography, and excellent wildlife habitat.  I would note this land exchange involves the transfer of surface interests only; no mineral interests are involved in the exchange. The BLM will reserve all minerals. The amendment adopted by the Senate at the urging of the administration makes clear that while a land-use plan amendment is prepared for the new Federal surface estate to be acquired, the mineral estate beneath it is segregated from the operation of the mining law.  Passage of this legislation will permit the land exchange to go forward. As a result, it will be a lasting benefit to the citizens of Wyoming and the Federal Government. I urge my colleagues to support S. 1030.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
