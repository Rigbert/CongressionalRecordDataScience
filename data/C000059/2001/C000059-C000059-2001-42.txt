Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a most exceptional California Inland Empire community leader, friend and great American--William E. Leonard--who will be recognized for his work in transportation with the upcoming dedication and grand-opening of the interchange between the 210 freeway and the 15 interstate highway.  Calvin Coolidge, America's 13th President, once said, ``No person was ever honored for what he received; honor has been the reward for what he gave.'' And Bill Leonard has given much during his years of public and community service.  A member of the California State Highway Commission from 1973 to 1977 and the California Transportation Commission from 1985 to 1993, Bill Leonard has made a great impactin a short amount of time upon Inland Empire and Californian transportation needs. I can think of no other more fitting tribute to Bill Leonard than the dedication of this vital interchange given his many years of service in the field of transportation infrastructure.  Bill Leonard began his professional career when he joined his father at Leonard Realty & Building Company in San Bernardino, after leaving the United States Army (1943-1946) where he rose to the rank of First Lieutenant. He earned a bachelors degree in Business Administration from the University of California at Berkeley in 1944. From the family business, Bill Leonard developed, owned and operated a variety of real estate, management and development services throughout the Inland Empire. And from 1956 to 1958 he served as a member of California's Athletic Commission.  In the community, Bill Leonard has been equally involved and giving. He is a member and past director of the San Bernardino Area Chamber of Commerce, member and past president of the San Bernardino Host Lions, founding member and president of Inland Action, Inc. and a member of the National Orange Show Board of Directors, which he has served as President and Chairman of the Board of Governors. Additionally he has served on the San Bernardino Valley Board of Realtors, San Bernardino College Foundation, St. Bernadine's Hospital Foundation and University of California at Riverside Foundation.  Bill Leonard has been honored numerous times over the years for his outstanding public and community service, including the Boy Scouts of America Inland Empire Council's Distinguished Citizens Award, Valley Group's Award for Excellence in Infrastructure, and more. The Interchange Dedication is a proud addition to this list.  Mr. Speaker, Bill Leonard has dedicated his life to public and community service. An American whose talents have bettered the lives of those living in the Inland Empire and California. It is an honor for me today to join in his recognition--the new Interchange bears a proud and distinguished name.                          ____________________
