 President, not seeing the Senator from Massachusetts, I will make this point: If there is an eminently sensible amendment to come before us, this is it. It addresses the crisis that exists all over this country where young people are graduating college deeply in debt and have that onerous debt around their necks for decades.  This amendment simply gives these young people the opportunity to refinance their debts so they can substantially lower their student debt, and in some cases cut their student debt in half. It is hard for me to imagine how anybody could vote against an amendment as sensible as this amendment but so important to millions of families in this country who want to be able to send their kids to college and for the young people who want to graduate college without this oppressive debt.  I strongly ask for a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.
