Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the motion to instruct conferees offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado would instruct conferees on H.R. 2215 to agree to title 4 of the Senate amendment but insist on adding the new section 2003 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as added by section 402 of the House bill.  I will not oppose the motion to instruct offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado, but there are a few things that I think she ought to think about before the conferees actually meet on this subject.                              {time}  1400  The motion will basically instruct conferees to create a separate and independent Violence Against Women's Office in the Department of Justice headed by a director appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. I supported such an amendment in the House Committee on the Judiciary, but in response to concerns about this proposal, it was amended to permit the attorney general the discretion to put the office in the Office of Justice Programs so that the grant-making function of both offices could coordinate. The Department of Justice has testified it prefers the House provision, and is concerned about balkanizing the various grant making offices that currently exist in OJP.  Most would agree that the current organizational structure at OJP is in need of reform, and this administration is undertaking steps to streamline and improve the organization and administration of OJP. As a result of various authorizing statutes and funding mandates by Congress, and organizational decisions made by past attorneys general, OJP consists of five bureaus, sixprogram offices, and seven administrative offices. Each of the five bureaus is headed by a presidential appointee by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. This structure does not include the Office of Community Oriented Policing.  Some argue persuasively that mandating that there be a separate VAWA office will further complicate the current structure at DOJ and make it more dysfunctional. Furthermore, a completely separate office would require additional resources to support the administrative functions of the office. I have heard that a completely separate office would require $10- to $15 million in funding, which I presume would come out of VAWA program funds.  I want to repeat that because the consequence of establishing this office precisely as the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) is advocating might mean $10- to $15 million more in administrative expenses, and $10- to $15 million less in program, depending upon the decisions being made by the appropriators. I advise the gentlewoman that is a potential consequence of this motion.  I have discussed this matter with a number of Members and my constituents. The staff of the Committee on the Judiciary has met with Senator Biden's staff, the Senate Judiciary Committee staff, and various groups who support the creation of a separate office. As the conference proceeds, all of these viewpoints have and will continue to be heard, about I am confident a compromise can be reached.  The gentlewoman's motion says nothing about the coordination of grant-making functions of the new VAWA office with OJP. I can only assume that she would like to create a completely separate grant-making structure that does not have to coordinate with OJP, thereby siphoning program funds to pay for administrative infrastructure. A bigger bureaucracy is not necessarily better. Many would prefer to spend precious Federal dollars on combating violence against women instead of creating a new bureaucracy to implement the Violence Against Women Act.  Also, while the motion instructs conferees to include the provision of the House bill relating to the duties and functions of the director of the VAWA office, the motion says nothing about a similar provision found in section 403 of the Senate bill. I can only assume the gentlewoman wants it dropped.  To those who say that a separate office is needed to raise the profile of the director in these issues, I would direct them to the very language of the House bill which the motion would direct conferees to include. Under that language, the director of the VAWA office would serve as special counsel to the attorney general on the subject of violence against women. The director would work with the judicial branches of Federal and State governments on these issues. The director would serve at the request of the attorney general as the representative of the Department of Justice on task forces, committees and commissions addressing violence against women issues. The director would serve at the request of the President as the U.S. representative on these issues before international bodies.  The list goes on. I do not know what could be more high profile than designated in the statute that the director will be the point person in the Federal Government on issues relating to violence against women.  Mr. Speaker, I support the motion because it generally captures that which has already been agreed to and will allow the conferees to continue to work on these and other very important administrative and organizational issues.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), and congratulate her for all of her many years of fine work on this issue.
