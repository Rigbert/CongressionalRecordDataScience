Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that.  Will that continuing resolution be clean, from the gentleman's standpoint--that is to say, it will not include other items on it--or does the gentleman have any anticipation that other items might be included on that?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I am hoping he is asking this question so he will return and start voting for this. But in the past, that has been what we have done, the last two, and I don't see any change in what we are moving forward with now.
