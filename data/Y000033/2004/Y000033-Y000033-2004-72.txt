Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the amendments offered by my colleagues from New York.  The amendments that they have offered would significantly increase the likelihood a terrorist incident occurring outside of a major metropolitan area will have disastrous effects.  This funding is not solely intended for security to prevent a terror attack, but also for preparedness, in case an event happens.  Terrorism can happen anywhere. That is why we must be prepared everywhere.  Allocating these funds solely on the risk of terror is just robbing Peter to pay Paul. Large cities and metropolitan areas will be safe and prepared, but nobody else will.  We have heard a parade of members that would benefit from a risk of terrorism only allocation. If this allocation basis is adopted, and a terrorist attacks your community, what will you tell them, I'm sorry we weren't prepared, but it's okay, because a few big cities are?  Providing for a State minimum allocation is the only way to ensure that every community is prepared.  I urge all of my colleagues to think very carefully before supporting these amendments, and to think about what such an allocation would mean if they do not represent a large metropolitan area or have significant critical infrastructure. Most members of this body do not, and therefore most members' districts will not be prepared under this scheme.  The Transportation Committee has put forward a proposal that does not require this false choice, between providing for national preparedness and providing preparedness for a select few.  When this proposal is considered during the normal legislative process, I urge my colleagues to support this alternative, which prepares everyone for terror attacks.  Oppose these amendments that leave most communities unprepared for terror attacks.
