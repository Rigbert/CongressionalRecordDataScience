 Ostensibly we live in a democracy, and ostensibly it is the President of the United States and the House and the Senate that represent the American people, and presumably are elected to do the best that we can to represent the interests of the American people, and presumably are elected to do the best that we can to represent the interests of the American people. And one of the aspects of this whole bailout which bothers me very, very much, is that all over this country the American people know what a lemon it is. They know that with the $290 billion deficit, and with people in this body talking about cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and nutrition programs for the elderly and for the children, that it is absolutely insane to be talking about putting $40 billion of American taxpayers' money at risk in this bailout.  It is not often in my view, as the only Independent in the Congress, that actually the Congress hears the needs of the American people. But guess what? On this particular instance, the Congress, the Republicans, the Democrats, the Independent, heard what the American people were concerned about and made it very clear that the U.S. Congress was not going to support the Mexican bailout.  So some of us last night, we were saying hey, every once in a while we actually win a victory. It looks like we are going to win this particular fight.  But lo and behold, guess what? So what if many of the vast majority of the American people do not want the bailout? So what if the vast majority of Congress does not want the bailout? I guess the Wall Street Journal, the major corporations and the major banks in America do want it. So, hey, if it is between the American people and the Congress on one hand, and the corporate world and the banks on the other hand, which way are we going to do?  So what the President does, which is really disturbing, I would have been disturbed if Congress had voted for the bailout. But I could have lived with it, just as I had to live with NAFTA. But the idea that the President circumvented the Democratic process, pulled out some ancient, arcane law which ostensibly gave him the authority, is very, very disturbing. And I frankly think those of us in Congress who are concerned about this issue have got to deal with that statute and make some changes to it.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, I appreciate the gentleman's comments there. I think it is certainly time to review this statute. It is obviously time to get some clarification from the administration on exactly what authority they believe they do have. Are there no limits? We are now pledging $20 billion to Mexico. Is there no limit? What if the $20 billion is not enough? Credible analysts came before our hearing, unlike the playacting hearing put on by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, but a hearing where we invited people who had differing views from the administration and the bailout artists, and said ``No. $40 billion will not be enough. Mexico is such a basket case, if you are going to tie the U.S. dollar to the Mexican peso, you better be prepared to defend the U.S. dollar against a run by the Japanese and the Germans and others, because they do not think this is a very smart thing to do.'' They said, ``You can expect to be talking about $150 billion, not $40 billion dollars.''  So this stabilization fund, will the President next week announce that well, the $20 billion was not enough, and now we are going to go for another $50 billion or $100 billion?                              {time}  2120  Where does this money come from? As you said, we have a $200 billion deficit, where does this money come from?
