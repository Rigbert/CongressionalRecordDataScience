Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, W. Ken Massengill. On Saturday, June 5, 1999, Mr. Massengill, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement from United Steelworkers of America (USWA), District 7. The celebration will take place at St. Elijah Serbian-American Hall in Merrillville, Indiana.  Ken Massengill has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to the betterment of union members and the community of Northwest Indiana, as well as the entire state.  Mr. Massengill's distinguished career in the labor movement has made his community, state, and nation a better place in which to live and work. For more than twenty-five years, Mr. Massengill has served as an important figure as a member of the United Steel Workers of America. He has held several positions throughout his tenure, but none as important as Assistant Director of District 7, USWA, a position from which he retired in February of 1999.  As a union representative, Ken Massengill has held a variety of offices, ranging from union steward to Sub-District Director. In addition to his service to the union, he has devoted much of his time to community initiatives. Some of the activities Mr. Massengill has been involved with include: board member for both the Porter County and Michigan City United Way, Chairman of the Lake Area United Way Board of Trustees, member of the Indiana University Labor Studies Advisory Board, and President of the Indiana Unemployment Insurance Board. Additionally, he serves as the Indiana Steelworkers PEC Legislative Director, PAC Coordinator, and in 1994 was appointed by Former Governor Evan Bayh to the Indiana Port Commission where he currently served as the Chairman of the Port Commission.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Ken Massengill. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made.His work in the labor movement provided union workers in Northwest Indiana opportunities they might not have otherwise had. Mr. Massengill's leadership kept the region's labor force strong and helped keep America working. Those in the movement will surely miss Mr. Massengill's dedication and sincerity. I sincerely wish Ken Massengill a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
