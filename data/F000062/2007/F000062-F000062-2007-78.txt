 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 96, S. 223, a bill to require Senate candidates to file designations, statements, and reports in electronic forms; that the committee-reported amendment be considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action.
