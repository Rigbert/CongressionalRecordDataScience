Chairman, I just wanted to say to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) that I fully support her efforts. I think she has raised an exceedingly important issue for our country. Without question, the nutrition of our children will yield the health of the future generation. The high use of sugar and high fats in the diets of our youth are creating an untenable, extremely unhealthy situation in this country that even the Surgeon General has recognized.  One of the hardest challenges we face within the U.S. Department of Agriculture is to get the nutrition part of the agency, which has over half of its budget, to talk to the production side, which is the part the gentlewoman is talking about. That is producers, organic producers, small farmers, must be linked to our local school districts. This has been a tough job.  I really support the gentlewoman on her efforts. Her goals of helping our children, I think, are commendable and also getting the Department of Agriculture to see its responsibilities toward our youth by working with farmers who can provide that fresh product in fruits and vegetables, with ethnic and racial sensitivity at the most local of levels, which is where we all live.  So I look forward to working with the gentlewoman as we move the bill in the other body and hopefully we can strengthen this measure as we move forward. I thank the gentlewoman so very much for bringing up this very important issue today.
