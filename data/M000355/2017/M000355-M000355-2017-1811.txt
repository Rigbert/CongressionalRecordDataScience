 President, ``Now is the time to put country before party.'' That was an observation by the Democratic leader just yesterday on the Senate floor. Our friend from New York makes a good point, and I am hopeful it is a principle his own caucus will follow in the days to come.  We are no longer in the midst of a contentious Presidential election. We have a new President, and that President has now put forth an exceptional Supreme Court nominee and a number of well-qualified Cabinet nominees. Yet, more than 2 weeks into his term, President Trump has the fewest Cabinet Secretaries confirmed at this point than any other President since George Washington.
