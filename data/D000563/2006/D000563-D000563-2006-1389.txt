President, only a little over an hour ago, Lane Evans announced he would not seek reelection in November to the U.S. House of Representatives. I understand his decision. It is a loss for his district, for our State, and for America. From the Quad Cities to Quincy, Springfield, Decatur, Carlinville, and towns in between, Lane Evans is deeply respected and his service will be deeply missed.  For over 20 years, Lane Evans has stood as a beacon of hope and has been a strong voice in his Illinois congressional district.
