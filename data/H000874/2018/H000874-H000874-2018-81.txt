 Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I asked the gentleman to yield because I just think the Record needs to be corrected.  The gentleman knows, Mr. Speaker, that we brought two immigration bills to this floor that would solve the problem. The gentleman also knows there was an executive order signed that stopped this action being taken before this even went forward.  But I also heard the gentleman say that he voted ``present'' because he didn't want the ICE agents to think he didn't support them, and that he supported those things in the resolved. Prior, he said that is why he voted against it.  I read what was in the resolved. I don't understand how anybody in America looks at voting ``present'' with an idea you support it. That is the only thing that I question.  Now, the gentleman also knows that this is the most productive Congress in modern history. It has passed more bills out of committee than any Congress in the last 25 years. It has passed more bills in this Chamber than any one in the last 25 years. He sees the openness to the number of amendments; and it is not just the number of amendments to Republicans because there are hundreds upon hundreds for Democrats.  The gentleman also knows that the immigration bills that came to this floor had an opportunity. But what is interesting to me is that people want just one that they can support.  Earlier, I heard he voted against CHIP because it was in the omni, but CHIP was on the floor by itself and he voted against it then.  He can vote for the post office bills and that didn't deal with the immigration either, but he can vote for that. But then when it came to supporting ICE, the majority of Democrats voted ``present.'' That is not a profile in courage. That is walking away from a situation.
