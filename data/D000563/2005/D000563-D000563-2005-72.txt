I think it still will work.  The second question I ask the Senator is this: Here is the choice we have. The PATRIOT Act can expire on December 31 of this year or it can be extended at least 90 days by a request being made on the floor. Does the Senator from Arizona think it is better for the PATRIOT Act to expire December 31 than to extend it 90 days?
