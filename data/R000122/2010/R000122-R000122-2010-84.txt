President, first, let me join Majority Leader Reid in saluting these incredible Americans who are with us today, wounded warriors and Bob O'Malley. As someone who served 12 years in the U.S. Army, my appreciation is profound for what you have done and continue to do. Thank you very much.  I have a circuitous connection with the 10th Mountain Division. My classmate, Buster Hagenbeck, commanded the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan, and I was there to visit those great soldiers several times. Thank you for your service and thank you for your inspiration.                          ____________________
