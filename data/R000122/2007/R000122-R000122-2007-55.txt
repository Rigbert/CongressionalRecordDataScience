President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007.  This important legislation, which I helped craft as a member of the Senate Education Committee and as a conferee, will make a substantial Federal investment in need-based grant aid for low-income students, and will significantly help middle-class students and families pay down and manage their loan debt.  Under this bill, the maximum Pell grant for eligible students will be increased by $500 next year and to $5,400 by 2012. This means that Rhode Island students will receive $7.8 million in additional grant aid next year and nearly $85 million over the next 5 years, increasing the average Pell grant in Rhode Island by $360 in 2008 to $2,880.  H.R. 2669 also includes provisions to stem the increasing numbers of middle-class families falling further into debt to finance a college education. As such, this bill phases in a lower interest rate on new subsidized Stafford loans to undergraduate students, reducing the rate in half over 4 years on such loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent; helps students manage their debt by capping monthly Federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income; and provides loan forgiveness for borrowers who continue in public service careers for 10 years, including nurses, teachers, and librarians.  I am especially pleased that this legislation includes provisions from my FAFSA Act--S. 939--to increase the income level at which a student is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell grant, ensuring that all students from families with incomes of $30,000 or less receive the maximum Pell grant. This automatic-eligibility level would also be tied to the Consumer Price Index to ensure that the benefit keeps pace with inflation and does not become diluted.
