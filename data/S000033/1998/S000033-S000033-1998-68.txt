 Chairman, my amendment sponsored by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey) and the gentlewoman fromFlorida (Mrs. Fowler) is very simple and straightforward. It bans the Department of Defense from buying products from Chinese state-owned companies as well as companies owned by the People's Liberation Army.  Mr. Chairman, I think that it might come as a surprise to many Members of this body that the Defense Department now builds the B-2 bomber with parts made by a company owned by the People's Republic of China.
