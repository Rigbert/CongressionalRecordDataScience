Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the retirement of a dedicated community leader in our district, Susan LeCron. She is retiring after 20 years of service to the Toledo Botanical Gardens. Under her leadership as executive director, the Toledo Botanical Gardens has truly flourished. Her able hand has guided the gardens from 20 acres and a groundskeeper to a 60-acre nationally designated botanical garden, a staff of more than 30, and a budget which is 20 times greater than at the beginning of her tenure.  Although she is proudest of the gardens' children's programs, Susan's leadership hasbrought lustre to the Toledo Botanical Gardens: the creation of a master plan, a successful $2.2 million capital campaign, the construction of a pond system, shade and perennial gardens, a new maintenance facility, a greenhouse, the addition of 19-resident organizations, and the planting of the grand allee which leads to the doors of the future visitors center. Her dedicated perseverance and commitment to the growth of the Toledo Botanical Gardens has made it a premiere attraction of northwest Ohio.  Susan LeCron is a true community advocate and horticulturist. Her work and her vision are preserving a gift for our future. We thank her, wish her well, and know nature always will shower her legacy with splendor.                          ____________________
