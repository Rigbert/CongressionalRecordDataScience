. 2614 is a relatively modest, yet important step towards meeting the long-term water needs for the West. Water recycling is an approach that more and more communities are tapping to meet local and regional water demand. To address the continued growth of water users, communities are truly maximizing the use of every drop of water.  H.R. 2614 authorizes Federal participation in conjunction with two water reclamation projects, one located in my congressional district and one located in the 41st Congressional District of California. Both projects are located in the greater Inland Empire, a region heavily dependent on imported sources of water.  The City of Corona Water Recycling and Reuse Project will enable the city of Corona to provide recycled water to parks, landscape maintenance districts, schools, landscaped freeway frontages and any other project that does not require potable water. The project will also reduce the need for increased water imports and construction of additional drinking water infrastructure.  The project will consist of three reservoirs and two pump stations along with retrofitted user irrigation systems. Additionally, 27 miles of pipelines are needed since recycled water is required to be kept completely separate from drinking water and uses a dedicated system of pipelines. The city plans to retrofit approximately 200 sites including schools, public parks and landscape areas, freeway landscaping, golf courses, and commercial landscaping.  The Yucaipa Valley Water Supply Renewal Project will maximize the various water resources in the Yucaipa Valley. The new facility will contain an advanced filtration (reverse osmosis) system and a brine pipeline to remove salinity, contaminants, and organic compounds from the water supply in the Yucaipa Valley. The brine pipeline will extend nearly 20 miles to the existing Santa Ana Regional Interceptor brine pipeline.  The completed project will minimize the amount of water imported from northern California, maximize the use of higher quality water, reduce withdrawals from ground water supplies, and provide a long-term, drought-proof water supply. The full project is expected to reduce demands on the California State Water Project by over 4 billion gallons per year, which is a sufficient quantity of water for 27,000 families of four each year.  I want to thank the city of Corona and city of Yucaipa for developing innovative, water-saving projects that truly benefit our entire region. I also want to thank my good friend Grace Napolitano, the Chairwoman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, for her leadership and support of my legislation. I know she shares my belief that water recycling is an important tool in addressing growing water needs in the West. Madam Speaker, I think it is crucial that we recognize and assist communities that are working to reduce their reliance on imported water and I urge all colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 2614.                          ____________________
