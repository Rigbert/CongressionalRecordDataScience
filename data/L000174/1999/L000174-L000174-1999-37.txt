President, Vermonters have a proud tradition of protecting our environment. We have some of the strongest environmental laws in the country. Yet despite this proud tradition of environmental stewardship, we have seen how pollution from outside our state has affected our mountains, lakes and streams. Acid rain caused from sulfur dioxide emissions outside Vermont has drifted through the atmosphere and scarred our mountains and poisoned our streams. Mercury has quietly made its deadly poisonous presence into the food chain of our fish to the point where health advisories have been posted for the consumption of several species. And, despite our own tough air laws and small population, the EPA has considered air quality warnings in Vermont that are comparable to emissions consistent for much larger cities. Silently each night, pollution from outside Vermont seeps into our state, and our exemplary and forward-looking environmental laws are powerless to stop or even limit the encroachment.  The Clean Air Act of 1970 was a milestone law which established national air quality standards for the first time and attempted to provide protection for populations who are affected by emissions outside their own local and state control. That bill did much to halt declining air quality around the country and improve it in some areas. It also acknowledged that fossil fuel utility plants contribute a significant amount of air pollution not only in the area immediately around the plant but can affect air quality hundreds of miles away.  While the bill has improved air quality, changes in the utility market since passage of the Clean Air Act make it necessary to consider important updates to the legislation. States throughout the country are deregulating utilities and soon Congress may consider federal legislation on this issue. I support these economic changes but Congress and the Administration should keep pace with this changing market. Breaking down the barriers of a regulated utility market can have important economic consequences for utility customers. More competition will drive down prices. But these lower costs will come with a price--the cheapest power is unfortunately produced by some of the dirtiest power plants. Most of these power plants were grandfathered under the Clean Air Act.  So today I am introducing the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act'' to address the local, regional, and global air pollution problems that are posed by fossil-fired power plants under a deregulated market.  In the last few weeks, the EPA and the Administration have taken some important steps to address the power plant loophole in the Clean Air Act that allows hundreds of old, mostly coal-fired power plants to continue to pollute at levels much higher than new plants. Closing this loophole is critical to protecting the health of our environment and the health of our children.  Last week the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency filed suit against 32 coal-fired power plants who had made major changes to their plants without also installing new equipment to control smog, acid rain and soot. This is illegal, even under the Clean Air Act, and it spotlights the glaring need to level the playing field for all power plants. This is particularly as our country moves toward a deregulated electricity industry.  Unfortunately, some of our colleagues decided that this move unfairly targeted some of their utilities that have benefitted from this loophole for almost thirty years. I would point out that many of us from New England and New York believe it is unfair that our states have been the dumping ground for the pollution coming out of these plants for the past thirty years. My colleagues have heard me speak on the floor about how this pollution is contaminating our fish with mercury, damaging our lakes and forests with acid rain, and causing respiratory problems and obscuring the view of Vermont's mountains with summertime ozone pollution from nitrogen oxide emissions.  Now, added to these concerns is the growing body of knowledge showing that carbon dioxide emissions are having an impact on the global climate. More than a decade of record heat, reports from around the globe of dying coral reefs, and melting glaciers should be warning signals to all of us.  In Vermont, one of our warning signals is the impact to sugar maples. Sugar maple now range naturally as far south as Tennessee and west of the Mississippi River from Minnesota to Missouri. Given the current predictions for climate changes, by the end of the next century the range of sugar maples in North America will be limited the state of Maine and portions of eastern Canada. Vermont's climate may notchange so much that palm trees will line the streets of Burlington and Montpelier, but the impact on the character and economy of Vermont and many other states will be profound.  It is hard to imagine a Vermont hillside in the fall without the brilliant reds of the sugar maples, and it is hard to imagine a stack of pancakes without Vermont maple syrup. And it is unlikely that sugar maples will be the only species or crop that will be affected by climate change, or that the effects will be limited to Vermont. Many like to dismiss concerns about pollution from power plants as a ``Northeastern issue.'' It is not; it affects all of us, perhaps in ways that we have not even begun to imagine.  I can show you maps that mark the deposition ``hot spots'' for these pollutants in the Everglades, the Upper Midwest, New England, Long Island Sound, Chesapeake Bay and the West Coast. This clearly is not a regional issue. Collectively, fossil fuel-fired power plants constitute the largest source of air pollution in the United States, annually emitting more than 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, more than 12 million tons of acid rain producing sulfur dioxide, nearly 6 million tons of smog producing nitrogen oxides, and more than 50 tons of highly toxic mercury.  These are staggering sums. Consider the fact that it would take nearly 25,000 Washington Monuments, weighing 81,120 tons apiece, to add up to 2 billion tons. And that is just one year.  Why are we continuing to allow pollutants on that enormous scale to be dumped on some of our most fragile ecosystems, much less into our lungs through the air we breathe? It is because Congress assumed when it passed the 1970 Clean Air Act that these old pollution-prone plants would be retired over time and replaced by newer, cleaner plants. It has not worked out that way, and it is time for the Congress to rethink our strategy.  More than 75 percent of the fossil-fuel fired plants in the United States began operation before the 1970 Clean Air Act was passed. As a result, they are ``grandfathered'' out from under the full force of its regulations. Many of the environmental problems posed by this industry are linked to the antiquated and inefficient technologies at these plants. The average fossil-fuel fired power plant uses combustion technology devised in the 1950's or before. Would any of us buy a car today that was still using 1950s technology? Of course not. So why are we still going out of our way to preserve 1950s technology for power plants?  As long as we allow these plants to operate inefficiently they will produce enormous amounts of air pollution. My bill takes a new approach to reducing this pollution by retiring the inefficient ``grandfathered'' power plants and bring new, clean, and efficient technologies for the 21st Century on line.  Obviously, major changes in this industry will not occur over night. The ``continue-business-as-usual'' inertia is enormous. The old, inefficient, pollution-prone power plants will operate until they fall down because they are paid for, burn the cheapest fuel, and are subject to much less stringent environmental requirements. ``Grandfathered'' plants have the statutory equivalent of an eternal lifetime under the Clean Air Act loophole.  Mr. President, this article in Forbes Magazine describes how valuable the old ``grandfathered'' power plants are. The article cites the example of the ``grandfathered'' Homer City generating station outside of Pittsburgh. Until last year, the utility valued this plant at $540 million. According to the Forbes article, last year the utility sold the plant for $1.8 billion. That works out to $955 per kilowatt of generating capacity, or about the cost of building a new plant. Why are these old pollution-prone plants suddenly so valuable? Maybe their ``grandfathered'' status has something to do with it.  What does my bill propose to do? First, it closes the ``grandfather'' loophole. Second, it lays out an aggressive but achievable set of air pollution and efficiency requirements for fossil-fired power plants. Third, the emissions standards will allow clean coal technologies to have a fair chance to compete in the future mix of electrical power generation. Fourth, it provides industry decision-makers with a comprehensive and predictable set of regulatory requirements and tax code changes so they can see up-front what the playing field is going to look like in the future. This will allow them to make informed, comprehensive, and economically efficient business decisions. Public health and the environment will benefit, consumers will benefit, and the utility companies will benefit from this approach.  As U.S. power plants become more efficient and more power is produced by renewable technologies, less fossil fuel will be consumed. This will have an impact on the workers and communities that produce fossil fuels. These effects are likely to be greatest for coal, even with significant deployment of clean coal technology. The bill provides funding for programs to help workers and communities during the period of transition. I am eager to work with organized labor to ensure that these provisions address the needs of workers, particularly those who may not fully benefit from retraining programs.  The bill provides substantial additional funding for research, development, and commercial demonstrations of renewable and clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, and fuel cells. As utilities retire their ``grandfathered'' plants and plan for future generating capacity, renewable and clean technologies need to be part of the equation. My bill also authorizes expenditures for implementing known ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere such as planting trees, preserving wetlands, and soil restoration.  How will the environment benefit from the emission and efficiency standards in my bill? Mercury emissions will be cut from more than 50 tons per year to no more than 5 tons per year. Annual emissions of sulfur dioxide that causes acid rain will be cut by more than 6 million tons beyond the requirements in Phase II of the Clean Air Act of 1990. Nitrogen oxide emissions that result in summertime ozone pollution will be cut by more than 3 million tons per year beyond Phase II requirements. And the bill would prevent at least 650 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.  Of course, this discussion should not just be about the impact to our environment. This debate should equally be focused on public health. There is mounting evidence of the health effects of these pollutants. The Washington Post Magazine ran an alarming article that documented the escalating number of children with asthma, jumping to 17.3 million in 1998 from 6.8 million in 1980. Asthma may not be caused directly by air pollution, but it certainly aggravates it and can lead to premature deaths.  The American public still overwhelmingly supports the commitment to the environment that we made in the early 1970s. As stewards of the environment for our children and our grandchildren, we need to act without delay to ensure that in the new millennium the United States produces electricity more efficiently and with much less environmental and public health impact. There is no reason why we should go into the next century still using technology from the era of Ozzie and Harriet.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section overview of the bill, and an article entitled ``Poor Me'' from the May 31, 1999, edition of Forbes Magazine, be printed in the Record.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the United States is relying increasingly on old,      needlessly inefficient, and highly polluting powerplants to      provide electricity;       (2) the pollution from those powerplants causes a wide      range of health and environmental damage, including--       (A) fine particulate matter that is associated with the      deaths of approximately 50,000 Americans annually;       (B) urban ozone, commonly known as ``smog'', that impairs      normal respiratory functions and is of special concern to      individuals afflicted with asthma, emphysema, and other      respiratory ailments;       (C) rural ozone that obscures visibility and damages      forests and wildlife;       (D) acid deposition that damages estuaries, lakes, rivers,      and streams (and the plants and animals that depend on them      for survival) and leaches heavy metals from the soil;       (E) mercury and heavy metal contamination that renders fish      unsafe to eat, with especially serious consequences for      pregnant women and their fetuses;       (F) eutrophication of estuaries, lakes, rivers, and      streams; and       (G) global climate change that may fundamentally and      irreversibly alter human, animal, and plant life;       (3) tax laws and environmental laws--       (A) provide a very strong incentive for electric utilities      to keep old, dirty, and inefficient generating units in      operation; and       (B) provide a strong disincentive to investing in new,      clean, and efficient generating technologies;       (4) fossil fuel-fired power plants, consisting of plants      fueled by coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, produce nearly      two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States;       (5) since, according to the Department of Energy, the      average combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil fuel-fired      power plants in the United States is 33 percent, 67 percent      of the heat generated by burning the fuel is wasted;       (6) technology exists to increase the combustion heat rate      efficiency of coal combustion from 35 percent to 50 percent      above current levels, and technological advances are possible      that would boost the net combustion heat rate efficiency even      more;       (7) coal-fired power plants are the leading source of      mercury emissions in the United States, releasing an      estimated 52 tons of this potent neurotoxin each year;       (8) in 1996, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United      States produced over 2,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide,      the primary greenhouse gas;       (9) on average--       (A) fossil fuel-fired power plants emit 1,999 pounds of      carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity      produced;       (B) coal-fired power plants emit 2,110 pounds of carbon      dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity produced; and       (C) coal-fired power plants emit 205 pounds of carbon      dioxide for every million British thermal units of fuel      consumed;       (10) the average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the      United States commenced operation in 1964, 6 years before the      Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was amended to      establish requirements for stationary sources;       (11)(A) according to the Department of Energy, only 23      percent of the 1,000 largest emitting units are subject to      stringent new source performance standards under section 111      of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411); and       (B) the remaining 77 percent, commonly referred to as      ``grandfathered'' power plants, are subject to much less      stringent requirements;       (12) on the basis of scientific and medical evidence,      exposure to mercury and mercury compounds is of concern to      human health and the environment;       (13) pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women of      childbearing age, and children are most at risk for mercury-     related health impacts such as neurotoxicity;       (14) although exposure to mercury and mercury compounds      occurs most frequently through consumption of mercury-     contaminated fish, such exposure can also occur through--       (A) ingestion of breast milk;       (B) ingestion of drinking water, and foods other than fish,      that are contaminated with methyl mercury; and       (C) dermal uptake through contact with soil and water;       (15) the report entitled ``Mercury Study Report to      Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental Protection      Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42      U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), in conjunction with other scientific      knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury      emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil fuels and      mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and sediments;       (16)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report      described in paragraph (15) supports a plausible link between      mercury emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil      fuels and methyl mercury concentrations in freshwater fish;       (B) in 1997, 39 States issued health advisories that warned      the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared      to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993; and       (C) the number of mercury advisories nationwide increased      from 899 in 1993 to 1,675 in 1996, an increase of 86 percent;       (17) pollution from powerplants can be reduced through      adoption of modern technologies and practices, including--       (A) methods of combusting coal that are intrinsically more      efficient and less polluting, such as pressurized fluidized      bed combustion and an integrated gasification combined cycle      system;       (B) methods of combusting cleaner fuels, such as gases from      fossil and biological resources and combined cycle turbines;       (C) treating flue gases through application of pollution      controls;       (D) methods of extracting energy from natural, renewable      resources of energy, such as solar and wind sources;       (E) methods of producing electricity and thermal energy      from fuels without conventional combustion, such as fuel      cells; and       (F) combined heat and power methods of extracting and using      heat that would otherwise be wasted, for the purpose of      heating or cooling office buildings, providing steam to      processing facilities, or otherwise increasing total      efficiency; and       (18) adopting the technologies and practices described in      paragraph (17) would increase competitiveness and      productivity, secure employment, save lives, and preserve the      future.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to protect and preserve the environment while      safeguarding health by ensuring that each fossil fuel-fired      generating unit minimizes air pollution to levels that are      technologically feasible through modernization and      application of pollution controls;       (2) to greatly reduce the quantities of mercury, carbon      dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides entering the      environment from combustion of fossil fuels;       (3) to permanently reduce emissions of those pollutants by      increasing the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil      fuel-fired generating units to levels achievable through--       (A) use of commercially available combustion technology,      including clean coal technologies such as pressurized      fluidized bed combustion and an integrated gasification      combined cycle system;       (B) installation of pollution controls;       (C) expanded use of renewable and clean energy sources such      as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells; and       (D) promotion of application of combined heat and power      technologies;       (4)(A) to create financial and regulatory incentives to      retire thermally inefficient generating units and replace      them with new units that employ high-thermal-efficiency      combustion technology; and       (B) to increase use of renewable and clean energy sources      such as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells;       (5) to establish the Clean Air Trust Fund to fund the      training, economic development, carbon sequestration, and      research, development, and demonstration programs established      under this Act;       (6) to eliminate the ``grandfather'' loophole in the Clean      Air Act relating to sources in operation before the      promulgation of standards under section 111 of that Act (42      U.S.C. 7411);       (7) to express the sense of Congress that permanent      reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases that are      accomplished through the retirement of old units and      replacement by new units that meet the combustion heat rate      efficiency and emission standards specified in this Act      should be credited to the utility sector and the owner or      operator in any climate change implementation program;       (8) to promote permanent and safe disposal of mercury      recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control systems,      and other methods of mercury pollution control;       (9) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury      exposure and the threat to public health from mercury,      particularly the threat to the health of pregnant women and      their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and children;       (10) to decrease significantly the threat to human health      and the environment posed by mercury;       (11) to provide worker retraining for workers adversely      affected by reduced consumption of coal; and       (12) to provide economic development incentives for      communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of      coal.

Section-by-Section Overview of ``The Clean Power Plant and                       Modernization Act of 1999'' What will the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1999'' do?       The ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1999''      lays out an ambitious, achievable, and balanced set of      financial incentives and regulatory requirements designed to      increase power plant efficiency, reduce emissions, and      encourage use of renewable power generation methods. The bill      encourages innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking.       The bill encourages ``retirement and replacement'' of old,      pollution-prone, and inefficient generating capacity with      new, clean, and efficient capacity. The bill does not utilize      a ``cap and trade'' approach. Many believe that the      ``retirement and replacement'' approach does a superior job      at the local and regional levels of protecting public health      and the environment from mercury pollution, ozone pollution,      and acid deposition. On a global level, the ``retirement and      replacement'' also does a far superior job of permanently      reducing the volume of carbon dioxide emitted.               What will the bill do for the environment?       The bill would prevent at least 650 million tons of carbon      dioxide emissions per year. Over time, even more greenhouse      gas emissions will be avoided annually as increases in power      plant efficiencies exceed 50%, more combined heat and power      systems are installed, and use of renewable energy sources      increases. Prevention of greenhouse gas emissions of up to 1      billion tons per year may be possible. Mercury emissions will      be cut from more than 50 tons per year to no more than 5 tons      per year. Annual emissions of acid rain producing sulfur      dioxide emissions will be cut by more than 6 million tons      beyond Phase II Clean Air Act of 1990 requirements. Nitrogen      oxide emissions that result in summertime ozone pollution      will be cut by 3.2 million tons per year beyond Phase II      requirements.       Over a 50 year period, the proposal laid out in the bill      will prevent more than 30 billion tons in carbon dioxide      emissions, and maybe as high as 50 billion tons. Carbon      dioxide is further addressed in the bill by authorizing      expenditures for implementing known ways of biologically      sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere such as      planting trees, preserving wetlands, and soil restoration.       Over a 50 year period, more than 2,200 tons of mercury      emissions would be avoided. While this might not sound like a      lot in relation to the other pollutants, consider that a      teaspoon of mercury is enough to contaminate several millions      of gallons of water. And over a 50 year period more than 300      million tons of sulfur dioxide and 160 million tons of      nitrogen oxides will be prevented beyond the Phase II      emission limits specified in the Clean Air Act of 1990.     Section 1. Title; table of contents     Section 2. Findings and purposes     Section 3. Definitions     Section 4. Heat rate efficiency standards for fossil fuel-         fired generating units       On average, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United      States operate at a thermal efficiency rate of 33%,      converting just one-third of the energy in the fuel to      electricity, and wasting 67% of the heat generated by burning      the fuel. Increasing efficiency in converting the energy in      the fuel into electricity is really the only way to reduce      carbon dioxide ``greenhouse'' emissions from these      facilities. According to the Energy Information      Administration, fossil-fired power plants in the United      States emit more the 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide per      year (or the weight equivalent of nearly 25,000 Washington      Monuments every year). This is approximately 40% of annual      domestic carbon dioxide emissions.       Section 4 lays out a phased two-stage process for      increasing efficiency. In the first stage, by 10 years after      enactment, all units in operation must achieve a heat rate      efficiency (at the higher heating value) of not less than      45%. In the second stage, with expected advances in      combustion technology, units commencing operation more than      10 years after enactment must achieve a heat rate efficiency      (at the higher heating value) of not less than 50%.       If, for some unforeseen reason, technological advances do      not achieve the 50% efficiency level, Section 4 contains a      waiver provision that allows owners of new units to offset      any shortfall in carbon dioxide emissions through      implementation of carbon sequestration projects.     Section 5. Air emission standards for fossil fuel-fired          generating units       Subsection (a) eliminates the ``grandfather'' loophole in      the Clean Air Act and requires all units, regardless of when      they were constructed or began operation, to comply with      existing new source review requirements under Section 111 of      the Clean Air Act. The average ``in service'' date for      fossil-fired generating units in the United States is 1964--     six years before passage of the Clean Air Act. More than 75%      of operating fossil-fired generating units came into service      before implementation of the 1970 Clean Air Act and are      subject to much less stringent requirements than newer units.       Subsection (b) sets mercury, carbon dioxide, sulfur      dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emission standards for units that      are subject to the 45% thermal efficiency standards set forth      in Section 4. For mercury, 90% removal of mercury contained      in the fuel is required. For carbon dioxide, the emission      limits are set by fuel type (i.e., natural gas = 0.9 pounds      per kilowatt hour of output; fuel oil = 1.3 pounds per      kilowatt hour of output; coal = 1.55 pounds per kilowatt hour      of output). Ninety-five percent of sulfur dioxide emissions      (and not more than 0.3 pounds per million Btus of fuel      consumed), and 90 percent of nitrogen oxides (and not more      than 0.15 pounds per million Btus of fuel consumed) are to be      removed.       Subsection (c) contains the same emission standards for      mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides as those in      Subsection (b). Increased thermal efficiency will result in      lower emissions of carbon dioxide, and the fuel specific      emission limits at the 50% efficiency level are lowered      accordingly (i.e., natural gas = 0.8 pounds per kilowatt hour      of output; fuel oil = 1.2 pounds per kilowatt hour of output;      coal = 1.4 pounds per kilowatt hour of output).       Furthering the public's right-to-know information on      emission volumes, Subsection (e) requires EPA to annually      publish pollutant-specific emissions data for each generating      unit covered by the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act      of 1999.'' In addition, at least once per year residential      consumers will receive information from their electricity      supplier on the emission volumes.     Section 6. Extension of renewable energy production credit       Section 45(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is      amended to include solar power,     and to extend renewable energy production credit to 2010 (it      is currently set to expire in 1999).     Section 7. Mega watt hour generation fee, and     Section 8. Clean air trust fund       The Clean Air Trust Fund is similar to the Highway Trust      Fund and the Superfund. Revenue for the Clean Air Trust Fund      will be provided through implementation of a fee on      electricity produced by fossil-fired generating units that      are ``grandfathered'' from the Clean Air Act's Section 111      new source requirements. Utilities will be assessed at the      rate of 30 cents per megawatt hour of electricity that they      produce from ``grandfathered'' units. For residential      consumers receiving power from ``grandfathered'' plants, the      cost of the fee would average 25 cents per month. Income from      the fee will be placed in the Clean Air Trust Fund to pay      for: a.) assistance to workers and communities adversely      affected by reduced consumption of coal; b.) research and      development and demonstration programs for renewable and      clean power generation technologies (e.g., wind, solar,      biomass, and fuel cells); c) demonstrations of the      efficiency, environmental benefits, and commercial viability      of electrical power generation from clean coal, advanced gas,      and combined heat and power technologies; and d.) carbon      sequestration projects.     Section 9. Accelerated depreciation for investor-owned          generating units.       Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, utilities can      depreciate their generating equipment over a 20-year period.      New, cleaner and efficient generating technologies will      experience shorter physical lifetimes compared to their      dirtier, less efficient, but more durable predecessors. Over      a 20-year timeframe, most components of new generating units      will need to be replaced; some components will be replaced      several times. To update the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to      reflect this change in the expected physical lifetimes of      generating equipment, Section 9 amends Section 168 of the      Code to allow depreciation over a 15-year period for units      meeting the 45% efficiency level and the emission standards      in Section 5(b) above. Section 168 is further amended to      allow for deprecation over a 12-year period for units      meeting the 50% efficiency level and the emission      standards in Section 5(c).     Section 10. Grants for publicly-owned generating units.       No federal taxes are paid on publicly-owned generating      units. Section 10 provides for annual grants in an amount      equal to the monetary value of the depreciation deduction      that would be realized by a similarly-situated investor owned      generating unit under Section 9. Units meeting the 45%      efficiency level and the emission standards in Section 5(b)      above would receive annual grants over a 15-year period, and      units meeting the 50% efficiency level and the emission      standards in Section 5(c) would receive annual grants over a      12-year period.     Section 11. Recognition of permanent emission reductions in          future climate change implementation programs.       This section expresses the sense of Congress that permanent      reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides      that are accomplished through the retirement of old      generating units and replacement by new generating units that      meet the efficiency and emissions standards in the bill, or      through replacement with non polluting renewable power      generation technologies, should be credited to the utility      sector and to the owner/operator in any climate change      implementation program enacted by Congress. The base year for      calculating reductions will be the year preceding enactment      of the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1999.''      The bill stipulates that a portion of any monetary value that      may accrue from credits under this section should be passed      on to utility customers.     Section 12. Renewable and clean power generation          technologies.  This section provides a total of $750 million over 10 years to fund research and development programs and commercial demonstration projects and partnerships to demonstrate the commercial viability and environmental benefits of electric power generation from biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cell technologies. Types of projects may include solar power tower plants, solar dishes and engines, co-firing biomass with coal, biomass modular systems, next-generation wind turbines and wind verification projects, geothermal energy conversion, and fuel cells.     Section 13. Clean coal, advanced gas turbine, and combined          heat and power generation demonstration program.       This section provides a total of $750 million over 10 years      to fund projects and partnerships that demonstrate the      efficiency and environmental benefits and commercial      viability of electric power generation from clean coal      technologies (including, but not limited to, pressurized      fluidized bed combustion and integrated gasification combined      cycle systems), advanced gas turbine technologies (including,      but not limited to, flexible mid-sized gas turbines and      baseload utility scale applications), and combined heat and      power technologies.     Section 14. Evaluation of implementation of this act and          other statutes       Not later than 2 years after enactment, DOE, in      consultation with EPA and FERC, shall report to Congress on      the implementation of the ``Clean Power Plant and      Modernization Act of 1999.'' The report shall identify any      provision of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Energy Supply      and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, the Public      Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, or the Powerplant      and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 that conflicts with the      efficient implementation of the ``Clean Power Plant and      Modernization Act of 1999.'' The report shall include      recommendations for legislative or administrative measures to      harmonize and streamline these other statutes.     Section 15. Assistance for workers adversely affected by          reduced consumption of coal       With increased power plant efficiency, less fuel will need      to be burned to produce a given quantity of electricity. This      section provides a total of $1.125 billion over 15 years ($75      million per year) to provide assistance to workers who are      adversely affected as a result of reduced consumption of coal      by the electric power generation industry. The funds will be      administered under the economic dislocation and workers'      adjustment assistance program of the Department of Labor      authorized by Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act.     Section 16. Community economic development incentives for          communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of          coal       With increased power plant efficiency, less fuel will need      to be burned to produce a given quantity of electricity. This      section provides a total of $1.125 billion over 15 years ($75      million per year) to provide assistance to communities      adversely affected as a result of reduced consumption of coal      by the electric power generation industry. The funds will be      administered under the economic adjustment program of the      Department of Commerce authorized by the Public Works and      Economic Development Act of 1965.     Section 17. Carbon sequestration       This section authorizes expenditure of $345 million over 10      years for development of a long-term carbon sequestration      strategy ($45 million) for the United States, and authorizes      EPA and USDA to fund carbon sequestration projects including      soil restoration, tree planting, wetland's protection, and      other ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide ($300      million). Projects funded under this section may not be used      to offset emissions otherwise mandated by the ``Clean Power      Plant and Modernization Act of 1999.''                                  ____                                Poor Me                        (By Christopher Palmeri)       Utilities are telling the rate regulators that their old      power plants are practically worthless. But they're selling      them for fancy prices.       The Homer City Generation Station is a 34-year-old, coal-     fired power plant near Pittsburgh. What's it worth? Until      last year it was carried on the books of two utilities for      $540 million. Then the companies sold it for $1.8 billion, or      $955 per kilowatt--about what it would cost to build a brand-     spanking-new electric plant.       Are old plants a millstone for utilities as they enter the      deregulated future? That's what the utilities are telling      rate regulators. We built all these plants over the years      because you told us to, they are saying--and now that      newcomers are about to undercut us, we need compensation for      the ``stranded costs.'' The logic of compensation for      stranded costs is unassailable. The only debate is over the      amount. Is the average power plant indeed a white elephant?       According to data collected by Cambridge Energy Research      Associates, the average nonnuclear power plant put up for      sale in the last year sold for nearly twice its book value.      Granted, the plants being sold tend to be the more desirable      ones, by dint of their location or their fuel efficiency.      Still, the pricing makes one wonder whether the power      industry should be entitled to much of anything for stranded      costs.       Some states--California, Maine, Connecticut and New York,      for example--have ordered utilities to sell all or part of      their generation capacity. That should set an arm's length      fair price. Thanks largely to the fat prices received for its      power plants, Sempra Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas &      Electric, says that its stranded-cost charges related to      generation--about 12% of a typical customer's bill--will be      paid off by July. That is two and a half years ahead of      schedule, a savings of $400 million for southern      Californians.       Not every state legislature or utility commission has the      political will to force divestiture, however. If a utility      does not want to sell, the utility and the regulators have to      estimate the fair market value for a plant and then see if      that is a lot less than book value.       This is tricky business. Last year Allegheny Energy, parent      of West Penn Power Co., estimated the value of its power      plant at $148 a kilowatt, half of their book value. An expert      hired by a number of industrial energy users suggested the      value should be $409. A hearing revealed that Allegheny had      bought back a half-interest in one of its plants two years      earlier at a price of $612 a kilowatt. Allegheny settled with      the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for a     valuation of $225 a kilowatt, half again the original      estimate. At that price, Allegheny's 700,000 customers in      western Pennsylvania are stuck paying $670 million in      stranded costs.       What happens if the utility doesn't get the compensation it      wants? Litigation. In New Hampshire the state legislature      passed a law designed to open up the power market in 1996.      New Hampshire's power companies and utility commission have      been tied up in court ever since over the issue of stranded      costs.       For this reason, legislators and regulators sometimes feel      like they need to cut some deal, any deal, just to get a      competitive market moving forward. The state of Virginia, for      example, dodged any stranded cost calculation. In a move      supported by local utilities, the legislature delayed true      competition and simply froze electric rates until 2007.      Utilities had donated more than $1 million to Virginia      politicians in the last two election cycles.       Last year Ohio legislators proposed a bill to open up the      power market. They figured stranded costs at $6 billion,      spread among Ohio's eight big utilities. Not liking that      number, the utilities came up with an $18 billion figure. The      latest compromise is $11 billion. This number represents, in      effect, the excess of the plants' book value over their      market value.       Wait a minute, says Samuel Randazzo, an attorney for some      industrial power users. That $11 billion number is more than      the book value of all the plants. Can the utilities lose more      than their investment? Negotiations are to continue.       ``We are applying a political solution to an economic      problem,'' shrugs Ohio utility commissioner Craig Glazer.      ``All intellectual arguments have been thrown out the window.      Now it comes down to who screams the loudest.       Expect further screaming as utilities enter the deregulated      market.                                 ______                                       By
