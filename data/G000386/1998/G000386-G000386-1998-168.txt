 I thank Senator Reed for coming over and doing that.  Having said that, knowing the personality of the Senator from Rhode Island, that he is very sincere about his position and very sincere in determining that this is a problem to needs to be dealt with, I suggest there are two issues relating to this amendment. One would be the immediate issue of whether or not it is needed; second, the extent to which this really falls in the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee.  I don't find fault with the Senator from Rhode Island offering this amendment to my bill, but a reason for my opposition is that I do not like to usurp the authority of other committees.  I think experience has shown that price controls, as indicated in this amendment, are counterproductive. In the end they are very harmful to the people they are trying to help, particularly the consumer, and in addition to that, somewhat harmful to the general economy.  I feel this amendment should be opposed. This amendment has the destabilizing effect of imposing price controls on credit card lenders by prohibiting the imposition of a fee or canceling the account of an account holder because the account has not incurred financial charges.  The credit card industry is extraordinarily competitive. People might not realize it--on the other hand, they might realize it because they get so many of these solicitations--but in the banking industry alone, there are 6,000 credit card issuers. They are all in competition, competing with each other for new credit card holders. Everybody here on the Senate floor right now is in somebody's computer and in a few days they will get some sort of a solicitation. That is how competitive it is. Whether that is right or wrong is another thing, but the competitive environment makes that determination.  This intense competition provides consumers with enormous benefits. For instance, it has resulted in a decline of the average credit card interest rate in the past several years. Just as important, the competition results in industry choice for the consumer. As I said, consumers can choose from literally thousands of different cards, each with a different array of pricing and benefit features.  As a result, the extraordinarily competitive environment in which credit card issuers operate, consumer credit actually dictates credit card prices much more efficiently than we can do through almost any Federal law. Any lender who offers undesirable pricing features will swiftly fall behind the competition because the consumers can and will choose other products. By contrast, this amendment would harm consumers by restricting consumer choice.  In addition, we have a record going back to 1991 when another Senator--still a Member of this body--tried to impose price controls on lenders and it precipitated a severely negative impact on the stock market. For example, in 1991, when the Senate opposed price controls on credit card lenders in the form of an interest rate ceiling, the stock market reacted, dropping 120 points in a single day. Clearly, in this time of already volatile market activity, we don't want to repeat things of that nature. I am not suggesting that would be what would happen in the case of the amendment that is before the Senate, but, obviously, we should be very cautious.  Now, probably a more important point for Members to consider in supporting or not supporting this amendment would be, as I said, whether it is in the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee. We have the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Faircloth, chairing the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions of the Banking Committee. He has indicated to me that he will hold hearings on credit card solicitation practices and also on lending practices.  I know many Members feel the credit card companies have been sloppy and overly aggressive in the way they offer credit. I say there is substance to that argument. That is why I have appreciated my comanager of this bill, Senator Durbin, bringing this to our attention as part of this legislation. I think it has been amply discussed, and I share some of those concerns as well. I do think it is more appropriate for the committee of jurisdiction to do that. I am certainly not here to tell Members that credit card companies have been totally responsible in the way that they offer credit. But the fact is that these are issues which need to be explored by the authorizing standing committee and its subcommittee.  The amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island is a Banking Committee issue. We happen to have before the Senate a bankruptcy bill which came out of the Judiciary Committee where we don't have the expertise that we ought to have on this issue. I would like to follow the regular order of the Senate and let the subcommittee with real expertise examine this.  I have a letter from Senator Faircloth that I wish the Senator from Rhode Island would consider. It is addressed to me.       It is my understanding that a number of amendments relating      to credit cards will be offered to S. 1301. Most, if not all,      of these amendments will relate to matters in the      jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I Chair the Financial      Institutions Subcommittee of the Banking Committee.       I share the concerns that many have regarding multiple      credit card solicitations and solicitations to minors. In      fact earlier this year, my Subcommittee held a hearing on      bankruptcy issues, with representatives of the credit card      industry testifying. I have requested and received GAO      reports on such practices as high loan to value loans and      the sending of ``live'' loan checks.       As for many of the proposed amendments relating, however,      none have been passed by the Committee. In fact, none have      been considered by the Committee. Further, none of the      proponents of the amendments have requested hearings on any      of their legislative proposals.       During consideration of the bankruptcy bill, please know      that I would be more than willing to hold a hearing or      hearings on any of these proposals in my Subcommittee where      they rightfully should be considered under regular order.           Sincerely,                                              Lauch Faircloth,                                                         Chairman,                           Subcommittee on Financial Institutions.  I give that to my colleagues for consideration. Again, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for coming.  I yield the floor.
