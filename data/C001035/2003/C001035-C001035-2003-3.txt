1522 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               congressional budget office cost estimate     S. 1522--GAO Human Capital Reform Act of 2003       Summary: S. 1522 would authorize the General Accounting      Office (GAO) to modify its personnel and workforce practices      to allow greater flexibility in determining pay increases,      pay retention rules, and other compensation matters. The bill      also would permanently extend GAO's authority to offer      separation (buyout) payments and early retirement to      employees who voluntarily leave GAO. Finally, S. 1522 would      rename GAO as the Government Accountability Office.       CBO estimates that enacting S. 1522 would increase direct      spending for retirement annuities and related health benefits      by about $1 million in fiscal year 2004, by $19 million over      the 2004-2008 period, and by $40 million over the 2004-2013      period. Several provisions of S. 1522 could affect GAO      employee compensation costs, but the net budgetary effect of      such provisions would depend on how GAO exercises its new      authorities and on whether future agency appropriations are      adjusted to reflect any savings or costs. Finally, we expect      that any additional discretionary costs associated with      changing the agency's name would not be significant.       S. 1522 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act (UMRA)      and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal      governments.       Estimated costs to the Federal Government: The estimated      impact of S. 1522 on direct spending is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      budget function 800 (general government).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                        By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING Estimated budget authority....................................        1        3        5        5        5        5        4        4        4        4Estimated outlays.............................................        1        3        5        5        5        5        4        4        4        4--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Basis of estimate       Direct spending       S. 1522 would give GAO permanent authority to offer      retirement to employees who voluntarily leave the agency      early. GAO's existing buyout authority, which will expire on      December 31, 2003, allows the agency to offer certain      employees a lump sum payment of up to $25,000 to voluntarily      leave the agency. In addition, certain qualified employees      who leave (whether they collect a separation payment or not)      are entitled to receive immediate retirement annuities      earlier than they would have otherwise. CBO estimates that      extending this authority would increase direct spending by $1      million in 2004, by $19 million over the 2004-2008 period,      and by $40 million over the 2004-2013 period.       Based on information provided by GAO about use of its early      retirement authority over the past several years, CBO      estimates that each year about 35 agency employees would      begin receiving retirement benefits three years earlier than      they would have under current law. Inducing some employees to      retire early results in higher-than-expected benefits from      the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). CBO      estimates that the additional retirement benefits would      increase direct spending by $1 million in 2004, by $16      million over the 2004-2008 period, and by $32 million over      the 2004-2013 period.       Extending GAO's buyout and early retirement authority also      would increase direct spending for federal retiree health      benefits. Many employees who retire early would continue to      be eligible for coverage under the Federal Employees' Health      Benefits (FEHB) program. The government's share of the      premium for retirees is classified as mandatory spending.      Because many of those accepting the buyouts under the bill      would have retired later under current law, mandatory      spending on FEHB premiums would increase. CBO estimates these      additional benefits would increase direct spending by less      than $500,000 in 2004, by $3 million over the 2004-2008      period, and by $8 million over the 2004-2013 period.       Spending subject to appropriation       The authorities provided by S. 1522 would allow GAO to      create a performance-based employee compensation system to      govern basic pay adjustments, pay retention for employees      affected by reductions in force, relocation reimbursements,      and annual leave accruals beginning in fiscal year 2006.      (Under existing law, GAO is required to follow personnel      management policies determined by the Office of Personnel      Management.) Implementing the new authorities that would be      provided by S. 1522 could affect GAO's total costs of      providing employee compensation, but CBO cannot predict any      cost or saving associated with these new authorities, or the      net effect of all such changes on the Federal budget.      Ultimately, the net budgetary effect of the proposed      authorities would depend on the features of the compensation      system adopted by GAO and on how the agency applies that new      system to individual employees. Moreover, any resulting      savings or costs would only be realized if the agency's      annual appropriations are adjusted accordingly.       Providing GAO with the option of providing voluntary      separation payments could also increase GAO's costs, but CBO      estimates that any new costs would average less than $500,000      annually over the 2004-2013 period. Section 2 of the bill      would allow GAO to offer certain employees payments of up to      $25,000 to voluntarily leave the agency. The bill also      requires that GAO make a deposit amounting to 45 percent of      each buyout recipient's basic salary toward the CSRDF. Unlike      an increase in retirement benefits, these two payments would      be from the agency's discretionary budget and are thus      subject to appropriation. Since GAO's current buyout      authority was first authorized in October 2000, no one at the      agency has received a buyout payment. As such, CBO expects      that relatively few employees would receive a buyout payment      over the next 10 years and that the cost of any buyout      payments and required deposits toward the CSRDF would be      negligible in any given year.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1522      contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as      defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of State,      local, or tribal governments.
