 President, I am pleased the Senate will adopt this resolution to honor correctional officers and employees. The resolution reaffirms our support for the thousands of correctional officers and employees who work in the face of danger each day, while reforming hardened criminals. They deserve our respect and support.  Tragically, many correctional officers have been permanently injured and killed in the line of duty. Few of us can truly appreciate the perils faced daily by our correctional officers. There have been over 356 men and women who have died while on duty. This year, we honor Wilmot A. Burnett, Lee Dunn, Raymond Curtis, Michael Price, Allen Gamble, Peter Hillman, Jason Acton, Leon Egly, William Giacomo, Alvin Glenn, and Allen Myers, all of whom have been killed during the past year. I hope this resolution will prompt us to reflect on the contributions of these men and the more than 200,000 corrections professionals who help to maintain the safety of our communities.  America's correctional officers and employees' efforts go unnoticed too often. I am pleased to sponsor this resolution to establish June 3-10, 2001, as ``Correctional Officers and Employees Week.''
