Speaker, I submit the following essay which was delivered by Mr. Tucker Jameson at the Southern Maryland Veterans Stand Down event on May 16, 2014. Tucker is a freshman at St. Mary's Ryken High School and is a member of the Stars and Stripes club. He lives in Mechanicsville, MD. He wrote:       Stand down. In military terminology, this term is used when      commanders wish to halt operational progress. It could be due      to mission completion, safety, or the elimination of a      threat. In some situations, a stand down is an opportunity to      ensure that the unit is in the most complete, efficient, and      advantageous position that it can be before it proceeds with      its mission. Sometimes the momentum of our operational tempo      and our desire to complete the mission blinds us to one of      the oldest of tactical blunders--haste. We take this      opportunity today to stop and remember the tradition that we      hope to carry on, and that tradition lives in our veterans.       A cornerstone of our development at St. Mary's Ryken high      school is our service to others. As a part of the Stars,      Stripes, and Service club I have had the opportunity and the      honor to focus my service on veterans. From assisting with      the Veteran's Day parade, visiting Charlotte Hall Veteran's      Home, and raising money for the Wounded Warrior Benefit, we      have been able to put our words into action in showing our      brave servicemen and women how much we care. Recently, we      coordinated an item drive for homeless veterans in the D.C.      area through Pathways to Housing. The response from our      community was incredible and it fills me with pride to hear      that our first donations went to a post 9/11 veteran who,      along with her 3 children, are no longer living in their car      and can look forward to a bright future. Although we are      making progress, we still have a long way to go.       Our efforts exemplify how important it is, not only to      ensure veterans are appreciated, but that they know they are      loved and needed. As our armed forces fight the enemy      overseas, we must fight against the intangible enemy of      disconnection and emotional disengagement, against      unemployment and homelessness. This Veteran's Stand Down is a      time to stop and remember that it is our duty and obligation      to live the principles our servicemen and women sacrificed so      much to preserve.  Nobody who fights for America overseas ought to have to fight just as hard to find a job, to keep a roof over their head, or to access quality health care once he or she returns home. I was pleased Tucker was able to participate in the event and remind us all of the moral obligation we have to ensure our veterans have the support and resources they need to transition to civilian life after serving our nation so courageously. I thank him and all who participated from throughout Southern Maryland for coming together for the Stand Down event.                          ____________________
