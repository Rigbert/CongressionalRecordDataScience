Let me respond to some of the things the majority stated.  First of all, when they make the statement that this, talking about the price of gas, all this happened during the Republican administration, let me assure you this happened because of the Democrats in the Senate voting against any increase in supply.  Now, if anyone has any doubt about that, go to our Web site www.epw--that stands for Environment and Public Works--epw.senate.gov/minority. Look that up. You will see that I have documented the votes all the way back to the middle 1990s, when we have tried to increase our supply of energy or our refining capacity.  Secondly, the statements that this is not a tax bill, I would only read to you the total revenue generated through carbon sales auctions for consumers of power, heating, cooling, and gasoline: $6.7 trillion. That is their figure, not my figure.  The maximum potentially rebated to consumers would be $2.5 trillion. That leaves $4.2 trillion. If that is not a $4.2 trillion tax increase, I don't know what it is.  Thirdly, the fact that all labor seems to be for this. I suggest that Senators talk to the United Mine Workers, who are very much opposed to it, the United Auto Workers, who are opposed to it. As far as the various communities on the chart shown by the junior Senator from California, there are many of evangelical associations. We had a press conference. They all showed up. They are all very much opposed to this, and all these are Scripturally based.
