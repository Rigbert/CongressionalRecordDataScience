 I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri. He has been a great partner in these and other ongoing efforts by the committee.  I urge the positive adoption of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor to H.R. 1307--the Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act, which establishes a centralized location where Federal Agencies will publish information on disaster assistance.  This legislation requires reports every 3 months, that are available to the public regarding the total amount of assistance provided by agencies, the amount of funding that obligated, and where the funds are going, including all projects or activities that received funding.  To date, roughly 32 percent, or $13.6 billion, of all funding, $42 billion dollars, Congress has appropriated to Puerto Rico has actually been received by the communities and families who are trying to rebuild their lives on the island.  With this legislation my constituents will know exactly how much funding is still expected to come to Puerto Rico and to their communities. They will be able to see the process that agencies are making for timely dispersals of funding and holding them accountable.  Again, I want to thank Rep. Peters and Ranking Member Meadows again for their work on this Disaster recovery related bill.
