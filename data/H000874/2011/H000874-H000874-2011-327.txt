Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Wilton Corkern, a good friend, environmental steward, and community leader who, at the end of last month, retired after serving for 21 years as President and CEO of the Accokeek Foundation. This weekend Wilt will be honored by his family, friends, and colleagues at the Foundation's annual Leadership Salute with its National Conservation Leadership Award.  The Accokeek Foundation, headquartered in my district, is devoted to the interaction between people and the landscape over time. The Foundation stewards 200 acres of the National Park Service's Piscataway Park, along the Potomac River in Prince George's and Charles Counties. The park was established to preserve the viewshed from George Washington's historic Mount Vernon estate.  The Foundation's programs include the National Colonial Farm, a living history museum that preserves heirloom plants, heritage breeds of livestock, and historic buildings of the Chesapeake Tidewater; the Ecosystem Farm, a demonstration of sustainable agriculture; and a number of training programs in organic farming, museum theatre, and related fields. The success and continued growth of these programs are a testament to Wilt's dedication and that of his talented staff and volunteers.  Mr. Speaker, Wilt's accomplishments at the Accokeek Foundation are many and lasting. Through the years, Wilt:  Established the modern organic Ecosystem Farm, with its innovative new farmer training program, and established what is now the Center for Agricultural and Environmental Stewardship as ``a national model for research, scholarship, education, and public information about sustainability in general and sustainable agriculture in particular.''  Helped to organize and launch the Friends of the Potomac and to secure designation of the Potomac as one of the first ``American Heritage Rivers.''  Relocated and reconstructed the Laurel Branch farmhouse, constructed the colonial outkitchen, and replaced the Saylor Grove fishing pier.  Constructed a ``green'' Education Center and demonstration stewardship areas.  Installed ``The View from Here: Preservation, Development, and Community in Accokeek, Maryland'' interpretive signage for the Foundation's fiftieth anniversary.  Secured Standards of Excellence certification from the Maryland Association of Nonprofits.  Reenergized the Foundation's land conservation initiative to focus on the Mount Vernon viewshed, preservation of working landscapes, and stewardship of easements.  Launched the Foundation's Piscataway Cultural Landscape Initiative, an effort to transform the concept of ``indigenous cultural landscape'' into a concrete interpretive experience for the public.  Wilt has made a real and enduring impact on our community--helping us improve our appreciation of the environment, recognize our role in preserving it, and understanding and experiencing our shared heritage as Americans. On a personal note, I have greatly appreciated his friendship and counsel over the years. I wish him the best in his retirement and ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on a job well done.                          ____________________
