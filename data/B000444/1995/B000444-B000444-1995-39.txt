 President, today I am introducing legislation that would increase the Social Security earnings limit--the amount that senior citizens can earn before they start losing Social Security benefits.  As my colleagues know, the earnings limit is currently $11,280, and it is increased each year for inflation. For seniors between the ages of 65 and 69, every $3 earned over that limit means a $1 reduction in Social Security benefits.  It is almost hard to believe this issue is still around. I remember back in my first term in the Senate--in 1977--when I introduced similar legislation. At the time, the earnings limit was $3,000, and I tried to increase it to $6,000. I was prompted to do so in part because of a Delaware woman who came up to me at a meeting and told me that she was breaking the law.  I wondered what crime could this sweet, frail, elderly woman be guilty of. And, she told me. She had a part-time job and was being paid in cash so that she would not have to report her income and thereby lose her Social Security benefits. She needed both to survive financially.  In the years since then, I have heard other stories--they are practically endless.  Imagine an elderly couple whose adult child develops some medical problem. Like most parents, they want to help their child--they do not abandon their parental instincts and concern just because they have turned 65. But, to meet the costs of caring for their child, they need to go back to work--and as a result, they will lose some of their Social Security benefits.  Or imagine the case--and it happens all too often--where the husband dies. And the wife, who he supported financially, now faces a dilemma. Her widow's Social Security benefits are not enough. She must get a part-time job to maintain a living. So, she goes to work, but loses part of her Social Security benefits.  Or imagine those senior citizens who just want to supplement their Social Security income--so they do not become dependent on welfare or on their own children, who are facing a financial squeeze of their own between their mortgages and putting their kids through college. Those seniors who want to ensure that they do not become dependent on others are penalized by having their Social Security benefits reduced.  Mr. President, these stories illustrate the perversity of a low Social Security earnings limit. It discourages some seniors from working, penalizes other seniors for working, and makes criminals of some seniors who need both a paycheck and a Social Security check to survive. This is not right.  So why does this policy even exist? Well, believe it or not, at one time, it had a very legitimate purpose.  In the midst of the Great Depression roughly 60 years ago, unemployment was rampant. And, the plain fact was, we wanted senior citizens out of the work force so that there would be more jobs for young workers with young families. That is part of the reason why Congress created the Social Security earnings limit--to discourage seniors from working.  A legitimate rationale at the time. But not today. Today, unemployment stands at a low 5.5 percent. And, the American economy, with a shrinking labor pool, is facing competition within an ever expanding global marketplace.  So, just when we need experienced workers in the labor force, we are wasting the greatest source of experience--our senior citizens. Just when we should be encouraging seniors to stay in the work force, many elderly workers are better off earning less than earning more. These are seniors who wish to work--in some cases, must work--who would work hard, and who could add millions of dollars to our economy. But, many are not working because the Social Security earnings limit penalizes them for doing so.  This is simply not fair to our seniors, and it is not good for this country. We should not penalize anyone for wanting to work and for wanting to supplement their income. And, we should not make criminals of those who do.  Now, unlike some of my colleagues, I do believe that some earnings limit still has a place. Social Security is, after all, a retirement program, not a reward for becoming old. But, an earnings limit set at $11,280 simply has no rational basis whatsoever. And those it hurts are too often those who are already struggling.  I find it interesting that the effect of such a low earnings limit is that working, middle-class seniors are penalized. They lose part of their Social Security benefits. But, the wealthy are treated differently. The elderly Donald Trumps and the elderly Ross Perots of the country have far greater incomes than $11,280, but they get those incomes from investments and unearned income. Therefore, they do not face the reduction in Social Security benefits that the middle-class faces.  This needs fixing. So, Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would increase the Social Security earnings limit to $14,500 next year and then gradually increase it over the following 6 years until the limit reaches $30,000 in the year 2002. In other words, seniors could earn up to $30,000 per year before their Social Security benefits begin to be reduced.  Earlier this month, the Senate debated and failed to pass similar legislation introduced by Senator McCain. I want to commend the Senator from Arizona for his dedication to this issue over the last several years. And, I say to my colleagues that the bill I am introducing today is the same as the Senate considered--and unfortunately rejected--a few weeks ago, except in a couple of respects.  First, my bill would also apply the increase in the earnings limit to blind recipients of Social Security benefits. Currently, blind individuals aged 55 and over qualify for Social Security disability benefits if their earnings are below the level of the retirement earnings limit. My proposal would retain this parallel treatment between the retired and the blind.  The second major difference between my bill and the earlier McCain legislation is that my bill does not include an offset. I believe we must find a way to pay for this bill. But, it was clear that the vote to defeat an increase in the earnings limit earlier this month was based in part on the proposed offset. So, my hope is that by not specifying an offset now, we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to find a suitable way to pay for the costs of this proposal and increase the Social Security earnings limit.  Mr. President, those senior citizens who want to work and those who must work to make ends meet should be honored and commended, not penalized by the Social Security system. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
