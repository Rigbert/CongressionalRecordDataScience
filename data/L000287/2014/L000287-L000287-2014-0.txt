Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues tonight to honor my friend, my brother, the longest serving Member of Congress, the Honorable John Dingell.  I had heard of Congressman Dingell long before I came to the House. I knew he had followed in his father's footsteps on his path to public service, that he was one of the youngest Members of Congress at the time. But most important, I heard that he would stand up, speak out, and fight for the issues of civil rights and social justice.  John Dingell is one of the most able and respected Members of this body. Yes, he is the dean of the House of Representatives. He had the capacity and the ability to say we have a right to know what is in the food we eat, what is in the air we breathe, and what is in the water that we drink.  He battled on the front lines for Medicare and Medicaid. He is the only Member of Congress still serving today who voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He also helped win passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that John Dingell is the embodiment of a time when legislators did not hesitate to use the power of the Federal Government to do good for all.  John, my friend, my brother, my colleague, thank you for your service. Thank you for all of the good that you have done to make our country and to make our world a better place.
