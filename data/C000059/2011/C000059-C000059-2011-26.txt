Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an incredible young boy, Cade Spinello, from my congressional district who has faced so many challenges in his young life. Cade's story came to me from a family friend of the Spinello's and I am honored to share it here. In 2009, Cade's parents, Michael and Erin, noticed that Cade's eyes were not lining up normally when he tried to focus. The doctor told the Spinello's that little Cade had lazy eye and prescribed a patch over the good eye to strengthen the weak eye. After a year of using the patch, Cade's condition worsened, and after a closer look the doctor realized that Cade's optical nerve was inflamed. After an MRI, the doctor told Cade'sparents the devastating news: Cade had a tumor the size of an egg at the bottom of his brain right behind his right eye. All of this was happening as Erin gave birth to their second child, Lucy.  After the discovery of the tumor, Cade was immediately sent to surgery where surgeons were able to remove 30% of the tumor and provide much relief to Cade. The Spinello's, and all their friends and family, were relieved to hear that the tumor was benign. Unfortunately, as Cade was recovering from surgery, he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body and left him without speech.  Over a year has passed since the surgery and the stroke and the only word to describe Cade's recovery is ``miracle.'' This brave young boy has overcome challenges most of us never face in a lifetime. He is walking and talking again. He has participated in a T-ball league. All this while going through a second surgery that saved his right eye and chemotherapy that has significantly reduced the size of his tumor.  The Spinello family has endured through so many hardships yet they face each day with optimism and with their deep faith in God. The community of Ladera Ranch has rallied around them and held fundraisers to help pay the medical bills. Through it all stands Cade Spinello, a testament to love, courage, and perserverance.  Today I ask the U.S. House of Representatives to take a moment and honor this incredible young boy and his family. I ask that all of us keep Cade, and the entire Spinello family, in our prayers as they continue down the path of recovery. I look forward to the day, not so long from now, that I will stand up here and congratulate Cade on his high school graduation and all the accomplishments that he will achieve in his life. For now, I simply stand in awe of a young boy who has conquered more in his young life than most do in an entire lifetime.                          ____________________
