 President, I rise today to introduce the RedwoodValley County Water District Loan Renegotiation Act of 2007. I am pleased that Senator Boxer is a cosponsor of this bill.  This bill seeks to remove roadblocks to the implementation of 1988 legislation that requires the Secretary of the Interior to renegotiate debts owed by the Redwood Valley County Water District to the United States. Enactment of this bill is necessary so that Redwood Valley can obtain a reliable water supply.  In 1983, the Redwood Valley County Water District completed a project which supplied water to a rural agricultural community near Ukiah, CA. Two Bureau of Reclamation loans totaling $7.3 million contributed to the financing of this project.  Unfortunately, the District was unable to repay these loans. This occurred for several reasons: The projected water use in the original feasibility study, developed by the District and reviewed by the Bureau, was seriously flawed; the District's ability to raise necessary revenues was compromised by a judicially imposed moratorium on new hook-ups; and concerns for endangered species reduced the District's potential water supply allotment by 33 percent.  As a result, in 1988 Congress passed Section 15 of Public Law 100-516 which indefinitely suspended the District's obligations to repay these Bureau loans and ordered the Secretary of Interior to renegotiate the loans. This loan renegotiation has yet to take place and now the District finds that its water supply is highly uncertain.  In 2000 in a report on Redwood Valley, the Bureau of Reclamation recognized these changed conditions, and concluded that the District needs a reliable water supply before it can solve its current financial dilemma.  The District recently identified two potential new projects, either of which could prove a reliable water source. No government funds will be sought for these projects. The District intends to rely on private financing, a strategy that the Bureau of Reclamation is encouraging. However, before the District can secure private financing for new projects, it must renegotiate the existing loans to provide for their repayment subsequent to the repayment of the new loans.  The existing loans are an impediment to the District's attempts to upgrade elements of its existing plant. As an example, the District unsuccessfully sought private financing to build a 100 kW solar panel project. This project would have enabled the District to cut its energy costs and to qualify for energy rebates.  Significantly, this legislation requires the District to repay to the United States the currently suspended loans once the District's new loans have been paid.  The only difference between this bill and S. 3189, which I introduced last year, is to clarify that no renegotiations are required to trigger the District's obligations to repay the loans and the Secretary of Interior ``shall reschedule the payments due'' once the District has satisfied its additional financial obligations.  The proposed water projects will enable the District to generate adequate revenues to allow the District to repay both its new private loans and its original loans from the United States. By providing a workable and reasonable solution to a longstanding problem, this legislation creates a win-win solution for taxpayers of the United States and the rate payers of the Redwood Valley County Water District.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1112       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. RENEGOTIATION OF PAYMENT SCHEDULE.       Section 15 of Public Law 100-516 (102 Stat. 2573) is      amended as follows:       (1) By amending paragraph (2) of subsection (a) to read as      follows:       ``(2) If, as of January 1, 2006, the Secretary of the      Interior and the Redwood Valley County Water District have      not renegotiated the schedule of payment, the District may      enter into such additional non-Federal obligations as are      necessary to finance procurement of dedicated water rights      and improvements necessary to store and convey those rights      to provide for the District's water needs. The Secretary      shall reschedule the payments due under loans numbered 14-06-     200-8423A and 14-06-200-8423A Amendatory and said payments      shall commence when such additional obligations have been      financially satisfied by the District. The date of the      initial payment owed by the District to the United States      shall be regarded as the start of the District's repayment      period and the time upon which any interest shall first be      computed and assessed under section 5 of the Small      Reclamation Projects Act of 1956 (43 U.S.C. 422a et seq.).''.       (2) By striking subsection (c).                                 ______                                       By
