DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is exactly correct. We would be prepared to accept virtually the same conditions we have agreed to in the past on Defense Appropriations and other legislation. If that is what it takes to expedite consideration of Homeland Security, I think it is critical that we attempt to accommodate the Senate and try to work through this very important legislative priority in an expeditious way. So the Senator from Illinois makes a very good suggestion. This is yet another approach. Let's decide to pick it up on Tuesday and move through the legislation. We can probably finish by the middle or certainly the end of the next week, and get to conference, even though they have not appointed conferees in the House.  My hope is when it comes to Homeland Security, given what we have heard today at the briefing, it would be imperative for us to deal with both of these bills in the most expeditious manner.
