  It could not be more timely.  Unfortunately, this year is shaping up to be one of the worst fire years on record for many States in the West and for southern California in particular.  The fire season usually begins in California in early summer and can last all the way up to November.  A few years ago it became clear to me that we had a potential disaster on our hand beginning every June.  In the 106th Congress Senator Domenici, several of our colleagues and I worked to greatly increase funding for fire prevention.  That included millions of dollars for the removal of dead and dying and small diameter trees and thick underbrush that have accumulated in our national forests, dramatically increasing the likelihood of serious and highly destructive forest fires.  Recently, the Forest Service identified 24 million acres of land in the Continental U.S. as being at the absolute highest level of catastrophic fire risk.  Almost a full one third of this area, 7.8 million acres, lies in California; this is more than any other State.  It includes the entire Sierra Nevada mountain range, the newly designated Sequoia National Monument, it also includes the Plumas and Lassen Forests in and around the Quincy area, where forest fires in the past have destroyed homes and businesses and spotted owl habitat.  And it includes the Lake Tahoe Basin, where one-quarter of the trees are either dead or dying.  And the probability of major fire conflagration remains and grows each year. Such a fire around Lake Tahoe for instance could permanently destroy the water quality of one of the most pristine lakes in the world.  Not to mention a potential loss of life, habitat and property that could be devastating.  Each year, the Forest Service spends hundreds of millions of dollars putting out fires.  This money would be much better spent preventing fires in the first place rather than cleaning up after the fact.  And that is what our resolution seeks to address.  How did things get this way?  Well through the turn of the 20th century, the U.S. population was predominantly spread out and agrarian.  Forest fires burned naturally at fairly predictable intervals and they burned hot enough to restrict encroaching vegetation and prevent fuel from loading up on the ground, but not hot enough to kill old growths.  Forests in the U.S. survived in this fashion for literally thousands of years.  By the middle of the twentieth century, however an increasing population began to occupy new urban-wildland interface zones on what had once been forests.  Suddenly, forest fires had to be put out or suppressed in order to protect the surrounding communities.  It seemed intuitive to simply continue fighting fires as they arose and leave the forests otherwise, untouched.  So nothing was done to groom the forests, to remove the dead and dying, to reduce undergrowth, and to prevent subsequent conflagrations.  What is called fuel load has grown to astronomical proportions in many of our national forests.  Dead and dying trees which were no longer consumed by fire, lingered while brush began to build up at ground level.  Newer, different species of trees, no longer stifled by natural fire, began to crowd out some of the older growth trees.  Forests became crowded and severely fire-prone.  Newer, different species of trees, no longer stifled by natural fire, began to crowd out some of the older growth trees.  In the meantime, what we learned was that one-size does not fit all when it comes to managing our forests.  Each forest is distinct. Differences in topography, geography, flora and fauna, elevation, and climate dictate how a particular forest should be managed.  A forest in the California Sierras is different from a forest in Alaska or Pennsylvania or Idaho.  It is imperative that the Forest Service use all available tools to clean up the forests and reduce fire risks.  This includes removing dead and dying trees, thinning overgrowth, and using mechanical treatment and controlled burning.  It should also include the fuel breaks demonstrated by the Quincy Library Group Project.  If we don't use all these tools, incidents of serious fire will only continue to increase.  In California, fire susceptible Douglas and White firs have grown underneath old growth ponderosa pines.  The newer firs which are not resistant to fire, create potential fuel ladders that permit a fire to reach the tops, or crowns of old growths for the first time.  For most of recent history an old growth pine was impervious to fire since rarely did a fire reach all the way up to its crown.  Now with these relatively new fuel ladders, fire threats to old growths are very real.  Drought periods have further stressed the forest, predisposing it to insect infestations, disease and of course, severe wildfire.  California forests provide homes for dozens of endangered and threatened species including the Marbled Murrelet and the Spotted owl.  It is an understatement to say that today, the risk of fire is the most serious threat to our forests and these species.  It may be the most immediate short-term environmental threat that our western forests face.  That is why this policy of fire prevention and this resolution are so important.  And I urge my colleagues to support the Craig-Feinstein resolution.                          ____________________
