Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing the Kake Land Exchange Act of 1997. This bill will provide for an exchange of land between Kake Tribal Corp. [KTC], a village corporation formed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and the U.S. Forest Service.  Specifically, the legislation makes possible an exchange in which the corporation transfers approximately 2,427 acres of its ANCSA entitlement lands surrounding the municipal watershed of the city of Kake, for an equal acreage of land managed by the Forest Service in the Saginaw Bay and Hamilton Bay areas. The bill serves two important purposes and enjoys the support of the Governor of Alaska, the city of Kake, Sealaska--the Regional Native Corporation--and the Alaska Federation of Natives, as well as other individuals and groups in southeast Alaska.  The two primary goals of the bill are to protect and preserve the Gunnuk Creek Watershed, which serves as Kake's supply of drinking water, and to enable the shareholders of KTC to realize benefit from its land entitlement in fulfillment of ANCSA's purposes.  The need for the bill was illustrated in the 1970's and 1980's when timber harvesting of the land in the Gunnuk Creek Watershed raised great concern in the community of Kake. To safeguard the watershed, logging activity on these lands halted. However, because the lands are owned essentially by a for-profit corporation, residents of Kake, many of whom are KTC shareholders, do not have total assurance that the watershed can be protected over the long term.  This legislation solves this dilemma simply by allowing KTC to exchange the watershed lands for other timbered lands. The lands transferred to the Forest Service will have long-term protection, while the lands conveyed to KTC can be used for the benefit of its shareholders.  In furtherance of the purposes of this bill, the city of Kake is willing to enter into an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service to manage the watershed property, once the exchange is completed. I believe this is a prudent move, and can be pursued either as part of this legislation or separately.  This exchange is an example of how economic development and protection of water resources can be simultaneously achieved in Southeast.                          ____________________
