Speaker, I rise today to comment on legislation I introduced earlier this year to temporarily waive the Medicare enrollment composition rules for the Wellness Plan in Michigan. The bill enjoys bipartisan support in the House and Senate and passed the Commerce Committee on September 18 by a unanimous vote.  H.R. 4012 would allow the Wellness Plan a waiver from the so-called 50-50 rule, which requires that any plan which serves as a Medicare HMO have at least 50 percent of its enrollees as non-Medicare and non-Medicaid recipients. The Wellness Plan is a Michigan-based 501(c)(3) federally qualified HMO which serves a predominately Medicaid-based population.  This plan had begun to serve the Medicare population under a health care prepayment plan. However, HCPP contracts were effectively frozen as of January 1, 1996, as a result of changes made under the Social Security and Technical Corrections Act of 1994 which subjects HCPP contractors to MediGap laws. Because of this, the Wellness Plan has been unable to enroll any more Medicare beneficiaries.  This plan has been recognized by two Secretaries of HHS and by Presidents Bush and Clinton. It serves a substantial portion of the Medicaid population in southeast Michigan and has been doing so for almost 25 years. It is financially sound and has an unblemishedrecord of providing health care to this population.  Although the bill had passed the major committee of jurisdiction and enjoyed bipartisan support in the Senate, it became a victim of time constraints and was not able to be scheduled for a vote in the House before Congress adjourned for the year. Nonetheless, we made important progress this year and I believe we are in solid position to pass this bill early next year when Congress reconvenes for the 105th Congress. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee and the House leadership to achieve this goal.                          ____________________
