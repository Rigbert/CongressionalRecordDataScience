Speaker, once again the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) is wrong. Had he read the amendment that is being proposed, revenue-neutral legislation which raise taxes here and lower taxes there in an equal amount do not require a two-thirds vote. They can be passed by a majority vote. So if the gentleman from Texas wanted to close all of these loopholes that he was talking about, maybe including some that benefit the oil industry, then perhaps enough money could be raised to repeal the marriage tax penalty or to provide further relief on the death tax to small business owners and farmers. As long as he wants to give a tax break for the money that he raises on closing the loopholes, then it is a majority. But if he wants to stick the American public with a tax increase and not give a tax break, then it requires a two-thirds vote.  So all I am saying is that if the gentleman from Texas really wants to be generous with the taxpayers because of his very sincere opposition to loopholes, tell us where you would lower taxes and then you would get a majority vote.
