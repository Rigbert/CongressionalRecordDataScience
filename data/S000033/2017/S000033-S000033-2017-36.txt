  Let me quote you, Senator Rubio, and tell me if this is right. This is a quote that you just made yesterday,and if I am wrong, I apologize. But as I understand it, you spoke to a group of Wall Street lobbyists, and this is what you said:       Many argue that you can't cut taxes because it will drive      up the deficit. But we have to do two things. We have to      generate economic growth which generates revenue, while      reducing spending. That will mean instituting structural      changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.  Let me help define what my Republican colleagues mean when they talk about structural changes to Social Security and Medicare. It will mean that at a time when senior citizens are splitting their pills in half, Republicans will go forward with massive cuts to Medicare.  Maybe their idea will be to raise the retirement age to 70, forcing older workers in terms of Social Security to work more before they can get their benefits. Maybe it will be privatizing Medicare and giving people a voucher. When my Republican friends talk about saving Social Security and Medicare, what they are talking about is cutting it.
