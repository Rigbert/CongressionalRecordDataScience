 President, I listened carefully to my good friend from Nevada who is my counterpart on the Democratic side. I recall he said, just a few moments ago--I think this is a direct quote: ``Why can't we legislate the way we used to?''  I say to my good friend from Nevada, I couldn't agree more. Why can't we legislate the way we used to? I have been here a while. But you wouldn't have had to be here all that long to remember how we used to legislate. Just as recently as a Congress ago, we didn't filibuster judges on the floor of the Senate. In fact, we hadn't done that for a couple hundred years.  Just as recently as the previous Congress, we didn't prevent the legislative process from going forward by prohibiting the appointment of conferees, but adhered to the normal legislative process, so that differences between legislation in the House and Senate can be reconciled and we can move forward.  I think we can stipulate the minority has always had a lot of power in the Senate, but never before has the minority insisted on writing legislation for the majority--not just in the Senate but in the House as well. That is the practical effect of preventing a conference. It is the minority of Senators saying: We won't allow the legislative process to go forward unless it is just the way we want it. Even though we are a minority in one of the two bodies, we are going to dictate to the other body the content.  When my friend from Nevada criticizes the majority leader for the way he is ``handling the Senate,'' he is pointing the finger in the wrong direction. I say to my friends on the other side: You have met the enemy, and it is you.  I think I can safely speak for the majority when I say that we are perfectly happy to have votes on the Democratic Party outbasket items. But, of course, one of the privileges each Member of the Senate has is to prevent a time certain for a vote. And that is used around here frequently in order to make sure something else happens.  The something else the majority would like to have happen--and certainly the majority leader would like to have happen--is the chance of finishing a piece of legislation, getting it to conference, resolving the differences, and sending it on down to the President for signature. That is the way we used to legislate, I say to the Senator from Nevada, who was suggesting longingly that we ought to go back to the way we used to legislate, as he put it. That is the way we used to legislate.  Our position has been, as we have discussed this back and forth off the floor, let's see a limitation on amendments that allows the minority the opportunity to have their vote, allows the majority an opportunity to have a similar vote on a similar subject, to work our way through the legislative process, and then a guarantee at the end that there will be a conference allowed so the legislation we have spent time on has some chance of becoming law.  I can say to my friends on the other side, there is no chance--zero chance--that the majority in the House of Representatives is going to let the minority in the Senate dictate to them the final content of legislation that leaves the Senate. That is simply not going to happen.  I agree with my good friend from Nevada: Let's get back to legislating the way we used to. Legislating the way we used to means a limitation on amendments, amendments that are relevant certainly to the underlying bill but not just those, even those that are not relevant, with opportunities for the other side to offer their substitute ideas, and then a chance to get to the end of the process, to finally pass the bill, to get to conference, and to move along.  That is what the majority leader is looking for. We are going to continue our discussions, both on and off the floor, in the hopes that we can reach agreements to move forward on this important piece of legislation.  The Welfare Reform Act of 1996 was a conspicuous success story, a bipartisan success story passed by a Republican Congress, signed by a Democratic President, something all of us are proud of. It should be reauthorized. And the JOBS bill that had to be shelved last week because of an excessive number of amendments is something we know is extremely important to accomplish.  Levies have been put in place, a European tax on American manufacturers, at 5 percent beginning March 1. Tomorrow, it goes up to 6 percent, and then another percent each month until it is up to 17 percent--European taxes on American manufacturers, killing jobs here at home when we are told that jobs is an important issue.  So we need to do business. We need to do welfare reform. We need to get back, as my good friend from Nevada said, to legislating the way we used to. I hope we can reach that point very shortly.                        Tribute to Steven J. Law  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a good friend, Steven J. Law, who is the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.  Deputy Secretary Law was nominated by the President and was confirmed by the Senate on December 9, 2003. Prior to holding his current position, he served the President and Secretary Elaine L. Chao as Chief of Staff at the Department. In that position, Steven has played a fundamental role in crafting major administration initiatives, such as the post 9/11 economic recovery plan, retirement security, and regulatory reform. Steven is valued as an asset to the Department, greatly admired by his peers, and respected throughout the Washington community.  Steven began his career in this city after graduating from the University of California at Davis. From there, he went on to receive his juris doctorate from Columbia University School of Law, where he was named the Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar and graduated cum laude.  It was after those academic pursuits that our lives happily crossed when he began in my office as a legislative assistant. Displaying the hard work and talent he is well known for, Steven quickly advanced to Chief of Staff shortly after successfully managing my 1990 reelection campaign.  Steven didn't just make a big impression on me. He was recognized by Roll Call as one of the 50 most influential staffers on the Hill. Eventually, he left my office to become executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during my chairmanship and helped secure the Republican majority through both cycles. Over 4 years, and through 2 tough election cycles, he has very skillful and professionally managed that operation in an extraordinarily able fashion.  I have had the privilege of working with Steven for the past 15 years. Ihave had the honor of calling him my friend and confidant during that time as well.  Mr. President, it is easy to see why President Bush chose to nominate Steven to this high post. It is easy to see why my Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Labor, also exercised good judgment in giving this talented man this opportunity. I applaud his confirmation and wish both Steven and his marvelous wife, Elizabeth, and their two beautiful children, Charlotte and John James, continued success in their future endeavors. Elaine and I have been blessed to be a part of their lives for the last 15 years. This is truly a remarkable individual and a magnificent public servant. I wish him well not only in his new job as Deputy Secretary of Labor, but in all of the endeavors he may undertake in the coming years.  I yield the floor.
