President, this week, our Nation celebrates Sunshine Week--a time to recognize and promote openness in our Government. At this important time of year, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn to reintroduce the OPEN FOIA Act--a bipartisan bill to promote more openness regarding statutory exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.  This bipartisan bill builds upon the work that Senator Cornyn and I began several years ago to reinvigorate and strengthen FOIA. Together, we introduced, and Congress ultimately enacted, the OPEN Government Act--the first major reforms to FOIA in more than a decade. I thank Senator Cornyn for his work and leadership on this important issue. I also thank President Obama--who was a cosponsor of the OPEN Government Act when he was in the Senate--for his deep commitment to FOIA. President Obama clearly demonstrated his commitment to open Government when he issued a new directive to strengthen FOIA during his first full day in office.  The OPEN FOIA Act simply requires that when Congress provides for a statutory exemption to FOIA in new legislation, Congress must state its intention to do so explicitly and clearly. This commonsense bill mirrors bipartisan legislation that the Judiciary Committee favorably reported, and the Senate unanimously passed, during the 109th Congress, S. 1181. While no one can fairly question the need to keep certain Government information secret to ensure the public good, excessive Government secrecy is a constant temptation and the enemy of a vibrant democracy.  For more than four decades, FOIA has served as perhaps the most important Federal law to ensure the public's right to know, and to balance the Government's power with the need for Government accountability. The Freedom of Information Act contains a number of exemptions to its disclosure requirements for national security, law enforcement, confidential business information, personal privacy and other circumstances. The FOIA exemption commonly known as the ``(b)(3) exemption,'' requires that Government records that are specifically exempted from FOIA by statute be withheld from the public. In recent years, we have witnessed an alarming number of FOIA (b)(3) exemptions being offered in legislation--often in very ambiguous terms--to the detriment of the American public's right to know.  The bedrock principles of open Government lead me to believe that (b)(3) statutory exemptions should be clear and unambiguous, and vigorously debated before they are enacted into law. Too often, legislative exemptions to FOIA are buried within a few lines of very complex and lengthy bills, and these new exemptions are never debated openly before becoming law. The consequence of this troubling practice is the erosion of the public's right to know, and the shirking of Congress' duty to fully consider these exemptions.  The OPEN FOIA Act will help stop this practice and shine more light on the process of creating legislative exemptions to FOIA. That will be the best antidote to the ``exemption creep'' that we have witnessed in recent years.  When he recently addressed a joint session of the Congress and the American people, President Obama said that ``I know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future when we will part ways. But, I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done.''  Sunshine Week reminds all of us that open Government is not a Democratic issue, nor a Republican issue. It is an American issue and a virtue that all Americans can embrace. Democratic and Republican Senators alike have rightly supported and voted for this bill in the past. It is in this same bipartisan spirit that I urge all Members to support this bipartisan FOIA reform bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 612       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``OPEN FOIA Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. SPECIFIC CITATIONS IN STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS.       Section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended      by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:       ``(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute      (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute--       ``(A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the      public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the      issue; or       ``(ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or      refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and       ``(B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN      FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.''.                                 ______                                       By
