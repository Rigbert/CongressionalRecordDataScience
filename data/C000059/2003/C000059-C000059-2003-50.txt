Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a hero from my congressional district. Earlier this afternoon, I had the distinct honor to attend the funeral service for Todd Jason Bryant, First Lieutenant, United States Army at Arlington National Cemetery. Today I would ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to his country.  Todd was born on January 14, 1980, in Long Beach, California. Todd came from a military family and his desire and determination to join the military was resolute. He enlisted in the Army Reserve and completed Basic Training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma before his senior year of high school. He came to my office for an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. I was proud to nominate this ambitious young man who I knew would distinguish himself at West Point, just as he had done his whole life.  He interned in my office before his senior year at West Point and graduated with a degree in Political Science on June 1, 2002. He would often joke that he was going to run for my congressional seat someday--I have no doubt he would have succeeded. After graduation, Todd attended the Armor Officer's Basic Course at Fort Knox, Kentucky, graduating in December 2002. He reported to Fort Riley, Kansas in January 2003, and was initially assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st, Battalion 34th Armor Regiment where he served as an Assistant Operations Officer. In April of 2003, Todd was reassigned to C Company, 1-34 AR where he assumed duties as Platoon Leader, 3rd Platoon. On August 30, 2003, Todd and Jenifer Reardon were married in Pennsylvania, nine days before shipping out with his unit in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On Friday, October 31, 2003, Todd was killed by an explosive device as his Humvee traveled on a road between Fallujah and Baghdad. He was 23 years old.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Todd, who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. Today was probably the hardest day the Bryant family has ever faced and my thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude for their sacrifice goes out to them. There are no words that can relieve their pain. Larry and Linda Bryant have raised an extraordinary family. Their oldest son, Tim is a Major in the Marines, their daughter, Tiffany, is a Captain in the Army and Todd, First Lieutenant in the United States Army, recipient of the Meritorious Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal Army Service Ribbon, Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart has been laid to rest in our country's most distinguished military cemetery.  His wife and family have all given a part of themselves today in the loss of their loved one and I hope they know that their son, the goodness he brought to this world and the sacrifice he has made, will not be forgotten.                          ____________________
