There is no question that when you have a robust middle class, it creates the demand that then buys the products from the corporations across this country that want to earn dividends, so that they can share those with their shareholders.  Growing the middle class drives our economy and it creates the jobs, and the people who do those jobs really create the company, they make the company work.  It isn't the shareholders who are down there on the lines, although I believe very much in shareholder equity for workers. I wish I could encourage more of it. Wouldn't that be great if they could all have a part of the indexes that the wealthy invest in? Because they certainly have earned it.  Through good jobs with decent wages, through the transportation and infrastructure bill I hope we can pass this year, which would be one action we could take that would help to give a big boost to this economy from coast to coast, all of that can help lift people's boats across this Nation.  I join in alliance with my two dear colleagues, Congressman Tonko and Congressman Garamendi, who are down here all the time. You are such good Representatives from your respective States, fighting on behalf of the American people.  Most of the rest of the place has gone home, but you are on the job. You remind me of members of my family. They always worked overtime.
