We believe that it is very important to give some stability and competence to the marketplace, to lenders and borrowers and manufacturers, large, medium, and small. I hope the gentleman would continue to consider with his caucus the possibility of having a longer term reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which, as the gentleman knows, expires on September 30.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  We have had many discussions. As the gentleman knows, in the last reauthorization, it was a shorter time period, with many reforms in there. Many feel that those reforms have been ignored. Many feel that the bank provides certain things the private sector is doing.  Knowing that we are in a short-term period, also knowing the threat before America today and the time, we want to make sure that we can have this debate. As for the expiration date, we felt that it was best to extend that out to June in the CR and have that debate later, moving forward, so you are not disrupting any time debating the threat from the terrorists and also doing the work that needs to be done. I do understand the gentleman has talked to me many times about that.
