MURRAY. I respond to the Senator from Illinois, I am as baffled as he is, that every Senator knows the 1872 mining law needs to be reformed. It needs to be reformed in a fair and responsible manner. If, indeed, the mining companies need more mill sites, then the taxpayers ought to get something in return. In fact, the mill site limitation is truly the only part of this law that allows us some control over what is left behind because the mining industry did not want to give and take, they just took, and got their rider put into this bill.
