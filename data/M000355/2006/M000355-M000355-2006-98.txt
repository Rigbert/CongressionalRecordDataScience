 President, I rise today to honor LaJuana Wilcher, a Kentuckian who nobly served the Bluegrass State as secretary for the State's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet, EPPC.  Appointed by the Governor in 2003, Ms. Wilcher will step down as Kentucky's top environmental regulator at the end of this month. As secretary for the EPPC, Ms. Wilcher oversaw many of Kentucky's regulatory agencies, including those that regulate the environment, coal mining, horse racing, banking, insurance, occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, housing, alcoholic beverage control, charitable gaming, and professional boxing and wrestling.  Before serving in the Governor's cabinet, Ms. Wilcher had over three decades of experience in environmental and natural-resources issues. She served in President Ronald Reagan's administration as a biologist and environmental lawyer with the U.S. National Park Service. And under President George H.W. Bush, she served as the Environmental Protection Agency's Assistant Administrator of Water.  Known for being a straight shooter who got things done, Ms. Wilcher dealt with the worst mine disaster in Kentucky in the past 16 years and pushed for tougher mine-safety legislation that was passed by the Kentucky General Assembly. She also spearheaded changes to Kentucky's horse racing industry when she instituted drug testing for horses.  Mr. President, I wish Ms. Wilcher well as she returns to her law practice in Bowling Green, KY. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking her for her dedicated service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and her Nation. She is a true steward of our environment.                          ____________________[Pages S10640-S10641]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       TRIBUTE TO LAJUANA WILCHER  Mr. McCONNELL.
