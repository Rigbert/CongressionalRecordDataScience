Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize the 40th anniversary of the Slovak Day Celebration. In honor of this momentous occasion, a commemorative event will take place on Sunday, July 21, 2013 at the Salvatorian Shrine in Merrillville, Indiana.   The first Slovak Day Celebration took place at the Seven Dolores Shrine in Valparaiso, Indiana in 1973, when Father Joseph Viater, along with Betty and Carl Yurechko, decided that Slovak heritage and culture should be honored in Northwest Indiana with a day of celebration.   Slovak Day has been a great success over the years, and the day is celebrated each year with a Slovak Catholic Mass, followed by traditional Slovak food and performances by Slovak dancers. Throughout the years, many bishops have come to celebrate this significant event, including Bishop Sokol from Slovakia, Bishop Adamec of Pennsylvania, and Bishops Andrew G. Grutka and Dale J. Melczek of the Diocese of Gary, Indiana. Additionally, over the past 40 years, many dedicated volunteers from Slovak churches throughout the region have given their time and efforts to this day.   I would like to take this time to recognize the numerous hardworking committee members for their outstanding dedication to this event. They are Betty Yurechko, Lillian and John Zaborske, Agnes Chervenak, Melissa and Jason Yurechko, Ann Fedorchak, Leona Cupka, Elaine Ruzbasan, Betty Ortiz, Andy Sacek, Irene Horn Riggio, and Reverend John Kalicky.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Slovak Day Celebration. The Slovak community has played an important role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. For their commitment to preserving Slovak heritage, the committee members, church leaders, and volunteers are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
