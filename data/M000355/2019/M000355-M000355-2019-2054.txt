 President, first, today I would like to turn attention to the severe weather that is afflicting communities throughout my home State.  Nearly 20 counties from one end of the State to the other have declared states of emergency in response to historically high water levels. Just moments ago, Governor Matt Bevin putthe entire Commonwealth under a state of emergency to mobilize resources where they are needed most. Many families are evacuating toward safety. Approximately 2,400 people in eastern and southern Kentucky are still without power. Mudslides have closed roads. Bridges are flooded, and emergency personnel have been deployed to rescue stranded drivers and others in danger.  I want to express my gratitude to the first responders working around the clock to keep their communities safe. It may be a difficult road to recovery, but Kentuckians are already pitching in to help their neighbors in need.  My staff and I are ready to work with emergency management officials and will continue to monitor the situation closely.                          ____________________
