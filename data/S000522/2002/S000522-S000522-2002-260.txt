Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I rise today to recognize and commend Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), an organization that has dedicated itself to the well being of some of America's most catastrophically disabled veterans for over 50 years.  PVA traces its origins back to February 1947, when delegates from seven groups of paralyzed veterans from around the country met at the Hines VA Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, to form a national organization to address the inadequacy of veterans health care, specifically for severely disabled veterans. At this meeting they immediately set some very specific goals, including increasing funding for the needs of spinal cord injured veterans and establishing a grant program to provide specially-adapted housing so that paralyzed veterans could leave the hospital and live more independent lives at home.  PVA was Congressionally chartered as a veterans' service organization on August 11, 1971 and since that time has continued to develop a unique expertise on a wide variety of issues involving the special needs of its members--veterans of the armed forces who have experienced spinal cord injury or dysfunction. PVA has more than 40 chapters and sub-chapters nationwide and nearly 20,000 members. In addition to its Washington, D.C. headquarters, PVA operates 58 service offices around the country to serve the needs of all veterans seeking Department of Veterans Affairs' claims and benefits.  PVA has used its expertise to become a leading advocate for quality health care not only for spinal cord injured veterans, but for all other veterans as well. They continue to press for research and education addressing spinal cord injury and dysfunction. They also assist veterans who apply to receive benefits that are available as a result of military service.  Mr. Speaker, for 16 years, PVA has co-authored The Independent Budget: A Comprehensive Policy Document Created by Veterans for Veterans, in cooperation with the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), AMVETS, and The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). The Independent Budget takes a comprehensive look at the current and future needs of veterans and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and makes specific recommendations for federal funding. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have found The Independent Budget to be a very useful tool in developing our Committee's recommendations for veterans funding. I wholeheartedly recommend that all Members of the House, if they have not already done so, obtain a copy and read it.  PVA created the Technology and Research Foundation in 1975, now named the Spinal Cord Research Foundation (SCRF), to support research to alleviate, and ultimately end, medical and functional consequences of paralysis. In 1980, PVA endowed $1 million for a Professorship in SCI Medicine at Stanford University. PVA also created the Spinal Cord Injury Education and Training Foundation (ETF) in 1987 to support innovative education and training programs designed to assist individuals with spinal cord injury or dysfunction, their families, and doctors who provide direct care. In 1988, the PVA-EPVA Center for Neuroscience and Regeneration Research at Yale University was founded in order to focus the energies and talents of some of the world's leading scientists in the development of new treatments, and ultimately a cure, for spinal cord injury and related disorders. It is a model of inter-institutional cooperation, that brings together the strengths of Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Yale University, all with the singular goal of restoration of function in people with spinal cord dysfunction.  PVA also coordinates the activities of two coalitions of professional, payer, and consumer groups that develop clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) defining standards of care for people with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. The Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine, composed of 19 organizations, has published six professional guidelines and three consumer guides to date. The Multiple Sclerosis Council, made up of 23 organizations, has likewise published CPGs.  PVA's Government Relations staff is well-known here on Capitol Hill and has been especially helpful to our Committee as we have developed and moved legislation to improve the delivery of services and benefits to America's 25 million veterans. Its Advocacy Program is a leading advocate for civil rights and opportunities that maximize independence of individuals who have experienced spinal cord injury or disease, or other severe disabilities and PVA played an important role in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). It continues its advocacy as an active member of the Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities.  Likewise, PVA's Architecture Program has played an important role in the lives of severely disabled veterans. It assists the private sector and government at all levels with quality accessible design and construction of VA facilities, affordable and accessible housing, and adoption of appropriate and uniform accessibility standards and codes. PVA's Health Analysis Program keeps a constant eye on the performance of the VA health care system as well as other health care systems in the public and private sector.  PVA also runs a Sports and Recreation Program dedicated to promoting a range of activities for its members and other people with disabilities, with special emphasis on activitiesthat enhance lifetime health and fitness. The organization sponsors the PVA National Bass Trail which is officially sanctioned by the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.). Likewise, PVA created the National Trapshoot Circuit to give individuals with disabilities a chance to participate in the recreational and competitive sport of trapshooting. Most notably, PVA co-sponsors the National Veterans Wheelchair Games and other wheelchair sports programs along with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Games encourage veterans to become aware of their abilities and potential, as well as wheelchair sports that are available, while promoting a spirit of healthy activity and fellowship.  Mr. Speaker, those of us who work with PVA on a regular basis, we have come to rely on the dedication and expertise that this organization brings to Capitol Hill. I want to recognize the hard work and sacrifice that all of their officers, members and volunteers have made in order to improve the lives of their fellow veterans and fellow Americans.  Mr. Speaker, as America continues our war on terrorism, like the wars of the last century against fascism, nazism and communism, the brunt of the battles will be borne by our men and women in uniform. Our nation has a sacred obligation, as President Abraham Lincoln said so eloquently, ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.'' And we especially have an obligation to care for those who have suffered the most to protect our freedoms, such as paralyzed veterans.  As Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, it is an honor to work hand-in-hand with Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the other veterans service organizations as we seek to improve the lives of paralyzed veterans and all of America's veterans and their families.                          ____________________
