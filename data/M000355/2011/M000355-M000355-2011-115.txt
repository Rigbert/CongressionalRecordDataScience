 President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments and achievements of lifetime educator Carl Weaver. For almost 40 years, Carl devoted himself to teaching young Kentuckians history, civics, and psychology while also coaching little league baseball in the afternoons and the South Laurel High School boys' baseball team.  Carl began teaching as an undergraduate student while at the University of the Cumberlands in 1963, at the age of 19. After graduation, Carl spent 6 years teaching in Ohio before returning to Laurel County, KY, where he earned his master's degree from Union College while simultaneously teaching full-time and raising his three children, Wayne, Karen (Davenport), and Whitney.  Carl witnessed many changes during his 33-year career teaching in Laurel County, but he cherishes most the time he spent teaching his own kids--Carl had each of his three children in at least one class in high school and also had the opportunity to teach Karen psychology her freshman year at Sue Bennett College. Carl never had a problem with any of his children in the classroom, recalling, ``I was probably harder on them than on other students.''  For Carl, it was always about the kids. Carl has an amazing passion for teaching and he truly enjoyed and appreciated the students. ``That's what it's really all about. You're teaching the student, not the subject,'' Carl says. Carl still misses teaching, but he was forced to retire at the 27-year mark due to ongoing complications with his legs as a result of his diagnosis with polio as a child.  These obstacles don't hinder Carl's spirit however, as he continues to stay busy by helping out in his son's produce stand on East Ky. 80. Carl admits he's enjoyed a good life. As he looks back now on his teaching career however, he says he doesn't regret a thing.  Mr. President, Carl Weaver is a humble, selfless Kentuckian who dedicated his life to educating the youth of Kentucky. I thank him for his passion and the wisdom he has shared with the people of our great Commonwealth. The Laurel County Sentinel Echo published an article in the spring of 2011 to honor Carl's career and accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, Spring 2011]Busier since retirement: Carl Weaver works concessions, mans a produce  stand and spends time with grandchildren. And like teaching, he loves                           every minute of it.                           (By Nita Johnson)       He walks with two canes due to rheumatoid arthritis,      another storyline to the     limp he's had all his life since suffering from polio at age      3.       But the canes and the limp don't deter long-time educator      Carl Weaver. In fact, since his retirement from the Laurel      County school system in 2002, Weaver has been busier than      ever.       In fact, Weaver depicts the word ``busy.'' With nearly 40      years of teaching experience under his belt, Weaver has      always been active in the school, in his personal life, and      in his community.       Even while raising his three children, his life has      revolved around academics and athletics. During school hours,      the classroom setting found him instructing students about      history, civics, and psychology. During summer breaks, he      taught psychology at Sue Bennett College.       After-school hours found Weaver on the baseball field where      he coached the South Laurel High School baseball team for six      years. When not on the baseball field, Weaver was the      academic team coach for Laurel County High School, and when      the county school split into two high schools, he remained on      at South Laurel High School as academic team coach, garnering      over 20 years in that position. During this time he was an      unyielding advocate for the establishment of elementary      school academic teams--a goal he not only saw accomplished      but saw its success and contributions to the educational      programs of the school system where he taught for 33 years.       As if that weren't enough, Weaver also coached baseball for      the local Little League teams, coached basketball for the      Laurel-London Optimist Club, and served as a 4-H leader. His      ties to the baseball field didn't end when he retired in      2002.       ``I help with the concession stands at South Laurel now,''      Weaver said. ``My son, Whitney, is assistant baseball coach      there.''       Weaver's teaching career began in 1963 after graduation      from Cumberland College (now University of the Cumberlands).      He attended Sue Bennett College for two years prior to      transferring to Cumberland College to pursue his bachelor's      degree. After college graduation, he moved to Zanesville,      Ohio, and taught seventh- and eighth-grade students for six      years before returning to Laurel County.       ``I was an undergraduate student and I was only 19 when I      started teaching,'' he said.       He earned his master's degree from Union College while      still teaching full-time and raising his own children.       Weaver saw many changes over the span of his career, but      his focus always remained on the students who came through      his classes. Three of those students were his own children--     Wayne, Karen (Davenport), and Whitney.       ``I had all three in at least one class during high      school,'' he said, ``and I had Karen in her first year at Sue      Bennett for psychology class. I never had any problems out of      my children in class. I was probably harder on them than on      other students.''       Many of his former students approach him even now, some of      which he said he had in class as many as 30 years ago.       ``I always enjoyed teaching. I enjoyed the students,''      Weaver said. ``You meet so many different students and see      the uniqueness of each one, their personality. That's really      what it's all about is the kids. You're teaching the student,      not the subject matter.''       He related that he still misses being in the classroom but      ongoing problems with his legs prompted him to retire after      reaching the 27-year mark.       ``I taught for 33 years but the six years in Ohio didn't      count toward my retirement time,'' he explained.       But retirement didn't provide time off from being busy. In      fact, between his own activities and those with his      grandchildren, Weaver says he has more to do now than in the      past.       Currently Weaver and his wife of 48 years, Pearl, are      helping out in their son's produce stand, located on East Ky.      80 beside Arnold's Place, while they continue to raise      strawberries and raspberries on their farm in the Laurel      River community. That farm produces the fruits and vegetables      that the Weavers display in their produce market--homemade      strawberry preserves made by their son Wayne and wife      Michelle. Jars of bread-and-butter pickles also adorn the      counter of the market, another example of the Weaver's      farming products.       ``Good to see you,'' Carl Weaver greets the customers      coming in to the produce market during the day, and their      parting is accentuated with, ``Thanks for stopping by. Come      back and see us.''       A friendly and informal manner from a man who holds his      honorary doctorate in humanities, but the nature of his      greeting is reason for the doctorate degree presented by his      brother Neal, then president of Louisiana Baptist University      in Shreveport.       ``He gave me an honorary doctorate in humanities because of      my long years of work with young people, in the classroom and      in the community,'' Weaver said.       ``It's been a good life,'' he added. ``When I started      college I planned to pursue a law degree. But somewhere along      the lines I decided I wanted to be a teacher. I guess some      people look back and see visions of better things but I      enjoyed teaching and I never regretted it.''                          ____________________
