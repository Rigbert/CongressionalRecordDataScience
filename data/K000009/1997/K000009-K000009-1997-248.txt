Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a man in my district who embodied the spirit of America. Joseph Wlodarz died to this life on August 5, 1997 at the age of 85 years.  Joseph ``Fudgie'' Wlodarz came to East Toledo when he was 13 years old. An all-city football player at Toledo's Central Catholic High School, Joe went on to play with local semi-professional teams, the Jack Frost Sugars, the Vargo Coals, and the Birmingham Ads. In addition to his passion for football, Joe also played basketball, baseball, and softball. He passed on his passion and his skill to hundreds of youngsters at Holy Rosary Church and School, where he coached children in these sports for 60 years. His son noted at his passing, ``He just loved to coach kids.'' Wlodarz Field at Ravine Park in East Toledo bears his name, a testament to his love of sport.  Joseph Wlodarz worked for 27 years at the former Unitcast Corp. in Toledo, where he left his mark as well. While at Unitcast, he organized UAW Local 48, and served many times as the union's president. He also worked as the labor-management coordinator.  Dubbed ``The Mayor of Birmingham''--(the close-knit Hungarian neighborhood of East Toledo in which he lived--Joe took an active interest in the neighborhood's community and civic affairs, although he never held an elected office. He was a founder of the Birmingham Hall of Fame, helped organize the 20th Ward Democratic Club, was a member of the East Side Recreation Board, served on the city of Toledo advisory panel for parks and recreation, and labored to establish the East Toledo Family Center where he also served on the board.  Joseph ``Fudgie'' Wlodarz' life is perhaps best summed up in his eldest son's tribute to him, which is a most fitting epitaph, ``He was never too concerned about making much money. He was always for his community and neighborhood, union, and helping people.''  Our heartfelt sympathy to Joe's wife Garnet, his sons James, Jack, Joseph, Jr., and Steve, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We mourn your loss, but trust you will find comfort in his memory and the legacy of a life truly well spent and devoted to others.                          ____________________
