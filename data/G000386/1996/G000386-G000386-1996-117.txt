 President, why are the taxpayers up in arms about Washington, DC? I think it is because they know how to spend their money better than Washington does. Americans are overtaxed. Ask any of them. Washington is also overweight. Today American workers work longer, they work harder, just so that Washington can spend more of their money. Taxpayers sacrifice more, I am sorry to say, so that Washington can spend more. That is just not right.  I want to make it possible for taxpayers to keep more of their own money. Part of that is to get Congress then to stop spending so darn much of it in the first place. That is why whenever I see a grossly wasteful program, I feel obliged to squeeze the fat out of it. And I urge my colleagues to help in that effort.  Maritime subsidies, the subject of this legislation, is one, one blatant example of how Washington wastes taxpayers' hard-earned money. It is a case study in how Washington turns common sense upside down. Instead of competition for lower costs, this program creates a monopoly that raises costs. Now we all expect competition to lower costs, and in most instances it does lower costs, but the program that is in this legislation creates a monopoly. And you know what happens most of the time when you have a monopoly? That ends up raising costs.  Instead of supporting the national security, as this program purports to do, this program is becoming irrelevant to national security.  This program delivers to the taxpayers higher costs and no national security benefit. Should that not be a clue that this program is wasteful? I know how the taxpayers would answer that question, Mr. President, but I am not sure yet how my 99 other colleagues will answer that question.  There is an old way and a new way of doing business in Washington. The old way is to spend money to get reelected. Just tax the citizenry more to pay for that effort. The money goes to wealthy companies--we call that corporate welfare--and it goes to powerful unions. It becomes corporate and union welfare. They keep getting more money from the Treasury and then they have clout. They pay contributions to reelect friends; that way they do not have to be accountable for the taxpayers' money.  A very ineffective program can exist and survive in Washington simply because it has so much clout. That is the political game in Washington. That is the political game that the grassroots of America, if people are candid with you, are sick and tired of. That is also how Washington wastes the taxpayers' money. To Washington, it is not waste. No, it is not waste. It is currency. It is the cost of getting reelected. That is the old way of doing business in Washington.  The new way, beginning with this Congress, is to be frugal. The era of big Government is over. Even President Clinton said that in his State of theUnion Message. Of course, even big-spending liberals are saying that. We are a vote or two shy of the balanced budget constitutional amendment, and maybe then, eventually, of getting a balanced budget. The days of fiscal responsibility are nearly upon us.  That is why, Mr. President, I view this vote on this bill, my amendments to this bill, as a test case for this Congress, a test between doing business the old way and doing business the new way. Taxpayers are tired of the burden we place on the taxpayers to feed the appetite of Washington bureaucracy. It is time for Washington to sacrifice for a change.  Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to share my concerns about the bill before the Senate. That bill is H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act. I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer a few amendments to address these problems.  Frankly, if these amendments pass, I intend to support the bill. When I talk about supporting and when I talk about amendments, because of my historical opposition to maritime legislation subsidies, the subsidies that are in the legislation, people might feel, well, I am gearing up to talk this bill to death and to not let it come to a vote. I have assured the leader that we are talking about minutes on amendments and some time for me to make opening statements. The legislative process in this body on this bill, even though maybe the outcome may not be to my liking, should work its will.  Mr. President, my criticism of maritime subsidies has centered upon the fact that taxpayers and consumers have suffered under the burden of monopoly. Let me emphasize that monopoly, maritime rates, and also hidden back-door subsidies, all meant to materially and beneficially impact our national security, but all the time we have these monopoly rates and these hidden back-door subsidies, the sad commentary is that it only marginally assists. I want to emphasize, only marginally assists our national defense.  This may be one reason that the Defense Department resisted so strongly having to pay for H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act. The Department of Defense resists paying for this cost, and yet it is being offered to us as necessary for our national security. Who is more concerned about the national security of the United States of America and our responsibilities in the world than, of course, the Department of Defense? Yet, let me say to you, this bill is being offered as necessary for our national security, yet the Department of Defense resists strongly having to pay for H.R. 1350.  It seems these subsidies have far more to do with maritime union welfare and with corporate welfare and much less to do with the defense of our Nation. The maritime union welfare focus is clearly borne out by the 1993 maritime decision memo prepared by President Clinton's very own Cabinet officials. These Cabinet officials told President Clinton that the primary purpose of these maritime subsidies is to pay high-priced wages and benefits of seafarers. This is not Republican Senator Chuck Grassley saying why we are having this bill before the Senate. This is the President's own Cabinet people saying that the primary purpose of these subsidies is to pay high-priced wages and benefits of seafarers.  Mr. President, now, again, besides the President's own Cabinet, I am not alone in opposition to our current system of maritime subsidies. Prominent public interest in taxpayer organizations such as the Citizens Against Government Waste, the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and Americans for Tax Reform all oppose H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act. These are the people who issue report cards at election time. These are the people that your constituents--who expect you to be fiscally responsible--look at how they rate you, as fiscally responsible or fiscally irresponsible, who put out reports, and legitimately so, in the spirit of free speech and the process of representative government, to tell you or your constituents, are you pro-taxpayer or anti-taxpayer? These organizations oppose this legislation.  I might add, however, that these groups do support the changes I seek, the amendments I offer. They support my amendments because this is clearly a taxpayer/good government issue. My amendments are also supported by a number of retired admirals.  Now, for my colleagues on the floor who are so closely and legitimately associated with uniform military leadership of America, I want to remind you the very same admirals I am talking about are the ones who had previously been listed as supporters of this legislation but had been given some sparse information about it. Their comments are revealing.  I refer, first of all, to a letter I received June 8, 1996, from Vice Adm. George P. Steele, U.S. Navy, retired. I will not read the entire letter, but he said in part:       My signature is on a form submitted by the American      Security Council. I only signed that form to gain time for a      mature study of a then-pending bill which could have resulted      in subsidies for the VLCC's, and now that I see how my name      is being used, I much regret it. I was invited to help that      council formulate positions and I met with their      representative, and I have not heard from them since, but I      am not surprised that my opinions do not suit them.       I do believe that this country needs and should pay for      only that part of the U.S. Merchant Marine that is configured      in type and numbers to support our authenticated defense      requirements. I am opposed to the continuation of Federal      programs mostly designed to line the pockets of unions,      owners, and shipbuilders unwilling to give up grossly      inefficient practices. We desperately need a fresh start, not      a continuing jobs program.  Signed, ``George P. Steele, Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy, retired.''  Then we have a Karl J. Bernstein. This is a handwritten note that I received in June 1996:       Thank you for your letter of May 30, 1996. It was most      informative. Had I been aware of the facts, I certainly would      not have agreed to the Maritime Reform and Security Act of      1995, as recommended by the American Security Council. Their      pitch was the usual one: ``We need adequate sealift.'' Of      course, everyone will agree to that.  Then I have a letter from Rear Adm. J. L. Abbott, retired, U.S. Navy, June 11, 1996:       Of all the words, those quoted from a Defense Department      memo--  That is the one that I said the Clinton Cabinet presented to the President to make a final choice on this legislation.  I will start over:       Of all the words, those quoted from a Defense Department      memo strike me as most compelling. The issue of two major      U.S.-flag container ship operators disposing of their U.S.-     flag fleet is primarily an economic policy issue rather than      a national security issue and should be treated accordingly.      I certainly support additional hearings by both the Senate      Commerce Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee to      probe exhaustively into the above-quoted statement in order      to find out where the truth lies.  Mr. President, my staff has just advised me that when I was quoting from that last letter and I referred to the Defense Department memo, I said that was the very same memo the Cabinet people had given to the President for him to make his judgment on. I was in error. That memo referred to in Admiral Abbott's letter was the memo of former DOD Assistant Secretary Colin McMillen. That was Colin McMillen's quote I just gave.  I could give a lot of letters. I want to finish with this one. These are Charles Minter's comments, a vice admiral, and this is penciled in at the top of a questionnaire that I sent to him asking him to fill out. He said:       I greatly appreciate your bringing to my attention facts of      which I was previously unaware. I strongly support additional      hearings at which voices in opposition can be heard so that      legislation which best deals with our sealift capability to      be effected.  I only bring these letters to my colleagues' attention because there is going to be a lot of weight put on by the proponents of this legislation in support of this legislation, saying that we have all these retired admirals who are saying this legislation is absolutely essential. I didn't know what sort of reaction I would get from these admirals. Obviously, all of them did not write back saying that they disagreed with their original position. But I would like to have my colleagues take with some caution this reference to their support, because we have a lot of these admirals who have questioned the use of their name.  We also have Admirals Minter, Edward Martin, Victor Long, Theodore Almstedt, Robert Stroh, and I have already talked about Karl Bernstein. These folks particularly were on record that we needed further hearings on this bill. We worked very hard with the chairman of the Commerce Committee to get hearings, and he consented to have those hearings, and they never materialized because of legislative responsibilities. But the reason for further hearings was that, at the time this bill had a hearing on it, opponents asked for an opportunity to be heard and there was no opportunity for the opposition to be heard. So the committee record, obviously, is not complete, because you should have both a balance between those who support legislation and those against the legislation. But the leadership wanted to move this bill out of committee very rapidly. That caused me some concern a year ago. I wish it hadn't happened, but it does happen, and when those hurdles are crossed, we are where we are now. So, hopefully, some of these things could have been worked out in committee.  Now, these admirals that I referred to also support my amendments to, first of all, restrict tax-supported seafarer war bonuses to those given regular military, so that there is a parity between our full-time military people who get war bonuses along with seafarers who get bonuses. I will show you where there is a terrible distortion and unfairness in that.  Seafarers, unlike people in the military, reserve some right to serve when called on, and our full-time military people do not have that right. So I have an amendment dealing with that subject. The next one requires subsidized U.S. carriers to provide both U.S.-flag vessels and crews in meeting its military obligations and does not allow them to substitute foreign flags and foreign crews for any or all of their military sustainment voyage responsibilities.  That amendment is a direct result of something Senator Lott said before he was floor leader, when this issue was up, as I referred to well over a year ago, when it was brought up late in the evening on a Friday before we were taking a recess. He said that we have to have this program because we have to make sure that American merchant mariners with American-flag ships are available to transport our materiel. This legislation does not require that. This legislation allows contracting for non-American-flag ships to do that.  Fourth, we would provide for the Department of Defense, and other agencies, buy-America type laws that protect taxpayers from price gouging. Again, all of these admirals are listed by the American Security Council as supporters of this bill before us. Yet, when given some facts--and we mailed them the Rubin-Clinton maritime memo, which is a memo that I previously referred to that the Cabinet sent to the President to make his decision as to whether or not he should get behind this legislation. These admirals, particularly after reading the Rubin-Clinton maritime memo, agreed that my amendment should pass and that further hearings should have been held.  I offer these as basic commonsense amendments. They are protaxpayer and prodefense amendments. If we continue to subsidize maritime in the name of national defense then the U.S.-flag carriers and seafarers must serve when called. It must not be optional. It is not optional for the people right now who are leaving the United States on their way to Kuwait because of problems in Iraq with Saddam Hussein, and the President defines those problems as needing another 5,000 troops on the ground in Kuwait. You saw those families on television last night with tears in their eyes but with an understanding that this is their job. And without question, they just pack up and go when called. The people operating our maritime fleets have an option.  Of course, as with any taxpayer subsidies, taxpayer protections ought to be provided. So my amendments will do that.  I want to highlight a few problems, and be more specific than I have with H.R. 1350.  Problem No. 1: It is simple--maritime union and corporate welfare. If someone told you, Mr. President, that the Clinton administration was trying to mislead us, someone might respond, ``What's new?'' What would be new is after receiving clear evidence that this ploy involves a jobs program for the maritime union that the Republican-controlled Congress went along with it. And the Republican Congress, when I am done, is going to know that this is what this is. How people vote is their choice. But it is not the Clinton administration that is misleading us. We bear some responsibility on the majority side of the aisle for that. Earlier this year, Citizens Against Government Waste delivered to every Senate office such evidence. And it is this internal White House memo from Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, to President Clinton discussing maritime subsidies. This memo represents the deliberations and conclusions of the political heads of 16 different executive branch agencies--departments, and agencies. We have a memo from the President's own people to the President. I suggest that it was never intended that this would ever get into the public domain. This memo now shows that 15 of 16 agencies supported a deficit-neutral maritime subsidy option that--this is from the memo--``would meet the Department of Defense maximum military requirements.''  There were three options in this memo. There was one of deficit neutral. That means, if you change your program, there is enough money someplace else in the budget to pay for it, or it is not going to cost any more than what is in the budget presently for that program. You have 15 out of 16 agencies. These are appointed by a Democratic President. They support a deficit-neutral option. Only the Transportation Secretary opposed this prodefense, taxpayer-friendly option because--again from the memo--``it provides less support than is sought by the industry and its supporters.'' Fifteen out of sixteen Democratic heads of agencies say we ought to take this option because it is deficit neutral, and it would still meet our military needs. You have 1 out of the 16, the Department of Transportation Secretary, who suggests that the other 15 ought to be ignored because their option provides less support than is sought by the industry and its supporters.  Here is the President of the United States representing 269 million people, the only political office representing the entire Nation, who is given a memo by 15 of his advisers saying here is a revenue-neutral option that will meet our military needs. But he has one who says, ``Well, forget about the military needs. Forget about being deficit neutral. The industry wants this, and its supporters want this.''  So instead of listening to the people, instead of listening to 15 of your 16 department heads, you get a recommendation from one person who says it is based upon what the industry wants and what its supporters want.  And that is what we have before us. What is truly remarkable about this memo is the admission that ``subsidies are needed principally to offset the higher wages of U.S. mariners.'' President Clinton ignored the plan supported by 15 of his agency heads including, let me say, the agency that is concerned and which administers our national security--the Defense Department --and sent to Congress a far more expensive bill that 3 years later is basically included in H.R. 1350.  In other words, for President Clinton, the era of expensive Government is not over. With regard to the maritime labor subsidies he still supports wasteful Washington spending, and the subsidies that that spending means.  We all thought that this Congress was going to reform welfare as we know it. If we can eliminate welfare affecting the poor, you would think that we could eliminate welfare of the wealthy maritime companies such as Sealand and powerful maritime unions. But, of course, as we all know, welfare is great, if you can get it.  I suppose that might be what MIT's Defense and Arms Control Studies Institute Director, Harvey Sapolsky, was driving at when he was quoted in the August 1991 Defense News. He said this, and I quote: ``Despite any accompanying rhetoric about national security, subsidies for the Merchant Marine fulfill the commonplace desire of obtaining a livelihood without the burden of having to compete to earn a living.''  So I want to get it straight from the beginning of this debate. Both the Clinton administration officials and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology defense experts agree that maritime subsidies are little more than welfare.  What I find really interesting in this whole approach is that Members ofCongress--particularly my friends on the other side of the aisle--denounce corporate welfare. And you even have Republicans saying that because we had in our tax bill of a year ago $30 billion for elimination of corporate welfare. So you are on to something. Yet, I will bet most Democrats plan to vote in favor of H.R. 1350 which will give wealthy maritime corporations hard-earned taxpayer dollars that these companies hardly need; hardly need.  For instance, after years of opposing subsidies, Sealand looks to gain the most from H.R. 1350. Why should taxpayers of this great country, people that work 40 hours or more a week, or families where two people work and can't pay their bills at the end of the week because so much of their income goes for taxes--why should these hard-working American taxpayers subsidize one of the world's largest and most successful container vessel companies that in recent years has posted record-breaking profits? Are Democrats for corporate welfare? Are these the Democrats, who have awakened Republicans to the crime of corporate welfare so that we put $30 billion of reduction of corporate welfare in our tax bill--are they for corporate welfare now when they support this bill? It appears so. But now what is really up? It is that, while Republicans complained about the millions upon millions of dollars that the AFL-CIO is spending to return Congress to Democratic Party control, my Republican-controlled Congress is on the verge of approving $1 billion in subsidies for some of the most politically active labor unions in the country.  How many Tuesdays and Wednesdays that Republicans meet--this is no clandestine meeting. These meetings are on everybody's schedule. How often do we meet as a Republican Party --I suppose the Democrats meet as the Democratic Party, and they may talk about the same things we talk about but from a different perspective--how many times do we meet and the subject is always coming up of the $35 million that the AFL-CIO is raising by taxing their members more--that $35 million is on top of what they are paying in labor union dues--this $35 million for the campaign for Democrats to regain control of the U.S. Senate?  We are always talking about that. We are nervous about that. We think it is awful that 40 percent of the union members who vote Republican are taxed by their leadership to run these horrible ads, and let me say intellectually dishonest ads, scaring the old people of America against Republicans. Forty percent of those union members vote Republican. They are taxed to run these ads against the political philosophy that they agree with, and they do not even have anything to say about it because this administration rescinded a rule that the Supreme Court gave the minority of American union members the right to ask for their dues back, that portion of which goes for political education. That rule was rescinded by this administration, so that 40 percent of the union members this year pay these dues to perpetuate a lie on television.  We are concerned about that in our Republican caucus, and yet here we have a Republican-controlled Congress on the verge of approving $1 billion in subsidies for some of the most politically active labor unions in this country.  Now, I want to give this some perspective because this is not just $1 billion, and this is not just $35 million that is being spent for this advertising now; this is real money per seafarer.  In an old report, in 1977, by the former House Merchant Marine Subcommittee ranking Republican, because the Republicans were in the minority then, Congressman McCloskey of California said all of the AFL-CIO members each averaged about 11 cents towards campaign contributions.  Obviously, that is way up now with the $35 million.  But there is a contrast between the rest of the AFL-CIO and the Seafarers International Union that contributed $29.06 to political activity. The Marine Engineers Beneficial Association gave a whopping $56.81 per seafarer, which is over 500 times what the average AFL-CIO member gave.  So here we Republicans stand today about to approve a 10-year $1 billion subsidy to pay maritime labor which, at least back in the 1970's, was about 500 times more politically active than the rest of the AFL-CIO unions.  Remember, that is what the Clinton Cabinet told us these subsidies were for--to pay for high-cost maritime labor unions. And I want to read that quote again. Secretary Pena said that you could not go with that option that 15 out of 16 Democrat agency heads wanted because it provided ``less support than is sought by the industry and its supporters.''  Now, that is problem No. 1 of this bill.  Problem No. 2 is that the Department of Defense already has VISA. VISA is an acronym for Volunteer Intermodal Sealift Agreement--VISA, V-I-S-A, Volunteer Intermodal Sealift Agreement. We are being told that this bill, H.R. 1350, will provide our national defense with a wonderful new intermodal transportation system that is crucial in time of national emergency. What is not commonly known is that VISA--again, the Volunteer Intermodal Sealift Agreement--is already in place and will be used to implement H.R. 1350.  Most U.S.-flag carriers have already transferred from the Sealift Readiness Program to VISA. The key point is legal authority already exists for VISA, and that is the Defense Production Act of 1950, and therefore H.R. 1350 and S. 1139 are not needed--not needed unless, of course, you want to funnel welfare subsidies to maritime unions, as revealed in the Rubin-Clinton memo.  So not only is this a high-cost program, but it adds little national security benefit. What kind of a deal is that for the already heavily burdened taxpayers of this great country, people who are spending for State, local, and Federal taxation 40 cents. A Washington bureaucracy is going to waste this money.  Problem No. 3 is that in the process of consideration of this legislation and building grassroots support for it, the active and retired military was misinformed. So some would ask the question, is this merely labor and corporate welfare? And, if so, why does our military support H.R. 1350 and S. 1139? The answer is simple. The Rubin-Clinton memo is evidence of the real position of our defense officials--not this bill. They offered a deficit-neutral plan that would subsidize their true military requirements--as few as 20 U.S.-flag vessels.  But when the Commander in Chief--and that is President Clinton--ignores his defense officials--he ignored the Department of Defense; he ignored 14 other agency heads--and he chooses a more expensive plan, the subsidies that are now included in this bill, then, of course, at that point you know he is the Commander in Chief. The military heads have no other choice but to publicly support their Commander in Chief's decision. Anybody participating in defense budget hearings has experienced firsthand this problem. Military leaders have to fall in line with the Commander in Chief.  But what about all of those retired admirals who support the Maritime Security Act? You can legitimately ask, shouldn't their view be entertained with some degree of authority because of their lifetime commitment to the national security of our country?  It has become clear to me that these retired admirals lent their name to an effort for which they had few reliable facts. Certainly, they did not know about the specific problems with the bill, nor did they know anything about the Defense Department's position, and they surely did not know about the Rubin-Clinton maritime memo.  As I stated earlier, I wrote to a number of these retired admirals giving them a copy of the Rubin-Clinton maritime memo, and I also sent them other information.  I received those very interesting responses that I have already quoted from. Some felt that they had not been fully informed and now support, at the very least, further hearings, and some support these amendments.  Problem No. 4 is that we have adequate sealift capacity with or without these subsidies. Now, here you get to the nitty-gritty of this legislation. It has been the same nitty-gritty for 50 years that we have been trying to promote a strong maritime industry. The excuse is we need it for our national security. I say, and the Department of Defense says, in a deficit-neutral way, with one of the other three options,their demands for the shipment of materiel in wartime can be met.  U.S.-flag companies have made it clear that their vessels will be available for national defense sealift if they reflag. In fact, our Government makes certain that, if they reflag, they flag under a country that allows the United States to maintain control over the vessels. The Defense Department Joint Chiefs of Staff prepared a definitive analysis of the sealift capacity and availability. It is included in the MRS Mobility Review Study, Bottom-Up Review update.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an unclassified table from this study, which details the projected sealift capacity upon which our military can depend.  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   TABLE C-17.--(U) FISCAL YEAR 2001 PROJECTED SEALIFT ASSETS WITHOUT MARITIME REFORM                                                                                                        [Unclassified]                                                                     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                    Fleet                                Ship type                  Number         SqFt capacity       TEU capacity      Cube capacity  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RRF.........................................
