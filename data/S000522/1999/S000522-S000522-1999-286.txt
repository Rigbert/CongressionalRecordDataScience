Mr. Speaker, I recently had the pleasure of attending a forum on ``The Upsurge of Anti-Semitism in Russia'' sponsored by the American Jewish Committee at its 93rd annual meeting. This forum was attended by several Members of Congress and provided a useful opportunity for representatives of the AJC and Members of Congress to exchange their thoughts on the rise of anti-Semitism in Russia and the response of Congress.  In this connection, I distributed a statement regarding the March 23 passage of H. Con. Res. 37, a resolution that condemned the anti-Semitic statements made by certain members of the Russian State Duma, as well as commending fair-minded members of the Duma for their efforts to condemn such statements. This resolution passed the House of Representatives unanimously. As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I was proud to have introduced this resolution in the House, along with every member of the Helsinki Commission. A companion resolution in the Senate, S. Con. Res. 19, has been introduced by Commission Co-chairman Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Ranking Commissioner Senator Frank Lautenberg.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I submit this statement for the Record.            Statement of the Honorable Christopher H. Smith       Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to meet      with you today, at this 93rd annual meeting of the American      Jewish Committee and the forum on ``Confronting the New      Upsurge of Anti-Semitism in Russia.''       With the fall of the Soviet Union, many of the ``hidden''      ills of that society that had been ``frozen'' by a      totalitarian regime devoted to superficial ``order'' re-     emerged. One of these was open anti-Semitism. Freedom of the      press has given rise to countless anti-Semitic publications      and leaflets. As you know, two suspicious explosions took      place in Moscow recently near the Maria Roshcha and Chorale      synagogues. These are only the most recent instances of arson      or suspected arson against these two synagogues. Other      synagogues and Jewish cemeteries in the former Soviet Union      and Russia have been hit as well.       In post-Soviet Russia, the residue of official anti-Semitic      propaganda of the Soviet era--disguised by Moscow as ``anti-     Zionism''--was bound to find a certain reception among      certain less-discriminating elements. These attitudes, freed      from the constraints of the Iron Curtain and now aided by the      Internet and an unrestrained press, and then reinforced and      cross-pollinated by neo-Nazis and racists throughout the      world. In their fervent anti-communism, some extreme      nationalists have attempted to present a distorted picture of      Jews as allies of communists destroying Russia during the      Soviet period. In Russia today the communists blame Jews for      being allies of capitalists destroying Russia. Finally, the      economic malaise experienced in Russia has engendered hatred      intolerance against not only Jews, but toward many ethnic      minorities, especially the so-called ``dark people'' from the      Caucasus.       It is deplorable when vandals and hate-mongers attempt to      spread bigotry in any society, but we must admit that such      unfortunate incidents do not take place only in Russia. And,      I have yet to meet any member of the Russian Jewish community      who wants to return to the Soviet period. But I--and I know I      can speak for other Members of the House of Representatives--     have been outraged by the antics and attitudes that have been      exhibited by some members of the Russian Duma, especially in      the ranks of the Communist Party.       In December of last year, Mr. Viktor Ilyukhin, a Communist      Party member and chairman of the Duma security committee,      stated that Yeltsin's ``Jewish entourage'' is responsible for      alleged genocide against the Russian people. Another      Communist Party member, retired General Albert Makashov,      speaking at public rallies, referred to ``the Yids'' and      other ``reformers and democrats'' as responsible for Russia's      problems and threatened to make up a list of targets and      ``send them to the other world.''       Incidentally, I have seen films of Mr. Makashov's      performance. It is quite sobering. I can only say, ``Heaven      help the Russian people and the world,'' if he and his ilk      ever do triumph.       In fairness to the many conscientious Russians inside and      outside of the government, these anti-Semitic statements were      widely condemned in Russia. In response to the public outcry,      both in Russia and abroad, Communist Party chairman Zyuganov      explained that the Party had nothing against ``Jews,'' just      ``Zionism.'' When fair-minded members of the Duma attempted      to pass a resolution condemning Makashov's statement, it was      voted down by the communist majority.       The U.S. Congress, though, has reacted much differently. On      March 23 of this year, the House of Representatives passed      unanimously, 421-0, House Concurrent Resolution 37,      condemning anti-Semitic statements made by members of the      Russian Duma and commending actions taken by fair-minded      members of the Duma to censure the purveyors of anti-Semitism      within their ranks. I was proud to have introduced this      resolution in the House, along with every member of the      Helsinki Commission as original co-sponsors. A companion      resolution in the Senate, Senate Concurrent Resolution 19,      has been introduced by Commission Co-Chairman Senator Ben      Nighthorse Campbell and Ranking Commissioner Senator Frank      Lautenberg.       In addition, several members of the Helsinki Commission and      I have written to Mr. Zyuganov to express our dismay at his      role and the role of his party in tolerating anti-Semitism in      a participating State of the Organization for Security and      Cooperation in Europe. In that letter, among other points, we      urged Zyuganov to take every appropriate step to disassociate      the Communist Party from racist and anti-Semitic positions      and to reject individuals who hold those positions.       I would add that our Embassy and the State Department have      performed commendably in expressing to Russian officials our      deep concern about the rise of anti-Semitism in Russia.       I am informed by the State Department that in recent days      at least, there have been no more anti-Semitic statements      emanating from Duma members. However, as Elena Bonner      remarked earlier this year at Helsinki Commission hearings,      the parliamentary elections in December of this year will be      an important indicator of Russia's direction for the future.      Will Russia return to the democratic path of the early 1990s      or will it turn backward in reaction? We hope that the lesson      of ethnic intolerance, taken to its extreme conclusion now in      the Balkans, should be clear.       In any event, let me assure you that as Chairman of the      Helsinki Commission and as Chairman of the Subcommittee on      International Operations and Human Rights of the House      International Relations Committee, I will use every      appropriate opportunity to combat anti-Semitism and      intolerance in Russia.                               ____________________
