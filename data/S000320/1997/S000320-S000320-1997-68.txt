 President, we are now resuming consideration of the fiscal year 1998 Transportation appropriations bill under a unanimous-consent agreement reached last evening. I believe this is important legislation that will have very significant effects on every State in this Union. It sets a record-high obligation ceiling on Federal highway spending. It provides the resources for the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard to operate our Nation's airways and waterways safely and efficiently.  Mr. President, it increases, again, our commitment to improving highway safety in this Nation. We want to finish our deliberations on this bill and pass it, if we can, and I ask now for the cooperation of all my colleagues in the Senate who have the option to offer amendments under the consent agreement and have not yet brought them to our attention. I would like for them to come to the floor with their amendments.  Later, I intend to seek a unanimous-consent agreement that all amendments must be offered this evening, that we debate any amendments on which there is disagreement this evening, and that we have a final vote tomorrow. Accordingly, I encourage all Members desiring to speak on the bill on any of the amendments that they propose to come to the floor as soon as possible.  Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments--we have a list of amendments and some of them we have worked out and will be stricken. If I could, I would like to go through the list of the ones that we worked on and we will not have to consider. First is the Hollings amendment on the list; the Graham transit amendment; the Durbin amendment; two amendments by Senator Enzi; the Mack amendment; one of the Abraham amendments; the Bond amendment--two of the Bond amendments. I believe that would take care of a number of them. Some of the other amendments still will be before us, we hope, in some form soon or will be disposed of in some way.
