SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.  Because, out of fairness, but also out of the actual rules of the House, that opportunity is in the rules for the minority to have a day of hearings, and it was denied. That means that the evidence that was going to be submitted to the jury who is voting to remove a President was also denied.  And why both sides weren't able to be heard, why the chairman did not want both sides to be heard, I think begs a lot of questions.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman on this.
