 President, it is my understanding the Senator from Nevada is prepared to offer an amendment. We would like to handle as many amendments as we can between now and 7, when we resume debate on the Brown amendment.  So I encourage any Senators who have amendments they think can be accepted or would not be controversial to please come over and let us try to get them taken care of before 7, because we have very few remaining contentious amendments after the Pakistan amendment and some Helms amendments.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
