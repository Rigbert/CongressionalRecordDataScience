 To the Senator from Delaware, I am talking fleet average. That applies to German, Japanese, American cars--to all cars. The argument, buy a Toyota Tundra, do not buy a Chevrolet Silverado that is not true. This is not a standard for American-made cars but a standard for cars sold in America from wherever they are manufactured.  Yes, the rules will apply to American manufacturers the same as they apply to others. Don't we want that? Isn't our goal to reduce the consumption of oil in America and our dependence on foreign oil? I no more stand here and put a discriminatory amendment up for American manufacturers and workers and say, You have to play to a higher standard than Japanese, German, Swedish, or whatever the source might be of the other car. This is a fleet average. It does not mean that every car has to meet this average. It is an average, which means there will be larger cars and larger trucks that will get lower mileage, but there must be more fuel-efficient cars that bring it to an average number.  Let me also talk about the unrealism of my proposal. For the record, increasing the fuel efficiency of passenger cars by 12\1/2\ miles per gallon over the next 11 years, the argument that it is beyond us, Americans cannot imagine how we would do such a thing--NHTSA has required that trucks in our country increase their fuel efficiency by 2.2 miles a gallon over 2 years. So they are improving by more than a mile a gallon over 2 years. My standard for all is 12\1/2\ miles over 11 years. Why is this such a huge technological leap? I don't think it is.  I yield for a short question on a limited time.
