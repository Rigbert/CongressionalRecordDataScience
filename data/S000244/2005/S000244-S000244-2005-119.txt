I wanted to make a couple of points.  First of all, the visa lottery system has been susceptible to fraud. Doing away with it would do away with fraud. Secondly, the visa lottery system does not give visas to people from ``over-represented countries,'' and that includes Mexico. So no Mexican is eligible to get a visa on the visa lottery system. I think that is discriminatory.  Also, the visa lottery system is unfair because the winners go ahead of spouses and children of lawful permanent residents, including Mexicans, and married sons and daughters of citizens who have waited for visas, in some instances for years. It also is used as a potential for aliens who pose a danger to Americans.  I think that with all these problems in the visa lottery system, the best thing to do is pass this amendment and get rid of it.
