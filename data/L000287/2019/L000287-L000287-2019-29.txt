I believe in the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence.  Can we come together and support a simple piece of legislation to open up the political process and let all of our people come in?  I ask you to remember what I said a few moments ago. With this vote, we have an opportunity to be a headlight and not a taillight.  Some of our colleagues are complaining that we didn't have enough time. We have the time. This piece of legislation was introduced more than 7 years ago, and the other party didn't do anything.  We are prepared to act. We are prepared to open up the political process and let all of the people come in. It is the right thing to do. It is a good thing to do, to set our country on a path, a path that can be a model for the rest of the world.
