 President, earlier I sent an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Boxer and myself which relates to the triple fencing of the Southwest border, particularly in the vicinity of San Diego and Mexico. This is an amendment to that amendment which has been worked out with Senator Kyl and which I believe, hopefully will be acceptable to both sides. Senator Kyl and I have discussed this. We have also discussed it with Doris Meissner, the INS Commissioner. We have worked out language to which INS now agrees.  Essentially, the language would authorize the appropriation of $12 million for the construction, expansion, improvement, and deployment of triple fencing. In addition, that currently under construction where such triple fencing is determined by the INS to be safe and effective, and in addition, bollard-style concrete columns, all weather roads, low-light television systems, lighting sensors and other technologies along the international land border between the United States and Mexico south of San Diego, CA, for the purpose of detecting and deterring unlawful entry across the border.  I believe this amendment in full is acceptable to both sides. Commissioner Meissner has also agreed to send a letter to Representative Hunter which would State that the INS is in the process of testing triple fencing, will continue that testing, and is prepared to add to it where it has proven to be effective and safe.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays.
