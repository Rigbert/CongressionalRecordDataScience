President, President Obama nominated William J. Martinez to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the District of Colorado last February. Mr. Martinez is a well-respected legal practitioner in Denver who has the strong support of both of his home State Senators. The statements earlier today from Senator Udall and SenatorBennet were compelling. They have been steadfast, forthright and exceedingly patient. I wholeheartedly agree with them that Bill Martinez should now, at long last, be confirmed. When he is, he will become only the second Hispanic to serve Colorado as a district court judge.  The Judiciary Committee favorably reported his nomination over 8 months ago, on April 15. It has been delayed ever since. In May we received a letter from the chief judge of the District of Colorado, Judge Wiley Y. Daniel, urging us to confirm Mr. Martinez because without additional judges ``it is impossible for the court to possess the judicial resources that are necessary to effectively discharge the business of the court.'' Despite that plea from the chief judge of the district, the Senate has not been allowed to consider this nomination until today.  This is another example of the unnecessary delays that have led to a judicial vacancies crisis throughout the country. Judicial vacancies have skyrocketed to over 100 while nominations are forced to languish without final Senate action. In fact, President Obama's nominees have been forced to wait on average six times longer to be considered than President Bush's judicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee during the first 2 years of his Presidency.  I still do not understand why this nomination was subjected to a party-line vote before the Judiciary Committee. I recall all the Bush nominees who were members of the Federalist Society and other conservative litigation centers who were confirmed just a few years ago. Can it be that some are seeking to apply a conservative activist ideological litmus test and discount Mr. Martinez' qualifications and work experience?  Our ranking Republican Senator, Senator Sessions, reflected on the confirmation process last year, saying:       What I found was that charges come flying in from right and      left that are unsupported and false. It's very, very      difficult for a nominee to push back. So I think we have a      high responsibility to base any criticisms that we have on a      fair and honest statement of the facts and that nominees      should not be subjected to distortions of their record.  I listened closely to the Senator's statement against Mr. Martinez but heard nothing about anything Mr. Martinez had done or even any position taken by the Colorado ACLU in which Mr. Martinez was involved. There was nothing on which to base opposition to this qualified nominee. Certainly not the ``gotcha'' questions he was asked months ago.  More than two dozen Federal circuit and district court nominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee still await a final Senate vote. These include 17 nominations reported unanimously and another 2 reported with strong bipartisan support and only a small number of no votes. These nominations should have been confirmed within days of being reported. In addition, 15 nominations ready for final action are to fill judicial emergency vacancies. With judicial vacancies at historic highs, we should act on these nominations. During President Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded to votes on all 100 judicial nominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. That included controversial circuit court nominations reported during the lameduck session after the election in 2002. In contrast, during the first 2 years of President Obama's administration, the Senate has considered just 55 of the 80 judicial nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee.  Adding to the letters we have received recently urging us to take action to fill vacancies is one sent this week to the Senate leaders by the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, a group of career prosecutors. John E. Nordin, vice president for membership and operations, writes:       Judicial vacancies in our federal courts are reaching      historic highs. Our members--career federal prosecutors who      appear daily in federal courts across the nation--are      concerned by the increasing number of vacancies on the      federal bench. These vacancies increasingly are contributing      to greater caseloads and workload burdens upon the remaining      federal judges. Our federal courts cannot function      effectively when judicial vacancies restrain the ability to      render swift and sure justice.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record. It concludes, ``[w]e believe that all judicial nominees approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee are deserving of a prompt up-or-down floor vote.'' I agree with these career Federal prosecutors who understand the vital importance of functioning courts and rely on them every day. It is time for the Senate to act on the dozens of judicial nominees that have been stalled from final consideration before we adjourn.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           National Association of                            Assistant United States Attorneys,                                Lake Ridge, VA, December 17, 2010.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell:      Judicial vacancies in our federal courts are reaching      historic highs. Our members--career federal prosecutors who      daily appear in federal courts across the nation--are      concerned by the increasing numbers of vacancies on the      federal bench. These vacancies increasingly are contributing      to greater caseloads and workload burdens upon the remaining      federal judges. Our federal courts cannot function      effectively when judicial vacancies restrain the ability to      render swift and sure justice.       As you know, thirty-eight judicial candidates have been      approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and await a Senate      floor vote. A large number of these candidates have been      approved without controversy by unanimous consent. Some      candidates have been named to judgeships whose vacancies have      been designated as ``judicial emergencies'' by the Judicial      Conference, because of their high caseloads and the      significant periods of time that these judgeships have      remained unfilled.       We believe that all judicial nominees approved by the      Senate Judiciary Committee are deserving of a prompt up-or-     down floor vote. Thank you for taking the time to consider      our views on this issue and for your leadership.           Sincerely,                                           John E. Nordin, II,                                    Vice President for Membership,                                                   and Operations.
