 Madam Speaker, I would simply make the point in response to the gentleman's remarks that I don't want to vote on a clean CR. I'm not here to do that. I am here to vote on 12 appropriations bills that make discrete decisions, that make discerning judgments about how best and most efficiently and most effectively to run the Government of the United States. The gentleman is mistaken if he thinks I want to vote on a clean CR. I want to do appropriations bills just as I know Chairman Rogers wants to do and as Ranking Member Lowey wants to do.  I reserve the balance of my time.
