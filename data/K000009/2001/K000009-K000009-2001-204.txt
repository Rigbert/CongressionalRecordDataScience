Speaker, I rise this evening to report to my colleagues and to our country indeed on an extremely troubling event that occurred early this morning in the nation of Ukraine, the most important strategic nation in Central Europe today.  What happened was that Ukrainian police, and I am quoting from an international news report, launched an early morning strike on opponents of President Leonid Kuchma, swiftly pulling down a makeshift tent camp which had become a focus of protests against that country's leader.  I might add, having just returned from that country, those demonstrators were peaceful; they were living in freezing temperatures, in tents; and they have a right to assemble; they have a right to speech; they have a right to express their opinion.  The news report goes on, as police tore down the tents, demonstrators tried to wrest back meager belongings which were dumped into lorries. Those resisting were manhandled into the back of unmarked gray trucks. Several protestors waving the blue and yellow Ukrainian national flag threw themselves desperately in front of the vehicles before being dragged away. Four hundred police arrested 100 peaceful demonstrators. The demonstrators, who have braved months of freezing temperatures and alleged harassment in one of the most potent symbols of resistance against that country's President, vowed not to give up.  Two hundred people, bystanders, watched as officers rapidly dismantled the camp. They were shouting, shame on the police. Most seemed stunned by the action against the peaceful tent dwellers.  I have some pictures here from the international press showing the arrest of peaceful demonstrators.  Now, politically I may not agree with some of those demonstrators in terms of their ideology. Some may be of the far right or the far left. It really does not matter. They have a right to assemble. The government of Ukraine is saying, well, the courts of Ukraine ordered them to be dismantled because they were assembled in a part of the city where they did not have a permit. Having been there, I can say they were large sidewalks. They were not bothering anybody. It was in a median strip.  The question is, why would that government choose to forcibly remove these demonstrators at this time?  Our delegation, having just returned from Ukraine, spent over 2 hours with the President of that country offering the President the help of the West and getting at the bottom of what was causing the demonstrators to assemble, and that is the beheading of a journalist in that country and the possible implication of the President of that nation in that terrible act.  We offered the President advice, saying that transparency in investigation, objectivity in investigation, could raise the confidence level of his own people and, in fact, all freedom-loving peoples. We received his assurance that freedom of assembly would not be marred, that freedom of speech would be able to continue, that freedom of press would be allowed.  We said we would come back here to Washington and offer a resolution in which we would support those principles being maintained in that country as it emerges into a more democratic arrangement, and yet today we hear about this awful act in that country.  Now, as we develop this resolution, as Members of this body, we are going to word a stronger resolution because we believe that regardless of an individual's views, one cannot compromise freedom of assembly; one cannot compromise freedom of speech; one cannot compromise freedom of press.  I would urge in the strongest possible terms the government of that nation to find a central place in which these demonstrators might be allowed to express their opinions. They were not even talking. They were merely staying in tents in cold weather.  The government says, well, there were no toilets in the area. Let me say, respectfully, in many places there are no toilets in that country.  It is important that freedom be allowed to emerge. The West has to be a strong voice for freedom of assembly, the very principles that allow a democratic nation to emerge. Again, we would offer to the President of Ukraine all of the institutions that this country has to offer, with our friends in the OSCE, the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe; to have a thorough and impartial investigation; to raise the confidence level of citizens of Ukraine and citizens of the free world everywhere that investigations are being pursued thoroughly, completely, in a fair-minded and open manner.  To do this, to take this action, is a terrible, terrible sign to the West, and we ask that government to please provide an area for people to freely demonstrate.                [From the New York Times, Mar. 1, 2001]            Ukrainian Police Tear Down Anti-Kuchma Tent Camp       Kiev.--Ukrainian police launched an early morning strike on      opponents of President Leonid Kuchma on Thursday, swiftly      pulling down a makeshift tent camp which has become a focus      of protests against the country's leader.       To cries of ``Shame, shame'' and ``Kuchma out!'' from      bystanders, some 400 policemen took about an hour to surround      and evict around 100 occupants from some 50 tents on Kiev's      elegant Kreshchatyk street.       The camp was set up in December by protesters demanding      that Kuchma investigate the mysterious death of a journalist,      which has triggered a huge scandal in Ukraine.       The United States and European Union have expressed concern      over the case and Kuchma's office published a letter from      George W. Bush, during the Ukrainian leader to pursue reform      and respect the rights of individuals.       As police tore down the tents, demonstrators tried to wrest      back meager belongings, which were dumped into lorries. Those      resisting were manhandled into the back of unmarked gray      trucks.       Several protesters waving the blue and yellow Ukrainian      national flag threw themselves desperately in front of the      vehicles before being dragged away.       The demonstrators, who have braved months of freezing      temperatures and alleged harassment in one of the most      potent symbols of resistance against Kuchma, vowed not to      give up.       ``We'll put them back up. I can't say right now how      quickly, but we'll be back,'' said a visibly-shaken Yuri      Lutsenko, one of the leaders of the Ukraine Without Kuchma      movement.       Around 200 people watched as officers rapidly dismantled      the camp, several shouting ``Shame on the police.'' Most      seemed stunned by the action against the peaceful tent-     dwellers.       Lutsenko, whose movement includes opposition parties,      rights groups and ordinary citizens, said 40 protesters were      arrested. Police spokesman Olexander Zarubytsky said 15      people had been charged with preventing officials from      carrying out their duties.       The scandal was sparked when journalist Georgiy Gongadze,      who was critical of Kuchma's rule, went missing. It      intensified when a headless corpse was found outside Kiev in      November.                      case of the headless corpse       Kuchma's involvement was alleged when opposition      politicians published tapes in which a voice similar to his      was heard giving orders to ``deal with'' the reporter.       Austrian experts said on Wednesday that they could not      verify that the voice was Kuchma's.       But the International Press Institute, a press freedom      group, said that after nearly two months of deliberation it      seemed hard to believe that the hundreds of hours of      expletive-strewn recordings had been faked.       Kuchma denies all involvement but this did not prevent the      U.S. and European statements of concern, as well as those      from international human rights groups.       The Ukrainian president's office said the letter from Bush      urged Kuchma to pursue reform and respect the rights of      individuals. It also said the United States was ready to help      Ukraine get through its current difficulties.       The tent dwellers, whose eviction had been ordered by a      Kiev court, accused police of violating their freedom.       ``You should have more respect for the constitution,'' one      shouted as he was carried off by around 20 police.       ``It is unbelievable, I am an invalid and he is pushing me      around,'' said Vitaly Yushevich, who was pulled out of his      tent by a burly police officer and bundled out of the camp.       Police said the protesters' belongings would be returned.       ``We are carrying out the court's orders. . . . All the      tents' occupiers will be able to claim their property back      later,'' said a police officer at the scene.                          ____________________
