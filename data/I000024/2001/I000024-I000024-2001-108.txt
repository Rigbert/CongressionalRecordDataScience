They are not wealthy people. For 13 townhall meetings in a row in western Oklahoma, at least one person stood up and said: Our family farm has been in our family now for three generations. We won't be able to do it anymore because maybe on paper, maybe on the IRS evaluation it is worth $1 million but not to us.  Then when all the corporate farms are buying up this land, 25 cents on the dollar, that is the greatest thing we could do for the farmers. It is not just in Oklahoma. I am sure it is in New Mexico and North Dakota, too.  Lastly, I hope you didn't miss the point, it was not a Republican but a Democrat who observed that the best way to increase revenues is to have marginal tax reductions. That was President Kennedy.
