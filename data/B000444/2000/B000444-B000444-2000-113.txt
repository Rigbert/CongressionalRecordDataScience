 Are we going to spend $40 billion to provide for the opportunity for this to truly be an egalitarian system, a meritocracy?  When we graduated from school in the early 1960s and late 1960s, and when our parents did in the 1930s, you needed a high school education to make it, and a college education was nice. Now you need a college education just to make it.  So I think people should be able to deduct at least this $12,000 and get a tax credit. This is a matter of priorities. The priorities should be to take care of the middle class first.  I reserve the remainder of the time.
