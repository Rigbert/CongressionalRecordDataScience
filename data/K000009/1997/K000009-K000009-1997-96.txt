Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to say to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stenholm] that we have read his amendment and are agreeable on this side. I understand that the gentleman has a particular problem in that the State cannot accept this facility because of cleanup requirements and that the State of Texas cannot, therefore, take this facility, and it is going to revert back to the department.  One of my concerns when we first read the amendment was that there be sufficient funding in the legislation for cleanup purposes which, as I understand it, total around $3 million.  Will the gentleman confirm that for me, please?
