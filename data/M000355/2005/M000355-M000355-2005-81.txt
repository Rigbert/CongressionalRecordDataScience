 President, I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate a House message to accompany S. 1281.  The Chair laid before the Senate a message from the House of Representatives insisting upon its amendment to the bill (S. 1281) entitled ``An Act to authorize appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for science, aeronautics, exploration, exploration capabilities, and the Inspector General, and for other purposes, for fiscal years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010'', and asking a conference with the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate disagree with the House amendment and agree with the request for a conference. I further ask that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate with a ratio of 3 to 2.
