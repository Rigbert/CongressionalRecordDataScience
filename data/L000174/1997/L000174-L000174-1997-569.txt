Would the Senator notalso agree with what President Clinton said in the State of the Union Message that we want a balanced budget? The answer is right there in the Chamber where he spoke. We can vote for it, and he can sign it, and we can do that without amending the Constitution.  The Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights.  Is that correct?
