Speaker, I thank the gentleman. The gentleman had to leave early. I think he had a plane to catch. And the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and I had a colloquy on this. I will inform the leader that I think I am safe in speaking for my side of the aisle with reference to the transportation reauthorization. We believe, and I am sure the gentleman shares the view, that this is a very important piece of legislation to pass. We would have hoped it would have passed by last September when the authorization expired. This is a bill, as the gentleman knows, that for every billion dollars we spend, we get 42,000 American jobs.  My observation, Mr. Speaker, is that I believe on our side of the aisle we would support the number that passed, as we overwhelmingly did. We would vote for a compromise between what the House passed and what the Senate passed, or we would support the Senate-passed number. So I tell my friend that for his planning's sake, I believe my side of the aisle will support anything at the level that we passed at a compromise between the two or at the Senate-passed level. We would hope this bill would move, and we want to be cooperative in accomplishing that objective.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would further yield, I totally agree with the gentleman. And as his side has been part of the negotiations and the other body has been in intense negotiations, I think the gentleman knows that a number has been agreed on by at least the principles, Democrat and Republican; and I do not want to cast aspersions on anyone, but the trouble with the bill is not in this House. The trouble with the bill is over in the other body, and they are going to have to come to some sort of understanding amongst themselves in order to get this bill.
