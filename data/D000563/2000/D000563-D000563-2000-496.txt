President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated April 5, 2000, addressed to Senators Lott and Daschle, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       We are writing to lodge our strong objection to      consideration of H.R. 2418 by the Senate. This bill would      reauthorize the National Organ Transplantation Act (NOTA) in      a manner that would adversely affect patients in many states      including our own, who are desperately in need of organ      transplants.       Every year, over 4,000 people die waiting for an organ      transplant. The organ allocation policy established by the      Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) has been      inequitable. Patients with similar severities of illness are      treated differently, depending on where they live or at which      transplant center they are listed. Patients in some parts of      the country wait much longer than patients in other regions,      who have the same level of illness. So for some, the chance      of dying before they actually receive a transplant is much      higher than for others. Over the last 3 years, 97 people died      while waiting for an organ transplant at the University of      Chicago, 187 died while     waiting at the University of Pittsburgh, 99 died while      waiting at Mt. Sinai, NY, and 46 children died while waiting      for an organ at the Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh.       Additional problems occur when hospitals provide large      numbers of life-saving transplants to out-of-state patients.      Maryland hospitals, for instance, are required to pay back      United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) with the total number      of kidneys used in transplant operations, even though 40      percent of those transplant are performed on patients from      other states. This means that states with small populations      and centers of excellence in transplantation more easily      build up a so-called ``kidney debt.'' A ``payback''      requirement also applies to livers between some Organ      Procurement Organizations (OPOs) or within certain OPOs.      Without greater regional sharing of organs, such policies      result in longer than the national average wait times and      possible sanctions by UNOS, merely because a state provides      life-savings services to non-residents.       To eliminate these inequities, the Department of Health and      Human Services (HHS) issued regulations, which became      effective March 16th, that establish a framework for organ      allocation policies to be developed by the network. The      policies will be based on sound medical judgment and will be      fairer for all patients, irrespective of where they live.       Regrettably, H.R. 2418 would take us backward and undermine      current efforts make the system more equitable. The bill      delegates current government authority to a private entity      without appropriate standards of Federal review. The bill      denies HHS any role in overseeing organ allocation and      promoting practices that are in the best interest of the      entire public health. The congressionally mandated study by      the Institute of Medicine clearly stated that such a role for      HHS was both necessary and appropriate. Instead, the bill      grants extraordinary powers to a private sector entity to      select and approve the Federal controller that manages the      OPTN. The manner of such selection does not appear to be      consistent with existing principles of the Federal      acquisition process, which promote full and open competition      in awarding Federal contracts. Furthermore, the bill would      not incorporate the Institute of Medicine's recommendation of      standardization of patient listing practices and broader      sharing of organs.       It is our hope that we can work with the committee of      jurisdiction here in the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor      and Pension Committee, to forge in an alternative      reauthorization bill. It is our understanding that Senators      Frist and Kennedy are currently working on a bill that would      be more in keeping with the IOM's recommendations. We ask      that this bill not disrupt the new HHS regulations.       Because of our strong objections to H.R. 2418, we request      that we be notified and consulted before any unanimous      consent agreement is sought for any legislation that seeks to      reauthorize the National Organ Transplant Act, to ensure our      ability to exercise our rights in the shaping of this      important legislation.       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.           Sincerely,     Richard J. Durbin,     Bob Kerrey,     Rick Santorum,     Barbara A. Mikulski,     Peter G. Fitzgerald,     Chuck Hagel,     Arlen Specter,     Paul S. Sarbanes,     Charles E. Schumer.                          ____________________
