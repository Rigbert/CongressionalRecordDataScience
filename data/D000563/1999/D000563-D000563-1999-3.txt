Isn't it ironic that if you bought a hospitalization policy now, as an employee of a company, you would expect some sort of prescription drug benefit as part of it, that goes along with most policies?  Medicare does not include that. Seniors find themselves at a distinct disadvantage. Many of the seniors I talked to the other day in East St. Louis, IL, had heart problems. Back 35 years ago, we didn't have the wide array of potential prescription drugs to deal with blood pressure problems, for example. Now we do. The fact that these prescription drugs are available means longer and better lives for seniors.
