Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Congressional Youth Leadership Council (CYLC) on the occasion of their 20th Anniversary. Founded in 1985, the Council has long been committed to inspiring America's youth to achieve their full leadership potential.  CYLC has educated over 200,000 individually selected young men and women representing all 50 States, the District of Columbia, the American territories, and over 100countries around the world since its founding. From my district alone, we have had more than 200 students participate in this outstanding and innovative program and in the entire State of Maryland over 1,600 students have had this terrific opportunity.  These energetic and dedicated young men and women are academically well-rounded, involved in their schools and communities, frequently interested in careers of government and service, and eager to develop their leadership skills. In addition to representing all comers of the country and globe, they are culturally, racially, and economically diverse.  The Congressional Youth Leadership Council programs bring thousands of students to Capitol Hill each year in an effort to deepen their understanding of the realities of government, citizenship, and service. I know my colleagues and our staff appreciate the opportunity to discuss important local, national, and global issues with these bright and eager young students.  Essential to the success of these and other CYLC programs is the focus on learning through experience. Students are challenged with simulations, role playing, and debate. They are charged with applying those experiences to abundant opportunities for personal interaction among each other and with today's leaders. The greatest outcome of this type of educational experience is open dialogue, perspective sharing, and cultural exchanges that increase understanding, cooperation, and teamwork.  The Congressional Youth Leadership Council inspires and energizes young men and women who return to their homes, communities, and schools with the tools and commitment to be effective leaders both today and for many years to come.  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to please join me in congratulating CYLC on 20 years of positively impacting the lives of America's youth, our next generation of leaders.                          ____________________
