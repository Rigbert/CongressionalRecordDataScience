Speaker, I wanted to express deepest appreciation for the yielding of my esteemed colleague, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio); and though I am not for human cloning, I just wish that somehow we could clone more of him to serve in this Chamber, and the people of Oregon are extraordinarily fortunate to have an honest and very, very able Member serving their interests and indeed America's interests.  I was listening to the gentleman's comments on fast track, which I always call the wrong track, and felt compelled to come here to the floor to at least try to attempt to gain just a few moments to discuss these issues with the gentleman. My colleague mentioned how much America is in hock to other countries and foreign interests borrowing those dollars in order to fuel this economy. The flip side of the fact is that 40 percent, over 40 percent now of our public debt is owned by foreign interests, is the interest that we have to pay them, and this year that number will total close to $400 billion. It is between $300 and $400 billion, which is almost as much as we will spend on the defense of the United States of America to pay on our borrowings and the interest that is owed on those.  So I think that the underside of this trade equation is the fact that piece by piece we are selling ourselves off, the public interest and the private interest.                              {time}  1830  I think the American people really have a sense of this when they go to the store and they look on the bottom of a cup or they look on the label on a piece of clothing and they sort of ask themselves, well, is anything made in America anymore? Everything from hedge trimmers to automobiles to clothing. We import over half of the oil, which we should totally displace by domestically produced new fuels. We are not independent. This was a Nation formed with the great ideal of independence and self-sufficiency, and piece by piece, at the end of this past century and now into the new one, we are frittering away that national endowment.  Now, the bill that was supposed to have come before us today for the second time in 2 weeks has not made it to the floor. And the reason the fast track bill is not here today and was not here last week is because the motion lacks the votes necessary for passage. The problems with the fast track proposal are so numerous that the rule that they have adopted is self-executing. In other words, we cannot really change anything in the bill.  And what are some of the things that are bad about it, in addition to its fundamental architecture, which is only going to increase more imports into this country? Well, first of all, the displaced workers that will occur in this country. And we know it is going to happen. It happened with NAFTA, it happened with PNTR with China. Every time we sign one of these agreements, more companies close in our country. It does not take a mental giant to figure out what is going on with displaced production. The money that was supposed to be in the bill to help the U.S. workers thrown out of their work was lowered, and there were lower levels of trade adjustment assistance in this fast track measure.  In addition to that, there were several provisions embedded in this fast track bill to try to protect the seats of certain Members of this institution in a very tough election year.  In addition to that, there were provisions that had been put in by the other body that would have protected industries in this country from illegal dumping of foreign goods, such as steel, and those were taken out.  In addition, worker health provisions, those people who lose their job and then lose their health benefits, there were provisions in the Senate bill to protect the health benefits of our workers at least for a period of time. Those were taken out.  And so those are just some of the few irresponsible ploys that were included by my colleagues from the other side of the aisle. And I would have to say to the gentleman, and I appreciate his yielding to me, really one of the issues that we have to consider is how, when we add up everything that has happened at this time of Enduring Freedom, or any time when we should be considering the independence of this country, are we either strengthening or destroying our national defense?  We can look at job security, border security, industrial security, economic security, all of those together comprise what we take an oath to defend: the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to assure the defense of the United States of America. The end result is we become less able to make the bolts that go into the airplanes, we become less able to make the airframes. The gentleman knows a whole lot about that in the Northwestern part of our country with what has happened to some of the outsourced Boeing production. We become less able to make steel. We become less able to make electronics.  If we look at what is happening with the defense base of this country, in my district we have just had a major nuclear incident. Guess what? In order to try to repair the facilities that can be repaired, if we need a new head on the reactor, it has to be done by Japan and then sent to France for finishing, and then comes back to the United States, and then the company is absolved of liability under exemptions in the Price-Anderson Act. What is going on? What is going on in this country?  The last foundries have closed. I have machine tool companies in my district going bankrupt one after the other. That is happening all over this country. We have lost almost 1.5 million manufacturing jobs over the last 2 years. So I want to compliment the gentleman and say that I would like to stay for a while longer, as I listen to what he is saying to the people of our country and to the Record.  This is an extraordinarily important issue. Fast track should not be brought up on this floor until its flaws are repaired. And why should we be allowing 31 more countries special access to ourmarket when we are hemorrhaging, when, in fact, we are hemorrhaging jobs all over the world, and our trade deficit will be over $360 billion more this year?  So I want to thank the gentleman very much for the opportunity to join him this evening and again compliment the very wise voters of the State of Oregon for sending the gentleman here. I have long admired his independence and his innovativeness as a Member of Congress.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, and, of course, the people of Ohio also have shown extraordinary wisdom in returning her, for more years than I have been here, to the House of Representatives. The gentlewoman has been tremendous on this fight. Although we have been losing, the margin is getting closer and closer.  The gentlewoman will certainly remember that last fall, after an extraordinary effort by the Republican leadership in this House, the President and all his Cabinet and others, they only prevailed by a one-vote margin in getting through the fast track trade bill. A number of Members on that side had to change their vote, and voted reluctantly against interests of their district, particularly people from the South and textile States, and they got what are thus far some pretty hollow promises in return. Certainly the voters in those States are going to have to look to see what it is that their elected Representatives have wrought by proposing to do more and more and more of the same.  Under this legislation, Free Trade of the Americas Act would be one of the things negotiated, and we would go to a few of the very few countries in the Western Hemisphere, where the United States is currently running a trade deficit, where we do not have this kind of a perverted free trade agreement in place, and we would give them the opportunity to join most other nations on Earth who are running huge trade surpluses with the United States, notably Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. A very large economy in Brazil would fall under this new free trade authority, and Brazil is a major manufacturer of automobiles, certainly something close to the gentlewoman's heart, and other very sophisticated goods.  So we can fully expect that under this sort of an agreement that we would find those products coming from Brazil where labor is indeed much, much cheaper than it is in the United States.
