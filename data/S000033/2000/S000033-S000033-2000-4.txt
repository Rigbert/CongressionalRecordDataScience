 Speaker, when we look at the health care crisis in America, there are many dimensions to it, but clearly one of the dimensions is that in my State of Vermont and all over this country physicians are writing out prescriptions to their patients, but they are saying, what is the sense of me writing out a prescription if my patient cannot afford to get it filled?  So what we are finding is that senior citizens and many, many other people are simply unable to take the prescription drugs that they need, or they are dividing their dosages in half, or they are taking their prescription drugs once every other day.                              {time}  1615  We hear from pharmacists that our legislation is supported by the Community Pharmacists of America. They stand behind their desks, behind their counters and their hearts are broken when senior citizens cannot afford the products that their doctors are prescribing, when people are dying and when people are suffering and we have the cure right in front of us.  So some of us in this Congress well over a year ago, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Berry) who is right here, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson), and I introduced legislation which was a very, very simple piece legislation.  What we said is that we are living in an increasingly globalized economy. I must tell my colleagues, I have many problems with the globalized economy. But we are living in that economy. And if we go to a shoe store, the shoe company is able to purchase shoes anyplace in the world. If we go to a pant store, a haberdashery, they purchase their product anywhere in the world.  So we are asking a very simple question. If a prescription drug is FDA safety approved, why cannot a prescription drug distributor or a pharmacist purchase that product anyplace in the world at a significantly lower price than the pharmaceutical industry is selling it to him in the United States right now? Why cannot competition exist, free market exist, global economy exist when we are talking about prescription drugs which are FDA safety approved?  Now, if that legislation were passed today, what we would have is prescription drug distributors testing the market in Canada, they would buy tamoxifen for one-tenth the price they would buy other drugs for 50 percent the price, they would be able to resell it to American consumers for significantly lower prices than we are currently paying.  Now, what is wrong with that legislation?  Nothing is wrong with that legislation. What that legislation would do is lower prescription drug costs in this country from between 30 to 50 percent at almost zero expense to the American taxpayer. It would allow American business people who import drugs to take advantage of the best prices that are available all over the world.  Now, our friends in the pharmaceutical industry who last year made $27 billion in profit, our friends in the pharmaceutical industry who are contributing millions and millions of dollars to both political parties, our friends in the pharmaceutical industry who, if my colleagues can believe it, have 300 paid lobbyists here in Washington, D.C., our friends in the pharmaceutical industry who spent $65 million on advertising last year trying to defeat any legislation that would lower the cost of prescription drugs, well, let me tell my colleagues they are fighting back vigorously. They are putting on dishonest, misleading ads on radio, TV, and in the newspapers and they are saying Members of Congress want to import unsafe, adulterated drugs.  What a horrible, terrible thing to say about Members of Congress who are fighting so that their constituents can afford the prescription drugs that they need. What a disgraceful thing to say about Members of Congress that we would want to see an unhealthy prescription drug come into this country. It is simply untrue.  The legislation that passed in the Senate is very clear. There are strong safety conditions attached to it. The FDA has said that, if they have $23 million to increase their capabilities, they will guarantee that the products coming into this country are safe.  This is not rocket science. It is easily done. The problem is not unsafe drugs that will come in if our legislation is passed. The problem is that today Americans are dying, Americans are suffering because they cannot afford the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. That is the problem.  And the pharmaceutical industry, which is every day showing the American people how outrageously greedy they are, apparently $27 billion in profits last year is not enough. I guess they need more than that. Apparently, charging Americans 10 times more than Canadians for certain drugs is not high enough prices, they need more than that.  Well, all over this country the American people are saying, enough is enough. Let us lower the cost of prescription drugs. Let us not continue the rip-off of the American people so that our people are paying so much more than the people in Europe, the people in Mexico, the people in Canada.  That is what this legislation is about. Do not believe the dishonest ads that the pharmaceutical industry is publishing.  As I mentioned a moment ago, over a year ago, legislation introduced by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Berry), the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson), and myself set the ground work, started the process for this. And we are making real progress. If thatlegislation were put on the floor today, we would have overwhelming bipartisan support.  I challenge the Republican leadership to show the American people that they have the guts to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, that they will allow the House and the Senate to vote on this legislation.  If they allow us to do it, it will win, we will lower prescription drug prices in this country, and we will have done something that the American people will be very proud of us for doing.
