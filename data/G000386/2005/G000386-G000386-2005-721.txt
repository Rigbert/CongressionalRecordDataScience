 President, it saddens me to report today that another young Iowan has fallen courageously in service to his country as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sergeant David Rice, a fire support specialist with the 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, died on April 26 when his vehicle overturned near Muqdadiyah. He was 22 years old.  David grew up in Sioux City, IA, and attended East High School where he excelled in football, wrestling, and track and field. He joined the Army after graduating from East in 2001 and was on his second tour of duty in Iraq.  David Rice is remembered by friends and family as a hard-working, quiet leader. In memory of Sergeant Rice, I would like to recognize today all of our military men and women, like David, who have been the quiet, dedicated leaders who have helped see our country through this difficult time. My prayers go out to the family of Sergeant David Rice, his father David, his mother Laurinda, and his sister Stevie. They should know that his leadership and sacrifice have not gone unnoticed but have earned him the gratitude of a Nation.                     Sergeant Angelo L. Lozada, Jr.
