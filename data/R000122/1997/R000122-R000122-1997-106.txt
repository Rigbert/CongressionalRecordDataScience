President, very briefly, I commend the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia and my colleagues who have proposed the second-degree amendment. I also commend the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, for focusing our attention on this very critical issue.  The danger for an immediate cutoff of funds, I think, is threefold.  First, essentially demoralizing our troops. It would be very difficult for them to understand that we have cut off funds now for an operation that is extending into June 1998. In effect, it would be like the difference between knowing that your lease expires in June 1998 and getting the eviction notice. Cutting off of funds is very close to being evicted. I don't think our troops will understand that.  Second, it would paralyze our efforts to construct a follow-on force by our European allies, a force that would not contain American troops but a force that would be necessary to maintain the peace in Bosnia. If we were to announce today a cutoff of funds, I believe we would have no chance to construct this follow-on force by our European allies.  Finally, I think we embolden those force elements who are resisting within Bosnia. This would be the message, that we are leaving, categorically, that there will be nothing to replace it, and that idea can only lead to further violence.  So I believe the best approach is the one that has been adopted in the second-degree amendment. And that is to, once again, reiterate our strong commitment to a withdrawal date by June 1998, but to give the time--and also to give the impetus--to develop a follow-on force, a non-American follow-on force, and support that force, and to continue to build on the structure of peace that is emerging today and that we hope will continue in the former Yugoslavia.  I commend again all of my colleagues who are working on this effort.  I yield my time.
