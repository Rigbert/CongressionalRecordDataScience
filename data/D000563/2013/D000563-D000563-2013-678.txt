President, I know that pending is the firearms legislation, which America is watching very closely, and which we will speak to at length as we proceed to this measure. I, of course, will come to the floor at that time to address some of the issues which were brought up in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One of the bills that is being brought forward under this firearms act is one related to straw purchases--purchases by an individual who can legally purchase a gun so that firearm can be given to someone who could not because of a felony conviction, for example, or perhaps mental instability.  Those third-party purchases--straw purchases--have become the scourge of many communities. One of them is the city of Chicago, IL, which I represent. We found that about 9 percent of the crime guns confiscated in Chicago over the last 10 years came from the State of Mississippi--Mississippi. So how did those guns get from Mississippi to the mean streets and alleys and backways in Chicago? Well, some people decided they could make some money by filling up the trunk of a car with easily purchased guns in Mississippi, driving up to Chicago, and selling them to gangbangers and thugs and drug kingpins in some dark alley late at night. That is a profitable business for some, but it has proliferated firearms and weapons in the city of Chicago to a level that many people find incredible.  Our superintendent of police, Garry McCarthy, came to Chicago from the New York City area. He learned that the per capita possession of firearms in the city of Chicago--per capita--is roughly six times what it is in the city of New York--six times more firearms. We are awash, flooded with these firearms, and most of them, virtually all of them, are coming in from outside the city--9 percent from Mississippi, 20 percent from one firearms dealer in the suburbs of Chicago.  Well, I can tell you these guns are not being purchased by end users in most instances. They are being purchased by girlfriends, by partners, those who could clear a background check and buy a gun and hand it over to someone else who commits a crime.  One of the provisions in the firearms bill that I authored with Senator Kirk, Senator Collins, Gillibrand, and, of course, our chairman, Patrick Leahy, relates to whether we are going to throw the book at those who purchase guns with the knowledge or reasonable belief that they are going to prohibited purchasers or to be used in the commission of a crime; and we do. The penalty starts at 15 years of hard time. In Chicago at a press conference we said: Girlfriend, think twice. Is he worth it? Is he worth 15 years behind bars for you to go buy that gun in the suburbs, hand it over to that gangbanger who kills somebody that night?  That is what folks have to put into their calculation of whether they are going to take that risk. That is one of the provisions in this firearms bill. I would like to think everybody would agree with this provision. Unless one happens to be in that rare group of Americans who believe selling firearms in volume, no matter whom they are sold to, is the best thing for our country, then they have to agree that clamping down with Federal hard time for those who make straw purchases is a good idea. I think it is. It is the lead measure in this firearms bill that will come before us.  There are other measures in there that have been somewhat more controversial, and we will come to them during the course of the debate. But I have asked for this time as in morning business to speak to two unrelated issues, not to diminish the importance of the firearms bill, which I have spoken to already, but to speak to two other issues which I hope will be taken up seriously by the Senate soon.
