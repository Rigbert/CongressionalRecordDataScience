 President, today I celebrate the 92nd birthday of a man I have known and admired for a long time, a man who has dedicated his life to making our world a better place for us and for our children. Russell W. Peterson was one of Delaware's most remarkable governors and has been a truly committed public servant for over 60 years.  Within the early hours of being sworn in as governor of Delaware in 1969, he delivered on a campaign promise to ease tensions in our racially charged city of Wilmington. He removed the presence of the National Guard who had patrolled the city streets for almost a year, and, along with the Delaware State Police, he enforced curfews following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  One of the most memorable accomplishments of the governor's career was the leadership role he played to protect our environment through the passage of Delaware's Coastal Zone Act of 1971. This was a groundbreaking law, the first of its kind in our Nation. Governor Peterson became known as a dedicated environmentalist for protecting the 115 miles of Delaware's coastline from heavy industry. As an activist for our environment, he was determined to help people on a local, State, and national level understand that living our lives is not at odds with preserving our environment. He also contributed to the landmark National Environmental Policy Act as chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality.  The governor's most recent project has already begun to rejuvenate the city of Wilmington's riverfront. He is cochairman of the governor's task force on the future of the Christiana and Brandywine Rivers and also serves on the board of the Riverfront Development Corporation. Through these efforts, the city's riverfront is becoming a brilliant asset to our State as it attracts visitors and new residents to the area. This beautiful new face to our riverfront also has an urban wildlife refuge center that has been named after Governor Peterson, for his decades of remarkable work.  These are only a few of Governor Peterson's many, many accomplishments. Through his service, he has truly improved the lives of Delawareans and has invigorated the city of Wilmington. He is currently the Delaware Audubon Society's honorary chairman of the board and has received 15 honorary doctorates and numerous other awards.  Governor Peterson is being honored for his contributions at a luncheon next Tuesday, in Wilmington. I can't think of a more deserving individual. I wish him all the best as we celebrate his 92nd birthday.                          ____________________
