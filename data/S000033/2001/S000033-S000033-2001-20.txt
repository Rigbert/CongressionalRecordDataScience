 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, as we begin this discussion, I think tonight about the family farmers in the State of Vermont and throughout this country, people who are farming land which has often been in their family's possession for generations, people who work 7 days a week and want nothing more than to leave the land that they own to their kids, some of the very best people in this country.                              {time}  2130  This amendment is being brought forth to help those people not only in the Northeast, but all over this country.  Mr. Chairman, let me begin by thanking my colleagues from the Northeast, from the Midwest, from the South and other regions of this country for their help in shaping this bill. Let me be frank about saying that this bill is not perfect. It still needs work. But given the crisis facing family-based dairy farmers all over America, given the huge loss of farms that we have all experienced, it is a major step forward and it deserves the support of this body. It is my belief that the Senate is prepared to consider similar type legislation, and that some of the concerns that Members may now have about this bill can be worked out between this time and conference committee time. I will do everything in my power to work with Members to make that happen.  Mr. Chairman, in every section of our country, family farmers are being driven off the land because the prices that they receive for their products are woefully inadequate. This is bad for rural America, which is losing its agricultural base. This is bad for the environment, as more and more open land becomes parking lots and shopping centers. This is bad for the consumer because, with fewer farms producing food, prices are more and more dependent upon the whims of a few large corporate interests who are increasingly controlling the industry.  Mr. Chairman, we must preserve family-based agriculture in this country by making certain that dairy farmers all over America receive a fair and stable price for their product, and that is what this amendment seeks to do.  Many of my colleagues know that dairy legislation has been very hotly debated in this Chamber and in the Senate for a number of years. There has been a lot of bitterness and contentiousness. In that regard, let me be clear in stating that I am a very strong supporter of the Northeast Dairy Compact which, in fact, originated in the State of Vermont. I believe that the compact has worked well for the six States who are in it and for farmers in neighboring regions who sell their milk into the compact area.  I am proud that 25 States in this country voted for dairy compacts and that 163 Members of this body support the concept of a dairy compact.  But, Mr. Chairman, there are people in this body who disagree with me and with the other 162 Members who support the compact. They have argued that a compact in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic States and in the South and in other regions would hurt their family farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere. I happen not to agree with them, but that is what they believe. Now is not the time to argue whether my view is right or their view is right. What this amendment does is to say to farmers in the Northeast, in the Midwest, in the South, in the West, family farmers all over this country, that we must come together, stop our fighting and pass a bill that will work for every region of this country.  I am very proud, Mr. Chairman, that this legislation is absolutely nonpartisan, Democrats, Republicans and independents will vote for it, as will Members from the Northeast, from the Midwest, from the South and from every other region of this country. In fact, I believe some of the fiercest opponents of the dairy compact concept will be supporting this effort, and I am delighted to have them on board.  Let me very briefly tell you, Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does. This legislation creates a new national voluntary countercyclical program made up of participating States. It is voluntary. But upon enactment, all States who have already voted to participate in the dairy compacts are automatically approved. Those States are Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. Those States, because they have already approved the concept of a compact, are automatically in the program. But any other State that chooses can join and we expect that the vast majority of the States in this country will do so.  This legislation establishes a national dairy trust fund which does not cost the taxpayers of this country one penny. What it does do is establish a mechanism through which dairy processors pay into the fund an equal amount to the differences between the class 1 market price paid to the producer and $17.50. This amendment establishes a cap which limits the amount of support any one farm can receive. The money acquired by the fund will then be distributed nationally to newly created regional boards based on the overall production of all milk, all milk, in the region.  This mechanism addresses the major concerns that our friends in the Midwest have had whose farmers only sell 15 percent of their milk for fluid purposes as opposed to the 40 percent average that exist nationally. In order to make certain that farmers do not overproduce, the newly created regional dairy boards may use a portion of the funds they receive for incentives to manage the supply of milk produced inthe region. Importantly, these boards are responsible for reimbursing the Federal Government for any additional surplus purchases that result from the program operating in their region. In other words, we have built in a strong supply management component.  Mr. Chairman, this bill says to farmers in Minnesota, in Wisconsin, in North Carolina, in Florida, in Idaho and Utah who have 100 cows, that they will receive the same help that farmers in Vermont and Maine and Massachusetts receive. It says that every region of this country is in danger of losing its family-based agriculture, and that we need a national approach to protect them.  If you are one of the over 160 Members of the House who are cosponsoring the dairy compact legislation, you should support this bill. If you are from one of the 25 States in the country that have voted to support the dairy compacts, you should support this amendment. If you are from the Midwest and have seen thousands of your family farmers go under because of the unstable, inadequate prices, you should support this bill. If you are interested in conservation and the environment, you should support this bill, because it keeps our farmland open. And if you are from urban areas and you want to make sure that your constituents will continue to receive healthy and fresh dairy products at a reasonable price, you should support this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter) who has an amendment that I am supportive of.
