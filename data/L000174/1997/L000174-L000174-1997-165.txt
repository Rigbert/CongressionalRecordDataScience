President, I would like to seek clarification on report language which the subcommittee was good enough to include in the Treasury and general government appropriations bill. That report language urges the Internal Revenue Service to approve a waiver from internal hiring requirements for the Newport IRS office if a planned reduction in force [RIF] does not result in those positions being filled.  The Newport IRS office is one of two national centers that process SS 8 forms and has earned a high reputation for efficiency and excellence. To handle its increased responsibilities, the office has been trying to fill a number of lower level positions ranging from GS 3-5. Current IRS regulations require that these positions be filled internally. While Newport is a beautiful Vermont town, it is also extremely remote, and the office has been unable to fill such low-level positions from within the existing IRS personnel. These new personnel are needed to continue Newport's exemplary record in processing SS 8 forms.  The committee report also includes a provision, which I strongly support, directing the IRS to continue to delay its planned field reduction in force until it submits another report to Congress with a detailed plan on how the IRS will ensure adequate taxpayer service in the future, especially in rural areas. I share the concerns outlined in the committee report about how taxpayer service will be affected by the planned reorganization, especially in rural areas like Vermont. As a result of this language, the RIF which IRS had planned for July 7 will not be going forward. My understanding is that in the absence of this RIF, the committee intends for IRS to move forward immediately with its approval for the Newport hiring waiver. Is that correct?
