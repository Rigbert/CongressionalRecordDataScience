Then subsequent to that the U.S. Supreme Court across the street took the Nebraska statute to consider whether or not it was constitutional, and that statute had the same language we are considering today. I can quote it. This was in the Nebraska statute, and this is in S. 3. Abortion is:     necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is      endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, physical      injury, including life and danger of physical condition      caused by or from the pregnancy itself.  The identical wording to the Nebraska statute. So in the year 2000, the Supreme Court ruled this language unconstitutional. Yet we come back today with exactly the same language that was already rejected by the Supreme Court, and we are supposed to vote on this without any intervening committee hearing, without having people come before us and suggest that if you are going to approach this again, you certainly don't want to go down the same path as the Nebraska statute.  So the Senator's motion to commit is basically to take the language rejected by the Supreme Court--the language before us now--back to committee so that whether you are for or against this amendment, you can at least concede the obvious--that this language has already been rejected.  What we are going through here is, frankly, not a very productive undertaking. Is that the Senator's suggestion with the motion to commit?
