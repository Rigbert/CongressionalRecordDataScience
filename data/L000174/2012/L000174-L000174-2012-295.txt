President, today I am proud to introduce a bill to reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act.  I am pleased that Senator Coons, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Schumer have joined me in this effort. When enacted, this legislation will continue for another five years the lifesaving grant program that Senator Campbell and I authored in 1998. This measure will continue Congress' strong commitment to the safety and security of our Nation's law enforcement officers.  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, administered by the Department of Justice, provides financial assistance to State law enforcement agencies to help purchase bulletproof vests. This program is an important part of the Federal Government's overall policy to assist and support State and local law enforcement partners around the country.  In February, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this program and the need for reauthorization to emphasize just how important and effective this program has been. At that hearing, a representative from the Government Accountability Office testified that since 1987, data shows that body armor has saved the lives of 3,000 law enforcement officers. That is 3,000 men and women who may not otherwise have made it home to their families and loved ones. The BVP Program has assisted State and local jurisdictions with the purchase of nearly one million bulletproof vests since 1999. That is a measure of success all Senators should be proud of. I hope we can support the continuation of this program unanimously, as the Senate did most recently in 2008.  Despite the progress that has been made in the improvement of lifesaving equipment and training, there is much work to be done. The year 2011 was an especially tragic one for the law enforcement community. Last year, 163 State and Federal law enforcement officers lost their lives and thousands were injured or disabled in the line of duty. This is an increase from 2010 and a grim reminder of the sacrifices far too many individuals make in the service of their communities and fellow citizens. The Senate should continue to do its part to help reverse the trend of the last several years.  The safety and support of law enforcement officers across the United States should be something on which we can all agree. As we look toward National Police Week this month, Senators have an opportunity with this legislation to help make a difference and to show the thousands of law enforcement officers and their family members who will be in Washington that the Senate stands with them. I encourage their support and I look forward to the enactment of this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2554       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership      Grant Act of 2012''.     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.       Section 1001(a)(23) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control      and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3793(a)(23)) is      amended by striking ``2012'' and inserting ``2017''.                          ____________________
