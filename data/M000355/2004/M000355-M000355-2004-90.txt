 President, it has come to my attention that since October of last year, the Government of Japan has funded at least 28 new projects in Burma totaling more than $18 million. Some of these funds appear to have been provided directly to the illegitimate and repressive State Peace and Development Council, SPDC.  A question many of my colleagues may be asking is: Why is Japan providing assistance to Burma and the thugs in Rangoon when Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other members and supporters of the National League for Democracy, NLD, remain imprisoned?  I wish I knew the answer.  Providing assistance to Burma and the SPDC sends exactly the wrong message at the wrong time. Assistance to the junta prolongs the suffering of the Burmese people and props up an illegitimate regime, headed by Than Swe, which has tortured, murdered and raped with impunity.  It is time Japan gets with the program and pressures the SPDC to begin meaningful reconciliation with the NLD--the only legitimately elected leadership of that country.  Freedom needs Japan's help in Burma.                          ____________________
