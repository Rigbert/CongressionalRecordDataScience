President, I rise today to commemorate the life of William W. Wirtz, a truly outstanding Illinoisan who passed away this week.  Bill Wirtz was a businessman, sports fan, and philanthropist. He took over operation of Judge & Dolph in Illinois in 1950 and expanded that business into the Wirtz Beverage Group, comprised of five distributorships in four States. He also served as president of Wirtz Corporation, Director of First Security Trust and Savings Bank, and chairman of the South Miami Bank Corporation. But most Chicagoans will remember him as the owner and president of the Chicago Blackhawks hockey team.  The Wirtz family bought the Blackhawks in 1954, and Bill was named president of the organization in 1966, a title he maintained for over 40 years. Bill was a true hockey fan. During his lifetime, he helped negotiate the merger between the NHL and the World Hockey Association, served on the 1980 and 1984 Winter Olympic Committees, and was chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Hockey League for 18 years. In recognition of his many contributions to the sport, Bill Wirtz was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.  Bill Wirtz also gave a great deal back to the community and the city of Chicago. Along with Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, he was a driving force behind the construction of the United Center to replace the old Chicago Stadium in 1994. He also established the Chicago Blackhawk Charities, which has donated over $7.5 million to worthy causes in the Chicago area. Perhaps closest to Bill's heart was the development of the Virginia Wadsworth Wirtz Sports Program at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Named after his mother, this program is a year-round, cross-disability sports and recreation program.  Bill Wirtz is survived by his wife Alice, five children and seven grandchildren. They have my condolences and those of so many who knew him. Bill's many contributions to Chicago and Illinois will not soon be forgotten.                          ____________________
