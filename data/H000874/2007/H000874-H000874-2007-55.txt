I did say that. He's correct. However, the principal proponents of that resolution, obviously, the relationship with Turkey is a very important one for the United States. It is a critical time in the Middle East. Turkey has been, obviously, a great help in some respects, sometimes. And so the principal sponsors of that resolution have written a letter to the Speaker and myself and asked us not to move forward with that resolution at this time. But it is obviously still a matter of great concern to the Speaker, to myself and, frankly, the majority of this House who are sponsors of this resolution.  But in answer to the gentleman's question, I do not expect it to move forward any time soon.
