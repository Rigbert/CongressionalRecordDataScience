I believe that there are, obviously, different times that confront us at this point in time; but I think, given where we are, that both sides may still be pretty much in the same position they were in last time.  I would, without asking further questions, urge my friends on the majority side to provide for that full and open debate and not allow a technicality which would result from a lack of waiver to preclude a substantive alternative to be debated on this floor and the different perspectives that Members might have being aired.  I think that is good for the American public, I think it is good for the House of Representatives, and I think it is good for the final product. I would hope that would be done. We certainly anticipated the gentleman's announcement, and we will be offering a substitute in a timely fashion on Tuesday next, as I understand the chairman will announce.
