 President, I join my colleague in his remarks about the Plum Creek exchange. We worked very hard last year to enact this exchange. I also share a concern about the implications of the discovery or marbledmurrelets on the lands scheduled to be exchanged to Plum Creek. I agree these lands should be left in federal ownership. I would like to ask Senator Gorton does one senator understand legislation is needed to allow the Forest Service to keep the two sections in question?
