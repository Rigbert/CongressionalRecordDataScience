President, last year, Congress quietly made it easier for thisPresident or any President to declare martial law. That's right: In legislation added at the Administration's request to last year's massive Defense Authorization Bill, it has now become easier to bypass longtime posse comitatus restrictions that prevent the Federal Government's use of the military, including a federalized National Guard, to perform domestic law enforcement duties. That change runs counter to our founding principles, to the optimal use of our superb National Guard here at home, and to whatever sensible reforms are needed to improve our Nation's emergency response capabilities.  Today Senator Bond and I are introducing legislation to repeal these unwarranted and perilous changes, which were made to a little-known law called the Insurrection Act. Our amendment replaces every word, comma, and period from the original act and returns it to its original form. Repealing this ill-considered change in the Insurrection Act would allow Congress to have a more orderly, thoughtful, open and consultative discussion on whether such sensitive and massive powers should be changed, if at all. It is difficult to see how any Senator could disagree with the advisability of having a more transparent and thoughtful approach to this sensitive issue.  The Insurrection Act is a Reconstruction-era law that provides the major exemption from posse comitatus--the legal doctrine that bars the use of the military for law enforcement directed at the American people here at home. The Insurrection Act is designed to ensure that Federal laws are enforced and to ensure that American citizens' basic constitutional rights are respected and protected. When the Insurrection Act is invoked, the President can--without the consent of the respective governors--federalize the National Guard and use it, along with the entire military, to carry out law enforcement duties. Treading as this does across basic constitutional issues relating to separation of power and to state and local sovereignty, this is a sweeping grant of authority to the President. Because the use of the military for domestic law enforcement is so sensitive an issue, the Act has been invoked only sparingly since it was enacted.  The primary reason that the law has been invoked so rarely is that there has been an inherent tension in the way it was crafted. Before it was changed last year, the law was purposefully ambiguous about when the President could invoke the Act in cases beyond a clear insurrection or when a state clearly violated Federal law in its actions. Because there was this useful ambiguity--a constructive friction in the law--a President until now would have to use the power with great caution, and with the impetus for appropriate consultation.  Yet by the time committee work was completed in the House and the Senate on the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Authorization Bill, the law had been changed and that useful ambiguity had vanished. In addition to the cases of insurrection, the Act can now be invoked to restore public order after a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, a disease outbreak, or--and this is extremely broad--``other condition.'' Restoring public order has suddenly become an entirely new purpose for the Insurrection Act. And, as if to underscore this fundamental change, the conference committee changed the name of the Act from ``Insurrection'' to ``Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order.''  This significant change was made without consulting the Nation's Governors, mayors, sheriffs, or the National Guard Adjutants General. It was made without consulting the other relevant policy committees in the Senate and the House. It was merely slipped in, at the Administration's request, as rider to a bill that was hundreds of pages long. And when the Nation's Governors learned of the change and expressed their strong opposition, they were ignored, and this facilitation of presidential ability to federalize the National Guard--even over the objections of the Nation's Governors--remained in the bill that was signed into law by President Bush.  Now this President and future Presidents can more easily take control of the National Guard and use our entire military apparatus for law enforcement at home. In a situation like another Katrina or even a more contained incident like a terrorist incident, the President will be able to bring in Federal troops and take away control from the Governors, the Emergency Managers, the Sheriffs, and the State Adjutants General who know their communities best and are responsible for responding.  What we should be doing instead is buttressing the response abilities of these local and State officials. We should ensure every State has a state-of-the-art emergency operations center, that our first responders have the best equipment and training, and that the National Guard has adequate equipment and available people at home to provide support. Any Federal assets--military or otherwise--that might come into a State should be in a supporting and not commanding role. The local officials who know their communities are in the best positions to control the situation, not the President or the military.  Some have argued that the changes made were only a clarification of existing law or that the Insurrection Act already gave the power to the President to use the military for law enforcement in an emergency. I strongly disagree with that explanation, and so do the Governors, Adjutants General, and a host of other officials. They see it, as Senator Bond and I see it, as a tangible and troubling expansion of the President's powers and a parallel reduction in State sovereignty. But if some believe the original Act already gave the President this expansive power, they should not object to bringing the law back to its original form.  Repeal of the recent changes to the Insurrection Act will help ensure that our National Guard and larger emergency response capabilities remain strong. Repeal is crucial to ensuring that our Governors and local officials remain in control and that they are consulted when anyone considers overriding their authority. Repeal is simply essential to ensuring the military is not used in a way that offends and endangers some of our more cherished values and liberties.  We enter this effort with the strong support of Governors and of the National Guard community, including the National Governors Association, the National Guard Association, the Adjutants General Association, and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard. I ask unanimous consent that support letters from the National Governors Association, the Adjutants General Association, and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard be printed at this point in the Record.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  Last year's Insurrection Act rider reflects the general lack of close oversight that has taken a toll on our system of government. I hope the days of rubberstamping are over, and I hope the Senate will quickly remedy this situation by considering and passing the bill that we introduce today.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     National Guard Association of                                      the United States, Inc.,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2007.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Christopher Bond,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Bond: The National Guard      Association of the United States (NGAUS) is pleased to      support your efforts to repeal those provisions of Section      1076 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act      (Public Law 109-364) enacted in the 109th Congress.       We believe those provisions removed the governors of the      several states from their constitutional role as the      commanders in chief of their respective states' National      Guard forces in responding to domestic emergencies, in both      an unnecessary and unwarranted manner.       We further believe that the exploitation of the language of      the Insurrection Act as a surreptitious method to gain      special presidential authority where clearly the Congress has      never intended the federal executive to hold sway is      ``creative'' but ``poor'' public policy. Please spare no      effort to reverse this dangerous precedent.       Thank you for your reasoned and forthright protection of      the prerogatives of the governors and the National Guard.           Sincerely,                                             Stephen M. Koper,                                          Brigadier General (Ret),                                                        President.                                       ____                               National Governors Association,                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2007.     Hon.Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Christopher ``Kit'' Bond,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Bond: Section 1076 of the      John Warner National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law      109-364) unnecessarily expanded the President's authority to      federalize the National Guard during certain emergencies and      disasters. The nation's governors opposed the inclusion of      this section in the bill because responsibility for      responding to disasters and other local emergencies to assure      the security and wellbeing of our residents along; with      managing the Guard within a state must rest with the      governor. The changes made in Section 1076 of the National      Defense Authorization Act undermine governors' authority over      the Guard, place the safety and welfare of citizens in      jeopardy and should be repealed.       Unless activated in purely federal service, the National      Guard is and should remain under state control with governors      as commanders-in-chief. The dual mission of the Guard, a      combat ready force that can be called on by the President and      a first responder in domestic emergencies or disasters under      the command and control of the governor, requires that      federal law clearly delineate chains of command for each      mission. The changes made to the ``Insurrection Act'' by      Section 1076 of the National Defense Authorization Act are      likely to confuse the issue of who commands the Guard during      a domestic emergency. By granting the President specific      authority to usurp the Guard during a natural disaster or      emergency without the consent of a governor, Section 1076      could result in confusion and an inability to respond to      residents' needs because it calls into question whether the      governor or the President has primary responsibility during a      domestic emergency.       The Insurrection Act, prior to passage of the National      Defense Authorization Act served the nation well as an      extraordinary remedy that allowed the President to take      control of the Guard in the most rare and exceptional of      cases. Despite the role of governors as commander-in-chief of      the Guard in their states, Section 1076 of the National      Defense Authorization Act was drafted without consultation      with governors and without full discussion or debate      regarding the ramifications of such a change on domestic      emergency response. We urge Congress to repeal the provision      in Section 1076 of the Act and open a dialogue with governors      regarding how to best enhance the effectiveness of the Guard      in responding to domestic disasters and emergencies.       Sincerely,     Governor Michael F. Easley,       Co-Lead on the National Guard.     Governor Mark Sanford,       Co-Lead on the National Guard.                                  ____           Adjutants General Association of the United States,                           Washington, DC. 2001, February 7, 2007.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Kit Bond,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       The Adjutants General Association of the United States      (AGAUS) represents the 54 Adjutants General of the fifty      states, three territories, and District of Columbia who are      responsible for training and readiness of Army and Air      National Guard units under their jurisdiction. We are united      in support of your legislation that repeals all language      contained in the John Warner National Defense Authorization      Act for Fiscal Year 2007 that significantly altered existing      law known as the Insurrection Act.       The language in the NDAA seriously upset the delicate      balance between Governors and the President in determining      the authority under which the National Guard will be used to      respond to domestic conditions endangering citizens. The      language significantly broadens the President ability to      declare martial law and mobilize the National Guard under      national command without consulting with the Governors. It      may in fact cause factions to pressure the President into ill      advised actions because the constructive ambiguity of the      original language which encourages consultation with      Governors no longer exists. For the National Guard this can      mean being federalized prematurely thereby losing important      capabilities available under State Active Duty and Title 32.       The National Guard has proven capable of operating flexibly      and responsively when retained under governor control. This      is well documented from the airport security mission in the      aftermath of 9/11 to sending 6,000 National Guard Soldiers      and Airmen to the southwest border in 2006 (with over 50,000      citizen-soldiers rapidly deployed under EMAC and Title 32 to      support Hurricane Katrina recovery sandwiched in between).      The language in NDAA 2207 would likely discourage using the      National Guard in these innovative, responsive, and cost      effective ways.       NDAA 2007 enabled something completely unnecessary without      committee or floor debate in either legislative chamber and      with explicit opposition from the Governors. Your bill      restores the Insurrection Act to a proper balance. Expect      willing and energetic support from the AGAUS.       Sincerely,                                              Roger P. Lempke,                                                     Major General     President.                                  ____                                                       EANGUS,                                 Alexandria, VA, February 6, 2007.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.     Hon. Christopher Bond,     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.       The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the      United States (EANGUS) is the only military service      association that represents the interests of every enlisted      soldier and airmen in the Army and Air National Guard. With a      constituency base of over 414,000 soldiers and airmen, their      families, and a large retiree membership, EANGUS engages      Capitol Hill on behalf of courageous Guard persons across      this nation.       On behalf of EANGUS, and the soldiers and airmen it      represents, I'd like to communicate our support for      legislation to repeal the changes to the Insurrection Act as      passed in Public Law 109-364, Section 1076, and to restore      the authority of the Governors as our founding fathers      designed over 230 years ago.       Public Law 109-364 stripped the nation's Governors of their      rightful authority to use the militia of the United States      (to wit, the National Guard) in times of natural disasters      and major public emergencies. Congress made this move without      any consultation with those Governors, duly elected by the      people of this great nation. It was an obvious knee-jerk      reaction to the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina in 2005,      yet without merit.       We applaud you for taking legislative steps to repeal this      law, and to restore to the Governors their rightful authority      over the militia when not in Federal service. The people of      America have a unspoken need for the National Guard in times      of public emergencies, and Washington is too far removed from      the challenges in each state. We look forward to working with      your staff as this legislation works its way into law.       Working for America's Best!                                  MSG Michael P. Cline, USA (Ret),     Executive Director.                                  ____                                 S. 513       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
