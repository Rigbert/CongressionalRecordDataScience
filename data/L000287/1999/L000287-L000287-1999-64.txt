Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning, as the dean of the Georgia delegation, to welcome our newest Member to the House of Representatives. Johnny Isakson won an impressive victory in Tuesday's special election in Georgia's 6th Congressional District. He received 65 percent of the vote in a crowded field of contenders.  Mr. Isakson brings with him a wealth of experience, having served in both the Georgia House and Senate. Back home, Johnny has developed a reputation as a bridge builder, a man who has strong beliefs but is also willing to work with others to get things done. I believe that trait will serve him very well here in Congress.  Johnny, on behalf of all the members of the Georgia delegation, Democrats and Republicans, we welcome you to this great institution, the people's House. We look forward to working with you to improve the lives of the people of the 6th Congressional District, of Georgia, and the people of the Nation.  Welcome. Welcome here. Work hard and enjoy yourself and have some fun as you work.                          ____________________
