Speaker, it is with great respect that I take this time to recognize Black History Month and its 2018 theme, African Americans in Times of War. This year's theme reflects on the crucial role of African Americans in the military. Throughout our history, millions of African American men and women have bravely served our country, and their contributions to the betterment of our nation are to be revered. We applaud those who continue to work so diligently to improve and expand upon military opportunities for African American men and women, but we must always acknowledge that there is more progress to be made.  We take this time to honor and reflect on the struggles and triumphs of African American people throughout America's history. African Americans have played a major role in every war, from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War. However, for a large majority of those wars, these brave individuals failed to receive ample recognition for their achievements. Let us take the time this month to recount and praise the African American men and women who served our country during wartime, and to commend those who serve in the military today.  The First Congressional District of Indiana, which I proudly serve, has a rich history steeped in military service. The late Quentin Smith, of Gary, Indiana, serves as a perfect example of what this year's theme means to the community of Northwest Indiana and the entire country. Quentin Smith was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the renowned African American World War II air corps. This group escorted and protected bombers as they flew missions over Europe, and they seldom lost a plane. For his bravery, courage, and heroism, Quentin Smith, along with his fellow Airmen, was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Following his military career, Mr. Smith continued to serve his community, especially the youth, through teaching and serving as the first principal of Gary West Side High School. A committed public servant, Mr. Smith was also involved in local government as a member of the Gary City Council, among many other exemplary accomplishments. Mr. Smith passed away in 2013 at the age of 94, but his legacy will live on for generations to come. For his truly honorable military career and his dedication to his community, Quentin Smith is held in our highest esteem.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other colleagues join me in celebrating Black History Month and honoring the African American men and women who served in the past while commending those who serve today. We are forever indebted for their contributions to protecting our great nation, and we thank them for their perseverance, sacrifice, and struggle.                          ____________________
