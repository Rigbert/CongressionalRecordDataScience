2968, the Trademark Technical and Conforming Amendment Act of 2010, along with the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions. I appreciate that the Senate moved quickly to call up and pass this legislation by unanimous consent. The speed with which the Senate acted on this legislation demonstrates what we can do when we work in a bipartisan fashion.  I recently received a suggestion from the chairman and ranking member of the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, who introduced companion legislation, to improve and clarify the language of the section that requires a study and report. Specifically, they suggested that Congress should strike the words ``by corporations'' from paragraph (a)(1) of section 4. I agree that this suggestion adds clarity and, should S. 2968 be enacted, I will work with Senator Sessions and the House Committee on the Judiciary to amend the study language in subsequent legislation.                          ____________________
