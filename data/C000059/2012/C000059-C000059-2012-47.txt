Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Frank Emerson. Frank passed away peacefully at Corona Regional Medical Center on Saturday, February 25, 2012 with his wife, Belvia and son, Bob at his side. Frank was a pillar of the community in Corona, California and he will be deeply missed.  As a young man, Frank attended the University of Redlands on a basketball scholarship and after college decided to join the Army. Frank then decided to go into the family business and ran Emerson's Men's Wear successfully for many years. Frank took on a partner, long time employee Jim Pauly, to help with Emerson's Men's Wear. Frank was a successful businessman and dedicated community servant. Frank served on many civic groups through the years, including the Corona Planning Commission. His life was a testament to his family who had settled in Corona in the early 1900s.  Frank leaves behind his wife of 53 years Belvia, Daughter, Elizabeth Jenkins of Texas; son, Robert ``Bob'' Emerson of Corona and their respective families. He was preceded in death by his son Donald. He also has five grandchildren and many other family and friends who will miss Frank's big heart and quick smile.  On Friday, March 9, 2012, a memorial service celebrating Frank's extraordinary life will be held. Frank will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to his work, family and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Frank's family and friends; although Frank may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
