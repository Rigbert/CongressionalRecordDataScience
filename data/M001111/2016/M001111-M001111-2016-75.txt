 Casey Family Programs works to influence long-lasting improvements in the safety and success of children, families, and the communities where they live. I am proud that Casey is based in Seattle, WA.  March 15 is Casey's Founders Day, a time for its leaders to reflect on the history of Jim Casey and his vision for the foundation and its mission.  Jim Casey, the founder of United Parcel Service, saw a critical need 50 years ago to ensure that our Nation's most vulnerable children had safe and stable families who would provide the opportunities and support they needed to succeed in life. After Jim's father died when he was just 14, he felt responsible for taking care of his mother and three younger siblings. As he was building the bicycle messenger service he started in 1907 into the world's largest delivery and logistics company, Jim also noticed that his most effective workers came from strong families, while those who did not thrive came from unstable backgrounds.  Those experiences and his vision led him to generously invest his resources to create Casey Family Programs in 1966 to provide direct services to vulnerable children and families. The foundation now works with all 50 States, as well as tribal, county, and other child welfare jurisdictions, to safely reduce the need for foster care and help create and sustain safe and stable families. It also educates policymakers at all levels of government about effective policies and evidence-based interventions that improve the lives of families and children.  From 2009 to 2015, Casey Family Programs invested $45 million in Washington State. It has helped support the child welfare system, courts, tribes, policymakers, and other organizations to improve stability for children and build communities of hope.  Casey Family Programs provides education, research, and information that is valuable in policy discussions as well as for Washington State and other States participating in the Federal IV-Waiver Program. For instance, Casey Family Programs has provided specific research to track which evidence-based programs States are using under their Federal waivers so that States can learn from and replicate these practices.  As the ranking member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I am committed to supporting policies to improve the lives of children and families. In particular, I was proud to include provisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act to increase educational stability for foster children and homeless youth. I appreciate Casey's commitment to these important issues as well.  I truly value the contributions of Casey Family Programs to Washington State and our country. Jim Casey once said that ``inspiration and enthusiasm are of little value unless they move us to action and accomplishments.'' I believe that the current leadership of Casey Family Programs has embraced the vision of their founder. I look forward to working with Casey Family Programs in the years ahead.                          ____________________
