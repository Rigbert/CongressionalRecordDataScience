Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to a great American and outstanding Alaskan on the occasion of his 80th birthday. Born on June 26,1928, in Spokane Washington, the Honorable Bill Sheffield has been a leader in business, government, and public policy for many of the 55 years he has resided in Alaska. He served as governor from 1982 to 1986 following an impressive and prosperous business career in which he built a company that became one of the largest private employers in Alaska and the Yukon Territory.  Following a landslide victory in his 1982 election, Governor Sheffield focused his attention to curbing the runaway growth in state government, bettering the lives of rural Alaskans, and saving more of Alaska's energy revenues for future generations of Alaskans. As Governor he supported opening ANWR, a position I proudly share with him and one which we will continue to support until development begins.  Since leaving public office in 1986, Governor Sheffield hasn't slowed down at all! He is a trustee of Alaska Pacific University; a member of the Advisory Board of ENSTAR Natural Gas; a charter member of Commonwealth North, Alaska's leading public affairs forum; Past Chairman of the Federal Salary Council; former Alaska Chairman of the United Nations 50th year celebration; received the 2006 Lifetime Achievement Award in Business from Alaska Business Monthly; former President & CEO of the Alaska Railroad Corporation and now serves on its Board of Directors.  In addition to these many commitments, Governor Sheffield also serves as the Director of the Port of Anchorage. As Director, Sheffield has implemented a massive expansion that started in 2002 and will be completed in 2014. Governor Sheffield's vision for the much needed expansion of the State of Alaska's largest port will serve nearly the entire geographic area and population of our State as goods and materials are brought into Alaska. In addition, the Port will serve National Defense Objectives by providing vital, modernized transportation support and access to four major military installations and personnel in Alaska, including the Stryker Brigade at Ft. Wainwright. Furthermore, the expanded port will play a major role in the ongoing efforts to bring even more of Alaska's vast and much needed energy resources to the rest of the Nation. I am proud to support Governor Sheffield, the expansion of the Port and the fantastic job he is doing for Alaska and the Nation. His tireless energy and enthusiasm continues to amaze me!  As a candidate for Governor in 1982, Bill's theme was ``Bringing the State Together.'' I learned from him that when we all work together we can achieve great things and I hope that others continue to follow in his path of bipartisanship. Most importantly, Madam Speaker, against the backdrop of today's partisan fighting, I have always tried to reach out to the other side, to reach out to Democrats who are dedicated to getting things done. Governor Sheffield, a lifelong Democrat, is one of the best examples I know of someone who is willing to work with anyone, regardless of political affiliation, who is also devoted to achieving important goals for the greater good.  I like to remember great leaders by what they were able to accomplish while they served others. The legacy that Bill will leave behind someday is the vision he has had for the future of Alaska. I share his vision in investing now to prepare for the future. Sometimes this goes against the grain of popular opinion but a great leader is unafraid of rocking the boat of populism. I celebrate Bill's willingness to do this and wish more public servants were willing to stand up for what is right and not just popular.  I would be remiss were I not to mention that while Bill works hard, he also knows how to enjoy all that life has to offer. He is an excellent duck hunter, fisherman, golfer and an avid outdoorsman and his friends and family mean the world to him. He and I have shared countless hours together over the years and I truly value his unwavering friendship. Madam Speaker, I am honored to call Bill Sheffield my friend and I hope the entire Congress will join me and my wife Lu in wishing him well on this wonderful occasion. Happy birthday Bill! God bless you.                          ____________________
