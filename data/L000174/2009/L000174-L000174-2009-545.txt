Presdient, this week, one of the indomitable artists of our age will take the stage of the Kennedy Center Concert Hall, as the great pianist Leon Fleisher teams up with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. His range, commanding technique and total sense of the music's natural shape and scope will surely captivate the audience. This is a fitting occasion to take note of a great artist, teacher and humanitarian who, through his playing, has touched the souls of so many.  In the early years of his career, Leon Fleisher astounded audiences with a golden sound. His career then seemed tragically cut short when he began suffering from a rare neurological condition that rendered his right hand unable to play. Instead of withdrawing from the musical world, Leon Fleisher remained in close contact with music through conducting, teaching and playing scores specially written for pianists who lost use of their right hands. He persisted in the effort to play the full concert repertoire, and some novel medical treatments eventually helped him regain full use of both hands.  It is a classic American journey, tracing a path out of despair to triumph. In Leon Fleisher's sense of determination, dedication, vision and skill, there is much for all of us to both admire and emulate. My wife Marcelle and I were delighted to sit next to him at a reception that honored his lifetime of achievement. We thoroughly enjoyedgetting to know this stately and cordial artist, a man of great intelligence, modesty and warmth.  Leon Fleisher has been playing across the country with full use of his hands for several years now. We are fortunate to be able to hear again how he plumbs the depths of every musical score, revealing something about ourselves through his music making. I know the Senate joins me in congratulating and recognizing Leon Fleisher's incredible contributions to the vibrant cultural fabric of our country.                          ____________________
