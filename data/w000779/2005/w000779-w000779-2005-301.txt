President, those who advocate drilling in the Arctic claim that the drilling is needed to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. But what is included in the Senate budget resolution doesn't increase U.S. energy security. To the contrary, it is a license to export Alaskan oil outside the United States. With the inflated revenue projections of $2.5 billion from drilling in the Arctic included in the budget, the Federal Government will be forced to sell the oil to the highest bidder to even come close to reaching that amount.  Under the Senate budget, if the highest price is in South America, oil from that wildlife refuge would have to go to South America. If the highest price is in the Far East, Arctic oil would have to go to the Far East. If the highest price is in the Middle East, Arctic oil would have to go to the Middle East.  With the weak dollar, it would be a virtual certainty that the highest price for Arctic oil would be outside our country. It would not reduce our dependence on foreign oil one drop to export Arctic oil overseas, but that is exactly what could happen under the Senate budget resolution.  Now, last Congress, the House, in passing its Energy bill, recognized that drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge won't help our Nation's energy security if the oil from that drilling is exported overseas.
