 President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to the Honorable Trent Lott dated May 17, 1999, signed by myself and Senator Kerrey.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                             Select Committee on Intelligence,                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1999.     Hon. Trent Lott,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: The Select Committee on Intelligence has      reported a bill (S. 1009) authorizing appropriations for U.S.      intelligence activities for fiscal year 2000. The Committee      cannot disclose the details of its budgetary recommendations      in its public report (Senate Report 106-48), because our      intelligence activities are classified. The Committee has      prepared, however, a classified annex to the report which      describes the full scope and intent of the Committee's      actions.       In accordance with the provisions of Section 8(c)(2) of      Senate Resolution 400 of the 94th Congress, the classified      annex is available to any member of the Senate and can be      reviewed in room SH-211. If you wish to do so, please have      your staff contact the Committee's Director of Security, Mr.      James Wolfe, at 224-1751 to arrange a time for such review.           Sincerely,                                                Richard C. Shelby,                                                         Chairman.                                                 J. Robert Kerrey,     Vice Chairman.                          ____________________
