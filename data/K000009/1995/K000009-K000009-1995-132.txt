Chairman, this is where the nub of the argument really lies, in terms of the Constitution. When this fund was established, the purpose was to prop up the dollar, not the peso, but the purpose of the fund was for short-term currency exchanges, not medium-term loans, not long-term loans, for another government, for another government to refinance its investors, those people that had speculated in that market.  I think that the gentleman, being a party to the agreement, obviously would want to defend it, but I think that when we have a backdoor form of foreign aid, this is not healthy. This is not healthy for our country, it is not healthy for the confidence of Members here, nor of the America people. We should have a debate.  Mr. Chairman, what is so troubling about this particular matter is we have never been allowed to have a full debate on the floor of this Congress. It has been bottled up by the committees of jurisdiction. Our efforts to get discharge petitions signed have been very interesting to watch, to move this bill to the floor in other forms, but I think the gentleman's point is incorrect. In fact, this fund was established to prop up the dollar, not any foreign currency.
