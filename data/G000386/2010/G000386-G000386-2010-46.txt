 President, today, I have the distinct pleasure of recognizing before the Senate some of the most talented and brightest young people in the United States. The 2010 Davidson Fellows Award is being given to 20 young students who are under the age of 18 and have already demonstrated superior ability and achievement in the areas science, music, literature, mathematics, and technology. I would like to take this time to recognize each of these extraordinary young individuals and their projects.  In the area of science, we have 12 young students with remarkable projects that have contributed to scientific progress. This includes Kyle Loh, a 16-year-old young man from Piscataway, NJ, who conducted screening of chemical libraries and identified compounds that can help convert human and mouse skin cells into pluripotent stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells have the potential to differentiate into many different cell types. The chemical compounds he identified obviate the need to destroy embryos. Kyle's studies advance regenerative medicine and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the conversion of skin cells into pluripotent stem cells.  Jonathan Rajaseelan, a 17-year-old young man from Millersville, PA, synthesized six new chemical carbene complexes of the metal Rhodium. Rhodium complexes act as catalysts in multiple organic synthesis reactions, including the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals. The catalytic effects of his complexes make these processes safer, inexpensive, and lessenvironmentally hazardous by eliminating the need for large quantities of hydrogen gas, a dangerous explosive. Jonathan's work has the potential to contribute to greener methods of making medicines, pharmaceuticals, and other chemical products.  Eric Brooks, a 16-year-old young man from Hewlett, NY, studied the genetic factors affecting metastatic progression of prostate cancer. Approximately 30 percent of men with prostate cancer will die from it, but it is difficult to predict who will get the metastatic diagnosis. Eric developed models based on evolutionary selection to identify genes that may affect metastatic potential either positively or negatively. His observations may be used to design better clinical predictors to indicate who must undergo painful treatment and for whom the treatment is unnecessary.  Meredith Lehmann, a 14-year-old young woman from La Jolla, CA, researched the spread of epidemics. Using trip data from all 3,076 counties in the continental United States, she found long distance auto travel, which accounts for five times as many passenger-miles as air travel, governs simulated epidemic evolution. Large hub airports near population centers are not disproportionately more important in contrast to existing research. Meredith's findings suggest epidemic models should incorporate automobile and air travel data, but transportation network restrictions are unlikely to be effective.  Laurie Rumker, a 17-year-old young woman from Portland, OR, investigated the susceptibility of organoclay to biodegradation by microorganisms within river sediments. Organoclay is a chemically modified clay material used to prevent hydrophobic pollutants from rising into the water ecosystem. Through spectrophotometric analyses and oxygen uptake tests, Laurie found biodegradation of the chemical structures within organoclay which could impair the ability of the organoclay to adsorb and retain pollutants. Laurie's work has important implications for the treatment of contaminated sediments.  Benjamin Song, a 16-year-old young man from Audubon, PA, researched colon cancer biomarkers in urine. Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, even with the sensitive but invasive colonoscopy. Benjamin designed and tested polymerase chain reaction assays targeting a known colon cancer epigenetic marker. His work shows potential for a urine test for colon cancer that is noninvasive, fast, affordable, and sensitive. In addition, his method could be adapted to virtually any cancers with known DNA alterations.  Merry Sun, a 16-year-old young woman from Chappaqua, NY, studied therapeutic ultrasound's potential in treating recurrent and metastatic cancers. Traditional therapies like radiation, chemotherapy, and surgical resection are ineffective in immune responses against tumor cells. Merry found that therapeutic ultrasound causes stress and light damage to tumor cells, which alerts the immune system to respond and target the tumor. Her results demonstrate the possibility of a novel, non-invasive, non-toxic cancer therapy that treats solid tumors as well as systemic metastases.  James Ting, a 17-year-old young man from Holmdel, NJ, synthesized bismuth nanowires which demonstrate quantum confinement, the reduction of electrons to a one-dimensional axis. By using physical vapor deposition, he created lawns of bismuth nanowires as well as isolating single nanowires to add to silicon chips. James' research focuses on the creation of single electron transistors, which are useful in the new field of spintronics. The spins of these electrons could then be harnessed and used for information storage and act as the building blocks for quantum computers.  Scott Boisvert, a 16-year-old young man from Chandler, AZ, demonstrated a link between amphibian aquatic environments and the growth of pathogenic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which has contributed to the loss of over 32 percent of amphibian species worldwide. Using ion chromatography and ion-coupled plasma spectrometry, Scott studied how the water chemistry of a habitat affects the growth of the microorganism. Scott's project has broad implications for understanding the pathogen's propensity to infect an amphibian host and controlling the spread of infection, benefiting conservation efforts.  Janie Gu, a 16-year-old young woman from Morganville, NJ, researched noise reduction of atomic magnetometer systems, advanced devices that measure magnetic fields with extreme precision. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, she tested the loss factors, such as measurements of magnetic noise produced, of various ferromagnetic materials for use in the magnetic shield around the system, improving the precision by more than 44 percent. Janie's work has applications in the military, medicine, information storage, mineral and oil detection, space exploration and fundamental physics experiments.  Rebecca Jolitz, a 15-year-old young woman from Los Gatos, CA, examined whether hypolithic cyanobacteria, a photosynthetic organism found under rocks in climatically extreme environments, could theoretically have enough sunlight to survive on Mars. Using an original computer program that simulated a million individual beams of sunlight hitting a Martian rock, Rebecca found that there was enough light for cyanobacteria to survive on Mars, indicating that Mars may not be a dead world. Rebecca's research could help to discover the means through which life on Mars may exist.  Sahil Khetpal, a 17-year-old young man from Plano, TX, developed a carbon nanotube-based drug-delivery system for tumor targeted chemotherapy and photo-therapy of cancer, a dual therapy. This versatile platform attacks tumors on two fronts and mitigates the severe side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy. He also investigated a gadonanotube for the development of a new drug delivery system. Sahil's system has the potential to both diagnose cancer at an earlier stage and provide the dual therapy mechanism to efficiently combat it.  In the area of music, there are two talented young musicians that have produced significant contributions to the art of music. Yeeren Low, a 13-year-old young man from East Stroudsburg, PA, explored and experimented with sound in various aspects of music through five compositions. In his portfolio, Art of Sound, his goal is to enrich the body of the contemporary classical music genre, and create new musical expressions and listening experiences. Yeeren is particularly interested in promoting greater awareness and exposure to the richness of the classical music genre, thus contributing to its wider recognition, appreciation and overall advancement.  Kevin Hu, a 16-year-old young man from Naperville, IL, traverses the globe and explores cross-sections of humanity in his violin portfolio, Sociomusicology: Exploring and Sharing the Worlds of Music. His portfolio includes selections of music that, at times, were repressed by political regimes, or conversely, celebrated for their heartbreaking beauty, all while representing an array of raw humanity. Kevin's goal is to present music as a tangible and dynamic tool in human healing, self-discovery, and dignity.  In the area of literature, we have one creative and inspired student, John Michael Colon, a 17-year-old young man from Wayside, NJ. John's portfolio, Art as Empathy: A Study of the Syncretic Potential of Literature, demonstrates the utility of literature and art in society. He writes that although human beings want to communicate their fundamental experience, this worldview is too ineffable to express directly; art and literature articulate this on a visceral level. John Michael proposes through art and literature, the expression of ideas can help tame the tendency to dehumanize others by helping us see their ideas the same way we see ours, inspiring empathy.  We have two bright young individuals whose projects have advanced the field of mathematics. Damien Jiang, a 17-year-old young man from Raleigh, NC, studied the parallel chip-firing game, PCFG. Though not a game, the PCFG is played on a graph, or network of nodes and edges, and is closely related to a variety of mathematical models for complex phenomena such as earthquakes, avalanches, and forest fires. By running computer simulations of randomized PCFGs, Damien studied their tendency to reach a cycle of repeating configurations, and mathematically proved a theorem about itsbehavior on a graph. Damien's work has broad applications in disaster preparedness.  Jonathan Li, a 17-year-old young man from Laguna Niguel, CA, developed a mathematical model and computer simulation to analyze tumor growth and is the first to study motility and contact inhibition, a mechanism that limits cell growth when pressured by neighboring cells. His research also revealed an inherent flaw of the Cellular Potts Model, used to simulate cellular structure behavior. Jonathan's work provides a method to predict the effects of motility on tumor development and can be used to identify cancer phenotypes that chemotherapy drugs can target, potentially improving treatment.  Finally, in the area of technology, we honor three innovative young minds. Anna Kornfeld Simpson, a 17-year-old young woman from San Diego, CA, developed a chemical-detecting robot. She used porous silicon, a material that changes color in the presence of chemicals like alcohols or nerve gas, and simple, low-cost circuit elements to detect color change. The robotic microcomputer then ``sees'' the chemical instead of ``smelling'' it. Prototypes had a 100 percent response rate. Anna's work has applications in security and counterterrorism, monitoring industrial settings for toxins, and exploring locations too hazardous for humans.  Alexander Gilbert, a 16-year-old young man from McLean, VA, developed a computer algorithm which improves contrast in magnetic resonance imaging, MRI. His program has been successfully applied to brain MRI images, enabling more accurate image definition of tissues, such as areas of demyelination, or plaques, which are often present in patients with multiple sclerosis. Alexander's work is pertinent to MRIs of the spine and other areas, and offers the potential for better diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease.  Gavin Ovsak, a 16-year-old young man from Hopkins, MN, designed a device to allow disabled individuals more effective access to computers. His project, known as CHAD, circuit head accessibility device, is a circuit board integrated onto a baseball hat to replace the functions of a computer mouse through head movements and a bite sensor. Gavin's work is less expensive, more efficient, and uses fewer complex software interfaces than are currently available in the assistive technology market, equalizing access to the social, occupational, and global significance of the Internet.  I often say that America's gifted and talented students possess remarkable potential. These 20 young individuals have demonstrated more than potential. They have already made significant contributions to our society in their short lives and one can scarcely begin to imagine how much they will contribute to society throughout their lives, thanks in no small part to the encouragement of the Davidson Institute as well as their parents and mentors. They are an inspiration and a reminder that if we fully support our most talented young people, we can look forward to a bright future.                          ____________________
