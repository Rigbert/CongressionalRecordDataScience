Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Ganske].  Mr. Chairman, as I was watching the debate on TV and came over from my office, I know that we have heard from a number of different outside industry groups that in fact this amendment takes care of some of the concerns that they have. There is an exception here in this bill that is labeled as such, and there is an exception for the patient when there is a new use of a composition of matter or biotechnological process. It is unfortunate that the Committee on the Judiciary has not moved on this. This is an important issue.
