We have a problem, because Alaska cannot do a dedicated fund. That is under our Constitution. That is why I want to have the gentleman's agreement. Otherwise I will strip it out. I want the gentleman to work with us to try to solve this problem.  I am not in disagreement to what the gentleman is trying to do, but we do have that problem. Does the gentleman understand what I am saying?
