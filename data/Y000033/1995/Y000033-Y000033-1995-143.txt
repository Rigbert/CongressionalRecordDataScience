Mr. Chairman, I do hope my good friend on the committee will not raise the point of order.  The background for this amendment, the National Environmental Protection Act, requires involvement of Federal agencies when activities constitute a major Federal action. Commercial Space Transportation Act requires the Department of Transportation to license launch vehicles and launch site operators. Department of Transportation, DOT, has determined licensing among constituents, alone constituents, major Federal action. It is acting as middleman in interpretation of NEPA requirements. Little or no Federal funding involved in the manufacturing, and structure and operation of launch sites or launch-like sites.  Problem: DOT's interpretation of NEPA has increased regulatory burden and cost of compliance with NEPA.  If I may continue, the problems are that DOT's interpretation of NEPA has increased regulatory burden and costs of compliance with NEPA. DOT requires extensive paperwork which is duplicative of the NEPA requirements.  I want to stress that. This duplicates what is already put in place by NEPA.  DOT has determined that it is a decisionmaker regarding whether environmental assessment is adequate or more costly. Time and money environmental impact statement is required.  Now I have a solution. This is what my amendment does:  Solution that eliminates DOT as the middleman or the interpreter of NEPA requirements. No NEPA requirements will be waivered.  I want to stress that, my good friend from California. State governments and other Federal agencies will interpret NEPA requirements. The result will be streamlined regulatory process industry, more efficient, better able to compete with international marketplace.  Mr. Chairman, this is a good amendment, and there is really nothing wrong with it. If my colleagues want to discuss the merits of it, let us discuss the merits, but what has happened, we have an agency here that has put itself in a position to interpretation when it is already in place with NEPA, and this is one of the reasons we have such a problem today in being competitive and so much disruption for the general public. It is why should two agencies be involved in something when we waive nothing, when NEPA sets down the requirements, when we have DOT saying this is what they interpret what NEPA interprets? It is an example of overgoverning what we are attempting to do, and in no way does this weaken, nor does it take away, a right of any group, or a right of a State or a committee to participate in the process.  It is a good amendment, Mr. Chairman, and I urge the passage of the amendment.                             Point of Order
