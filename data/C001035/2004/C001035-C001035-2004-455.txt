I question why it is necessary when everybody has the bill available. It is on page 12, for example, lines 20 through 25, in describing what the national intelligence director shall do. It says:       Developing and presenting to the President an annual budget      for the National Intelligence Program after consultation with      the heads of agencies or elements, and the heads of their      respective departments . . .  I do not see how it could be clearer.
