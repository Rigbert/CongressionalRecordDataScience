 President, I want to say, as the majority leader has, that we appreciate the efforts of Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby. They are working hard and worked well into the night to come up with a bipartisan start for the housing bill on which we hope to begin debate and amendment later today.  I am optimistic they will be able to come together. I think it is an example of the Senate functioning the way it ought to, functioning at its best, and we look forward to making progress on that bill sometime in the afternoon.                          ____________________
