Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).  Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this, and, Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this important piece of legislation that will work to deter fraud in the wake of disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Disaster assistance fraud is something I have been fighting for quite some time now. I recently held a hearing in the Homeland Security Investigation Subcommittee to uncover the findings of a 6-month fraud investigation by the GAO. What they found was nothing short of shocking.
