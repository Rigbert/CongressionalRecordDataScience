Mr. Chairman, just so the record is very clear on this, the question was asked by our former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, what will be the role of the Chinese Government? And the answer back from the executive director of the UNFPA was as follows:       The Chinese Government, at the central and provincial      levels, will be in charge of coordination, internal      monitoring, guidance, and evaluation, all of which will be      conducted in accordance with ICPD principles. The local      government will be in charge of the actual implementation of      project activities at the county level program.  Mr. Chairman, that is exactly the problem. The Chinese Government, as they have been doing for the last 20 years, will run this program; and again, the UNFPA will give it more cover, which it certainly does not deserve.  Women, it even says in the document, will be assessed a social compensation fee if they do not conform to the guidelines, the one-child-per-couple program.
