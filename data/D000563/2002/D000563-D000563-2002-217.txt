There were some who said that would not happen, that once this bill had been reported from the committee, had gone through the regular order, with two hearings before the Senate Commerce Committee, on which my colleague from Illinois serves, a hearing both in Chicago as well as in Washington, when ample opportunity had been given both sides to present their point of view, when amendments were considered and offered by my colleague from Illinois, when the final vote on the committee was a substantial bipartisan vote of 19 to 4, it was the belief--and I am sorry to say the mistaken belief--of some of my colleagues in the Senate that my colleague from Illinois would accept a debate on this issue and would accept the consequences, up or down.  Apparently that is not to be the case. It leads us in a position, today, where those colleagues on the floor who have any doubt in their mind should have it dispelled. The objection by the Senator from Illinois makes it clear that he is prepared to delay this as long as possible.  The Senator from Nevada has put his finger on the issue. What is at stake is the safety of O'Hare, the world's busiest airport. What is at stake is the efficiency of that airport. What is at stake are hundreds of thousands of jobs in Illinois and literally the future of our economy. That may sound like hyperbole from a Senator, but what I have said is supported by the Chamber of Commerce on a national and State basis, the national AFL-CIO and the State AFL-CIO, all of the major business organizations, economic development organizations which support this bill and oppose the position taken by the junior Senator from Illinois.  This is not a bill just being offered by me but, rather, with the cooperation and the active participation of my colleague, Senator Grassley of Iowa, Senator Harkin as well, and a bipartisan coalition. As the majority whip has noted, 61 Senators have signed on in support of this bill and sent a letter to the majority leader and Republican leader to indicate that support. My junior colleague from the State of Illinois certainly does not have that kind of support. He has said he is going to try to delay this and try to avoid it for as long as possible.  In making this unanimous consent and making this statement, I hope it is clear on the record that at this point in time we will use any appropriate means to bring this issue forward. We will not be enslaved by the threat of filibuster. I say to my colleague from the State of Illinois, if he will accept a debate on this issue for a reasonable period of time, offer the amendments, and bring it up for a vote, I will accept the consequences. Let the Senate make its decision, yes or no. If the merits of his argument are compelling, he will succeed. If they are not compelling, he will lose. The same is true for my position. That is the nature of the legislative body. It is the nature of fair play. I hope my colleague from the State of Illinois will reconsider his dedication to these delays.
