Chairman, I thank my friend from Missouri for yielding. I know that there are strong feelings on this issue, but the gentleman keeps saying subsidizing the abortion. The Federal employee, of course, gets a compensation package. The CBO has said there is no difference in the cost to the Federal Government with or without this. It is a choice of the employee of what policy they choose. The Federal Government does not buy the policy.  So my question to the gentleman is, the gentleman from New Jersey said this facilitates. I understand that and I think that is a valid point. All I am saying, and all that we are saying, is that the Federal employee has a compensation package. They have the opportunity to spend that. Whether this is in or out, there is no additional or less cost to the taxpayer. That is my point.
