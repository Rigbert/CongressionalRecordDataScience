Chairman, I essentially would explain the amendment that is for $23.7 million for desperately needed rehabilitation, repair, and safety measures at dams under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.  It is meant to improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of these facilities that are already in place, and with the recognition that if we can improve efficiency by 1 percent, we can generate an additional $3.3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity without the construction of any additional facilities.  It is my understanding that the majority has agreed to the amendment. I simply want to use my time to thank the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young), the gentleman from Alabama (Chairman Callahan), and the gentleman from California (Chairman Lewis), for their deep consideration and approval of this measure.
