I believe we have resolved this matter in response to the original amendment regarding this subject. Senator Kerry and Senator Rockefeller and Senator Warner and I have crafted a second-degree amendment that will be accepted by Senator Kerry. I recognize the unique concern in regard to the Senator from Delaware. I would hope we could dispense with this first and then enter into a discussion as to the merits of the Senator's concern.
