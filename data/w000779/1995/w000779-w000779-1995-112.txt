Speaker and colleagues, I am a Member of the House who has felt that the calculation of the Consumer Price Index for our country should be a concern that was outside politics, one that was going to be nonpartisan. Making sure that the Consumer Price Index is calculated accurately is of enormous importance to, for example, low-income senior citizens who depend on their Social Security to pay for their necessities, but it is also important to millions of middle-income taxpayers, because our brackets are now indexed for inflation, and the tax brackets and the personal exemption, the standard deduction. A number of these concerns for middle-income people are affected by the Consumer Price Index.  But recently is seems to me politics has been introduced to these discussions, because the Speaker has said that unless the Consumer Price Index is changed within the next 30 days, the agency that calculates it, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, would be zeroed out.  I think this is very unfortunate. We understand why someone might want to do this, because if you lower the Consumer Price Index, you can have a no-fingerprints way to cut the deficit by about $150 billion, if you cut the Consumer Price Index by just 1 percentage point. But what you will do in the process is hurt those low-income seniors and, ironically, there are some new studies by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that show because of the high medical expenses of seniors their Consumer Price Index may be understated rather than overstated. So you will hurt those seniors.  But you will also hurt the middle-income taxpayers who will find they will be paying more in taxes as a result of these changes.  Now, I am one of the Democrats who voted on the first day of the session to make it tough to raise income taxes, because I thought it was important to protect small businesses and seniors and others. So last Friday, with the minority leader, the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt], and a number of our colleagues, I introduced a piece of legislation stipulating that to cut the Consumer Price Index in this Congress and raise the taxes on middle-income people and hurt low-income senior citizens you would have to comply with rule XXI that was passed the first day saying that a tax increase has got to be approved by a three-fifths majority. I am very hopeful that this bill will not be necessary.  I want that Consumer Price Index calculated on nonpartisan bases by professional economists, but if there is going to be an effort to politicize the Consumer Price Index, it will come out on the floor of the House of Representatives and cutting it and hurting the senior citizens and the middle-income taxpayers, for those who want to do it, they will have to comply with the rule making it tougher to raise income taxes.                          ____________________
