President, I rise today to introduce legislation that expands treatment to millions of Americans suffering from a deadly addiction: tobacco. I am pleased to have Senators Brownback, Bingaman, and Graham of Florida join me in this effort. The Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion Act of 2001 will help make smoking cessation therapy accessible to recipients of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Maternal and Child Health, MCH, Program.  We have long known that cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death, accounting for 20 percent of all deaths in this country. It is well documented that smoking causes virtually all cases of lung cancer and a substantial portion of coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and cancers of other sites. And the harmful effects of smoking do not end with the smoker. Women who use tobacco during pregnancy are more likely to have adverse birth outcomes, including babies with low birth weight, which is linked with an increased risk of infant death and a variety of infant health disorders.  Still, despite enormous health risks, 48 million adults in the United States smoke cigarettes, approximately 22.7 percent of American adults. The rates are higher for our youth, 36.4 percent report daily smoking. In Illinois, the adult smoking rate is about 24.2 percent. Perhaps most distressing and surprising, data indicate that about 13 percent of mothers in the United States smoke during pregnancy.  Today, the Surgeon General released a new report that documents the health effects for women who smoke. Women now represent 39 percent of all smoking related deaths in the United States each year, more than double the percentage in 1965.  More than 21 percent of women in my state of Illinois smoke. Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer among women surpassing breast cancer in 1987, and smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer cases. In fact, lung cancer death rates among women increased by more than 400 percent between 1960 and 1990. And smoking among girls is on the rise as well. From 1991 to 1999, smoking among high school girls increased from 27 to 34.9 percent.  There is no doubt that smoking rates among women and girls are linked to targeted tobacco advertising. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey showed an abrupt increase in smoking inititation among girls around 1967, about the same time that Philip Morris and other tobacco companies launched advertisements for brands specifically targeted at women and girls. Six years after the introduction of Virginia Slims and other such brands, the rate of smoking initiation of 12-year-old girls increased by 110 percent.  The report released today echoes this concern, highlighting the targeting of women in tobacco marketing. Between 1995 and 1998, expenditures in the United States for cigarette advertising and promotion increased from $4.90 billion to $6.73 billion. In 1999, these promotional expenditures leaped another 22 percent, to a new high of $8.24 billion.  As a result, we are not only paying a heavy health toll, but an economic price as well. The total cost of smoking in 1993 in the U.S. was about $102 billion, with over $50 billion in health care expenditures directly linked to smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, reports that approximately 43 percent of these costs were paid by government funds, primarily Medicaid and Medicare. Smoking costs Medicaid alone more than $12.9 billion per year. According to the Chicago chapter of the American Lung Association, my state of Illinois spends $2.9 billion each year in public and private funds to combat smoking-related diseases.  Today, however, we also know how to help smokers quit. Advancements in treating tobacco use and nicotine addiction have helped millions kick the habit. While more than 40 million adults continue to smoke, nearly as many persons are former smokers living longer, healthier lives. In large part, this is because new tools are available. Effective pharmacotherapy and counseling regimens have been tested and proven effective. The Surgeon General's 2000 Report, Reducing Tobacco Use, concluded that ``pharmacologic treatment of nicotine addiction, combined with behavioral support, will enable 10 to 25 percent of users to remain abstinent at one year of posttreatment.''  Studies have shown that reducing adult smoking through tobacco use treatment pays immediate dividends, both in terms of health improvements and cost savings. Creating a new nonsmoker reduces anticipated medical costs associated with acute myocardial infarction and stroke by $47 in the first year and by $853 during the next seven years in 1995 dollars. And within four to five years after tobacco cessation, quitters use fewer health care services than continued smokers. In fact, in one study the cost savings from reduced use paid for a moderately priced effective smoking cessation intervention in just three to four years.  The health benefits tobacco quitters enjoy are undisputed. They live longer. After 15 years, the risk of premature death for ex-smokers returns to nearly the level of persons who have never smoked. Male smokers who quit between just the ages of 35 and 39 add an average of five years to their lives; women can add three years. Even older Americans over age 65 can extend their life expectancy by giving up cigarettes.  Former smokers are also healthier. They are less likely to die of chronic lung diseases. After ten smoke-free years, their risk of lung cancer drops to as much as one-half that of those who continue to smoke. After five to fifteen years the risk of stroke and heart disease for ex-smokers returns to the level of those who have never smoked. They have fewer days of illness, reduced rates of bronchitis and pneumonia, and fewer health complaints.  New Public Health Service Guidelines released last summer conclude that tobacco dependence treatments are both clinically effective and cost-effective relative to other medical and disease prevention interventions. The guidelines urge health care insurers and purchasers to include counseling and FDA-approved pharmacotherapeutic treatments as a covered benefit.  Unfortunately, the federal government, a major purchaser of health carethrough Medicare and Medicaid, does not currently adhere to its own published guidelines. It is high time that government-sponsored health programs catch up with science. That is why we are introducing legislation to improve smoking cessation benefits in government-sponsored health programs.  The Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion Act of 2000 improves access to and coverage of smoking cessation treatment therapies in four primary ways.  First, our bill adds a smoking cessation counseling benefit to Medicare. By 2020, 17 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 years of age or older. It is estimated that Medicare will pay $800 billion to treat tobacco-related diseases over the next twenty years. In a study of adults 65 years of age or older who received advice to quit, behavioral counseling and pharmocotherapy, 24.8 percent reported having stopped smoking six months following the intervention. The total economic benefits of quitting after age 65 are notable. Due to a reduction in the risk of lung cancer, coronary heart disease and emphysema, studies have found that heavy smokers over age 65 who quit can avoid up to $4,592 in lifelong illness-related costs.  Second, our measure provides coverage for both prescription and non-prescription smoking cessation drugs in the Medicaid program. The bill eliminates the provision in current federal law that allows states to exclude FDA-approved smoking cessation therapies from coverage under Medicaid. Ironically, State Medicaid programs are required to cover Viagra, but not to treat tobacco addiction. Despite the fact that the States are now receiving the full benefit of their federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry, less than half the States provide coverage for smoking cessation in their Medicaid program. On average, states spend approximately 14.4 percent of their Medicaid budgets on medical care related to smoking.  Third, our legislation clarifies that the maternity benefit for pregnant women in Medicaid covers smoking cessation counseling and services. Smoking during pregnancy causes about 5-6 percent of perinatal deaths, 17-26 percent of low-birth-weight births, and 7-10 percent of preterm deliveries, and increases the risk of miscarriage and fetal growth retardation. It may also increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS. And a recent study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine shows that children whose mothers smoke during pregnancy are almost twice as likely to develop asthma as those whose mothers did not. The Surgeon General recommends that pregnant women and parents with children living at home be counseled on the potentially harmful effects of smoking on fetal and child health. A new study shows that, over seven years, reducing smoking prevalence by just one percentage point would prevent 57,200 low birth weight births and save $572 million in direct medical costs.  Fourth, our bill ensures that the Maternal and Child Health Program recognizes that medications used to promote smoking cessation and the inclusion of anti-tobacco messages in health promotion are considered part of quality maternal and child health services. In addition to the well-documented benefits of smoking cessation for maternity care, the Surgeon General's report adds, ``Tobacco use is a pediatric concern. In the United States, more than 6,000 children and adolescents try their first cigarette each day. More than 3,000 children and adolescents become daily smokers each day, resulting in approximately 1.23 million new smokers under the age of 18 each year.'' The goal of the MCH program is to improve the health of all mothers and children. This goal cannot be reached without addressing the tobacco epidemic.  This legislation has been endorsed by ENACT, a coalition of more than 60 national health organizations including the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, and the American Public Health Association.  I hope my colleagues will join me not only in cosponsoring this legislation but also in working with me to see that its provisions are adopted before the year is out. As the Surgeon General has said, ``Although our knowledge about tobacco control remains imperfect, we know more than enough to act now.''  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 622       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
