President, let me just echo the comments of our Democratic leader, Senator Reid, in relation to Senator Mikulski. I will save a few moments perhaps next week to speak my own tribute to her and give my own reminiscences. But I didn't want to abruptly change the subject without saying I am in total agreement with Senator Reid in terms of the quality of service and friendship that we have had with the senior Senator from the State of Maryland.                          ____________________
