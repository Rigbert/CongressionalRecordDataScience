 What we would not do is sanctify warrantless searches. I do not believe, as a layperson, in a body and before these many esteemed lawyers, that my constituents want to see this country move toward a system of warrantless searches. That is what this legislation before us would do.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And if this amendment fails, to vote against 666.
