 President, there has been substantial debate recently regarding the connection between legal and illegal immigration. Those who favor increased legal immigration have argued there is no link between legal and illegal immigration. In their view, these matters are completely unrelated and should be treated separately, as you just heard.  I disagree. It is simply impossible, I believe, to control illegal immigration without first reforming our legal immigration system. One-half of all illegal immigrants enter the country legally and overstay their visa. No amount of effort at the border will stop this. The only way, I believe, to effectively prevent illegal immigration is to reform our legal immigration system. Thus, I believe there is a clear link between legal and illegal immigration. I support Senator Simpson's proposals to reform the legal immigration system, but I am concerned that even his efforts to reduce legal immigration do not go far enough.  With all the misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding this issue, it does not seem possible for this body to pass legislation which will, in my view, bring the number of legal immigrants into line with our national interests. The central question, as I see it, is not whether we should continue legal immigration; we should. The problem is not that legal immigrants or legal immigration are bad per se--they are not. We are a Nation of immigrants, and immigrants have made great contributions to our country, as you have heard on the floor. Immigration is an integral part of our heritage, and I believe it should continue. The real issues that Congress must face, however, are what level of legal immigration is most consistent with our resources and our needs. Yes, and what criteria should be used to determine those who will be admitted. I am convinced that our current immigration law is fundamentally flawed and I want to share with you some charts to illustrate this point.  First, the law has long been allowing the admission of excessive numbers of legal immigrants. Let me show you this chart. This chart here shows that the average number of immigrants in this country admitted per year has climbed to about 900,000. You can look at the chart. From the 1930's to the 1990's, it is just in an upward spiral.  Additional legal immigration levels averaged about 300,000 per year until the 1965 Immigration Act. As this chartindicates, this is the bulk of immigrants in our country. Three-fourths of the immigrants are legal immigrants. This is three times our level of illegal immigration. There is no other country in the world that has a regular immigration system which admits so many people. Current law fails to consider if such a massive influx of foreign citizens is needed in this country. It also fails to recognize the burden placed on taxpayers for the immigrants' added costs for public services.  Excessive numbers of legal immigrants put a crippling strain on the American education system. Non-English speaking immigrants cost taxpayers 50 percent more in educational cost per child. Schools in high immigration communities are twice as crowded as those in low immigration areas, as this next chart indicates.  Immigrants also put a strain on our criminal justice system. Foreign-born felons make up 25 percent of our Federal prison inmates--25 percent, much higher than their real numbers.  Immigrants are 47 percent more likely to receive welfare than native-born citizens. In 1990, the American taxpayers spent $16 billion more in welfare payments to immigrants than the immigrants paid back in taxes. At a time when we have severe budget shortfalls at all levels of government, our Federal immigration law continues to allow aliens to consume the limited public assistance that our citizens need. Moreover, high levels of immigration cost Americans their jobs at a time when we have millions of unemployed and underemployed citizens, and millions more who will be needing jobs as they are weaned off of welfare. It is those competing for lower skilled jobs who are particularly hurt in this country. Most new legal immigrants are unskilled or low skilled, and they clearly take jobs native citizens otherwise would get.  Second, criteria to select who should be admitted does not incorporate, I believe, our country's best interests. As the next chart shows, who are the legal immigrants? Employment based is only 15 percent. Immediate relatives, 31 percent; other relatives, 27 percent; 4 percent is relatives of people who were given amnesty under other legislation. The others are refugees and asylees, 15 percent. The diversity lottery, 5 percent.  But look at it again: Immediate relatives, 31 percent; other relatives, 27 percent. Relatives predominate the immigration.  The 1965 Immigration Act provisions allow immigrants to bring in not only their immediate family, Mr. President, such as their spouse and minor children, but also their extended family members, such as their married brothers and sisters who then can bring in their own extended family. The brother's wife can sponsor her own brothers and sisters, and so forth. This has resulted in the so-called chain migration we have been talking about, whereby essentially endless and ever-expanding chains or webs of distant relatives are admitted based on the original single immigrant's admission. This can be 50, 60, or more people. I believe this is wrong, and it must be stopped.  Immigrants should be allowed to bring in their nuclear family--that is, their spouse and minor children--but not, Mr. President, an extended chain of distant relatives.  Some opponents of reforming legal immigration who are fighting desperately to continue the status quo will say that only a radical or even reactionary people favor major changes in the immigration area. However, bringing our legal immigration system back under control and making it more in accord with our national interest is far from adequate, I submit.  Let me remind my colleagues that the bipartisan U.S. Immigration Reform Commission, under the leadership of the late former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, recommended fundamental reforms in the current legal immigration system, and the overwhelming majority of the American people want changes in our legal immigration system. I certainly would not consider mainstream America radical or reactionary.  The next chart shows that the results of a recently released national Roper Poll on immigration are dramatic:  More than 83 percent of Americans favor lower immigration levels: 70 percent favor keeping immigration levels below 300,000 per year; 54 percent want immigration cut below 100,000 per year; 20 percent favor having no immigration at all;  Only 2 percent--only 2 percent, Mr. President--favor keeping immigration at the current levels.  I believe we should and I believe we must listen to the American people on this vital issue. If we care what most people think, and we should, and if we care about what is best for our country, I believe we will reduce legal immigration substantially by ending chain migration and giving much greater weight to immigrants' job skills and our own employment needs.  Mr. President, I support the Simpson amendment, which I am cosponsoring, to begin reducing legal immigration.                           Only Initial Step  I emphasize ``begin'' because the amendment is but a first step toward the fundamental reform and major reductions in legal immigration that we need. I would like us to do much more now. Congress should pass comprehensive legal immigration reform legislation this year instead of adopting only a modest temporary reduction. Even as an interim step, I would prefer tougher legislation, like S. 160, a bill that I proposed earlier. That bill would give us a 5-year timeout for immigrants to assimilate while cutting yearly legal immigration down to around 325,000, which was roughly our historical average until the 1965 Immigration Act got us off track.  Nevertheless, I am a realist and have served in this body long enough to know that the needed deeper cuts and broader reforms cannot be adopted before the next Congress. This is a Presidential election year and the time available in our crowded legislative schedule is quite limited. Most attention has been focused until recently on the problems associated with illegal immigration, and many Members have not yet been able to study legal immigration in the depth that is needed to make truly informed and wise decisions. The House has already voted to defer action on legal immigration reforms. Moreover, the separate legal immigration bill recently reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee is controversial and fails to provide a proper framework for real reform. The committee's bill disregards most of the widely acclaimed recommendations of the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform made under the able leadership of the late former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.  Let me take a moment to comment on the history of the committee's legal immigration bill, S. 1665, because it is relevant to this discussion. Originally, Senator Simpson, chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, took many of the key recommendations of the Jordan Commission, which spent 5 years studying every aspect of U.S. immigration policy, and turned them into S. 1394, the Immigration Reform Act of 1996. The bill, as Senator Simpson drafted it, set out many very sensible reforms--reforms proposed by the Commission and which the American people overwhelmingly support. It would have instituted a phased reduction in legal immigration, ended extended family chain migration and placed greater emphasis on selecting immigrants based on their job skills and education while taking our labor market needs more into account.  Unfortunately, the legal immigration bill that has been reported to us is radically different than the original Simpson legislation and the Jordan Commission's recommendations. The American people want fundamental immigration reform, and yet the committee's bill gives us the same old failed policies of the past 30 years, albeit in a different package. Mr. President, supporters of that bill ought to be thankful that truth in advertising laws do not apply because what they are selling to the American people as immigration reform is anything but. That bill not only fails to make such much needed recommended systemic reforms, it actually increases legal immigration levels.  Given these circumstances, it is clear that major cuts and comprehensive legal immigration reform will have to wait until the next Congress. Nevertheless, I believe that it is important to begin the debate and to begin making at least some reductions in the numbers of legal immigrants. This amendment's modest temporary reductions inlegal immigration appear to be about all that might be done this year. Therefore, I am supporting this amendment.                        Reform In 105th Congress  I want to make it clear, however, that in the next Congress I will fight very hard to ensure the enactment of the fundamental reforms needed to restore common sense to our immigration system and to best serve our national interests. I intend to push for legislation incorporating many of the changes recommended by the Jordan Commission and other immigration experts.  I believe that while we must allow immigration by immediate nuclear family members of citizens and legal permanent residents, we must significantly reduce legal admission levels by eliminating many preference categories, especially those for extended relatives, as proposed by the Commission. Most of our legal immigrants are admitted through the family preference system put in place by the misconceived 1965 Immigration Act. Admission is not on the basis of their job skills or our labor market needs. Only about 6 percent of our legal immigrants are admitted based on employment skills.                            Chain Migration  The 1965 act's provisions allow immigrants to bring in not only their immediate family members--such as their spouse and minor children--but after they become citizens they also may sponsor their extended family members--such as their married brothers and sisters--who then subsequently can bring in their own extended family. For example, the brother's wife can sponsor her own brothers and sisters, and so on. This has resulted in the so-called ``chain migration'' effect whereby essentially endless and ever-expanding chains or webs of more distant relatives are admitted based on the original single immigrant's admission. This can be 50, 60 or more people. This is wrong, and it must be stopped. It creates ever-growing backlogs because the more people we admit, the more become eligible to apply. Immigrants should be allowed to bring in their nuclear family (e.g., spouse and minor children), but not an extended chain of more distance relatives. In addition, we must give greater priority to immigrants' employment skills and our labor needs when we reform admission criteria.  Proponents of high immigration levels argue that we must retain extended family admission preferences in order to protect family values. Well, let us remember, Mr. President, that when an immigrant comes to this country, leaving behind parents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins, it is the immigrant who is breaking up the extended family. Why does it become our responsibility to have a mechanism in place to undo what the immigrant himself has done? Why is it the responsibility of the American taxpayer who picks up the tab for so many legal immigration costs to have to let the immigrant bring more than his or her immediate nuclear family here? Where do our obligations to new immigrants end? Apparently they never do in the minds of immigrationists who advocate continuing an automatic admission preference for this ever-expanding mass of extended relatives. Each time we admit a new immigrant to this country under our present system, we are creating an entitlement for a whole new set of extended relatives. For most, this means being added to the admission backlogs.                   Chain Migration Increases Backlogs  In that regard I want to observe that proponents of bringing in backlogged relatives at an even faster rate claim that family chain migration is largely a myth. I find this an astounding contention. The very fact that in recent years we have developed a massive, ever increasing backlog of extended relatives proves the point that chain migration is a reality. As the committee's report on its legal immigration bill, S. 1665, notes: ``Backlogs in all family-preference visa categories combined have more than tripled in the past 15 years, rising from 1.1 million in 1981 to 3.6 million in 1996.'' Family chain migration is real, and it's a real problem.             Confusion Between Legal And Illegal Immigrants  Mr. President, even the very modest reductions made in the pending amendment are viewed as unnecessary by those who favor retaining high levels of legal immigration. They have been saying that legal and illegal immigration provisions should not be considered together because there is confusion between legal and illegal. They say that Congress might let concerns over illegal immigration taint its view on how legal immigration should be handled, and that this could lead unjustly to reductions in legal numbers.  Well, after talking about immigration with many citizens in Alabama and elsewhere, I must admit that I have found that there is in fact considerable public confusion about legals and illegals. Furthermore, I agree that this is affecting how Congress is dealing with these issues, but the effect is not what immigrationists think. Ironically, the confusion is greatly benefiting the special interest immigration advocates and their congressional allies and undercutting the efforts of those of us who believe that major cuts in legal immigrant numbers and other reforms must be made. Concerns and confusion over illegal immigration actually are keeping Congress from making the large cuts in legal admission that otherwise clearly would be made this year. Let me explain why.  What I have found in repeated discussions with citizens from all types of backgrounds is that they are overwhelmingly concerned about the high numbers of new immigrants moving to our country. However, most people are under the mistaken impression that almost all of the recent immigrants came here illegally. When you explain to them that in fact that about three-fourths of the immigrants in the last decade are legal immigrants they are shocked. At first, they can't believe that Congress has passed laws letting millions of new people come here legally. Then, I have found that the shock and disbelief of most individuals I talked to quickly turns to outrage and anger, and they start demanding that Congress change its policy and slash legal admissions.  Thus, Mr. President, what I have found convinces me that most of our constituents are really just as upset about legal immigrants as they are about illegal ones. However, they frequently have only been voicing their concerns in terms of illegal aliens because they did not realize that the people they are upset about actually were here legally.                Legal And Illegal Immigration Are Linked  High immigration advocates also have argued that there is no link between legal and illegal immigration and that amendments relating to legal immigration are not appropriate to the illegal reform bill we are now debating. I strongly disagree. Legal and illegal immigration are closely linked and interrelated.                     Legal Provisions Now Included  First, with respect to the linkage of legal and illegal immigration, Mr. President, let me also remind my colleagues that the so-called illegal immigration bill that we are debating already contains important provisions relating to legal immigration like those imposing financial responsibility on sponsors of legal immigrants. Thus, it clearly is appropriate to consider the pending amendment to reduce legal immigration.                         Legal Fosters Illegal  Our current legal admissions system makes literally millions of people eligible to apply, and therefore causes them to have an expectation of eventual lawful admission. But, the law necessarily limits annual admission numbers for most categories and massive backlogs have developed. By allowing far more people to qualify to apply for admission than can possibly be admitted within a reasonable time under the law's yearly limits, the present law guarantees backlogs. It can take 20 years or longer for an immigrant's admission turn to come up. This then encourages thousands of aliens to come here illegally. Some come illegally because they know that under current law they either have no reasonable chance for admission or they will have to wait many years for admission given the backlogs.                 Illegals Can Legalize Without Penalty  It is important to note that our current law does not disqualify those who come illegally from later begin granted legal admission. Therefore, illegals often feel they have nothing to loseand everything to gain by jumping ahead of the line. In short, our legal immigration process has the perverse effect of encouraging illegal immigration. Even though we granted amnesty to legalize over 3 million illegal aliens in 1986, today well over 4 million--and quite possibly over 5 million--illegal aliens now reside in the United States Hundreds of thousands of the new illegal immigrants later will be getting a legal visa when their number eventually comes up through the extended family preference system. Many of these illegals--ho I remind you have broken the law, and who everyone in Congress seems to be so concerned about--thus will become legal immigrants. Magically, it would seem the bad guys become the good guys and all problems go away. Mr. President, how can this be? How can anyone honestly say the legal and illegal issues are not very intertwined and linked together?                        Illegal Increases Legal  In another paradoxical result of our current flawed system, illegal immigration also tends to increase legal immigration. How? Well, look at the situation under the 1986 amendments. The 3 million illegals who received amnesty were allowed to become legal, thereby increasing the number of legal immigrants. And, after becoming legal residents and citizens, what have these former illegals done? After being transformed into good guys by legalization, they have played by the rules, as flawed as the rules are, and petitioned to bring in huge numbers of additional legal immigrants who are the relatives of these legalized illegal aliens. This greatly increases the backlogs. The Jordan Commission found that about 80 percent of the backlogged immediate family relatives are eligible because of their relationship with a former illegal alien. And, as the backlogs grow, Congress is asked to raise admission levels by special backlog reduction programs, which will then increase the number of legal aliens.  Thus, we have an integral process here where the legal system works so as to guarantee backlogs which in turn lead to special additional admission programs and to more illegals who, after a while, may be legalized and then become eligible to bring in more relatives legally. Many of the new legal applicants in each cycle are then thrown into the backlogs so the process can repeat itself. Many of the applicant's relatives also will come here illegally to live, work and go to school while waiting to legalize.                       Legal Has Similar Impacts  Legal immigration is also linked to illegal immigration because it has many of the same impacts. Both legal and illegal immigration involve large numbers of additional people, with legal in fact accounting for nearly three times more new U.S. residents every year than illegal immigration. Many of my colleagues have expressed grave concerns about illegal immigrants taking jobs from Americans, or these immigrants committing crimes, or costing taxpayers and State and local governments millions for public education and welfare and other public assistance. Well, as I will point out later in detail, it is time to recognize that legal immigrants often cause these same types of adverse impacts. Congress must stop overlooking or disregarding this patently obvious fact. Let there be no mistake we will not solve most of our national immigration problem by just dealing with illegal immigration. Legal immigration is in many ways an even greater part of the problem.                            Florida Example  Often, the adverse impacts of legal immigration actually will be much greater than illegal because so many more people are involved. For example, consider the situation in the State of Florida. As my colleagues know all too well, especially those who are concerned with unfunded Federal mandates, the Governors of high immigration States like Florida have been coming to Congress for the last several years demanding billions of dollars in reimbursements for their States' immigration-related costs. Governor Lawton Chiles, a former distinguished Member of this body, presented testimony in 1994 to the Senate Appropriations Committee asking for such reimbursement. Governor Chiles' detailed cost analysis showed that in 1993 Florida's State and local governments had net--not gross--immigration costs of $2.5 billion. About two-thirds of this cost--$1.6 billion--came from legal immigration. That's right, listen up everyone, legal immigrants were responsible for two-thirds of Florida's immigration costs. Florida's public education costs alone from legal immigrants came to about $517 million that year. So, my colleagues, we must face the facts that many concerns being raised apply with equal or greater force to legal immigration and that legal and illegal immigration are interrelated.              Neither Immigrant Bashing Nor Glorification  While I do not condone unjustified immigrant bashing, neither do I subscribe to much of the one-sided emotional immigrant glorification and mythology that so often permeates the legal immigration debate. Supporters of high immigration levels often appear to be saying that legal immigrants are much smarter than citizens and that almost all are harder working, more law abiding and have stronger family values than native-born Americans. They imply that we do not support family values if we do not support allowing every immigrant who comes here to later bring his or her entire extended family of perhaps 50 or more relatives. Immigrationists also tend to see only positive benefits from legal immigration and to disregard or downplay any negatives.           Both Positive And Negative Impacts Must Be Weighed  Well, Mr. President, this Senator believes that Congress has the responsibility to weigh both the positive and negative aspects of immigration and to factor in our national needs and citizens' interests when setting legal admissions levels and procedures. Yes, we should consider the positive contributions made by immigrants, and the fact that legal immigrants pay taxes to help defray some of our immigrant-related costs. However, we also need to consider the impacts on American families when one or both parents loses job opportunities to legal immigrants, or when a parent's wages are depressed by cheap immigrant labor. We need to consider the impacts on American schoolchildren of having hundreds of millions of dollars diverted from other educational needs to pay for special English-language instruction or scholarships for children from recent immigrant families. We need to consider the impacts on America's senior citizens and our needy native-born people who are unable to obtain nearly the level of public assistance they require because billions are going to pay for benefits for millions of legal immigrants. We need to consider the impact of legal immigration-related unfunded mandates on State and local governments and taxpayers, especially in high immigration areas like Florida and California. And, we need to remember that many immigrants who do pay taxes are paying relatively little because they are making very low wages, and thus do not necessarily pay taxes at a level that will cover nearly all of their costs.                   Legal Immigration Should Continue  The central question that Congress must decide is not whether we should continue legal immigration. Of course we should. The problem is not that legal immigrants or legal immigration are bad per se. They are not. We are a Nation of immigrants, and immigrants have made great contributions to our country. Immigration is an integral part of our heritage, and it should continue. However, while immigrants bring us many benefits, but they also bring certain added costs and other adverse impacts. Furthermore, we do not have unlimited capacity to accept new immigrants.                      What Level And What Criteria  The ultimate question that Congress must face here is what level of legal immigration is most consistent with our resources and needs, and what criteria should be used to pick those who are admitted. After studying this question, I am convinced that our current legal immigration law is fundamentally flawed. The heart of the problem is twofold: First, the present law has for years allowed the admission of excessive numbers of legal immigrants; and second, the selection criteria are discriminatory and skewed so as to disregard what's in our country's overall best interests.                        Dramatic Legal Increases  The current immigration system, based on the 1965 Immigration Act, has allowed legal immigration levels toskyrocket. Legal immigration has grown dramatically in recent decades after the 1965 Immigration Act. We have been averaging 970,000 legal immigrants--that's nearly 1 million people legally every year--during the last decade! When you add in the 300,000 plus illegal immigrants who move here every year, this means we are taking well over a million immigrants a year.  We now have over 23 million foreign-born individuals residing in the United States, both legally and illegally. This translates to 1 in 11 U.S. residents being foreign-born, the largest percentage since the Depression. Immigrants cause 50 percent of our Nation's population growth today and will be responsible for 60 percent of the U.S. population increase that is expected in the next 55 years if our immigration laws are not reformed.  Before commenting further on our high levels of immigration, let me briefly explain why the 1965 act is discriminatory. Most immigration under the act occurs through the family preference system. In the early years after the act was passed, a few countries were then the primary immigrant sending countries. After a few years, immigrants from those nations were able to petition for admission of more and more relatives. These relatives from those countries came and in turn sponsored other relatives from those countries, further expanding the immigrant flow from these sending countries. As a practical matter, few immigrants can now be admitted other than on the basis of a family relationship so new immigrants tend to come from the same countries where their earlier family members came from.  This means that there is a de facto discrimination both against admitting immigrants from other countries and against immigrants from even the favored nations unless they happen to be a relative of other recent U.S. immigrants. Would-be non-relative immigrants can be much better educated and higher skilled, but unless they qualify under the much more limited employment categories, they need not apply because under the 1965 act's nepotistic system the admission quotas go to relatives.  Well, Mr. President, I strongly believe that it's long past time for Congress to recognize the 1965 act's flaws and to readjust the statutory process so that we have far lower legal admission levels and fairer admission criteria that are more closely keyed to our national needs and interests. Some of my colleagues and I will probably disagree at least on the numbers of immigrants to be allowed, but I would hope that most will at least agree that an issue of such overriding and strategic importance to the future of our country merits their careful and detailed consideration. Our Nation should not be changed so fundamentally without Congress debating the issue and making a conscious, informed decision on how immigration should be allowed so as to best promote and protect our national interests.                Not Like Traditional Immigration Levels  Historically, except for a brief 15-year period around 1900, our legal immigration levels have been much lower than what we have experienced after the 1965 act and its subsequent amendments. Many of my colleagues may be surprised by this fact because immigration mythology may have led them to believe that high levels of immigration like we have experienced in recent years are typical or traditional throughout American history. Well, quite the opposite is true.  During the 50-year period from 1915 through 1964, for example, legal immigration levels averaged only about 220,000 annually. From 1820 when our formal immigration records were begun until 1965, it averaged only about 300,000, including the unusually high years around 1900. From 1946 to 1955, it averaged about 195,000 annually; then from 1956 to 1965, it was averaging roughly 288,000 yearly. With the passage of the 1965 Act, the numbers began to skyrocket: from 1966 to 1975, the yearly average became 381,000; then from 1976 to 1985 it hit 542,000; and for the last decade from 1986 through 1995, legal immigration on average hit about 970,000 yearly.  The post-1965 act constant high legal immigrant influx is radically different than our historical pattern. Another important aspect of our legal immigration problem is that there have been no immigration timeouts or break periods for the last 30 years to give immigrants time to assimilate and be Americanized.  Even with the ending of legalizations under the 1986 amnesty law, the legal numbers are still very high. And, this huge wave of immigrants has helped fuel the application backlogs which now run around 3.6 million. Some apologists for high immigration numbers say that since legal immigration has averaged somewhat lower for the last couple of years, we are on a significant new downward trend. Well, we are not. Recent INS projections call for a large increase in legal immigration in fiscal year 1996, thanks largely to the current law's provisions allowing immigration by extended relatives of recent immigrants and the effects of family chain migration.                           Times Have Changed  Mr. President, not only are such extremely high immigration levels not traditional, but it is important to realize that today times and circumstances have changed dramatically so that it is far less appropriate to have either such high immigration or the limited skills most current immigrants now bring us.                                  Then  In the good old days of yesteryear, we had a much smaller U.S. population and many more people were needed for settling the frontier and working in our factories. In earlier times, our economy also needed mostly low-skilled workers. We still had plenty of cheap land and resources. Quite significantly, we had no extensive taxpayer-funded government safety net of public benefit programs for unsuccessful immigrants to fall back on. Not surprisingly, 30 to 40 percent of our immigrants returned to their homelands. Furthermore, our domestic population's cultural and ethnic heritages were more similar to those of new immigrants. More Americans then had large families because the high domestic birthrate was similar to that of new immigrant families. And, the melting pot concept was generally accepted and fostered assimilation. In addition, there were periodic lulls in immigrant admission levels so as to allow for assimilation.                                  Now  Today, circumstances are quite different. Land and resource availability are much more limited and expensive. The United States now is a mature nation with a host of serious domestic difficulties, economic problems, chronic unemployment, crime, millions of needy, and so forth. Our population has grown many times over. In fact, the United States now doesn't need more people--we have no frontier to settle, and we have plenty of workers. And, our economy has been undergoing fundamental structural changes. We have been restructuring toward a high-technology economy that needs higher skilled, more educated workers to compete in the new global marketplace instead of unskilled or low-skilled immigrant labor. We now have a costly taxpayer-funded safety net of government assistance that immigrants can rely on such as welfare, AFDC, SSI, health care, and other benefit programs. Not surprisingly, now only 10 to 20 percent return to their home country. And, multi-culturalism is favored over the ``melting pot" concept by many immigrant groups, making assimilation often much more difficult and slower. Instead of following our traditional course of enhancing our strengths by melding a common American culture out of immigrants' diversity, multiculturalists now push to retain newcomers' different cultures.  Mr. President, yes, times and circumstances have changed. How many Senators would be willing to vote today to start voluntarily admitting three-quarters of a million, or more, new people--most of whom are poor, unskilled or low-skilled and don't speak English--every year? I dare say that most of those who did so would face serious reelection problems when outraged voters learned of their actions. Perhaps, this is why the Judiciary Committee's legal immigration bill uses admission assumptions that are much lower than recent INS projections. Perhaps, some people hope to escape voters' wrath by claiming that they did not know what's happening and what's obviously going to happen if we don't make big cuts and other reforms. Whatever their reasoning, whatwe are experiencing is legislative business as usual, catering to the high immigration and cheap labor lobbies when it comes to legal immigration.                Time To Face Legal Immigration Realities  Well, my colleagues, we are paying a high price now for years of excessive Federal spending and for using smoke and mirrors accounting to understate our budgetary problems. We are facing an analogous problem here for having allowed both legal and illegal immigration levels to be excessive for years, and for failing to acknowledge difficulties caused by high legal immigration.  We simply must begin facing up to the real numbers and the problems associated with admitting far too many new people through legal immigration. About three-fourths of our immigration comes from legal immigrants. That's three times our level of illegal immigration. Why are we trying to close the backdoor of illegal immigration and lamenting about all the impacts illegals are causing, but at the same time disregarding the fact that the front door is open wider than ever? Congress must stop giving little or no thought to the obvious interconnection between legal and illegal immigration and their similar adverse impacts. In the last Presidential campaign, there was a popular saying ``It's the economy stupid!'' Well, with respect to the heart of our immigration problems it can be said ``It's the numbers stupid!''--we get three times more numbers from legal immigration than illegal.                       Legal Immigration's Costs  Our current legal admissions policy fails to take into account whether such a massive influx of newcomers is needed, or the burdens placed on taxpayers for the immigrants' added costs for public education, health care, welfare, criminal justice, infrastructure and various other services and forms of public assistance. Let me highlight some of these costs:  Education--For example, excessive numbers of legal immigrants are putting a crippling strain on America's education system. About one-third of our immigrants are public school aged. Immigrant children and the children of recent immigrants are greatly increasing school enrollments and adding significantly to school costs in many areas.  Schools in many high immigration communities are twice as crowded as those in low immigration cities.  In 1995, the Miami public school system was getting new foreign students at a rate of 120 per day, and as I noted earlier, Florida's costs in 1993 for legal immigrant education came to over half a billion dollars.  Hundreds of thousands of children from immigrant families speak little or no English. This causes a tremendous increase in education costs and diverts limited dollars that are needed elsewhere in our school systems. English as a Second Language programs are very expensive. Non-English speaking immigrant children cost taxpayers 50 percent more in education costs per child.  Welfare--Legal immigrants, who make up the largest part of our foreign-born population, also are costing billions for various forms of public assistance:  According to the GAO, about 30 percent of all U.S. immigrants are living in poverty. The GAO has found that legal immigrants received most of the $1.2 billion in AFDC benefits that went to immigrants.  Immigrants now take 45 percent of all the SSI funds spent on the elderly according to the GAO. In 1983, only 3.3 percent of legal resident aliens received SSI, but in 1993 this figure jumped to 11.5 percent; 128,000 in 1983 vs. 738,000 by 1994. This is a 580 percent increase in just 12 years.  The House Ways and Means Committee indicates that in 1996, around 990,000 resident aliens--who are non-citizens--are receiving SSI and Medicaid benefits, costing $5.1 billion for SSI and another $9.3 billion for Medicaid, for a total of $14.4 billion. The committee projects that this cost for legal immigrants will jump to over $67 billion a year by 2004.  As our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, has pointed out, only about 40 percent of our immigrants are covered by health insurance, and therefore immigrants have to rely heavily on taxpayer funded public health services.  Recent analysis by Prof. George Borjas of Harvard University of new Census Bureau data also has confirmed immigrants are using more public benefits. Borjas points out that immigrant households were less likely than native-born Americans to receive welfare in 1970. However, his analysis shows that today immigrant households are almost 50 percent more likely to receive cash and non-cash public assistance--they are about 50 percent more likely to receive AFDC; 75 percent more likely to receive SSI; 64 percent more likely to receive Medicaid; 42 percent more likely to receive food stamps; and 27 percent more likely to receive public housing assistance.  Borjas also notes that 22 percent of the California's households are immigrants, but they get 40 percent of the public benefits; that 9 percent of Texas' households are immigrants, but they get 22 percent of the public assistance; and that 16 percent of New York's households are immigrants, but they get 22 percent of the public assistance benefits.  Jobs--At a time when we have millions of unemployed and underemployed American citizens--and millions more who will be needing jobs as they are weaned off welfare--our Federal immigration law continues to allow in a flood of foreigners to depress wages and take jobs that our own citizens need. While corporate cheap labor interests profit, it is American workers who suffer, especially those who are competing for lower skilled jobs. Most new legal immigrants are unskilled or low-skilled, and they clearly take many jobs native citizens otherwise would get.  Dr. Frank Morris, a noted African-American professor, pointed out in House testimony last year that immigration is having disproportionate adverse impacts on American blacks as follows:       There can be no doubt that our current practice of      permitting more than a million legal and illegal immigrants a      year into the US into our already difficult low skill      labor markets clearly leads to both wage depression and      the de facto displacement of African American workers with      low skills. . .. The American labor market is not exempt      from the laws of supply and demand. If the supply of      labor, especially unskilled labor, increases in markets      where significant numbers of African Americans reside for      any reason, you have either a wage depression or labor      substitution effect upon African Americans, who because we      have less education, work experience and small business      creation rates than other Americans, are      disproportionately negatively impacted in those markets. .      .. America is the only country in the world that has mass      immigration at a time of slow growth, and industrial      restructuring of the economy. African Americans are      disproportionately hurt by this process because almost      half of all immigrants head for cities that also have a      large number of African American residents searching and      fighting for better low rent housing, better low skill      requirement but high paying jobs, and better public school      education for their offspring.  Secretary of Labor Reich in testimony regarding needed immigration reforms on September 28, 1995 before the Senate's Subcommittee on Immigration commented on the ``fundamental question of what purpose our employment- or skill-based immigration policy is meant to serve'' as follows:       This nation of immigrants always has and always will      welcome new members into the American family, though at a      different pace and in different ways to suit the times. . ..      Employment-based immigration to fill skill shortages, as well      as the temporary admission of selected skilled foreign      workers, is sometimes unavoidable. But I firmly believe that      hiring foreign over domestic workers should be the rare      exception, not the rule. And I believe such exceptions should      be even rarer, and more tightly targeted on gaps in the      domestic labor market than is generally the case under      current policy. . .. If employers must turn to foreign labor,      this is a symptom signaling defects in America's skill-     building system. Our system for giving employers access to      global markets should be structured to remedy such defects,      not acquiesce in them. And it should progressively diminish,      not merely perpetuate, firms' dependence on the skills of      foreign workers.  Crime--Immigrants also put a strain on our criminal justice system--over 25 percent of the Federal prison inmates are foreign-born. This is clearly very disproportionate to immigrants' percentage of our general population, which is about 9 percent. Large numbers of these criminal aliens were admitted legally. It cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars just to incarcerate them.  After an extensive study, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations reported in April 1995 that:       Aliens now account for over 25 percent of Federal prison      inmates and represent the fastest growing segment of Federal      prison population. A conservative estimate is that there are      450,000 aliens who have been convicted of a crime and who are      in prison, in jail, on probation or on parole in the United      States. Criminal aliens not only occupy beds in our prisons      and jails, they also occupy the time and resources of law      enforcement and our courts.  Mr. President, I say that we must recognize such negative impacts from excessive levels of legal immigration, and that we have a moral obligation to take care of American citizens first. We certainly cannot do so without making drastic cuts in legal immigration numbers. We also must change the criteria to give much more emphasis to immigrants' skills and our changing labor needs.           Responsible, Reasonable Legal Immigration Reforms  Many opponents of reforming legal immigration who are fighting desperately to continue the status quo say that only radical or even reactionary people favor major changes in this area. Their contentions are erroneous. Bringing our legal immigration system back under control and making it more in accord with our national interests is far from radical.  Let me remind my colleagues again that the bipartisan U.S. Immigration Reform Commission, under the leadership of the late former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, has recommended fundamental reforms in the current legal immigration system. The Commission's recommendations included substantial reductions in legal admission levels and abolishing a number of admission categories including brothers and sisters of citizens and adult children of permanent residents. Surely, proposing such fundamental changes because they concluded this would be in our national interest does not mean that distinguished Americans like Barbara Jordan are radical or reactionary.  Moreover, the overwhelming majority of the American people certainly are not radical or reactionary, and they clearly want Congress to dramatically reduce legal immigration numbers. And dramatic is perhaps the best way of describing the results of a recently released national Roper Poll on immigration. This Roper Poll found over 83 percent of Americans favor lower immigration levels. Seventy percent favor keeping overall immigration below 300,000 per year, and this view is supported generally across racial, ethnic, and other lines--52 percent of Hispanics, 73 percent of blacks, 72 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans. A majority of the public--54 percent--want immigration cut below 100,000 per year; and 20 percent favor having no immigration at all. Even reform opponents were surprised to learn that only 2 percent favor keeping the current levels. It should be noted that the questions used in this poll specifically advised respondents that current levels of legal and illegal immigration totaled over 1,000,000 new immigrants per year. The people's answers stated the immigration levels they favored for all immigration, including both legal and illegal. While this new Roper Poll is consistent with many earlier polls, it shows even stronger public sentiment on these issues. Thus, it is clear that the public wants dramatically lower legal immigration.  Mr. President, we must listen to the American people on this vital issue. If we care what our constituents think, if we truly want to represent their views, and if we care about doing what's best for our country, we will cut legal immigration substantially and we will make other fundamental changes in the system to end chain migration by extended family members and to give much greater weight to immigrants' education and skills and our employment needs. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to begin to make the responsible, reasonable reforms needed in our legal immigration policies.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several articles showing the need for immigration reform be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the San Diego Union Tribune, Apr. 24]                            Border Surprise       Washington.--Despite contentions by President Clinton's      administration that legal immigration is tapering off under      existing law, the flow is expected to soar by 41 percent this      year over 1995 and remain substantially above last year's      level for the foreseeable future.       This forecast comes from unreleased data compiled by the      Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).       The projections, obtained by Capley News News Service,      triggered an outcry yesterday from advocates of tougher      restrictions on legal immigration. They responded to the      disclosures by charging that the INS had intentionally misled      Congress and the public during this year's stormy debate over      whether to cut legal immigration.       The projections show immigration rising from 593,000 last      year to 835,000 this year and 853,000 in 1997. The overall      numbers actually will be about 100,000 higher because the      projections do not include refugees and several other groups      of people admitted legally.       For that reason, the overall number for next year is      expected to be closer to 1 million than to 853,000.       At a key moment in the congressional debate the INS held a      press conference during which it stressed the downward trend      in the immigration levels during the past two years. The      officials failed to disclose the agency's forecast showing      the huge surge beginning this year.       If the law remains substantially unchanged as appears      likely at this point, the average annual level of legal      immigration over the next eight years would be about 29      percent higher than in 1995.       They clearly misled the American people and Congress,      knowing they were telling part of the truth but not the whole      truth,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith R-Texas, chairman of the House      Immigration subcommittee.       ``It's inexcusable, and what it really says is, `How can we      believe what they say again when it comes to immigration      figures?' ''       Smith led a failed 16-month drive in the House to cut legal      immigration. It was defeated earlier this month.       A White House spokeswoman said she could not comment on      internal INS projections she had not seen. But she said the      notion that legal immigration would rise sharply was      inconsistent with what INS officials had told her.       A senior INS official denied any effort on the part of the      agency to mislead Congress, saying agency officials had      testified on Capitol Hill that they expected immigration      levels to rise--not fall--under current law.       Robert Bach, executive associate commissioner for policy      and planning of the INS, briefed reporters hours before a      pivotal March 28 Senate vote and stressed the declines in      immigration during fiscal years 1994 and 1995. The report he      released that day also was circulated widely on Capitol Hill.       Yesterday, Bach said there had been no effort to mislead      reporters.       He said that ``we reported on what was'' in the two      previous years.       ``We didn't spin the future,'' Bach said.       He said that ``it was a straightforward report'' on what      happened in 1994 and 1995.       But Smith disagreed.       ``They (INS officials) justified their position in      supporting an amendment to take out legal immigration reform      by saying the numbers were coming down anyway,'' he said.      ``And they knew the numbers would be jumping up as they were      speaking.''       Restrictionsists including Smith argue that current levels      of legal immigration have placed economic burdens on states      such as California, Texas, Florida, New York and New Jersey      where most immigrants reside. They also say immigrants      increase the competition that low-skill domestic workers face      for low-wage jobs.       Immigration advocates argue that the burdens of legal      immigration are exaggerated and that, overall, it is good for      America. Some of them attribute restrictionist sentiment to      racism and xenophobia.       Clinton had endorsed a controversial 1995 recommendation by      the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform to significantly      cut legal immigration. But his administration has quietly      lobbied against the congressional initiatives, saying they go      too far. And it provided a crucial and possibly fatal blow to      reform efforts in the House by coming out in support of the      amendment that killed legal immigration reform there earlier      this month.       An effort by Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., chairman of the      Senate immigration subcommittee, also was defeated. Instead,      the Judiciary Committee approved an amendment by Sens.      Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.       Their proposal is the only legal immigration legislative      initiative that remains alive in Congress. No date has been      set for it to be debated on the Senate floor.       The INS predicts that immigration under the Abraham-Kennedy      provision would decline by 4,000 from current law, or less      than .5 percent. That means the 29 percent higher levels      forecast for the next eight years would occur even under the      Abraham-Kennedy plan. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., voted      for the amendment after being assured by its authors that it      would entail significant cuts.       Feinstein has said California needs cuts in legal      immigration. But she was unavailable Monday or yesterday to      comment on the INS projections.       Those projections show that legal immigration even under      the scuttled Simpson provisions--the most restrictive of the      proposals--would have been 7.5 percent higher over the next      eight years than last year's level.       The immigration surge is attributed to the rougly 3 million      people legalized under the     1986 overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. Many have      become citizens and are petitioning for the immediate and      unlimited admission of their spouses, minor children and      parents.       ``It's very clear that INS is trying to play down these      (rising immigration) numbers as much as possible,'' said      Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies. ``It's      just amazing what information the INS decides to leave in or      leave out or present or not present. And there's no reason      for it other than to affect the current congressional      immigration debate.''       Immigration advocacy groups, which were allies with the INS      in the effort to defeat the legislative reforms, said they      had been waryed how the INS used its figures.       ``We never made a big deal about the declines (in 1994 and      1995); the INS did,'' said Frank Sharry, head of the National      Immigration Forum, which has played a key role in the      campaign to block substantial cuts in legal immigration. ``We      always knew the numbers would spike up.''       But Sharry insisted that the INS projections overstated      both the extent and the duration of the surge. He called the      INS projections ``laughable.''       ``This will be a one-time blip that will occur over the      next few years,'' he said. ``We're quibbling over rather      small differences based on questionable projections that are      being (politically) spun by restrictionists to bring about a      major reduction in immigration levels.''                                                                    ____                [From the New York Times, Mar. 19, 1996]                    Too Many Engineers, Too Few Jobs                       (By Michael S. Teitelbaum)       Is there such an acute shortage of skilled scientists and      engineers that America's computer industry and research      laboratories must recruit thousands of foreign workers yearly      in order to compete globally?       That's what Sun Microsystems, Intel, Microsoft, the      National Association of Manufacturers and the American      Immigration Lawyers Association would have you believe. They      successfully lobbied Congress to drop immigration reform      proposals that would have held down increases in the number      of highly skilled foreign workers. Statistics, however,      contradict them. There is no shortage of scientists,      engineers or software professionals. If anything, there is a      surplus.       Claims of an impending dearth of scientists and engineers      began a decade ago, when Erich Bloch, then the director of      the National Science Foundation, declared that unless action      was taken, there would be a cumulative shortfall of 675,000      over the next two decades.       Congress responded. The National Science Foundation      received tens of millions of additional dollars for science      and engineering education. And in 1990, Congress nearly      tripled the number--to 140,000 per year--of employment-based      visas for immigrants with certain skills.       Not surprisingly, the number of science and engineering      doctorates reached record levels. From 1983 to 1993, the      annual number of Americans earning such Ph.D.'s increased 13      percent. But the number of slots for graduate students grew      even more dramatically during that time--about 40 percent.      The excess spaces were filled by foreign students, who often      stayed in America to compete in the job market. Meanwhile,      the United States sharply increased the number of foreign-     born scientists and engineers it let in; 39,000 were      admitted in 1985, 82,000 in 1993.       The labor shortage never materialized. But global      competition rose and the cold war ended. High-tech      corporations and defense contractors were forced to downsize;      state budget crises forced large universities to sharply      reduce their hiring of new faculty.       Unemployment among scientists and engineers remains much      lower than for low-skilled workers, as it does for all highly      educated workers. Nonetheless, tens of thousands of highly      skilled professionals have been laid off. For instance, from      1991 through 1994, I.B.M. laid off 86,000 workers; AT&T,      Boeing and Hughes Aircraft laid off a total of 135,000      workers.       It is an employer's market; stagnant or declining salaries      have been the trend. For instance, from 1968 through 1995,      the median annual salary, including benefits, for an engineer      with 10 years of experience declined 13 percent in constant      dollars, to $52,900. Meanwhile, salaries in other professions      like medicine and law greatly increased.       Job prospects for recently minted scientists and engineers      have plummeted. A 1995 study by Stanford University's      Institute for Higher Education Research concluded that ``too      many doctorates are being produced in engineering, math and      some sciences,'' not including biological and computer      sciences. It said: ``Overproduction, estimated to average at      least 25 percent, contradicts predictions of long-term      shortages, given current demand.''       Engineers and software professionals who have lost their      jobs could be easily retrained to the big high-tech      companies. However, there is no incentive to do so, as long      as they can easily hire from U.S.-educated foreign nationals.       As one software professional let go by a computer company      reported, he and his colleagues are ``disposable'' rather      than ``recyclable.''       In short, the situation is out of balance. A record number      of Ph.D.'s, but a weak job market. Claims of a labor      shortage, but stagnant or declining wages. Thousands of laid-     off professionals, but increased foreign recruitment.      Shortage or surplus? Ask any downsized engineer or computer      professional for the answer.                                                                    ____               [From the National Review, Mar. 11, 1996]                           The Welfare Magnet                           (By George Borjas)       The evidence has become overwhelming: immigrant      participation in welfare programs is on the rise. In 1970,      immigrant households were slightly less likely than native      households to receive cash benefits like AFDC (Aid to      Families with Dependent Children) or SSI (Supplementary      Security Income). By 1990, immigrant households were more      likely to receive such cash benefits (9.1 per cent v. 7.4 per      cent). Pro-immigration lobbyists are increasingly falling      back on the excuse that this immigrant-native ``welfare gap''      is attributable solely to refugees and/or elderly immigrants;      or that the gap is not numerically large. (Proportionately,      it's ``only'' 23 per cent).       But the Census does not provide any information about the      use of noncash transfers. These are programs like Food      Stamps, Medicaid, housing subsidies, and the myriad of other      subsidies that make up the modern welfare state. And noncash      transfers comprise over three quarters of the cost of all      means-tested entitlement programs. In 1991, the value of      these noncash transfers totaled about $140 billion.       Recently available data help provide a more complete      picture. The Survey of Income and Program Participation      (SIPP) samples randomly selected households about their      involvement in virtually all means-tested programs. From      this, the proportion of immigrant households that receive      benefits from any particular program can be calculated.       The results are striking. The ``welfare gap'' between      immigrants and natives is much larger when noncash transfers      are included [see table]. Taking all types of welfare      together, immigrant participation is 20.7 per cent. For      native born households, it's only 14.1 per cent--a gap of 6.6      percentage points (proportionately, 47 per cent).       And the SIPP data also indicate that immigrants spend a      relatively large fraction of their time participating in some      means-tested program. In other words, the ``welfare gap''      does not occur because many immigrant households receive      assistance for a short time, but because a significant      proportion--more than the native-born--receive assistance for      the long haul.       Finally, the SIPP data show that the types of welfare      benefits received by particular immigrant groups influence      the type of welfare benefits received by later immigrants      from the same group. Implication: there appear to be networks      operating within ethnic communities which transmit      information about the availability of particular types of      welfare to new arrivals.       The results are even more striking in detail. Immigrants      are more likely to participate in practically every one of      the major means-tested programs. In the early 1990s, the      typical immigrant family household had a 4.4 per cent      probability of receiving AFDC, v. 2.9 per cent of native-born      families. [Further details in Table 1].

Borjas and Lynette, Hilton, ``Immigration and the       Welfare State: Immigrant Participation in Means-Tested Entitlement      Programs,'' Quarterly Journal of Economics, forthcoming, May 1996.           And that overall ``welfare gap'' becomes even wider if      immigrant families are compared to non-Hispanic white native-     born households. Immigrants are almost twice as likely to      receive some type of assistance--20.7 percent v. 10.5      percent.       The SIPP data also allow us to calculate the dollar value      of the benefits disbursed to immigrant households, as      compared to the native-born. In the early 1990s, 8 percent of      households were foreign-born. These immigrant households      accounted for 13.8 percent of the cost of the programs. They      cost almost 75 percent more than their representation in the      population.       The disproportionate disbursement of benefits to immigrant      households is particularly acute in California, a state which      has both a lot of immigrants and very generous welfare      programs. Immigrants make up only 21 percent of the      households in California. But these households consume 39.5      percent of all the benefit dollars distributed in the state.      It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that the welfare      problem in California is on the verge of becoming an      immigrant problem.       The pattern holds for other states. In Texas, where 89      percent of households are     immigrant but which has less generous welfare, immigrants      receive 22 percent of benefits distributed. In New York      State, 16 percent of the households are immigrants. They      receive 22.2 percent of benefits.       The SIPP data track households over a 32-month period This      allows us to determine if immigrant welfare participation is      temporary--perhaps the result of dislocation and adjustment--     or long-term and possibly permanent.       The evidence is disturbing. During the early 1990s, nearly      a third (31.3 percent) of immigrant households participated      in welfare programs at some point in the tracking period.      Only just over a fifth (22.7 percent) of native-born      households did so. And 10.3 percent of immigrant households      received benefits through the entire period, v. 7.3 percent      of native-born households.       Because the Bureau of the Census began to collect the SIPP      data in 1984, we can use it to assess if there have been any      noticeable changes in immigrant welfare use. It turns out      there has been a very rapid rise.       During the mid-1980s, the probability that an immigrant      household received some type of assistance was 17.7 percent      v. 14.6 percent for natives, a gap of 3.1 percentage points.      By the early 1990s, recipient immigrant households had risen      to 20.7 percent, v. 14.1 percent for natives. The immigrant-     native ``welfare gap,'' therefore, more than doubled in less      than a decade.       Thus immigrants are not only more likely to have some      exposure to the welfare system; they are also more likely to      be ``permanent'' recipients. And the trend is getting worse.      Unless eligibility requirements are made much more stringent,      much of the welfare use that we see now in the immigrant      population may remain with us for some time. This raises      troubling questions about the impact of this long-term      dependency on the immigrants--and on their U.S.-born      children.       There is huge variation in welfare participation among      immigrant groups. For example, about 4.3 percent of      households originating in Germany, 26.8 percent of households      originating in Mexico, and 40.6 per cent of households      originating in the former Soviet Union are covered by      Medicaid. Similarly, about 17.2 per cent of households      originating in Italy, 36 per cent from Mexico and over 50      per cent in the Dominican Republic received some sort of      welfare benefit.       A more careful look at these national-origin differentials      reveals an interesting pattern: national-origin groups tend      to ``major'' in particular types of benefit. For example,      Mexican immigrants are 50 per cent more likely to receive      energy assistance than Cuban immigrants. But Cubans are more      likely to receive housing benefits than Mexicans.       The SIPP data reveal a very strong positive correlation      between the probability that new arrivals belonging to a      particular immigrant group receive a particular type of      benefit, and the probability that earlier arrivals from the      same group received that type of assistance. This correlation      remains strong even after we control for the household's      demographic background, state of residence, and other      factors. And the effect is not small. A 10 percentage point      increase in the fraction of the existing immigrant stock who      receive benefits from a particular program implies about a 10      per cent increase in the probability that a newly arrived      immigrant will receive those benefits.       This confirms anecdotal evidence. Writing in the New      Democrat--the mouthpiece of the Democratic Leadership      Council--Norman Matloff reports that ``a popular Chinese-     language book sold in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Chinese      bookstores in the United States includes a 36-page guide to      SSI and other welfare benefits'' and that the ``World      Journal, the largest Chinese-language newspaper in the United      States, runs a `Dear Abby'-style column on immigration      matters, with welfare dominating the discussion.''       And the argument that the immigrant-native ``welfare gap''      is caused by refugees and/or elderly immigrants? We can check      its validity by removing from the calculations all immigrant      households that either originate in countries from which      refugees come or that contain any elderly persons.       Result: 17.3 per cent of this narrowly defined immigrant      population receives benefits, v. 13 per cent of native      households that do not contain any elderly persons. Welfare      gap: 4.3 percentage points (proportionately, 33 per cent).      The argument that the immigrant welfare problems is caused by      refugees and the elderly is factually incorrect.       Conservatives typically stress the costs of maintaining the      welfare state. But we must not delude ourselves into thinking      that nothing is gained from the provision of antibiotics to      sick children or from giving food to poor families.       At the same time, however, these welfare programs introduce      a cost which current calculations of the fiscal costs and      benefits of immigration do not acknowledge and which might      well dwarf the current fiscal expenditures. That cost can be      expressed as follows: To what extent does a generous welfare      state reduce the work incentives of current immigrants, and      change the nature of the immigrant flow by influencing      potential immigrants' decisions to come--and to stay?
