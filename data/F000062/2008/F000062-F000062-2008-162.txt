 President, the purpose of this amendment is to strengthen the legal requirement that FISA is the exclusive authority for the electronic surveillance of Americans. When FISA was written in 1978, it followed 30 years of warrantless surveillance of communications and telegrams of hundreds of thousands of Americans sending messages outside the country. This would stress that FISA is the legal way for the collection of electronic surveillance against Americans.  In 2001, the administration decided they would not take the Terrorist Surveillance Program to the FISA Court, that they would perform this program outside of FISA, and it took until January of 2007 to bring this within the confines of FISA where it is to this day.  I think we need to make a strong statement in this bill that FISA is the exclusive authority for the electronic surveillance of all Americans, and this amendment aims to do that. It provides penalties for moving outside of the law, and I believe it would strengthen the opportunity to prevent the Chief Executive, either now or in the future, from moving outside of this law.
