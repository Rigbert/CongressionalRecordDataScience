 With respect for all of my colleagues, I rise in support of the Stupak amendment, which maintains existing Federal law, the Hyde amendment, on the compelling issue of abortion.  For 34 years, citizens of conscience have weighed in on this important moral and legal issue. Let me repeat: This amendment reaffirms longstanding, existing law and nothing more. It represents the broad consensus of the American people after 34 years of consideration on this issue. This is what it says:  ``No Federal funds 'authorized under this act may be used to pay for any abortion or cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion,' except in the cases of the life of the mother, rape or incest.''  The amendment does no more, no less. It is similar to language that applies in Federal law on Medicaid, Medicare, Veterans Affairs, the CHIP program, and the Federal Health Employees Program, which is a model for how this language should be applied. It has been tried, tested and proven. The inclusion of this amendment clarifies the bill's language on the potential fungibility of premium dollars.  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and the bill.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield for a unanimous consent request to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).  (
