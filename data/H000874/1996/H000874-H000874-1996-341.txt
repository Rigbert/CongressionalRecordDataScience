Speaker, I rise today to recognize the efforts of more than 100 individuals--both paid and volunteer--who spent many hours in the cold waters and on the shoreline of the Wicomico River searching for the late William E. Colby, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The search ended early Monday morning after his body was discovered near the shoreline, ending an intense search that began when his canoe was found April 28.  There were many agencies and organizations involved in the search which was headed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police. I want to recognize all of the participants in this search, including Sheriff Fred Davis and the Charles County Sheriff's Department who handled press inquiries and protected the Colby residence.  The search involved countless volunteer hours and assistance from: the Maryland State Police Aviation Division; the Charles County Dive Team, who were the first divers in the search; the Cobb Island Volunteer Fire Department and EMS; the Seventh District Volunteer Fire Department Boat 5 from St. Mary's County; the Marbury Volunteer Fire Department--using their rescue boat and dive team; the Bel Alton Volunteer Fire Department; the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Department Dive Team; the Calvert County Dive Team; the U.S. Coast Guard; the Prince George's County Dive Team--Companies 22, 49, and 56; the La Plata Volunteer Fire Department; Sardom Search and Rescue Dogs; the Cobb Island Volunteer Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary; the Charles County Communications Department; the Virginia State Marine Police; the Naval Surface Warfare Center EOD Dive Team and the Rescue Squad Dive Team from Dahlgren, VA; and numerous local citizens who volunteered in many different ways.  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the efforts of the paid and volunteer members of this special community. These individuals engage in hundreds of hours of specialized training and continuing education to enhance lifesaving skills just to be ready for emergency rescue calls and searches. Charles County and other communities across America benefit daily from the services of these dedicated professionals who are ready 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and they deserve our continued thanks.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the efforts of the volunteer fire and rescue services personnel and other agencies involved in the intense search for Mr. Colby which lasted more than 1 week. I want each of them to know that my colleagues in Congress share my pride in the selfless manner in which they carry out their mission in our community and every community throughout America.                          ____________________
