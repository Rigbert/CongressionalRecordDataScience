 S. Department of Education, on a case-by-case basis, to award a Pell grant to a needy student that wants to get a teaching credential, but needs that 5th year required by the state. We all know that even 4 years of college is costly, and many students cannot afford it. That is the rationale, the purpose, and the foundation of the Pell Grant program.  Well, if you cannot afford 4 years, you likely cannot afford a 5th year. Therefore, we lose teachers because young people cannot afford that 5th year. And it is one of the reasons why today in California we have 21,000 teachers who are not credentialed. This would permit, on a case-by-case basis, a Pell grant to be granted to a needy student for that 5th year.  These students in California would get a bachelor's degree in an academic subject, such as biology or French or whatever it is, and then take a 5th year in teacher education. That 5th year consists of learning teaching methods and of student or practice teaching.  The American Council on Education, a consortium of all the higher education groups, has said, ``These students [in California] who want to teach are unfairly caught in a state requirement `catch-22' and should not be penalized as a result.''  One of the central purposes of the higher education bill is to strengthen teacher education. And it is long overdue; and it is well met by this bill. I think we can all be very proud of the vote we will cast.  Title II authorizes new grants to States and to institutions to reform and toughen teacher training. Once again, California may well be leading the way because requiring this fifth year is also a good way to strengthen teacher education.  According to the National Commission on Teaching, each dollar spent on improving teacher qualifications nets greater gains in student learning than any other use of the education dollar. This study and others have found that teacher quality is very uneven through this country. Just last week, in the ranking member's State, Massachusetts, the state Board of Education said that 56 percent of their teachers failed the State's first basic reading and writing test for teachers. Nationwide, over one-quarter of newly hired teachers lack the qualifications for their jobs according, again, to the Teaching Commission.  Studies also show that unprepared or underprepared teachers simply don't stick it out. They are more likely to leave teaching after a few years. In my State, California, 30 percent of the teachers leave after their first 2 years; after 5 years, almost half of California's teachers have left. A November 1997 report of the California Advisory Panel on teacher education found in hard-to-staff schools as many as half of all beginning teachers leave teaching permanently after only 3 years in the classroom. That is shocking to me. Among underprepared teachers, this attrition rate climbs to two-thirds. What this is saying is that if a teacher isn't prepared, doesn't have the qualifications, doesn't have the teaching skills and aptitude, two-thirds of them leave within 3 years. This undermines education.  There is a precedent for the approach of this amendment. Congress gave the Secretary the authority to award year-long Pell grants, similar to what this amendment does, in 1992.  I want just quickly to make a few other comments on the teacher shortage and why this amendment is important. We have, as I said, 21,000 teachersin California on emergency credentials. That is 1 out of every 11 teachers. Half of California's math and science teachers didn't minor in those subjects in college, but they are still teaching. That is wrong. In Los Angeles, according to a U.S. News & World Report article last October, ``New teachers have included Nordstrom clerks, a former clown, and several chiropractors.''  This is a situation that shouldn't exist. It exists because there are not enough teachers. Therefore, emergency credentials are granted and these credentials can go on for 10 or 15 years and be granted to people who are really not qualified to teach. They are certainly not credentialled to teach.  The need for good teachers is exacerbated by the fact that we need these new teachers in the next decade because public school enrollment in California is growing at triple the national rate. In California, the need for new teachers is triple the national rate.  I am hopeful that this amendment would be accepted by this Senate.  The amendment is going to be particularly helpful to prospective teachers enrolled at California State University. This is an institution today which prepares 60 percent of my State's teaching force. At this university, 48 percent of the students are Pell-grant eligible and the average Pell grant is $1,200 to $1,500. The University of California has 1,200 candidates for a teaching credential each year, and one-third are eligible for Pell grants. Thus, 400 UC students could benefit from a fifth year Pell grant each year.  Essentially, this amendment is going to encourage more needy students to stick it out, to get that teaching credential, to do that fifth year at the university. That means that our young elementary and secondary students are going to be better served because they will have a teacher in the classroom who is qualified to teach. I, frankly, believe and would propose and urge the California Legislature to eliminate all emergency credentials by the year 2005 and be able to provide that the California teacher corps, K-12, is essentially 100 percent credentialled. But they will not be able to get there unless this body is willing to pass this amendment today.  Again, in summary, California requires a fifth year. These students are not eligible for Pell grants for the fifth year. Forty-eight percent of the students who would go into teaching need these grants. We need 250,000 new teachers. We currently have 21,000 teachers teaching who are not qualified to teach, who are teaching on so-called emergency credentials. The quality of education, its excellence and its accountability, I believe, will be heightened by this amendment.  I thank both the chairman and the ranking member. I am hopeful you will accept the amendment.  I yield the floor.                             Exhibit No. 1                              The California State University,                                     Long Beach, CA, July 8, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: When I came to the California State      University in March of this year, I established as a top      system priority strengthening and improving the quality of      our teacher preparation programs. Over the next decade, in      California alone, we will need an additional 250,000 new K-12      classroom teachers. In addition to our changing demographics,      the shortage of teachers in California is particularly acute      due to the State's classroom size reduction initiative,      together with the large number of teachers who are expected      to retire over the next 10-20 years.       As you know, one in eleven California teachers is teaching      under an emergency certificate or waiver. Although the State      of California requires that prospective teachers complete a      5th year of classroom preparation and pedagogy following      receipt of their baccalaureate degree in order to become      fully credentialed, these 5th-year students--who are      considered neither undergraduate nor graduate students--lack      access to federal grant aid. Your Pell Grant amendment to S.      1882 would go a long way to encourage financially needy      students to persist in their studies so that they may become      fully certified to teach in California's K-12 schools--rather      than deferring completion of their requisite 5th year while      teaching under an emergency certificate.       Indeed, those who enter the classroom without the necessary      preparation are more likely to permanently leave the      profession. In its November 1997 report to the California      Commission on Teacher Credentialing, the Advisory Panel on      Teacher Education, Induction and Certification for Twenty-     First Century Schools states, ``In many hard-to-staff      schools, as many as half of all beginning teachers leave      teaching permanently after only three years in the classroom.      Among under-prepared new teachers, this attrition rate climbs      to two-thirds.''       On behalf of the California State University, which      prepares more than half of the 18,000 new teachers      credentialed in California each year, I wish to express my      appreciation for your efforts to ensure that California's      21st Century teachers have access to the federal financial      assistance they need to become fully prepared to provide all      of California's children with the quality education they      deserve.       With kind regards,           Sincerely,                                                  Charles B. Reed,                                                       Chancellor.
