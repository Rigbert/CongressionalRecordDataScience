 President, I rise today with Senator Saxby Chambliss to honor and thank one of the Senate's longest-serving and most widely-respected professional staff members--Kathleen McGhee. Kathleen is retiring this week after 33 years of continual service to the Select Committee on Intelligence.  As all Senators know, much of the work of the Senate is done quietly and behind the scenes, by staff whose names are not in the papers and who are not in public service for the recognition. This is especially true for the work of the Intelligence Committee, which operates behind closed doors and--when things are working right--without public attention. For 33 years, Kathleen McGhee was the person who made sure that the committee operated professionally by ensuring that our hearings ran smoothly, reports were written, letters sent and received, transcripts maintained, and budgets were met, all in a timely fashion.  The only thing she has not been able to overcome is the mice.  Kathleen came to the committee shortly after graduating from the University of Maryland, joining the committee staff on April 7, 1980, in order to assist the committee's arms control expert. She subsequently provided administrative support to the committee's budget director, minority counsel, and minority staff director. In 1987, Chairman David L. Boren appointed Kathleen as the chief clerk of the Intelligence Committee, a position she has held ever since.  In her time here, she has been present when some of our Nation's most important national security issues were considered and debated--from espionage during the Cold War to the response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and many more. In the thousands of hearings, briefings, and markups she has run, Kathleen has truly seen and heard it all.  Kathleen has served as clerk, and mostly as chief clerk, for 11 committee chairmen: Birch Bayh, Barry Goldwater, Dave Durenberger, David Boren, Dennis DeConcini, Arlen Specter, Richard Shelby, Bob Graham, Pat Roberts, Jay Rockefeller, and for me. Owing to the nature of the committee and its rules, and to her even-handed, nonpartisan approach, she has also served many Vice Chairmen equally well during her tenure: Patrick Moynihan, Pat Leahy, Bill Cohen, Frank Murkowski, John Warner, Bob Kerrey, Richard Bryan, Kit Bond, and now Saxby Chambliss, to name a few. Few people in the U.S. Congress can say that they have worked for so many Senators--85 Senators in all--and as professionally.  As importantly, in her time here, and especially as the committee's chief clerk for more than two decades, Kathleen has worked with more than 300 staffers who have uniformly appreciated and respected her professionalism and collegiality. Kathleen has managed the administrative staff and functions of the committee, and coordinated with other Senate offices on matters ranging from the rules to the architecture. She has walked dozens of staff directors through the preparation and execution of the committee's budget and has been hailed repeatedly as the committee's ``institutional memory.''  As the chief clerk, Kathleen has been responsible for showing new staffers the ropes and making sure they were able to transition smoothly into their new roles on the committee staff. Especially for people used to the bureaucratic difficulties in the executive branch, her ability to pave the way has been nearly miraculous.  Sadly, but understandably, it is now the time for her own transition--although true to her form, Kathleen agreed to continue her service longer than anticipated in order to make sure that the hand-off to her successor would go smoothly.  Now, we are pleased to take the opportunity on behalf of the Senate to thank Kathleen McGhee for her tremendous service to the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Senate, andthe Nation. We wish her all the very best as she enjoys a well-earned retirement to her home in Falls Church, VA, and on her beloved shores of Bethany Beach, DE, with her husband Mike and children, Luke and Molly.                          ____________________
