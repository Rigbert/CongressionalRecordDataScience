 President, I commend the Senator from South Carolina for bringing up his amendment. I think it is something we should consider in conference. Senator Dodd had a colloquy about it on the side on the floor a few minutes ago.  At the end of the day, what we are interested in is a more actuarially sound flood insurance program, one that will make more sense after a lot of mapping goes on around the country that will broaden the program and not perpetuate subsidy over and over for four or five sales or four or five generations where property is sold.  The Senator from South Carolina is on the right track. I assure him I want to pursue this in conference.                      Amendment No. 4710 Withdrawn  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking member. I trust their judgment to work this issue out in conference. I think the bill has made a lot of progress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.
