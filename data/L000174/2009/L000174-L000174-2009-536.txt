President, I was going back over the notes of what I said. I don't find anything where I ascribe any motives to the Senator from Oklahoma. I am shocked that he thought I had. If there is any implication in the record that I was ascribing motive to my friend and valued member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it certainly was not intended. I did, however, relate the fact that he held up the bill for some considerable period of time. That is a fact. That is in the Record. That is known. I will let him explain why he held it up. I ascribe no motives. In fact, in my 36 years in the Senate, I have not ascribed motives to any colleague of mine, even if he or she placed a hold on a bill. I am not about to start now. The fact is, the Senator from Oklahoma did place a hold on the important Emmett Till bill. The fact is, the full Senate did pass it over his objection. The fact is, we do have a letter from Eric Holder, the Attorney General, promising that his Justice Department has already, and will continue, to commit its resources towards prosecuting civil rights era cold cases. The fact is, the money we want to have is already in the bill we consider today. And the fact is, we have to pass this bill with the appropriations in here, including for the Department of Justice, so we can move forward as a nation. We must ensure that the Emmett Till bill is more than simply a statute. It must also be an answer to the hopes of all Americans that justice might finally occur inso many of the unsolved civil rights cases.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from Eric Holder.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         The Attorney General,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2009.     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and          Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chairwoman: The Department of Justice      wholeheartedly supports the goals of the Emmett Till Unsolved      Civil Rights Crime Act. The racially-motivated murders from      the civil rights era constitute some of the greatest      blemishes upon our history.       The Department is working in partnership with the National      Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the      Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Urban League to      investigate the unsolved racially-motivated violent crimes      committed more than 40 years ago. The FBI has prioritized the      top dozen of these cases, though there are more than 100      unsolved murder cases from the civil rights era under review      by the FBI.       You have my personal commitment that the Department will      continue to pursue these serious crimes in those matters in      which the law and the facts would permit effective law      enforcement action. We will continue to use our resources and      expertise to identify and locate those responsible for these      crimes and prosecute them whenever possible, consistent with      the Principles of Federal Prosecution.           Sincerely,                                               Eric H. Holder, Jr.
