Speaker, I rise today to recognize the inauguration of the new office complex for the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), and to highlight the importance of U.S.-Taiwan relations. This relationship has a vital impact on the peace, security and stability of the Western Pacific.  The inauguration ceremony for this new facility will be attended by a number of dignitaries, including Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. This event represents much more than the opening of just another new office complex in metropolitan Taipei. It stands as a concrete example of the firm commitment and unbreakable bonds that exist between the peoples of the United States and Taiwan.   Next year will mark the 40th anniversary of the passage and signing into law of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which has served as a cornerstone for our vigorous security, economic and people-to-people bilateral relationship. It was a proud moment in the history of this Congress when we took the lead in assuring that the Carter Administration's decision to grant diplomatic recognition to Beijing would not come at the expense of Taiwan. The people of Taiwan have earned our friendship and support as they share our own dedication to democracy, human rights, and a free market economy.   I am one of the few remaining members who personally witnessed the historic passage of the TRA. Let us stand with Taiwan here again today by recognizing the continued American support of Taiwan through the inauguration of this new AIT facility.                          ____________________
