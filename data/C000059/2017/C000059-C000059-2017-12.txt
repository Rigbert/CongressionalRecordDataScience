This topic was discussed at our EPA hearing in June. Administrator Pruitt called rumors about regional closures ``pure legend.''  Further, it costs money to close regional offices and move staff, and funding has not been requested to do so.                              {time}  1130  In addition, the closure of regional offices is something the administration would need to propose and go through the deliberative process here in Congress. It would require a multiyear effort.  As a wise man within the administration once said, ``we can close any lab or Federal building that is not located in Washington, D.C., or in a congressional district.''  As the fiscal year 2018 process has already demonstrated, while the President may propose changes, Congress has the final say in funding decisions.  In addition, this amendment would have unintended consequences as agencies review their footprints and propose ways to reduce their rent, security, utility costs, and operate more efficiently. All executive branch agencies are required to submit plans to the President on ways to operate more efficiently. We need to see these plans before jumping to any conclusions. So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
