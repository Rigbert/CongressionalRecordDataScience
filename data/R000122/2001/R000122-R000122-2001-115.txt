President, I rise today to recognize the 180th anniversary of Greek Independence. On March 25, 1821, ordinary Greek citizens with a conviction for freedom rose up against their oppressors. And, much like America's patriots, they struggled against overwhelming odds and won, bringing about their independence. For this reason, I was pleased to join my colleagues in cosponsoring and passing Senate Resolution 20 which designates March 25 as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.  On this anniversary, Greeks and Greek-Americans can reflect on the struggle for independence and be proud. Their ancestors stood up and fought for their freedom, ending 400 years of rule by the Ottoman Empire. History is quick to forget the details and summarize the outcome. That is why remembering the sacrifices, the oppression, the battles, the poorly armed men standing outnumbered, and their victory are so important.  March 25th, however, is not just for those of Greek descent. It is a day for all who appreciate freedom and treasure democracy. Territorially, the nation of Greece is smaller than the state of Alabama. Yet, for such a small nation it has left a large mark on history and society. The Hellenes have produced many lasting societal advances and cultural contributions, art, science, philosophy, and architecture are just a few. In addition, they have had a rich and lasting impact upon politics. Democracy, the modern day pinnacle of government, was founded in Greece over two thousand years ago.  As citizens of a great democracy, we are proud to recognize the contributions of the Hellenic culture in our own nation. From the education of the Founding Fathers to the development of our Constitution, Greek ideas have shaped America. In my own state, the Greeks have been members of Rhode Island's communities for over 100 years. Originally starting as factory workers and fishermen, today's descendants of the first immigrants continue to advance both economically and professionally, contributing to our state with their hard work and active citizenship.  Therefore, on the day marking the 180th anniversary of the revolution for independence, I congratulate all Greeks and Greek-Americans and express my appreciation for their contributions and those of their ancestors.                          ____________________
