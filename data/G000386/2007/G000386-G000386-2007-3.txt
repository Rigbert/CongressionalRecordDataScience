  Let me bring up another chart to expand on this point. I have next to me the portrait of Punxsutawney Phil, that famous groundhog. In thinking of Phil and the weather report he will provide in 45 days, I also thought about the popular film entitled ``Groundhog Day.'' That movie stars Bill Murray, in which a man relives the same day--Groundhog Day--over and over and over. This film has taken on greater significance for me as I seem to be in a very similar situation. More than just a sense of the deja vu, I feel I am reliving a past experience.  We are going through the same debate we had a couple of weeks ago. We are on a different bill and the amendment has different offsets. Yet I seem to remember already having this debate.  So, Mr. President, instead of taking the next steps and focusing on what we said we would do in the letter and finding a mutually agreeable--those are words from the letter--resolution to the AMT patch, the House Democratic leadership is insisting that the Senate repeat the same debate and vote of just last week.  At 5:01 p.m., on Tuesday, December 4, 2007, we took up H.R. 3996, with the title ``Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007.'' For several hours on Tuesday, Wednesday, and into Thursday, we debated the bill. The final vote on final passage came at 7:25 p.m., Thursday evening, December 6.  According to the Secretary of the Senate, 93 of us were here for that vote. So I must not be the only one reliving this experience.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the results of that final vote.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       The result was announced--yeas 88, nays 5, as follows:                      [Rollcall Vote No. 415 Leg.]                                YEAS--88     Akaka     Alexander     Allard     Barrasso     Baucus     Bayh     Bennett     Bingaman     Bond     Boxer     Brown     Brownback     Bunning     Burr     Byrd     Cantwell     Cardin     Casey     Chambliss     Coburn     Cochran     Coleman     Collins     Corker     Cornyn     Craig     Crapo     DeMint     Dole     Domenici     Durbin     Enzi     Feinstein     Graham     Grassley     Gregg     Hagel     Harkin     Hatch     Hutchison     Inhofe     Inouye     Isakson     Johnson     Kennedy     Kerry     Klobuchar     Kohl     Kyl     Landrieu     Lautenberg     Leahy     Levin     Lieberman     Lincoln     Lott     Lugar     Martinez     McCaskill     McConnell     Menendez     Mikulski     Murkowski     Murray     Nelson (FL)     Nelson (NE)     Pryor     Reed     Reid     Roberts     Rockefeller     Salazar     Sanders     Schumer     Sessions     Shelby     Smith     Snowe     Specter     Stabenow     Stevens     Sununu     Tester     Thune     Vitter     Warner     Webb     Wyden                                NAYS--5     Carper     Conrad     Dorgan     Feingold     Whitehouse                             NOT VOTING--7     Biden     Clinton     Dodd     Ensign     McCain     Obama     Voinovich                        Majority \1/2\ Required       Vote date: 12/06/2007, 6:23:00 p.m., Business Type: L.
