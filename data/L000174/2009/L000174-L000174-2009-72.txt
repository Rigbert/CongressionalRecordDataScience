President, I am pleased to join Senators Whitehouse and Cornyn in introducing the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act of 2009. This important bipartisan legislation would help jurisdictions control the increased costs facing correctional systems across the country, while also improving public safety and reducing recidivism.  In recent years, Federal and State governments have passed many new criminal laws creating more and longer sentences for more and more crimes. As a former prosecutor, I strongly believe in securing tough and appropriate prison sentences for people who break our laws. But while it is important to ensure that serious crimes result in significant sentences, we must also work to make our criminal justice system as effective and efficient as possible. That is why I have long championed legislation like the Second Chance Act, which helps ensure that when people get out of prison, they enter our communities as productive members of society, so we can start to reverse the dangerous cycles of recidivism and violence.  We have an obligation to help states cope with overburdened criminal justice systems and rising recidivism rates. Over the last twenty years, state spending on corrections has risen from $10 billion to $45 billion a year by some reports, and that number is expected to rise. Despite mounting expenditures, recidivism rates remain high, and by some measures have actually worsened.
