President, I understand we are at a point of great emotions and feelings, stress in the Senate over the change in the rules about the use of the filibuster in the Senate. Unfortunately, it appears that we are going to stay in that state for at least a short period of time, and I am not holding my colleague from South Carolina accountable for that. I believe what he has done is reflect the feelings on that side of the aisle, not just his personal feelings. However, I believe he has made a valuable suggestion.                          ____________________
