President, I urge the Senate to pass the bill H.R. 1944, authorizing an exchange of lands between the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Lake County, OR.  My colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, joined me in introducing S. 881 on June 11. The chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski, was extremely helpful and the bill was included in a hearing on various land exchange bills on June 18th. The U.S. House passed the companion measure, sponsored by the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Congressman Smith, on July 22. The Energy Committee reported the House bill yesterday, and I greatly appreciate the Chairman's excellent work to bring the bill to floor for final passage today.  This legislation will go far to keep the Warner Canyon Ski Area of Lakeview, OR, in business. If ever there was such a thing as a community ski area, this is it. It is low tech. It is run by a non-profit local organization. This legislation is clearly in the public interest of Lakeview, OR, and the Nation.  This bill has important benefits to the Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge, as well. Management of our National Wildlife Refuges can be burdened when there are privately owned lands inside of a refuge boundary, and this measure allows the refuge to take ownership to more than 300 acres of county owned lands inside the refuge. With this acquisition we move closer to the permanent protection of this important Oregon wildlife refuge.  I was pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Gordon Smith, and I urge its passage.
