Chairman, I wish those who take this floor and so casually dismiss the rights of victims of rape and incest could have sat with me across a table at a home for abused children to meet two 17-year-old young women who had been victims of rape and incest, their young lives shattered by the violent and vicious crimes they had been subjected to.  I pray to God that a young woman in that situation would have the strength to carry her baby and put it up for adoption. But neither the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook] nor any member of the Republican majority has the right to say that she must do so under all circumstances. That is mean, it is extreme, it is wrong. We must be sensitive to the fact that many people, young women in particular, face shattering experiences because of these violent, vicious crimes. To take away their right to terminate that pregnancy early on, their right to choose, is wrong. This a decision for a woman, her doctor, and her conscience.
