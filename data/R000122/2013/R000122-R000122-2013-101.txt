President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Blunt in the introduction of the Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act.  According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, by 2020, there will be a shortage of 91,000 physicians. Approximately half of the shortage, 45,000, will be in primary care.  Individuals and families living in underserved areas, urban and rural, will continue to be those most disadvantaged by this shortage. According to the Pew Research Center, roughly 10,000 baby boomers will become eligible for Medicare every day through 2030. The most recent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office predict that 27 million individuals will gain access to health insurance by 2017 as a result of the Affordable Care Act. With an aging population and increasing number of individuals with health insurance, the gap between patients and providers is expected to widen. The Affordable Care Act took steps to address this shortage, but we can do more.  The Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act would authorize programs that would grow the overall number of health care providers, as well as encourage providers to pursue careers in geographic and practice areas of highest need.  Building on the success of the National Health Service Corp, NHSC, Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs, and State Loan Repayment Program, this legislation would establish a state scholarship program. Like the NHSC State Loan Repayment Program, States would be able to receive a dollar-for-dollar match to support individuals that commit to practicing in the State in which the scholarship was issued after completing their education and training. At least 50 percent of the funding would be required to support individuals committed to pursuing careers in primary care. The States would have the flexibility to use the remaining 50 percent to support scholarships to educate students in other documented health care professional shortages in the state that are approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act would also authorize grants to medical schools to develop primary care mentors on faculty and in the community. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, graduating medical students consistently state that role models are one of the most important factors affecting the career path they choose. Building a network of primary care mentors in the classroom and in a variety of practice settings will help guide more medical students into careers in primary care.  The legislation would couple these mentorship grants with an initiative to improve the education and training offered by medical schools in competencies most critical to primary care, including patient-centered medical homes, primary and behavioral health integration, and team-based care.  It would also direct the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study and make recommendations about ways to limit the administrative burden on providers in documenting cognitive services delivered to patients. Primary care providers treat patients in need of these services almost exclusively, and as such, spend a significant percentage of their day documenting. That is not the case for providers who perform procedures, like surgeries. This IOM study would help uncover ways to simplify documentation requirements, particularly for delivering cognitive services, in order to eliminate one of the potential factors that may discourage medical students from pursuing careers in primary care.  I am pleased that providers across the spectrum of care recognize that this bipartisan legislation is part of the solution to addressing the looming health care workforce shortage and have lent their support, including: the Alliance of Specialty Medicine, the American Association of College of Osteopathic Medicine, the American College of Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association, the Association of Academic Health Centers, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Society of General Internal Medicine.  I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well as Senator Blunt and our colleagues to pass the Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act in order to help ensure patients have access to the health care they need.                          ____________________
