 President, I rise to introduce the Criminal Justice Integrity and Innocence Protection Act of 2001.  It is my hope that this bill will jump-start the process of ensuring that every innocent prisoner in this nation has access to DNA testing that could setthem free, and that every criminal defendant has access to truly competent counsel.  This is not the first bill to be introduced on this issue.  My good friend from Vermont and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, has twice introduced his Innocence Protection Act, with an impressive and bipartisan group of supporters behind the bill. I commend him for his work on this issue, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to see a bill pass.  But I have had some concerns with certain provisions of the Leahy bill, concerns that make it impossible for me to support the bill as currently drafted.  Also last year, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, addressed the DNA issue in a bill of his own. However, that bill did not include provisions on competent counsel, something that I very strongly feel should be included.  So the real aim of my effort is to start moving this process forward. It has been well over a year since these bills were first discussed, and no real action has taken place. There are differences of opinion on how to move forward on this issue, and I fully understand how committed each side is to their position.  But I believe that these differences of opinion will continue to prevent the Senate from considering this issue for the foreseeable future, unless something is done to break the stalemate.  In the hopes of doing just that, breaking the stalemate, last year, I invited both Senator hatch and Senator Leahy together, to try to resolve the differences between their two approaches. We had a constructive meeting, and some progress was made.  Since that time, each of us has gone back and forth with suggestions and criticisms of various ideas, and our staffs have been working diligently on trying to craft a solution to the impasse.  Nevertheless, time continues to run without action.  So today, I am introducing what I believe is a good compromise on this issue, a piece of legislation, based on our discussions, that I hope will spur debate, and provide a major step forward on this issue.  Essentially, the legislation I am introducing today does two things.  First, the bill provides a procedure by which prisoners who might be able to prove their innocence with the use of new DNA technology can do so.  The bill contains safeguards, of course, so that frivolous requests will be minimized.  For instance, prisoners have to demonstrate that biological evidence does exist that could possibly prove them innocent, and they must show that DNA testing was unavailable to them at the time of trial.  But overall, the bill will allow for the testing of inmates where evidence could lead to their exoneration.  If DNA testing proves innocence, the judge can release the prisoner immediately or, if there are other crimes of which the defendant may have been guilty, the judge can determine the best way to proceed in the case.  Second, the bill also addresses the issue of competent counsel, through the establishment of independent, national standards for legal representation in capital cases.  Specifically, this legislation directs the State Justice Institute to study this issue and to develop standards for competent counsel in capital cases.  The bill then authorizes grants to states that agree to adopt those standards.  The State Justice Institute has long served as a neutral facilitator between the state and federal judicial systems, and the bill would allow them to work with judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys alike to develop a model system for standards in these cases.  The combination of these two parts of the bill, competent counsel standards and DNA testing, will serve as powerful tools in restoring the public's confidence in the integrity of our judicial system.  I support the death penalty, and I have for a long time. And I have spent much of my public career trying to ensure that guilty people face the consequences of their actions.  But we must protect the innocent from a system of justice that can make mistakes. That is what this bill is all about, and that is why I hope we can move quickly to debate this issue fairly, with all opinions on the table, and move forward towards passage of a reasoned, strong bill.                                 ______                                       By
