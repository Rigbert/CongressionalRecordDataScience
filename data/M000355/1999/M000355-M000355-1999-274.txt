 I agree with him that without the allocation that Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd provided for us, we couldn't have even done this well. I do think that even with this, some would argue inadequate allocation, we can meet our responsibilities around the globe. I believe we have done that in this bill.  Now the Senator from Kansas is here and has an important amendment to be offered.  Let me just mention to all Members of the Senate, Senator Leahy and I, at about 10:30, are going to propound a unanimous consent request asking that all amendments to this bill be submitted by noon, which we think will help the Senate dispose of this measure in a timely fashion.  Mr. President, seeing the Senator from Kansas here, who has an amendment to offer, I yield the floor.
