 President, under this legislation, the list of unlawful activities in the Travel Act will be expanded to include the following crimes: drive-by shooting; robbery; burglary; assault with a deadly weapon; intimidation of witnesses, victims, jurors or informants; assault resulting in bodily injury; possession and/or trafficking of stolen property; alien smuggling; and firearms trafficking.  In addition, the maximum penalties would be doubled, from 5 to 10 years, for those who commit nonviolent violations of these provisions. A conspiracy provision is also added to the statute.  We double the base offense levels under the sentencing guidelines for traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a street gang. This is to get at those gangs that come from other countries and States and operate back and forth. So traveling in interstate or foreign commerce in aid of a street gang would increase from 6 to 12 in sentencing levels, which increases the base sentencing range from a low of 0 to 6 months and a high of 12 to 18 months, to a new low of 10 to 16 months and a new high of 30 to 37 months. Committing violent crimes in aid of a street gang or racketeering activity would increase from 12 to 24, which increases the base sentencing range from a low of 10 to 16 months and a high of 30 to 37 months, to a new low of 51 to 63 months and a new high of 100 to 125 months.  One of the most insidious tactics of today's gangs is the way they target children to do their dirty work, and they indoctrinate them into a life of crime. Let me give you an example.  According to the Los Angeles Times, the 18th Street Gang, which I described earlier, ``resembles a kind of children's army,'' with recruiters who scout middle schools for 11- to 13-year-old children to join the gang. The gang's real leaders are middle-age veteranos, long-time gang members who direct this criminal activity from the background.  Chicago's Gangster Disciples recruit not just at high schools, but even at elementary schools. One of the gang's members told a Federal court about his preference for children 17 and under as armed guards, ``because they can go to jail and get out quicker.''  This pattern is not unusual. A report by the National Gang Crime Research Center found, ``The term `youth gang' is itself somewhat of a misnomer when it comes to the major gangs in America today * * * the real leaders at the top of these major gangs are in fact older adults, many in their forties and even older * * * 84.8 percent''--85 percent--``of the gang members in our sample indicated that their gang does in fact have such older adult leaders.''  Current Federal law contains no penalty for recruiting minors to participate in gang activity, and this is a critical part of our legislation. This legislation makes the recruitment or solicitation of persons to participate in gang activity subject to a 1-year minimum and a 10-year maximum penalty, or a fine of up to $250,000. If a minor is recruited or solicited, the minimum penalty is increased to 4 years.  In addition, the person convicted of this crime would have to pay the costs of housing, maintaining and treating the juvenile until the juvenile reaches the age of 18.  This act also makes violation of this section a predicate offense under the racketeering statutes, known as RICO statutes.  It is now a crime to knowingly transfer a firearm to be used to commit a violent crime or a drug trafficking crime. This legislation adds a mandatory minimum penalty of 3 years if the gun to be used in crime is transferred to a minor.  This legislation increases penalties for transferring handguns to minors. The Youth Handgun Safety Act, passed by Congress as part of the 1994 crime bill, does not contain sufficient penalties against juveniles who possess handguns for criminal purposes. In fact, one provision of this act requires only probation for first-time juvenile offenders who possess a handgun.  Such a weak penalty has meant that prosecutors don't bother to target and prosecute gang members. I have been told this by U.S. attorneys and by district attorneys, and we aim to correct that problem with this language. In addition, current law sets different penalties for juveniles and adults who transfer a weapon to a minor. The Federal Gang Violence Act toughens the penalties against juveniles and adults who transfer a firearm to a minor--and subjects juveniles and adults to the same penalties for violating this law.  This legislation changes the Youth Handgun Safety Act by:  First, setting a one-year minimum sentence for anyone--adult or juvenile--who provides a minor with a handgun.  Second, holding juveniles accountable when they unlawfully give another minor a firearm by applying the same 5-year maximum sentence now given to adults.  Third, setting a 1-year minimum sentence and applying the same 10-year maximum sentence to adults and juveniles who give a firearm to a minor and should have known the gun would be used in a crime of violence. Currently, the 10-year maximum sentence only applies to adults.  Juveniles under 13 years old, however, would not be subject to these mandatory minimum sentences.  The Armed Career Criminal Act provides that if a person has three or more prior convictions for certain crimes--is a ``career criminal''--and he possesses, ships, transports or receives a gun or ammunition--is armed--he will be subject to a mandatory minimum 15 year penalty and fine of up to $25,000.  Serious drug offenses are already in the list of crimes which count toward the three-conviction minimum; this bill would allow juvenile convictions for serious drug offenses to also count toward that three-conviction minimum.  This would not apply to nickel-and-dime possession offenses, but to drugdealing which is punishable by 10 or more years in prison.  Many police officers around the country are confronting heavily-armed gang members who are wearing bullet-proof vests.  This legislation increases Federal sentences if a person wears body armor in the commission of a Federal offense, by directing the Sentencing Commission to provide for a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines of at least two levels.  Presently, a 30-day time limit exists for bringing juveniles to trial. With crimes being committed by juveniles becoming increasingly violent and complex, prosecutors need additional time to adequately develop cases. This legislation increases the time limit to 45 days.  This bill adds firearms trafficking violations to the list of crimes that can be attacked by prosecutors under RICO. Currently, firearms violations are not RICO predicate acts. Prosecutors and law enforcement officials indicate an increasing use of firearms by criminal street gangs to commit home robberies, business invasions, and attacks on rival gangs.  Since most of the firearms have moved in interstate commerce--and because firearms are such an integral part of the gang's activity--law enforcement officials have suggested that firearms violations become predicate acts under RICO.  Finally, this legislation authorizes $100 million over the next 5 years for hiring additional Federal prosecutors to prosecute violent youth gangs.  I don't mean to go into detail, but I really want this body to understand that in this Senator's opinion, and I think Senator Hatch's and our cosponsors', this Nation's No. 1 criminal threat comes from organized street gangs now moving vociferously across State lines and across international lines. If we don't move now, I think we surrender the independence of this Nation to a kind of underground world of street gangs connected in Russia, connected in Asia, connected in Japan, connected in Latin America. and Central America.  What we aim to do is up the penalties and create some new penalties which can really be effective in dealing with crime. The addition of the RICO statutes, the use of asset seizures and forfeitures, treating street gangs today the way mafia organized crime was treated 10 to 15 years ago can make a big dent and deter gangs. Most important to me is that it becomes a Federal offense for anyone to go out there and recruit a member of a gang that moves their stolen goods, illegal immigrants, drugs, guns, murder, extortion, witness intimidation across State lines.  Mr. President, I would like to make one last comment on another subject before I yield the floor.                          ____________________
