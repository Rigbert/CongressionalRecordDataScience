 President, this amendment, which is offered by Senator Lugar and Senator Obama, restores full funding for the President's supplemental request for the Nunn-Lugar programs, at a total cost of $8 million. This amendment will allow upgrades to Russian nuclear warhead storage facilities to be completed on time.  The House-passed bill contained full funding for the Nunn-Lugar programs. This amendment would square us with the House level.  This amendment has 34 cosponsors--10 Republicans, 23 Democrats, and 1 Independent.  My understanding is that this amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. I ask that it be considered by voice vote and adopted at this time.
