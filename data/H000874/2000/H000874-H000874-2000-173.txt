Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time and for her comments with reference to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center.  I rise not to talk about the substance; I know there is some concern expressed by the gentlewoman from Ohio and the gentleman from Florida and others about exactly where this bill is now; but I do want to say to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) that I echo the remarks of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey).
