President, there has been a significant development in private pension law this week, and I have come to the floor to discuss it briefly because I think it is something that will be of enormous interest to working families across the country who, of course, have been reading for months now about their pension plans going belly up. These are workers who work hard, play by the rules, hope to have a dignified retirement and have understood that Social Security was never going to cover all of their retirement security needs. So they have sought to have a private pension, and companies across this country have given them the impression--falsely, in a number of instances--that their private pension would be secure and there for them when they retire.  One of the aspects of this whole challenge, with respect to pension security, has been to eliminate what I believe is a double standard today in private pension laws. There is in fact a double standard in private pension law because so often the executive retirement benefits get hidden in a lockbox while the worker ends up getting creamed in the process.  What we have done, on a bipartisan basis in the Senate Finance Committee, is to say that that double standard, the standard that protects the executives while it clobbers the workers, will no longer be tolerated under our private pension statutes.  As a result of a change that a number of our colleagues worked on, which was backed by Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, if this provision that we have developed becomes law, if a company pension plan is funded at less than 80 percent, then the executive pensions cannot be hidden under the ruse of being ``deferred compensation.'' That is what we have seen come to light in the last few months, that somehow the executives walk away with millions of dollars worth of pension benefits under the guise of it somehow being something called deferred compensation while the workers end up seeing their pensions disappear by 40, 50, 60 percent.  This provision, in my view, is extremely important because it will prevent companies whose pension plans are at risk of going under from protecting the executive pension while allowing the employees' pensions to sink like a stone.  An example of this would be a flight attendant from Tigard, OR, who gave United Airlines 16 years of service, saw her pension fall recently to a net of $138 a month, while the CEO of United is going to continue to receive $4.5 million. Now, of course, the CEO claims it is not really a pension, that this was compensation worked out before the executive came to United. But I can tell you that elderly woman in Tigard, OR, would sure like to have what the United executive has, regardless of what it is technically referred to under pension law.  A lot more needs to be done to ensure that the executives are not going to reap these huge gains at the expense of their workers. Captain Duane Woerth of the Airline Pilots Association said it well, in my view, when he said, ``While thousands of pilots will retire with only a fraction of the pension benefits they earned and expected, airline executives can look forward to retirements knowing that their nest eggs are solid gold.'' This was reported in Fortune magazine. And there are numerous other examples where generous executive pensions have been protected at the expense of the workers' retirement.  In March of 2002, for example, US Air CEO Stephen Wolf took a lump-sum pension payout of $15 million, including benefits, for 24 years of service that he never actually performed. Six months later, the company filed for bankruptcy and terminated its pilot pension plan, leaving the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation with $2.2 billion in liabilities. Where is the fairness in all of that? The executive takes this huge golden parachute away while the workers try to figure out how to make ends meet when the company files for bankruptcy and terminates the pension plan.  Three months before United filed for bankruptcy in 2002, the companyplaced $4.5 million in a special bankruptcy protected trust for their CEO, Mr. Glenn Tilton. United then terminated all of its pension plans in 2005, leaving the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation with $6.6 billion in liability.  In 2002, the Motorola Company chose to not make any contributions to its pension plan for 70,000 employees and retirees, a plan that was underfunded by $1.4 billion. At the same time, Motorola found another $38 million to give its top executives a variety of pension perks.  In 1999, IBM's cash balance conversion resulted in dramatic pension cuts for the older workers. It is still being litigated in the courts, but in 2002, IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, who oversaw the cash conversion, retired with a pension of $1.1 million per year.  In November of 2002, Delta began phasing out its traditional defined benefit plan for 56,000 employees and replaced it with a cash balance pension plan. As Delta was shorting its workers, their former CEO got a generous guaranteed pension plan of $1 million per year that will be available to him when he turns 65.  These are a few examples, Mr. President, of excessive executive generosity, and they have been particularly egregious in the airline sector, where there have been numerous threats of bankruptcy and actual problems with respect to keeping the workers' pensions intact or even a portion of them secure.  I am pleased the Finance Committee took a significant first step yesterday toward cutting off this corporate spigot that has been gushing millions of dollars for executive pensions but produces less than a trickle of funds for tens of thousands of hard-working Americans. There is more to do.  Certainly the first step that began yesterday in the Senate Finance Committee at ending this double standard came about because Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus worked in a bipartisan fashion, and Senator Bingaman, Senator Kerry, Senator Schumer, and others joined me in pressing for this change. But suffice it to say there is more to do in this area. Certainly the question of what companies are required to do in terms of making their premium payments is important. In the days ahead the Finance Committee and eventually the Senate as a body will have to take up these issues.  What I wanted to bring to the Senate's attention today is that this is an important start. It is a start that keeps faith with American workers who have come to my townhall meetings. The Presiding Officer is from Georgia and represents a number of workers affected by the financial problems of Delta Airlines. People come to our town meetings and ask, how is it that the executives get off scot-free with respect to these pension issues while we are getting clobbered? I am tired of reading about how the executives have somehow been able, under the guise of deferred compensation or special retirement benefits that are protected from bankruptcy proceedings, and I am tired of seeing how the executives always come out hunky-dory while the workers end up trying to figure how to make ends meet when their pensions have been slashed by 40, 50, or 60 percent.  There is more to do in terms of reforming private pension law, but this effort to eliminate the double standard where executives get protected and workers get hurt, eliminating that double standard is at the center of what good bipartisan pension reform ought to be all about. Fortunately, the Senate Committee on Finance took a big step in the right direction by saying yesterday that if a company's pension plan is not actually funded, then the executives cannot find their way to yet another lockbox and protect themselves with these deferred compensation arrangements.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
