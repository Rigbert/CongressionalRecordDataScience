Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and colleague from California, Ron Packard. After 18 years of service and dedication to his constituents and his country, Ron is retiring. While I join my colleagues in wishing him all the best as he dedicates himself to some well deserved time with his family, I also know that the House is losing a valued and trusted Member.  Ron Packard's career has been marked by fairness and bipartisanship. In his various roles on the Appropriations Committee, Ron has always gotten the job done. That's not always an easy task when it comes to funding the government, but Ron has done it with integrity, dignity, and purpose.  Ron's career has been marked with distinction since the beginning. Even the method of his election was notable. Ron is one of only four Members of Congress ever to have won their first election as a write-in candidate , but that's not surprising. He had experience as a businessman, a school board member, a city councilman, and mayor. He knew then what he knows now citizens' needs are best met on the state and local level by people who understand them rather than by Washington bureaucrats.  This is the legacy Ron Packard will leave behind. It is characterized by hard work, honesty, bipartisanship, leadership, patriotism, and strength. It will serve as an example for future legislators as they do the people's business. I join my colleagues in wishing Ron a fond farewell and a happy retirement.                          ____________________
