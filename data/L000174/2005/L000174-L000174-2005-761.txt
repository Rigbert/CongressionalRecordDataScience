President, I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment intended to head off the administration's plans to raid the Crime Victims Fund of more than $1.2 billion. I am joined by Senators Kennedy, Mikulski, Feingold, Biden, Durbin, Obama, and Dodd on this amendment.  We created this fund under the Victims Crime Act of 1984 to be used for the victims of crime. We made a solemn promise these funds would be there. The budget resolution rescinds all amounts remaining in the fund. It is wrong. We should not be saying your suffering--even though we promised with great fanfare, the President and everybody else promised that your suffering is going to be our concern. We should not say it is no longer that way.
