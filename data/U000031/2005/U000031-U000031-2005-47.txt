Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I am a dad. I have got two teenagers. My son has an X Box game. We are very careful in terms of the games that come into our house, both when we go to the store to purchase them as well as what both he and my daughter watch. It is my clear understanding, and the gentlewoman from Minnesota and my colleagues here know it is our understanding, that this particular video game never should have had an ``M'' rating. It always should have been an ``Adults-Only.'' Had it had an ``Adults-Only,'' it would not have been on the shelves of a number of different major retail stores, whether they be Best Buy, Sears, Wal-Mart, et cetera. It was appropriate that they immediately remove those games from their shelves.                              {time}  1545  It is not appropriate. We are thinking that we are taking the right steps to send that message for all families across this country. Not only did we get the letter that was signed literally in about 10 minutes by more than 75 Members of this House in a bipartisan approach, but I have called the FTC to talk with them as well to make sure that if, in fact, they did violate the standard that they ought to use every sanction that they can to go after this particular manufacturer.  But this resolution spells it all out as well. And I would urge my colleagues to support this resolution because that indeed will send the message not only to this particular gamemaker but to use all the strength that the FTC has for those who violate those standards that we ought to seek sanctions appropriately to go after them so they do not profit from despicable games like this that no 13-year-old ought to be exposed to, let alone families across the country.
