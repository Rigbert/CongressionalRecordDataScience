  A few months ago, Speaker Pelosi was saying she was not ``for impeachment'' unless it was ``bipartisan.'' But even after the resolution codifying the Democrats' unfair process received zero Republican votes, the House plowed ahead anyway, searching for a way to arrive at an outcome the Democrats literally predetermined years ago.  Meanwhile, the American people are still waiting for Washington Democrats to stop blocking crucial bipartisan legislation. I spoke yesterday about the USMCA, the landmark trade deal that experts say would create 176,000 American jobs. For 9 months, Speaker Pelosi has told the press every couple of weeks that she will allow a vote soon. Last winter, she was ``optimistic''; over the summer, ``We want to pass this bill''; this fall, ``becoming closer''; and a couple of weeks ago, ``I think we are close.''  We have had months of this stalling. Now we are 1 week out from Thanksgiving, and there is still no tangible sign--none--of progress from the House. If the House cannot pass the USMCA this year, there is no way they will be able to claim that the people's business has not taken a back seat to impeachment.                          ____________________
