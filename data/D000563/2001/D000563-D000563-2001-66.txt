Section 5(a)(8) of the bill calls for ``State administration of all State and local sales and use taxes'' to be part of the streamlining process that would allow States and localities to be able to collect taxes due on remote sales. I believe it is important to make clear--in the legislation itself--that the requirement for ``State administration'' applies only to those taxes on out-of-State remote sales. The fact that, in a particular State, a single locality might on its own continue to collect local taxes on other sales would not affect that State's eligibility to be part of the streamline compact.  By way of example, the city of Chicago has a number of local use taxes that are imposed on different types of transactions. The city both imposes and collects those taxes from sellers wherever they are located in the State of Illinois. While the city and the State might agree to State administration of out of State remote sales, I would not want to see this legislation mandate that only the State of Illinois could collect these taxes on other sales.  I believe that this interpretation is intended by the legislation. Section 5(a) call for States and localities to work together to develop a streamlined tax system ``in the context of remote sales.'' However, I am concerned that this intent is not clearly enough spelled out. When the legislation returns from conference, I hope that this intent would be made absolutely clear. This could be done by changing section 5(a)(8) to read ``State administration of all State and local sales and use taxes on remote sales.'' It would also help to add a general use clause that would state that ``nothing in this Act shall be construed to divest the authority of local governments to collect taxes on sales other than remote sales as defined in this Act.''  Would the managers agree to this interpretation and assure me that the final legislation will make this interpretation absolutely clear?
