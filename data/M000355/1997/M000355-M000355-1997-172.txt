 President, let me just say very briefly--we are anxious to hear from Senator McCain, and move on to a vote--the capital investment account referred to by the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member will still be $105 million after the Lugar amendment is approved. That would exceed the President's request by $10 million and exceed the 1997 level of last year's bill by $80 million.  The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee certainly raises a valid point with regard to the infrastructure at the State Department. But it will be substantially increased for all the purposes he alluded to even after the amendment restoring the National Endowment for Democracy is hopefully approved.  Just one other point, Mr. President. I just want to mention a letter that was sent to the chairman and the ranking member in support of the National Endowment funding at $30 million signed by, in addition to Senator Lugar and myself, Senator Graham, Senator Mikulski, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Mack, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Cochran, Senator Lieberman, Senator Hatch, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator Inhofe, Senator Dodd, Senator Abraham, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murkowski, Senators Leahy, Roth, Kerry of Massachusetts, Robb, Levin, Breaux, Kyl, DeWine, Coverdell, Jeffords, Moynihan, Reed, Hagel, Torricelli, Thomas, Reid, Rockefeller, Frist, and of course the distinguished Senator from Arizona, who is about to speak who has been an enthusiastic supporter of this program over the years.  The NED, many of us feel, has done wonderful work, has broad bipartisan support across both party and ideological lines.  Mr. President, we hope the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Indiana will be approved.  I yield the floor.  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.
