. There will be no rollcall votes during today's session of the Senate. Under the previous order, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 254, the juvenile justice bill, at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. It is hoped significant progress will be made on that bill, and therefore Senators should expect votes after 2:15 p.m. during Tuesday's session of the Senate. I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
