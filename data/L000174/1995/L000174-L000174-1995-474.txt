President, I yield myself whatever time I may consume.  Nobody in here would disagree with the fact that we want to keep hardcore pornography away from our children. I am the proud parent of three children, and the proud father-in-law of three others. I cherish the time when those children were growing up.  I had the advantage of growing up in a family where we learned to read at an early age. My parents had published a weekly newspaper when I was a child and owned a printing business throughout the time I was growing up until my adult life when they retired.  They read to us as children and encouraged our reading. By the time I was 4 years old, I was reading books actively. By the time I finished third grade, I had read all of Dickens and most of Robert Louis Stevenson. I say that not to brag but because it happened with the encouragement of my parents. They guided me; they encouraged me to read and to read a good deal. They knew that, periodically, I might read something that they probably wished I would not, but they got me to read and read and read. It helped me through college, it helped me through law school, it helped me through my days as a district attorney, and it certainly helped me become a U.S. Senator.  I also use Internet. I do town meetings on the Internet. I correspond with people around the world with the Internet. I call up information I need and plan trips to other countries. I call up information and maps, and so on. I find it is a most marvelous tool. Somebody raised the question about something in Australia the other day, and I could click into the Internet and pull up something from a country thousands of miles away, instantaneously.  Now, I have not seen the things on the Internet--I do not doubt that they are there--that the Senator from Nebraska speaks of. I am six-foot-four, and I looked over the shoulders of a huddle of Senators going through the blue book of the Senator from Nebraska. I saw one page of it, but I do not care to see that kind of filth. I also know that I use the Internet probably more than most, and I have not been able to find some of these things. But I do not question that they are there. I do worry about the universal revulsion for that kind of pornography--I assume it is universal in this body--and that we not unnecessarily destroy in reaction what has been one of the most remarkable technological advances, certainly in my lifetime--the Internet.  It has grown as well as it has, as remarkably as it has, primarily because it has not had a whole lot of people restricting it, regulating it, and touching it and saying, do not do that or do this or the other thing. Can you imagine if it had been set up as a Government entity and we all voted on these regulations for it? We would probably be able to correspond electrically with our next-door neighbor, if we ran a wire back and forth, and that would be it. Had we had the Government involved every step of the way and had us engaged in micromanaging it every step of the way, we would not have the Internet that we have today.  I think there is a better way to reach the goal that the Senator from Nebraska and I share. The goal is--and I yield to nobody in this body--to keep really filthy material out of the hands of children.  Maybe we can do it the same way my parents did. They guided me when we read. We have software that can allow parents to know what their children see on the Internet. Maybe some day we will accept the fact that there is some responsibility on the part of parents, not on the part of the U.S. Congress to tell children exactly what they should do and read and see and talk about as they are growing up. Maybe mothers and fathers ought to do what mine did and what my wife and I did with our children. [[Page S8331]]   In that regard, Mr. President, I also suggest that if we are going to get involved, maybe we should allow the elected Members of this body to do it. I was concerned when I heard the new Chaplain. I have not had a chance to meet him. Some day I will. After listening to his prayer, it seems like he was part of the debate. It reminds me of his predecessor who gave a long, long prayer here shortly after the arrest of O.J. Simpson saying that he worried about poor O.J. Simpson's state of being, and that we should pray for him and hopefully he would feel OK. Some of us suggested that maybe there ought to have also been prayers for the two people that were murdered. I do not mean in any way to suggest who committed the crime. But I recall suggesting that maybe if we are going to have the chaplains interject themselves into public debate, they may want to be evenhanded enough, at least, to pray for those who have died and not just for somebody who may be a wealthy ex-football star.  By the same token, I suggest to the Chaplain--who may be a very fine man, for all I know--that perhaps he should allow us to debate these issues and determine how they come out and maybe pray for our guidance, but allow us to debate them. He may find that he has enough other duties, such as composing a prayer each morning for us, to keep him busy.  The concern I had in my amendment--my amendment speaks to the need to have a real study of just how we do this. I suggest one way, of course, is to have the kind of software that is now available, where parents can find out exactly who their children have been corresponding with or what they have been looking at on the Internet. Parents can make it very clear that if you want to use the computer, there are certain areas you do not go into.  It is the same way we do it today. A parent can say, hey, you are going to bring books home and there are certain things that are going to be off limits--at least at your age. It is not that much different just because they might be able to call up the books, or whatever, at home. That is no different than calling up the books from the corner bookstore. I suspect that a number of these things are available there.  My bill would require the Attorney General, in consultation with the National Telecommunications Information Administration of the Department of Commerce, to transmit to the Judiciary Committees in the Senate and in the House of Representatives a report of evaluating current laws and resources for prosecuting online obscenity and child pornography.  If pornographers are out there, prosecute them. I have voted, as most of us have, to go after them. As a former prosecutor and as a parent, I find them the most disgusting people.  What they do to our children is terrible, allowing authorities to go directly after them. Let us find out how we do that without destroying the Internet.  For example, the first part of the amendment from the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Indiana would make it a felony not only to send obscene messages to another person, but apply the same penalty to sending an e-mail message with indecent or filthy words that you hope will annoy another person.  For example, if someone sends you an annoying e-mail message and you respond with a filthy four-letter word, you may land in jail for 2 years with $100,000 fine. If you picked up the phone and did the exact same thing, you are perfectly OK. But if you type it out and send it to the person electronically, no matter how annoyed you might be, tough.  I do not think under this amendment a computer user would be able to send a private or public e-mail message with the so-called seven dirty words. Who knows when a recipient would feel annoyed by seeing a four-letter word on-line?  The second part of the amendment makes it a felony to send or receive over computer networks any obscene material. There is no requirement that the person soliciting and receiving the material knew it was obscene.  In other words, you click on your Internet--and you can go through thousands and thousands of words--and find out that something you called up expecting it to be innocent is not, you could be prosecuted for receiving it under this statute.  I think that goes too far. I think that could be far better worded. I think that if we had the Justice Department study the area and make recommendations that we then act upon within a very short period of time, which is also in my amendment, I think it would be far better.  What I worry about is not to protect pornographers. Child pornographers, in my mind, ought to be in prison. The longer the better. I am trying to protect the Internet, and make sure that when we finally have something that really works in this country, that we do not step in and screw it up, as sometimes happens with Government regulation.  When it came out that I was looking for an alternative approach, one that would allow the Justice Department to find a way to go after pornographers but to protect the free use of the Internet, I received these petitions almost immediately.  Every page of this stack of documents that I am holding has dozens and dozens of names from across the Internet. These are people saying yes, that is the way to do it. Find out how to go after the pornographers, but keep our Internet working. There were 35,000 petitions, in a matter of days.  In that regard, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in the New York Times magazine this Sunday by James Gleick, titled, ``This Is Sex?'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the New York Times Magazine, June 11, 1995]                              This Is Sex?                           (By James Gleick)       At first glance, there's a lot of sex on the Internet. Or,      not at first glance--nobody can find anything on the Internet      at first glance. But if you have time on your hands, if      you're comfortable with computing, and if you have an      unflagging curiosity about sex--in other words, if you're a      teen-ager--you may think you've suddenly landed in      pornography heaven. Nude pictures! Foul language! Weird      bathroom humor! No wonder the Christian Coalition thinks the      Internet is turning into a red-light district. There's even a      ``Red Light District'' World Wide Web page.       So we explore. Some sites make you promise to be a grown-     up. (O.K.: you promise.) You try ``Girls,'' a link leading to      a computer at the University of Bordeaux, France. The message      flashes back: Document Contains No Data. ``Girls'' at Funet,      Finland, seems to offer lots of pictures (Dolly Parton! Ivana      Trump!)--Connect Timed Out. ``Girls,'' courtesy of Liberac      University of Technology, Czech Republic, does finally, with      painful slowness, deliver itself of a 112,696-byte image of      Madchen Amick. You could watch it spread across your screen,      pixel by tantalizing pixel, but instead you go have lunch      during the download, and when you return, there she is--in      black-and-white and wearing clothes.       These pictures, by the way, are obviously scanned from      magazines. And magazines are the ideal medium for them.      Clearly the battle cry of the on-line voyeur is ``Host      Contacted--Waiting for Reply.''       With old Internet technology, retrieving and viewing any      graphic image on a PC at home could be laborious. New      Internet technology, like browsers for the Web, makes all      this easier, though it still takes minutes for the typical      picture to squeeze its way through your modem. Meanwhile,      though, ease of use has killed off the typical purveyor of      dirty pictures, capable of serving hundreds of users a day      but uninterested in handling hundreds of thousands. The      Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers has turned off its      ``Femmes femmes femmes je vous aime'' Web page. The good news      for erotica fans is that users are redirected to a new site      where ``You can find naked women, including topless and total      nudity''; the bad news is that this new site is the Louvre.       The Internet does offer access to hundreds of sex      ``newsgroups,'' forums for discussion encompassing an amazing      spectrum of interests. They're easy to find--in the newsgroup      hierarchy ``alt.sex'' (``alt'' for alternative) comes right      after ``alt.sewing.'' And yes, alt.sex is busier than      alt.sewing. But quite a few of them turn out to be sham and      self-parody. Look at alt.sex.fish--practically nothing.      Alt.sex.bestiality--aha! just what Jesse Helms fears most--     gives way to alt.sex.bestiality.hamster.duct-tape, and      fascinating as this sounds, when you call it up you find it's      empty, presumably the vestige of a short-lived joke.      Alt.sex.bondage.particle-physics is followed by      alt.sex.sheep.baaa.baaa.baaa.moo--help!       Still, if you look hard enough, there is grotesque stuff      available. If pornography doesn't bother you, your stomach      may be curdled by the vulgar commentary and clinical how-to's      in the militia and gun newsgroups. Your local newsstand is a      far more user-friendly source of obscenity than the on-line      world, [[Page S8332]] but it's also true that, if you work at      it, you can find plenty on line that will disgust you, and      possibly even disgust your children.       This is the justification for an effort in Congress to give      the Federal Government tools to control the content available      on the Internet. The Communications Decency Act, making its      way through Congress, aims to transform the obscene-phone-     call laws into a vehicle for prosecuting any Internet user,      bulletin-board operator, or on-line service that knowingly      makes obscene material available.       As originally written, the bill would not only have made it      a crime to write lewd E-mail to your lover; it would also      have made it a crime for your Internet provider to transmit      it. After a round of lobbying from the large on-line      services, the bill's authors have added ``defenses'' that      could exempt mere unwitting carriers of data, and they say it      is children, not consenting adults, they aim to protect.      Nevertheless, the legislation is a historically far-reaching      attempt at censorship on a national scale.       The Senate authors of this language do not use E-mail      themselves, or browse the Web, or chat in newsgroups, and      their legislation reflects a mental picture of how the on-     line world works that does not match the reality. The      existing models for Federal regulation of otherwise protected      speech--for example, censorship of broadcast television and      prohibition of harassing telephone calls--come from a world      that is already vanishing over the horizon. There aren't      three big television networks now, serving a unified mass      market; there are thousands of television broadcasters      serving, ever-narrower special interests. And on the      Internet, the number of broadcasters is rapidly approaching      the number of users: uncountable.       With Internet use spreading globally, most live sources of      erotic images already seem to be overseas. The sad reality      for Federal authorities is that they cannot cut those off      without forcing the middlemen--on-line services in the United      States--to do the work of censorship, and that work is a      practical impossibility. Any teen-ager with an account on      Prodigy can use its new Web      browser to search for the word ``pornography'' and click his      way to ``Femmes femmes femmes'' (oh, well, better luck      next time). Policing discussion groups presents the would-     be censor with an even more hopeless set of choices. A      typical Internet provider carries more than 10,000 groups.      As many as 100 million new words flow through them every      day. The actual technology of these discussion groups is      hard to fathom at first. They are utterly decentralized.      Every new message begins on one person's computer and      propagates outward in waves, like a chain letter that      could eventually reach every mailbox in the world.      Legislators would like to cut off a group like      alt.sex.bondage.particle-physics at the source, or at its      home--but it has no source and no home, or rather, it has      as many homes as there are computers carrying newsgroups.       This is the town-square speech the First Amendment was for:      often rancorous, sometimes harsh and occasionally obscene.      Voices do carry farther now. The world has never been this      global and this intimate at once. Even seasoned Internet      users sometimes forget that, lurking just behind the dozen      visible participants in an out-of-the-way newsgroup, tens of      millions of potential readers can examine every word they      post.       If a handful of people wish to share their private      experiences with like-minded people in alt.sex.fetish.hair,      they can do so, efficiently--the most fervent wishes of      Congress notwithstanding--and for better or worse, they'll      have to learn that children can listen in. Meanwhile, if gun-     wielding extremists wish to discuss the vulnerable points in      the anatomy of F.B.I. agents, they too can do so. At least      the rest of us can listen in on them, too. Perhaps there is a      grain of consolation there--instead of censorship, exposure      to the light. Anyway, the only real alternative now would be      to unwire the Information Superhighway altogether.
