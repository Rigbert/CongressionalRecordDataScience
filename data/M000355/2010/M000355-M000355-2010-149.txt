 President, I have a further unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4853; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.  Before the Chair rules, I would like to clarify that the amendment includes provisions that do the following:  One, make permanent the $1,000 child tax credit; two, make permanent the deduction for State and local sales tax; three, make permanent the expired research and experimentation credit; four, repeal section 9006 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the small business 1099 paperwork mandate; five, add a sense of the Senate on the recess appointment of Dr. Donald Berwick, based on the Roberts amendment No. 4512; and extend the alternative minimum tax patch for 2009 permanently, adjusted for inflation.
