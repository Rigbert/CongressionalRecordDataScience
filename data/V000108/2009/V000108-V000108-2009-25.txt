Post 80 came to be shortly after the founding of the national organization. In honor of this momentous occasion, the members of Post 80 will be celebrating with dinner and entertainment on Sunday, September 19, 2009, at the legion hall in Whiting, where they will host Robert Newman, Department of Indiana American Legion Commander, as their featured speaker.   Just yesterday, the United States House of Representatives joined the Senate in passing legislation supporting the goals and ideals of American Legion Day. For the past ninety years, Whiting Post 80 has been an extraordinary example of the ideals and mission of the American Legion. Overall, the American Legion boasts nearly 15,000 posts, and remarkably, consists of nearly three million members. In their communities, American Legion posts are a source of pride for their many contributions made to aid veterans and to better their communities.   Throughout the years, Whiting Post 80 has taken heed of the American Legion's mission. They have been well known in the Whiting-Robertsdale area for their many activities aimed at honoring veterans, which have included an honor guard and drum and bugle corps, but also for their many programs that serve the youth and families in their community.   From within the ranks of its membership, Whiting Post 80 has seen some of its members rise to great ranks within the American Legion organization. They have had two members, Donald Hynes and Richard Quattrin, serve as Department of Indiana Commanders. Quite impressively, Mr. Quattrin also served at the national level as the National Executive Committeeman for the Department of Indiana. Four of Post 80's members have also been honored with the American Legion's highest award, The Distinguished Service Award. These individuals are: Donald Hynes, who served as post adjutant for five years, Leo Mulva, who served as post adjutant for a remarkable forty-eight years, Richard Quattrin, who also served an impressive thirty years as post adjutant, and Bert Tiemersma.   Additionally, of the nearly one hundred World War II veterans who are members of Post 80, sixteen of them have over sixty years of service to the organization, including their longtime service officer, Nick Oprisko, who still serves in that capacity and is in his 66th year with the post.   Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing American Legion Post 80 and its members on its 90th anniversary. I also ask that you join me in honoring its membership for their service to their community, its veterans, and their commitment to the ideals of the American Legion. Their efforts have played a major role in elevating the quality life in their community.                          ____________________
