Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2202, the Immigration in the National Interest Act, includes many important provisions to help the United States get control of its borders: 5,000 new border patrol agents over 5 years, stricter penalties for alien smuggling and document fraud, prohibitions of public assistance, and procedural reforms that would make it easier to deport people who have abused our hospitality.  I commend the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Smith, for his work on this and even when we disagree, he is always a very fine gentleman and its fair about that.  The bill also contains some controversial provisions that would sharply reduce both family-based and employment-based immigration. I frankly think we should concentrate our efforts on illegal immigrants, and I wish the bill had even gone further in that direction; for example, by taking steps toward getting control of the situation in which people come to the United States on short-term tourist or business visas and then overstay their visas, living and working in the United States as illegal immigrants.  On balance, I support many of the provisions of H.R. 2202, precisely because it takes strong steps in controlling illegal immigration. I do want to point out that I will be strongly supporting on the floor the Chrysler-Berman-Brownback amendment which will help keep the focus on stopping illegal immigration by separating these issues from the provisions controlling and concerning legal immigrants and visas and refugee. H.R. 2202 and the amendment that Mr. Chrysler hopes to offer would eliminate the small number of visas now allocated for brothers and sisters.  Just let me say I also, as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, and we have jurisdiction over the refugee budget, will be offering my own amendment that would lift the cap of 50,000 refugees after the fiscal year 1997. We have held extensive hearings in my subcommittee on the refugee situation. I do believe that consultation process between the administration and the Congress ought to be the modality used, not a cap. I think that the world is getting more volatile, not less, and doing our fair share to relieve the pressure on true refugees, people who have a well-founded fear of persecution, we ought to not cap it, and continue the consultation process.                              {time}  2000
