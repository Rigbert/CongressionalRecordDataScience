Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  I have followed this process as a person who comes from a district where the forest wars have raged during my entire tenure in Congress. I have followed the Quincy Library project with great hope as a way to move away from embittered and polarized interests to some solutions that make sense. I am very concerned that we have ended up with a bill on the floor that the administration has raised strong objections to a few points of language and concerns within the bill. I am hoping that we work that out, because I would like to see this project go forward to implementation.                              {time}  1230  Because it is finally moving away from the forestry we have been practicing in this country since NFMA and before that, which is the approach of save and sacrifice. That is, over here we will have huge clearcuts, and over here we will put some land aside. The President's plan was an improvement, but what it did was saved more and sacrificed less. It did not look at alternative management.  This project would, over a wide and large land base, first, reserve roadless areas, reserve wilderness areas, enhance riparian protections, follow all the recommendations for the spotted owl recovery program in terms of canopy closure, but it would engage in what is called light touch, uneven aged stand management, light touch forestry, over about a quarter of this land base. Now, that, to me, is a step forward in recovering the health of this ecosystem and in beginning to turn down the temperature on these conflicts.  There are some who have vested interests in continuing the conflict, and they are going to object even if we come to a reasonable conclusion here, those at the poles of this debate. But I believe the vast majority of the people want to see us work out an agreement here that can be signed into law by the President, that will allow us to look at a different type of forest management to recover forest health and leave those areas that are already healthy alone.  That is what the Quincy Library project is about. Those were the conclusions that were reached by this local group, rather amazingly. I was very skeptical when we put forward funding for the Quincy Library project. I said we will never get strong environmentalist and strong industry advocates to sit down in a room together and agree on much of anything. Well, there has been substantial agreement, but now the disagreement has gone beyond the walls of the Quincy Library to here on the floor, where we still have a few fine points to work out so that we can ensure that we have a bill that is acceptable to the administration and that we can go forward.  Again, reserve the roadless areas, reserve the wilderness areas, enhance the protections, follow the spotted owl guidelines, but go to light touch uneven aged stand management on those lands outside of those critical areas that are not in a very healthy condition. It would definitely be a step forward in our understanding of how we might recover some of the damage that has been caused by mismanagement of Federal forestlands over the last half century here in this country.  So I am hopeful that it will be possible to come to that sort of an agreement here on the floor today. I will support the gentleman's amendment when it is offered later and am hopeful that we can work out any other differences.
