Mr. Speaker, last week I participated in a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the original GI Bill, and its principal author Mr. Harry Colmery of The American Legion. First enacted in 1944, the GI Bill has helped over 20 million Americans reach their educational goals, and in the process helped transform our Nation.  Michael J. Bennett, the author of the book, ``When Dreams Came True: The GI Bill and the Making of Modern America,'' spoke at that ceremony and I want to commend his remarks to all of my colleagues:       Mr. Dooley, my favorite political philosopher, had this to      say about Americans: ``We're a great people we are, and the      greatest thing about us is that we know we are.''       I wonder about that. We are a great people--and we know it,      but I'm not sure we know why we are. We are a democratic      people, citizens of the world's first truly democratic      republic. And we are a practical, sensible people; indeed,      our national philosophy is often called pragmatism. Yet, all      too often, we seem to believe we are great because our      Presidents are great, elected leaders whose wisdom is      exceeded only by their power, and we are practical and      sensible because we study their words and follow their      example.       If you believe that, you're in the wrong place today.      Franklin Delano Roosevelt preferred an Economic Bill of      Rights for everyone in return for everyone, women as well as      men, being subject to a universal draft. America got the GI      Bill of Rights instead because of the man we're belatedly      honoring today. And that is the best proof we have that      democracy itself, the wisdom of ordinary people, is what has      made us great--and will make us even greater still if we      follow the example, in deeds as well as words, of Harry      Colmery. For it was Harry Colmery, who crafted the GI Bill of      Rights in Room 570 of the Mayflower Hotel over the Christmas-     New Year's holidays of 1943-1944.       In just a few short weeks--and in the little more than six      months it took the Legion, Hearst newspaper reporters and      editors and Congressional allies in Congress to get the Bill      through the House and Senate--these men, and one woman, made      modern America possible. And they did so, despite FDR, and      the vociferous opposition of the nation's elite, the best and      brightest of the time.       The GI Bill will turn the nation's colleges and      universities into ``educational hobo jungles,'' Robert      Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago,      warned. The Bill will benefit ``the least qualified of the      wartime generation,'' moaned James Conant, the president of      Harvard, who rallied academic opposition to the Bill in      Congress. And he might have prevailed. But Rep. Edith Nourse      Rogers of Massachusetts was shrewd enough to use a Southern      segregationist to potentially expose the proper Bostonian as      a hypocrite to the improper Bostonian readers of The Boston      Record-American.       That's just one improbable--but true--anecdote in a story      full of improbabilities, but then, everything about the GI      Bill is improbable unless you believe that democracy can      sometimes, rarely but sometimes, be the best of all possible      governments. And that's what makes the GI Bill truly      wonderful, a story full of real wonder and authentic      inspiration. For this was a bill conceived in democracy and      dedicated to the proposition that those called upon to die      for their country, if need be, are the best qualified to make      it work, if given the opportunity.       And make the Bill work, the men and women who proudly      identified themselves as GI's did. They did so despite the      fact that the politically correct Pentagon advised newspaper      and magazine editors that the word GI, an acronym for general      or government issue is, and I quote, ``dehumanizing,      demeaning and disrespectful.'' The GI Bill became the      catalyst of America as an essentially middle-class society,      and the seedbed of the civil rights movement as GI's built      the suburbs, transformed arsenals of mass destruction into      industries of mass consumption, and democratized higher      education, even getting Conant to admit the GI's were ``the      best students Harvard has ever had.''       There's a profound lesson here for all of us, one that      transcends the pieties of the left and the banalities of the      right; liberal ends are best achieved by conservative means.      Capitalism can be democratic. Merit should be determined as      much by actual deeds as by test scores. We live in an era of      growing rather than lessening class distinctions. Those who      go to the college of hard knocks can only expect hard times.      And those who are the smartest graduates of the best schools      experience little more than virtual reality. In these times,      as in World War II, the military is the best preparatory      school for life, higher education and citizenship.       Everyone profits. The $14.5 billion cost of the WWII Bill      was paid by additional taxes on the increased income of the      GI recipients by 1960. Without the prosperity--and social      peace--engendered by the GI Bill, America couldn't have      afforded the Marshall Plan's $12.5 billion. Indeed, the GI      Bill, rooted in eternal verities of individual aspiration and      political reality, is a far better model for international      development than the Marshall Plan.       The authors of the GI Bill were World War I veterans who      kept faith with their children, the veterans of WWII. That      made possible the peaceful end in 1989 of the 20th century      World War that began in 1914. Now, nine     months after the massacres of September 2001, we are engaged      in a war on terror that will, undoubtedly, last at least as      long as WWI and WWII, if not much of the 21st century.       Unfortunately, we didn't keep faith--as much as we should      have--with the veterans of Korea and Vietnam, especially the      Vietnam veterans. We didn't adequately respect their service,      and sufficiently encourage their potential. But perhaps,      starting with this dedication, we're beginning to learn the      practical, sensible, and, yes, pragmatic lesson of the WWII      bill. We owe the young men and women who are--and will be--     our protectors in this long, shadowy conflict no less than a      moral--and a financial--equivalent of the WWII GI Bill.       We don't just owe it to them; we owe it to ourselves.                                 ____________________
