 What this underlying amendment is about is protecting the victim and giving the victim more of the money and giving the lawyer a little bit less without taking away any incentive.  Statistics indicate the poor victims, on the whole, get about 48 percent of the money; 52 percent goes to the lawyers and the costs and the courts. This is a pro-victim amendment that benefits these injured parties over whom many have expressed so much concern.
