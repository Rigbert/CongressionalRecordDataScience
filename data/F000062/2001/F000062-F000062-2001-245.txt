 President, today, Senator Olympia Snowe and I are introducing a bill to guarantee that the decision of how long a patient stays in the hospital is left to the attending physician. Our legislation would require health insurance plans to cover the length of hospital stay for any procedure or illness as determined by the physician to be medically appropriate, in consultation with the patient.  The bill is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Psychological Association.  We are introducing this bill because many people, patients and physicians, have told us that HMOs set limits on hospital stays that are shorter than what the attending physicians believe are medically necessary. In my view, only the physician who is taking care of the patient understands the patient's full medical history and the patient's medical condition and needs. Every patient's condition and course of illness varies. Patients respond differently to treatments. Complications arise. The doctor should decide when patients are medically ready to be discharged, not an insurance plan.  The American Medical Association has developed patient-based discharge criteria which say: ``Patients should not be discharged from the hospitalwhen their disease or symptoms cannot be adequately treated or monitored in the discharge setting.''  A number of physicians have shared with me their great frustration with the health care climate, in which they feel they spend too much of time trying to get permission and justify their decisions on medical necessity to insurance companies.  A California pediatrician told me of a child with very bad asthma. The insurance plan authorized 3 days in the hospital; the doctor wanted 4-5 days. He told me about a baby with infant botulism (poisoning), a baby with a toxin that had spread from the intestine to the nervous system so that the child could not breathe. The doctor thought a 10-14 day hospital stay was medically necessary for the baby; the insurance plan insisted on one week.  A California neurologist told my staff about a seven-year-old girl with an ear infection and a fever who went to the doctor. When her illness developed into pneumonia, she was admitted to the hospital. After two days she was sent home, but she then returned to the hospital three times because her insurance plan only covered a certain number of days. The third time she returned she had meningitis, which can be life threatening. The doctor said that if this girl had stayed in the hospital the first time for five to seven days, the antibiotics would have killed the infection and the meningitis would never have developed.  Another California physician told my office about a patient who needed total hip replacement because her hip had failed. The doctor believed a seven-day stay was warranted; the plan would only authorize five.  A Chico, California, maternity ward nurse put it this way: ``People's treatment depends on the type of insurance they have rather than what's best for them.'' A Laguna Niguel, California woman, Gwen Placko, wrote this to me: ``. . . doctors have become mere employees of for-profit insurance companies. They are no longer captains of their own `ships' so to speak. . . Only doctors should be the ones to make decisions for the direct treatment and benefit of their patients.''  Physicians say they have to wage a battle with insurance companies to give patients the hospital care they need and to justify their decisions about patient care.  A study by the American Academy of Neurology found that the Milliman and Robertson guidelines used by many insurance companies on length of stay are ``extraordinarily short in comparison to a large National Library of Medicine database . .. And that [the guidelines] do not relate to anything resembling the average hospital patient or attending physician. . . .'' The neurologists found that these guidelines were ``statistically developed'' and not scientifically sound or clinically relevant.  The arbitrary limits HMOs and insurance plans have set are resulting in unintended consequences. Some 7 in 10 physicians said that in dealing with managed care plans, they have exaggerated the severity of a patient's condition to ``prevent him or her from being sent home from a hospital prematurely.''  The American College of Surgeons said it all when this prestigious organization wrote: ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision-making process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and his or her health and well being. . . . specifically, single numbers [of days] cannot and should not be used to represent a length of stay for a given procedure'', April 24, 1997. ACS wrote, ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision making process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and his or her health and well being.''  The American Medical Association wrote, ``We are gratified that this bill would promote the fundamental concept, which the AMA has always endorsed, that medical decisions should be made by patients and their physicians, rather than by insurers or legislators. . . We appreciate your initiative and ongoing efforts to protect patients by ensuring that physicians may identify medically appropriate lengths of stay, unfettered by third party payers.''  The American Psychological Association wrote me, ``We are pleased to support this legislation, which will require all health plans to follow the best judgment of the patient and attending provider when determining length of stay for inpatient treatment.''  Americans are disenchanted with the health insurance system in this country, as HMO hassles never seem to end and physicians are effectively overruled by insurance companies. Doctors and patients feel that patient care is compromised in a climate in which anonymous insurance clerks interfere with medical decision- making.  This bill is one step toward returning medical decision- making to those medical professionals trained to make medical decisions.  To summarize, the Hospital Length of Stay Act of 2001:  Requires plans to cover hospital lengths of stay for all illnesses and conditions as determined by the physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate;  Prohibits plans from requiring providers (physicians) to obtain a plan's prior authorization for a hospital length of stay;  Prohibits plans from denying eligibility or renewal for the purpose of avoiding these requirements;  Prohibits plans from penalizing or otherwise reducing or limiting reimbursement of the attending physician because the physician provided care in accordance with the requirements of the bill; and  Prohibits plans from providing monetary or other incentives to induce a physician to provide care inconsistent with these requirements.  It includes language clarifying that: nothing in the bill requires individuals to stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time for any procedure; plans may require copayments but copayments for a hospital stay determined by the physician cannot exceed copayments for any preceding portion of the stay.  It does not pre-empt state laws that provide greater protection.  It applies to private insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, federal employees' plans, Children's Health Insurance Plan, the Indian Health Service.                                 ______                                       By
