President, this is the last amendment of the evening. I would like to have your attention for a short period of time.  I have not been a strong supporter of this budget deal, the basis of the assumptions and other things. But in the event it does come up with a balanced budget in the year 2002, I see one frailty with this, and that is, you can come into balance in the year 2002, only to find out that in 2003 you come along and go back into deficits again.  So I am going to read one sentence very carefully. I would like to have you listen to it.       [I]t shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any      budget resolution . . . for fiscal year 2002 and any fiscal      year thereafter . . . that would cause a unified budget      deficit for the budget year or any of the 4 fiscal years      following the budget year.  I would like to reserve the last 10 seconds of my time.
