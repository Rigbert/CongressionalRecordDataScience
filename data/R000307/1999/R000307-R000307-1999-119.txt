I had thought we had an agreement that there would not be an objection to the amendment by unanimous consent. That obviously is not the case. We are going to have to consider this. Let us work on this.  I will be happy to visit here on the floor with the Senator from Delaware and my good friend from Michigan. I am not entirely clear, after listening to the Senator, that his description of this amendment is the one that I have. Let us work it out, and if push comes to shove, although I think it is entirely reasonable for a Senator to be allowed to amend his own amendment, if this has caused some concern on the part of both Senators, we can always bring this up as a separate amendment, which may be the best case. If, in fact, you say ``legal,'' you put the word ``legal'' in there, obviously I do not think the President is going to have any obligation to report on anything. In terms of obligation, if I might say so, if the Senator will continue to yield, if Kosovo is not an obligation, I am not standing here on the floor of the Senate. That is my response.  Why don't we visit about this if we can, and then, if necessary, we will just introduce an amendment at a later time as a separate amendment.
