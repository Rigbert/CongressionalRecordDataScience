 President, this amendment will solve problems that agencies, the Office of Personal Management, and the Federal employee health benefit carriers have experienced with regard to payment of health care premiums by allowing agencies to advance the employee premium for employees on leave without pay, rather than waiting for the employees to return to work.  I understand this has been cleared on both sides.
