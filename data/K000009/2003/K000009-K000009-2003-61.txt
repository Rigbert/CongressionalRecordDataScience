Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Rehberg-Hooley amendment to say that the Committee bill provision indeed subverts the law. This Rehberg-Hooley provision was included in the farm bill. But when the opponents of that law found an opening in the subcommittee of agriculture appropriations to try to subvert the law, they took that opportunity. And so what we are talking about here is changing the law of our country that was passed here, as well as passed in the other body, and signed into law. We surely had plenty of consideration. That is number one.  My second point is this amendment is being offered at a time when we have the highest number of meat recalls in the country's history. God forbid you are the parent of someone who just died from eating contaminated meat. I find it very interesting that those who oppose this say there are going to be all these high costs and all these problems. Do Members know that not one producer in Ohio has complained to me about this law? I represent cattlemen and cattlewomen. They raise a lot of different kinds of animals in our region. Producers want the labeling. In fact, the Ohio producers, the Great Lakes producers, are working on their own electronic ear tags because they do not want their meat mixed with other stuff that they do not know where it comes from. They want to be able to offer a quality product at a competitive price and get it on the shelves of the supermarket. The problem is that the supermarkets deny shelf space to independent producers.  We know who wants this law subverted. It is not the ranchers; it is not the farmers. It is the people who want to make money off them. Any decent business person wants labeling of their product. Our father operated a family grocery and when he made his meatloafs, when he made his sausages, we had our own label tape that we pealed and put right on the package. We were so proud of his products. Our market was called Supreme Market, and to this day it sold the best meat I ever ate, the best sausage I ever ate. We were proud to label it. Good producers want labels on their quality products.  In Ohio, the Great Lakes Family Farms has a special verification program. They eartag animals with all relevant information. They know what shots the animal got. They know which feed lot it was on and how much it weighed at 6 months, at 8 months. They know everything because they know their customers want to know, and that local label gives them a niche in the market to be able to offer quality meat.  Mr. Chairman, in an era when the consumer wants to know, why is the Republican leadership trying to subvert the law and not give us as consumers the right to know where our meat comes from? It is simply because if you are going to mix in Argentinian beef or mix in some other kind of meat at the store, you do not want your customers to know. If you have some Uruguayan skinny steer that was wandering somewhere around Latin America, and then you are going to take some of that meat and blend it in with Ohio beef, you do not want anybody to know because you are going to make just as much money on that package.  But the farmers know how to label. They are doing it already. They are doing it in our region, and those electronic ear tags are so complete and with technology being what it is today, we can know everything about an animal, even who its mother and father were.  Do not give me this baloney it is going to be so much more expensive. Our farmers are already doing it. Ohio farmers can lead the way. In fact, the American Farm Bureau supports the law. It does not support subverting the law. They support country-of-origin labeling. In the letter that they have sent to us, they say those products should be labeled at the retail level. With increased trade, more products are being imported into the United States and the farm bureau is working with the agricultural marketing services to implement a program with the least amount of burden and cost to producers.  So in addition to all of the names that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) read into the Record, I will include a letter from the American Farm Bureau.  Mr. Chairman, Members might have noticed the recent stories about mad cow disease, BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, that is up in Canada now. We have to know where our meat comes from, and people who raise meat should be responsible for it, just like my father was responsible for his products. They ought to be proud of what they are producing and not ashamed, and not try to hide something on a package that when you take the hamburger out, it looks red on the outside and it is all brown on the inside. We all know what they are doing. We understand what that is all about.  I think it is a worthy amendment. We have the technology to do it. I will place in the Record what the 4-H requires of our students as one of its projects to have labeling of beef. This is not rocket science. It can be done.                              American Farm Bureau Federation,                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2003.     Hon. Marcy Kaptur,     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Kaptur: The American Farm Bureau      Federation commends the Appropriations Committee for timely      action on the FY04 agriculture spending bill. We ask that you      consider the following information as the Appropriations      Committee acts on the bill this week.       We support full funding for the Farm Security and Rural      Investment Act of 2002 (FSRIA). Unfavorable weather      conditions, uncertainties involved with international trade,      the value of the dollar and record high input costs have      converged to produce a turbulent and difficult time for      agriculture. The industry has suffered through several      consecutive years of historic low market prices and weather      disasters. The new farm law helps address problems faced by      American farmers and ranchers and it provides unprecedented      funds for our nation's conservation needs. Changes in farm      bill programs would be devastating not only to farmers and      ranchers but the rural economy as well. Consequently, the      Farm Bureau strongly encourages you to avoid making changes      to FSRIA in the FY04 appropriations process.       We commend the Committee for maintaining full funding of      farm bill commodity programs. It is imperative that counter-     cyclical payment rates, loan rates and direct payments be      preserved as adopted in FSRIA. We are opposed to any changes      in current payment limitations for direct payments, counter-     cyclical payments, loan deficiency payments (LDP) and      marketing loan gains (MLG), including a separate payment      limitation for the peanut program. Current rules on spouses,      three-entities, generic certificates and actively engaged      requirements should be retained.       AFBF supports country-of-origin labeling (COOL) as passed      in the 2002 farm bill. Many farmers and ranchers believe that      the products they grow in the United States should be labeled      a product of the United States at the retail sales level.      With increased trade, more products are being imported into      the United States, giving the consumers greater choices at      the marketplace. Farm Bureau is working with the Agricultural      Marketing Service (AMS) at USDA to implement the program with      the least amount of burden and costs to producers. We are      disappointed the legislation blocks further work by USDA to      implement country-of-origin labeling for meat and poultry      products. We ask that you support the restoration of funding      for this important program.       Farm bill conservation programs should be fully funded.      Full implementation of the Environmental Quality Incentive      Program (EQIP) and Conservation Security Program (CSP) is key      to assisting agricultural producers in complying with      environmental regulations and addressing important      conservation issues nationwide. Program funding for technical      assistance is essential if conservation programs are to be      successful. While we are pleased that the bill increases      funding for conservation operations activities, we are      disappointed that funding for CSP is blocked and limits have      been placed on EQIP.       The development of alternative energy sources is not only      significant to the advancement of American agriculture but      also is vital to enhancing our nation's energy security. The      2002 farm bill contained an energy title that includes      provisions for federal procurement of bio-based products,      bio-refinery development grants, a biodiesel fuel education      program, renewable energy development program, renewable      energy systems, a bioenergy program and biomass research and      development. These programs will assist rural economic      development as well as increase our nation's energy      independence. We are disappointed that the bill under      consideration does not include funding for key programs that      promote alternative energy sources.       Thank you for your consideration of these issues of      importance to farmers and ranchers.           Sincerely,                                                     Bob Stallman,                                                        President.
