 President, I rise in support of the Salvage Motor Vehicle legislation as it has been amended by the Levin/Feinstein amendment.  The sale of rebuilt vehicles that have been wrecked in accidents has become a major national problem. According to the National Association of Independent Insurers, about 2.5 million vehicles are involved in accidents so severe that they are declared a total loss. Yet, more than a million of these vehicles are rebuilt and put back on the road.  In many cases, ``totaled'' cars are sold at auction, refurbished to conceal prior damage, and resold to consumers without disclosure of the previous condition of the car. The structural integrity of these vehicles has been so severely weakened that the potential for serious injury in an accident is greatly increased.  This bill seeks to address the problem by requiring vehicle owners to disclose that the car has been salvaged if it has sustained damage valued at more than 75% of its retail value. The problem with this approach is that it sets a ceiling rather than a floor for consumer protection. States who may already have stronger definitions of salvage vehicles would be preempted.  The amendment that I have offered with the senior Senator from Michigan will eliminate this flaw in the bill. Our amendment says specifically that nothing in this bill will effect a state law that provides more stringent consumer protection relating to the inspection, titling or any other action dealing with salvage vehicles. We believe that this is the best possible outcome. A minimum level of consumer protection will be set at the federal level, but the bill now authorizes states to provide greater or more comprehensive protection if they wish.  Protection for consumers in my state of California will be greatly enhanced by the Levin/Feinstein amendment. California law does not set a percentage value for salvage vehicles. Instead it says that a vehicle is salvaged when the owners determines that repairing the vehicle is ``uneconomical''. Our amendment will allow California to maintain that definition as well as states with other protections. California law is also more comprehensive in terms of what vehicles are covered. California's law covers all vehicles including large trucks, motorcycles, and motor homes which would not be covered under the federal law.  I believe we now have a good bill. By setting a federal level of consumer protection that is a floor rather than a ceiling, we will achieve the goal of protecting consumers from fraud while at the same time giving states the flexibility to implement a stricter definition for salvage vehicles.  I want to thank the Senator from Michigan. Together we have crafted an amendment that will protect the residents of our states and many others. I also want to thank the Majority Leader for his willingness to work with us to improve the bill.                          ____________________
