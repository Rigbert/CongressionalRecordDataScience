That is the one thing we believe on this side of the aisle.  If this election is to be decided by facts and evidence, the American people will vote for a new vision of America, a stronger economy at home, and more respect for America around the world. But if we are going to let this campaign disintegrate in the last 3 weeks into sloganeering and name-calling, who knows what the outcome will be. We trust the facts and the evidence. This administration has failed to move this economy forward for working families. It has pushed a tax policy that not only doesn't help them, in many instances it penalizes them.  Look at what families are up against under the Bush administration. The cost of medical care and health insurance, up 59 percent; gasoline is up 38 percent; college tuition is up 38 percent; housing costs are up 27 percent. Even the cost of a bottle of milk is up 13 percent. When this President says in Arizona in the next debate that America is better off under his administration, he isn't feeling the pain families feel every single day when they try to make ends meet.  Mr. President, this election is going to be a historic turning point for America. We are either going to move toward 4 more years of the Bush administration, with economic policies that have taken a toll on the hardest working people in the world, or we are going to move forward with a new vision to help families have a better life for themselves and their children.  We are going to decide, when it comes to foreign policy, if we are going to continue to squander the reputation and good name that America has built up over many decades or whether we are going to move to a new level of respect for America around the world. The choice is in the hands of the voters on November 2.  I yield the floor.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).
