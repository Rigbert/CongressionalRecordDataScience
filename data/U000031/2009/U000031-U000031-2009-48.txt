Since its founding as the Weekly Record in 1882, the Tri-City Record has been a lifeline for southwest Michigan, reliably keeping folks informed on significant news and community events.  What began as the Weekly Record became the Watervliet Record in 1884. Through the years, with only a handful of owners, the newspaper grew to report not only on news in the city of Watervliet, but also the surrounding communities of Coloma and Hartford. A century after the first name change, the newspaper was purchased by Anne and Karl Bayer in 1984, and soon became the Tri-City Record.  Under the Bayer family's stewardship, countless residents have come to rely upon the Tri-City Record to stay connected with the community and keep up on current events. I commend the Tri-City Record's rich tradition of excellence and proud history of reporting to Coloma, Hartford, Watervliet and across the State of Michigan.  As the newspaper industry across the Nation has been strained during the digital age, the Tri-City Record continues to be a jewel in our corner of southwest Michigan. I salute Anne and Karl Bayer and the entire staff on reaching this milestone and wish them continued success for many years to come.  Twenty-five years later and still going strong, the Bayers represent a most important chapter in the storied history of the Tri-City Record.                          ____________________
