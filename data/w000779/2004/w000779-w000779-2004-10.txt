President, in just a couple of weeks, on October 23, a memorial will be erected by villagers and family member at Suhozem, Bulgaria to honor one of our Nation's brave soldiers and one of Oregon's native sons, Lt. Kingsley. Today, I wish to take a few minutes to remember Lt. Kingsley and share his story of great courage and sacrifice.  The story of Lt. David Kingsley is emblematic of the strength and pioneering spirit of the earliest Oregonians. Lt. Kingsley was born and raised in Portland, OR and graduated from Benson High School. Prior to enlisting in the Air Force, he worked in the disaster unit of the Portland Fire Bureau--always committed to the service of his community and country. During the Second World War, he went to pilot training, and then served as a bombardier in a B-17F. He was assigned to the 341st Bomb Squadron, 97th Bombardment Group, 15th Air Force.  On June 23, 1944, he was on Mission No. 295, flying out of Amendola airfield in Foggia, Italy against the Dacia Oil Refinery in Ploesti, Romania. While on the bombing run, the right wing of his aircraft was hit by enemy fire. His aircraft took 15 strikes, crippling it as it flew over Bulgaria. The attack injured several members of the aircrew, including the tail-gunner. Lt. Kingsley had to remove the tail-gunner's damaged parachute to provide first-aid.  An order to bailout was given; the Lieutenant gave his parachute to the injured tail-gunner and reminded him to pull the ripcord. The last airman exiting the crippled aircraft remembers seeing Lt. Kingsley standing in the bomb bay of the plane, making sure all of his fellow crew were out of the plane first. Because of Lt. Kingsley's previous flying experience, he jumped into the pilot's seat and tried to regain control of the aircraft, which descended and circled the field in an attempt to land. Witnesses reported seeing the aircraft dive steeply and crash in a field just north of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Lt. Kingsley never got out alive. For his extreme bravery he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.  Today, one of the Oregon Air Guard's F-15 units is based in southern Oregon at Kingsley Field, named in Lt. Kingsley's honor. This year marked the 60th anniversary of that fateful day and of Kingsley's heroism.  At a time when so many young men and women from Oregon and all across the Nation are fighting overseas, we honor their service. And we must also remember to honor the service of these veterans--some of whom, like Lt. Kingsley, have made the ultimate sacrifice--so that we can live in freedom and continue to pursue our dreams. We do not forget and will not forget them, and we are forever grateful for their honorable service to and sacrifices for our Nation.                        Sergeant Joshua J. Skvor
