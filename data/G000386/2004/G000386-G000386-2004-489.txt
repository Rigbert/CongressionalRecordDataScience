 President, I am introducing two education tax bills today. These bills will help us make permanent the $30 billion in education tax incentives that were contained in the 2001 tax bill.  The first bill will extend and make permanent the tuition deduction that was enacted in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, Public Law 107-16, or EGTRRA. A lot of people think we don't spend enough money on education, but they also don't think we should make the 2001 tax cuts permanent. I don't know how they can justify that position. The education tax incentives in the 2001 tax bill have done a whole lot of good. The tuition tax deduction is available only through December 31, 2005. The cost of the provision for those four years was about $10 billion. So you can see that it was very expensive.  For parents struggling to send their children to college, the tuition tax deduction has been very important. Some of them probably wish it were set at a higher level, but at between $2,000 and $4,000 depending on your income, it is still a beneficial tax incentive for the middle class.  The second bill that I am introducing today will make the rest of the EGTRRA education tax provisions permanent, as well as the deduction for teacher classroom materials that was passed in the stimulus package of March 2002. That provision expired at the end of last year so it is very important that we enact it on a permanent basis and do so as soon as practicable.  I hope my colleagues will join me in sponsoring these bills and will agree to consider them and pass them in the Senate in the next month or two.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2048       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
