Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information; and I understand he is a little bit in the same position I am, having just learned of this in the last few minutes. I am pleased to hear that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) will be communicating with and working with the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos). Again, while there are, obviously, as we all know, disagreements on the prosecution of that effort, whether we should have undertaken it, there is no, I think, dispute on the underlying support of our troops, their effort, their safety, and their objectives. Hopefully, that is what we will articulate.  I thank the gentleman for his information, and I will surely be talking to the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), as I know our leader will, to try to make sure that we are all together on this statement, which I think will be good for our troops and good for the world to see as well. I thank the gentleman.  We had expected to see the budget resolution on the floor next week. Then, frankly, we had heard in the last few hours, or few minutes, that that was not going to be the case, that the markup had been called off or cancelled, rescheduled by the gentlemanfrom Iowa (Mr. Nussle) for next week. Our presumption was, if that was the case, then the budget would be delayed a week.  Now the information is, and I know the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the leader, is not on the floor, it is my understanding that perhaps he is working on trying to effect agreement, but can the gentleman tell me whether or not he has confidence that that will be on the floor next week, or are we waiting to see what is going to happen today to make that final decision?
