 President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to add approximately 5,000 acres of pristine natural land to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Mateo County. This addition will protect the sweeping views of the San Mateo Coast and ensure the protection of rich farmland, several miles of public trails, and incredible array of wildlife and vegetation. I am happy to be joined by Senator Boxer in sponsoring this legislation.  The property to be added is one of the most visible and important pieces of land on the San Mateo coast north of Half Moon Bay. The largest parcel to be added is a 4,262 acre stretch of land known as the Rancho Corral de Tierra. The Rancho Corral de Tierra is one of the largest undeveloped tracts remaining on the San Mateo Coast and is constantly under threat of development.  The mountainous property, which surrounds the coastal towns of Moss Beach and Montara, was previously purchased by the Peninsula Open Space Trust. The Trust has agreed to transfer the land to the Federal Government for about half of the purchase cost. It is this type of public-private partnership that Congress needs to support in our efforts to preserve open space.  The Rancho Corral de Tierra Golden Gate National Recreation Area Boundary Act of 2001 has the support of the entire Bay Area Congressional Delegation. Similar legislation is being introduced today in the House of Representatives by Tom Lantos with co-sponsors Anna Eshoo, Nancy Pelosi, George Miller, Lynn Woolsey, Ellen Tauscher, Peter Stark, Mike Thompson, Barbara Lee, Mike Honda, and Zoe Lofgren.  The addition of the Rancho Corral de Tierra property will result in the protection of all or part of four watersheds, and several endangered species such as the peregrine falcon, San Bruno elfin butterfly, San Francisco garter snake, and the red-legged frog. Moreover, due to the coastal marine influence and dramatic altitude changes, plants grow on the property that are found nowhere else in the world.  This legislation will also reauthorize the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Point Reyes National Seashore Advisory Commission for another 20 years. The Advisory Commission was established by Congress in 1972 to provide for the free exchange of ideas between the National Park Service and the public. The Commission holds open and accessible public meetings monthly at which the public has an opportunity to comment on park-related issues.  I have always felt that protecting our nation's unique natural areas should be one of our highest priorities. The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is one of our Nation's most heavily visited urban national parks as it is in close proximity to millions of people. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
