 This is all in one amendment.  So let me just briefly explain what Ketamine is. Ketamine is an animaltranquilizer. Ketamine is a hallucinogen that is very similar to PCP. It is called ``Special K.'' It has become a new, popular ``designer'' drug.  Although the drug has been in existence for several years, its abuse has rapidly become more prevalent in recent years.  In fact, a club in New Jersey was recently closed by police after it discovered teens were attending these things called ``raves'' where club employees distribute bottled water for the purpose of being able to take this drug called ``Special K.''  In addition to seizures in New Jersey, recent newspaper articles have mentioned seizures in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, and Florida. Drug trafficking experts have also cited the presence of ``Special K'' in Georgia and the District of Columbia and in my home State of Delaware.  It is considered the successor to PCP, or ``angel dust,'' as it is known in the streets, due to the similarity of the two drugs' chemical compositions and mind-altering effects. There have also been reports of PCP being sold to people who think they are buying ``Special K.''  The bottom line is that this is becoming an incredibly popular drug.  The point I will conclude with is I say to my colleagues that by moving Rohypnol to schedule 1 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act and adding ``Special K,'' Ketamine, to schedule 2 of the act, this legislation will subject both drugs to tough controls, increased penalties for unlawful activities involving the two drugs, and it will increase the attention of law enforcement and direct Federal efforts against this.  Mr. President, It also enhances the penalties for people who abuse both these drugs.  In an attempt to cooperate as much as I can, I will yield the floor unless there is somebody who will argue against it.
