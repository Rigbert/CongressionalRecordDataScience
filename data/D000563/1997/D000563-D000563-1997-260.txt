President, at the outset, let me say this is a serious matter and one in which I heartily concur with Senators Leahy and Hagel over the issue before us. In the recorded history of humankind, there were many instances of conflict leading to wars of devastation and great loss. Most people believe those wars come to an end, and with the end of the war there is at least some finality and some peace. Those who have been injured, of course, carry those scars for a lifetime. Those who lost their lives are remembered. Those who served look back with sometimes horror, sometimes fondness, to the experience.  We in the United States think at the end of the great wars, and after the tickertape parades, the finality is finally evidenced by something as significant as a memorial. But what we are speaking of today is a legacy of war that does not end. After the decisions are made, the foreign policy decisions which go awry and lead to a war or a conflict, those decisions end up creating situations which live on forever. In this case, we are dealing with a specific challenge and a specific issue of landmines.  In a visit to Central America about 7 years ago, I went to Costa Rica, to a clinic which was being sustained by contributions from the United States. It was an orthopedic clinic where, primarily children, but adults as well, were brought in to be fitted for orthopedic devices. These are young men, children, young women who walked the streets and the dusty roads in Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, and innocently stepped on a landmine and lost one of their limbs.  These were not combatants or soldiers, these were ordinary people. The wars were over. Yet, for them, the war continued. Each and every day they faced hostilities, hidden hostilities in these landmines. We rallied, in the United States, as we do so often, to provide medical assistance, as we should.  The decisions of foreign policy that led to those conflicts meant nothing to these people, nothing whatsoever. The important thing is that they had been maimed and had lost a limb because of that war and because of its legacy. Many of us think of someone losing a leg or a foot and, of course, in the United States, assume they will go through rehabilitation, they will be fitted with some type of orthopedic device, and life will go on. But in a developing country, a poor country, that kind of injury can be devastating for a lifetime. People who once had great potential can find themselves at that point relegated to impoverishment, relegated to always being a ``cripple.'' We take for granted that they will receive help, and many times they do not.  There are now 110 million landmines in 64 countries around the world. The conflicts which led to the planting of those landmines may have been long forgotten, but they still sit there, waiting for an innocent civilian or passerby to come through and become a victim. The Leahy-Hagel proposal is a good one, to put an end to this devastation and an end to this legacy of war.                          ____________________
