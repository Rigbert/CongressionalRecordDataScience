President, in many ways I feel that if the distinguishedSenator from Utah and I were unconstrained by Senators on either side, we could write a bill that would be very helpful. But I hope we do not get carried away with partisan rhetoric here.  The fact of the matter is that there have been a number of issues the Democratic side of the aisle has brought up that have been voted down by the Republican side--not unanimously, I might say; in fact, I can think of a couple where the distinguished Presiding Officer voted differently than the majority of his party--and then those parts were then put into a Republican bill. That is fine. I am not interested who takes credit; I am interested in stopping juvenile crime.  In fairness, let's point out, when we talk about what the administration might or might not have done, in the past 6 years, the rate of violent crime has come down at a faster and greater level than at any time in my lifetime. I am 59 years old. That means through Republican and Democratic administrations, the rate of violent crime has come down faster than ever before in the 6 years of this administration. The rate of juvenile crime has done the same. We have stopped thousands and thousands of gun sales to those with felony records. Let's stop saying who has done it or who has not done it. Let's do what is best for our children. We are parents. We are grandparents.
