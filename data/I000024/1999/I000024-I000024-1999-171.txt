President, I ask unanimous consent that the following brief statements be printed at the appropriate places in the permanent Record of May 14 immediately following Votes 118 and 119, respectively:  Mr. President, I was absent from the Senate today in order to be a pallbearer at a funeral in Tahlequah, Okla. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on the Hatch-Craig amendment. This position is consistent with my vote to table the same amendment on May 13. The tabling motion failed 3-97, thus leading to the today. I believe my presence would not have changed the outcome since determined efforts werebeing made to switch just enough votes to assure the amendment's passage.  Mr. President, I was absent from the Senate today in order to be a pallbearer at a funeral in Tahlequah, Okla. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes'' on the vote to table the Shumer amendment.
