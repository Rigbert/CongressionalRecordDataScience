I now yield to Doug LaMalfa from California.                              {time}  1615  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for leading this Special Order today, and also for the comments started out by the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), very heartfelt, that reflect the importance of this.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the sanctity of human life and to recognize those who will be in Washington, D.C., tomorrow for the March for Life. I am pleased to join my colleagues and individuals who have traveled from near and far to be in solidarity to protect the rights of the unborn. I applaud those marchers who come here year after year despite snow, rainy conditions, and cold conditions to stand up for such a vital cause. It is their efforts and determination which gives substance and meaning to this year's theme, ``Every Life is a Gift''--and to march for the truth.  As a parent, I wish all parents would understand what the gift is that the Lord has bestowed with one of these young lives upon you. That is part of our mission, to help them understand, to educate. That is part of the mission of the March for Life, to appreciate that these are gifts, even through the hard times. We have struggles in all matters of our lives, and that is an important one we have to get through as well. To understand these blessings that these lives are.  Mr. Speaker, I stand before you to convey to these marchers that their voice will be heard and will continue to be heard as we fight for the dignity of human life.
