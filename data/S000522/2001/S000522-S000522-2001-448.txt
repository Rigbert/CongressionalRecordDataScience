Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to introduce the Reservists Education Protection Act of 2001. Original cosponsors of this legislation include my good friend Lane Evans (D-IL), the Ranking Democratic Member of the VA Committee and 31 other Members of the House. This bill would reinstate VA educational entitlement to certain Active Duty servicemembers and veterans in reserve components called up for Operation Enduring Freedom and future national emergencies.  Up to 10,000 of the 50,000 Reservists recently called to active duty by President Bush as a result of the September 11th attacks against the United States would lose educational assistance entitlement if they are forced to disenroll from school. Many of them would also lose the tuition they paid.  The Reservists Education Protection Act of 2001 would restore monthly entitlement to (a) veterans in reserve components who are using the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) earned by prior active duty, and (b) regular Active Duty servicemembers and veteran reservists who are transferred to a new duty station or assignment.  The Reservists Education Protection Act of 2001 would cover any such servicemember involved in a national emergency after September 11, 2001. (Note: Reservists using the MGIB-Selected Reserve program already have entitlement restoration benefits, and additional time to use their benefit.)  Active Duty servicemembers and veterans are currently entitled to 36 months of educational benefits; this bill assures that no entitlement is lost due to mobilization. The Reservists Education Protection Act of 2001 is similar to the relief that Congress provided during the Persian Gulf War.  The servicemember would also regain time to attend school by extending their Montgomery GI Bill delimiting date by their mobilization tour of duty, plus four months, to the 10 years that they already have. For example, if a servicemember is mobilized for six months, he or she would have 10 months added to their delimiting date.  Active Duty servicemembers and veterans enrolled in the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) (chapter 32) and Survivors and Dependants Educational Assistance (chapter 35) would also be included in the Reservists Education Protection Act of 2001.                          ____________________
