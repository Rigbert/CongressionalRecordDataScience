Hosted at Kalamazoo College since 1943, the tournament has earned a reputation of prestige and excellence, offering the finest in men's junior tennis anywhere in the world.  Over the past six and a half decades, most of the great names in American tennis--Agassi, Ashe, Connors, Courier, McEnroe, Roddick, Sampras, and Young, among many others--have competed at Kalamazoo's Stowe Tennis Stadium for the coveted title of USTA junior champion. The Championships have not only been witness to many record achievements in junior athletics, but also many of the most exhilarating moments in sports history.  The continued success and popularity of this event can only be attributed to the hundreds of volunteers and sponsors throughout Southwest Michigan, who have generously given of themselves year after year. Special recognition is also accorded to Kalamazoo College and Western Michigan University, whose hospitality in hosting and organizing the tournament has been essential. Not least, for their exceptional contributions, Kalamazoo's own Rolla L. Anderson, Timon Corwin, David R. Markin, and Allan B. Stowe are to be praised for providing the leadership and commitment necessary for the tournament to flourish.  Hosting the USTA Boys' 18 and 16 National Championships for so many years has been a tremendous honor for my district. On this momentous occasion, we look back to those whose legacies are manifest in the present, as well as those future generations of volunteers and athletes that will build upon this tradition.                          ____________________
