 President, today Senator Dorgan and I are introducing a bill to make four important changes to the current Gun-Free Schools Act, GFSA.  I am a proud sponsor of the Gun-Free Schools Act, which was enacted as part of the Elementary-Secondary Education Act in 1994. The law requires states receiving federal elementary-secondary education funds to have a state law requiring local school districts to expel from school for a period of not less than one year students who bring weapons to school.  A March report (ED-OIG/S03-A0018) prepared by the Inspector General, IG, of the U.S. Department of Education, highlights several improvements needed to clarify the law. This bill makes those important clarifications.  The IG's report, called a ``perspective paper,'' resulted from an audit that Senator Dorgan and I requested to examine the enforcement of the GFSA in seven States.  We live in a society today that is much different than when I grew up. Our nation is awash in guns and our children live in a culture of violence, bombarded by horrific images in movies, television, and video games. Combine these factors with a lack of parental supervision and this combustible mix has exploded again and again on too many school campuses.  In just the last few weeks alone, we've seen this mix erupt within just a few miles of each other in the San Diego area.  On March 5, a troubled young man named Charles ``Andy'' Williams brought a .22-caliber revolver to school, fired at random, killing two students and wounding 13 others at Santana High School, in Santee, California. And on March 22, an eighteen year-old shot five students at Granite Hill High School in El Cajon, California. Fortunately, in this case, no one was killed.  The Los Angeles Times summed up this epidemic aptly on March 6 and called on public officials to act, saying ``Nothing of course, assures that tragedy can be prevented, but leaders from the classroom to the White House can clearly take more steps to promote school safety.''  Now I know that gun laws are not the only answer to solving this problem, but they do represent part of the answer. But the fact is that even the most simple, rational, and targetedmeasures to deter guns from falling into the hands of our young people have been cast aside.  The fact is that there are some simple steps we can take to limit the number of guns from reaching our children. We can close the loophole on the importation of high capacity ammunition clips. We can include trigger locks on every gun purchased.  And we need to continue with measures that are working. The Gun Free Schools Act is a targeted fix that is working. And the bill we are introducing today refines this law slightly to make it work even better.  This legislation will close several loopholes in current law under which allows some students to escape punishment who bring guns to school.  Because the law effectively imposes a one-year expulsion for students who have ``brought'' a weapon to school, students who ``have'' or ``possess'' a weapon in school can go ``scot-free.''  Under current law, for example, a student could use a firearm that was technically ``brought'' to school by another student. The student could then possess it in his or her backpack or locker and thus potentially make it available to others and go unpunished because he or she did not technically ``bring'' it to school.  Another loophole that the bill addresses is the definition of school. The current prohibition on guns in schools applies to ``a school.'' This could be interpreted to mean literally the school building.  Our bill clarifies that school means ``any setting that is under the control and supervision of the local education agency'', i.e., the school district. Without this change, a student could wield a firearm on the football field, on the school bus or in the parking lot and possibly evade punishment under this law.  Here are the four changes made by this bill: Under the current law, states are required to have a law requiring a one-year expulsion of students who have ``brought a weapon to a school'' in order to receive federal education funds.  The change our bill proposes is to add to current law, ``or to have possessed a firearm.'' We are proposing this change because punishing only people who ``bring'' a weapon to school leaves a glaring loophole in the law.  Without this change, students who ask friends to bring a weapon to school or who obtain a weapon from someone who has ``brought'' it to school, but carry it around or use the weapon, would not be covered since current law uses the term ``brought.'' Current law could be interpreted to mean that students can have a gun at school as long as they do not actually ``bring'' it into the school. I believe this change is an important clarification.  The IG's report says that without this change, states and school districts may ``incorrectly implement the Act, resulting in non-compliance or the submission of erroneous information on disciplinary actions under the Act.'' This is because current law does not ``specify expulsion as the consequence for students found in possession of a firearm.''  Under current law, school districts and states are required to report expulsions. They are, however, required to report incidents. An example of this would be when students bring a weapon to or possess weapons in schools, for which no disciplinary action is taken.  Without reporting all incidents in which students have or possess weapons in schools, it is impossible to determine if school officials are in fact enforcing the law, if they are actually expelling students.  The IG's audit cites an example at one Maryland school in which a student who brought a firearm to school was not expelled. Instead, the school's administrators allowed the student to withdraw from school and the school did not inform the school district of the incident. Police arrested the student. So action was taken, but the incident itself did not appear in the annual report because technically the student was not expelled.  Similarly, the IG found that in one California district, school officials did not expel a student ``involved in a firearm incident'' because the student was arrested and did not return to school.  In these cases, the students did face legal consequences for their action, but the weapons incidents were not reflected in the school's report because the law requires reporting only expulsions, not incidents.  The bill would add several new reporting requirements. School districts and states would have to report, 1. all firearms incidents; 2. each modification of an expulsion, e.g., when an administrator shortens an expulsion, which is allowed under current law; and 3. the level of education in which the incident occurs, elementary, middle, high school.  Only by thorough reporting can public officials, the Department of Education, and the Congress know how well the law is working and how effectively it is being enforced.  These proposed changes should remedy that deficiency.  There are two additional changes we are proposing based on the IG's work. The Department of Education has incorporated these two changes in their guidance to states and school districts, but I believe these changes should be codified in the law so they cannot be changed administratively.  The prohibition on weapons in ``school'' applies ``to a school,'' which implies that this means the building only. For many years, the U.S. Department of Education interpreted this to mean the school buildings only.  Under that approach, therefore, a student could bring a weapon to school and leave it in an unlocked car, where it would still be readily available to students throughout the school day.  Interpreted strictly to mean ``school buildings,'' that policy also allowed guns on athletic fields, in equipment sheds, and in school yards. As one Virginia legislator put it, ``you could legally come to a PTA meeting packing a weapon.''  Fortunately, the Department has corrected its guidance to school districts to clarify that the prohibition on bringing guns to schools applies to the entire school campus. The guidance states, ``The one-year expulsion requirement applies to students who bring weapons to any setting that is under the control and supervision of the local education agency.''  Under our bill, weapons would be allowed to be kept in cars and trucks on school property only if the weapons are ``lawfully stored inside a locked vehicle on school property.'' This provision is an effort to recognize that in some communities students may go hunting directly after school.  Under current law, the chief school administrator in a school district can modify an expulsion on a case-by-case basis.  Our bill would require that all modifications be put in writing. The IG found inconsistent reporting of modifications. This change should establish one consistent, clear policy and should provide a record of expulsions that are modified.  Guns have no place in schools. Congress made this clear in 1994 when we adopted the Gun-Free Schools Act.  This is a good law that should remain in place. The bill we introduce today makes some important clarifications in that law and strengthens it.  The latest Annual Report on School Safety reports that 3,930 students were expelled for bringing a firearm to school. One student is one too many, in my view.  The latest incidents in California are but another disturbing reminder of the ``culture of violence'' that so pervades our society. All of us must ask why students resort to guns to deal with their grievances or vent their frustrations. Clearly, we must take strong steps to address the underlying societal issues and to get guns out of the hands of youngsters.  This bill is one small, yet important, step to ensure that no more schoolchildren die from weapons violence. I urge my colleagues to enact this bill promptly.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              The Gun-Free Schools Refinement Act--Summary       Amendments to the current Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994.      These changes are based on the March 2001 report of the U.S.      Department of Education's Inspector General (ED-OIG/S03-     A0018).                        1. ``Brought a Weapon''       Current law: Requires states to have a law requiring a one-     year expulsion of students who have ``brought a weapon to a      school.''       Proposed Change: Adds ``or possessed a weapon.''                        2. Entire School Campus       Current law: The prohibition on bringing a weapon to school      applies ``to a school.''       Proposed Change: Clarifies that the prohibition on bringing      guns to schools applies to entire school, specifically ``any      setting that is under the control and supervision of the      local education agency,'' unless a gun is lawfully locked in      a vehicle.                   3. Report Incidents, Modifications       Current Law: Requires only reporting of expulsions.       Proposed Changes: Requires the reporting of--       1. All weapons incidents;       2. Each modification of an expulsion (e.g., when an      administrator shortens an expulsion); and       3. The level of education in which the incident occurs      (elementary, middle, high school).                      4. Modifications in Writing       Current Law: Allows states' laws to allow the chief      administering officer of a school district to modify one-year      expulsions on a case-by-case basis.       Proposed Change: Requires that all modifications of      expulsions be put in writing.
