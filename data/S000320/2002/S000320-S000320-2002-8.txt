 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend, H. Pettus Randall III, of Tuscaloosa, AL. Pettus Randall died on Saturday, September 7, at the age of 57.  Pettus was a native of Tuscaloosa, AL and attended the University of Alabama where he received bachelor's degrees in English and history. He attended New York University's Graduate School of Business and completed his law degree at the University of Alabama in 1971.  Following the death of his father, Henry Pettus Randall Jr., in 1976, Pettus took over the publishing company that his father had started in 1934. Pettus grew Randall Publishing Company from a $1 million a year company into the $70 million a year nationwide operation it is today. Randall Publishing Company employs more than 600 workers in 20 States and is one of the largest publishers in construction and trucking. It is among the 20 largest privately held U.S. publishing companies and was rated the sixth-fastest-growing publishing companies in the United States.  Under Pettus' management, Randall Publishing Company employees were among the first in the Nation to have 401(k) benefits and, as Randall Publishing Company grew, the growth of equity was shared with each employee.  In the summer of 2000, I had the honor of introducing then-Governor George W. Bush to Pettus at an event at Randall Publishing Company.  Pettus served as president of the West Alabama Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Tuscaloosa Kiwanis Club. He chaired State campaigns for the Cancer Society and Christ Episcopal Church in Tuscaloosa. He worked with United Way, Tuscaloosa Boys and Girls Clubs, March of Dimes and the Tuscaloosa Association of Retarded Citizens.  Pettus and his wife, Catherine were recognized this year by the Alexis de Tocqueville Society for their contributions to the quality of life in west Alabama. In May, he received the west Alabama Chamber's lifetime achievement award and was named Tuscaloosa County's citizen of the year.  Pettus also found time to raise a family. He and Catherine raised three exceptional children. Their daughter Jaynie Rogers attends an MBA program at Harvard. Their daughter Kate is a graduate of both Vanderbilt and Cambridge Universities, and is about to join an investment management firm in Los Angeles. Their son Pettus IV attends Princeton University.  Pettus Randall was a good friend, a patriarch of the Tuscaloosa community, and a much-beloved family man. He will be greatly missed by many.                          ____________________
