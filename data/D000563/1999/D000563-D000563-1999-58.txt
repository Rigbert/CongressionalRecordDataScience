 Mr. President, consider that only a few weeks ago, this Chamber was seriously considering a $792 billion tax cut for some of the wealthiest people in America, and many people on the other side of the aisle said that is good, wise policy. Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve didn't think so. Frankly, the people of America don't think so. They told the Republican Party to keep this tax cut primarily for wealthy people.  Now comes a proposal from the Republican side when it comes to the working families that would cut out $1,200 in income, $1,200 to a family making about $10,000 a year. That is an upside down priority. That is a priority that forgets the real people who are working in this country to make America strong. Eleven point four million workers would get a pay increase with the Democratic Kennedy minimum wage increase package, and with this proposed increase that Senator Kennedy has proposed and I am supporting, it means over $2,000 a year for people who are scraping to get by, primarily women who are in the minimum wage workforce, African-Americans, and Hispanics, people who go to work every single day who understand the importance of work and deserve our respect for doing so.  The vote tomorrow morning will be a measure of how much respect we have for them. This $2,000 increase for these workers can mean 7 months of groceries, 5 months of rent, 10 months of utilities, tuition and fees at a community college so one of their kids has a chance to even have a better and more successful life.  I say to the Senate this is a test. It is a test as we wrap up this session about where our values will be. Will they be with these working families? Will we make certain they get an increase in their basic wage or will we stand with those who want to delay it and delay and delay it? The argument is often made that if you increase the minimum wage, you are going to lose jobs.  Take a look at my home State of Illinois. Since the 1996 increase in the minimum wage, take a look at the real statistics: 268,100 new jobs since we last increased the minimum wage; 33,100 new retail jobs, the area where most minimum-wage jobs are found; unemployment is down 10 percent; and the unemployment rate is 4.7 percent.  As we increase the minimum wage, we have not seen all of the things that the Republicans tell us we should be afraid of--afraid of losing jobs and creating chaos in the workplace. Exactly the opposite has happened across America. Since we last raised the minimum wage, we have seen an economy moving forward.  Now the real test for this Senate is whether or not we are going to bring on board this ship as it moves forward the people who get up and go to work every single day, the men and women who work in the convenience stores, who make our beds in motels and hotels we stay in overnight, the folks who serve our food and cook it in the kitchen. These are the invisible people who keep America moving forward. But these invisible people will be watching tomorrow to see if this Senate is going to give the minimum wage increase which is so essential.  I hope those on the Republican side who are preaching fiscal integrity and fiscal soundness will think twice about voting for a bill that not only stretches the minimum wage an extra year but provides tax cuts without compensating offsets. What does that mean in layman's terms? The Republican package doesn't pay for the tax cuts that they are trying to enact. They have some good ideas, I am sure. But it isn't honest if you didn't pay for them.  What Senator Kennedy and the Democrats have done, what we have said is when it comes to small business and the tax proposal, we have the means of paying for them. And by and large, we are going to make sure that when the small businesses that enact these increases in the minimum wage turn to us and say, are you listening to some of our other concerns, the answer will be yes. We want to make sure you can deduct every single penny of your health insurance premiums as every major corporation can. Self-employed people, farmers, and small businesses deserve the same benefit: Make sure that there is a facility available for child care; make sure that a pension package can be offered--things that will help small businesses extend opportunities for their workforce and create better employee moral and productivity.  I close by saying that this vote tomorrow morning at 10:30 is a test of the Senate's will and the Senate's values. I hope that we will stand by people who go to work every single day.  It is one thing to preach on the floor about people looking for a handout; these folks are looking for a hand up. They are working and need assistance and an increase in their minimum wage. I rise in strong support of the proposal by Senator Kennedy. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me.  I yield the floor.                           Amendment No. 2547
