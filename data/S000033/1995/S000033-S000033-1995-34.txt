 Chairman, let me introduce a concept into this discussion that does not often get heard, and that is the concept of justice. Our Republican friends are right when they talk about the serious problem of the national debt and the interest on the national debt. They are dead wrong in terms of their reconciliation package.  Mr. Chairman, what sense does it make and how are we moving toward a balanced budget when we give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America? How does that help us move toward a balanced budget? How does it help us move toward a balanced budget when we repeal the alternative minimum corporate tax so that the largest corporations in America will end up paying nothing in taxes? Explain to the American people how that moves us toward a balanced budget.  This morning, Mr. Chairman, the Progressive Caucus held a press conference and we documented that if this Congress had the guts to stand up to the large corporations and the wealthiest people in this country and eliminated the $125 billion a year in corporate welfare that we currently provide, we could move toward a balanced budget in 7 years, but we would not have to slash Medicare, we would not have to slash Medicaid, student loans, fuel assistance, or children's nutrition programs.  There is a way to move us toward a balanced budget which is fair, Mr. Chairman, which does not come down heavy on the poorest and most vulnerable people in this country. Let us have the guts to stand up to the big money interests and move toward a balanced budget in that way.
