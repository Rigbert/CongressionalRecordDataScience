President, on that day in 1983, President Reagan announced his decision to begin the long march away from the suicidal defense doctrine known as mutual assured destruction. In one bold stroke, he singlehandedly committed the Nation to an intense research and development program designed to harness our technology to the task of countering the threat posed by ballistic missiles, and to do it with measures that are defensive. Wouldn't it be better, he asked, ``to save lives rather than to avenge them?''  In retrospect, we can see that it was a speech that truly rocked the world. In the context of the closing strategy of the cold war, it posed the decisive final challenge to the Soviet Union. Three years later, at the Reykjavik Summit, extraordinary Soviet efforts to deter Reagan from his commitment to missile defense failed. As a result, the evil empire's days were numbered and Soviet leader Gorbachev knew it.  In the context of domestic politics, Reagan's 1983 speech ignited a passionate debate over defense policy which still continues today. Within just hours after the speech, one of our distinguished colleagues in this body coined the term star wars. Opponents claimed Reagan's idea was a fantasy, that he wanted a perfect astrodome defense which would cost trillions of dollars.  Despite such rhetoric, in the context of science and technology, the speech helped focus inquiries on numerous fronts which led to remarkable breakthroughs. Is it technically feasible, at an affordable cost, to ``intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reach our own soil or that ofour allies?'' In 1983, many critics answered ``no.'' Today, such questions are themselves--as Reagan would say--largely ``impotent and obsolete.''  But still, 13 years later, America has not deployed, nor is it committed to deploy, any national missile defense system. Why? In a fundamental sense, the answer lies in the triumph of politics over science. The real technological barriers have been broken. We have the know-how. Even funding is no longer the real issue.  Rather, it is the many political barriers that remain, and they are formidable. The Soviet Union is gone, and with it, the perceived threat posed by its awesome missile arsenal. Proliferation of missiles to other countries continues, but we are told that any real concern about it is premature. Today's Democrat President, like the Democrat Congresses before him, argues strenuously that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty should remain as the ``cornerstone'' of U.S. strategic defense policy. It prohibits the deployment of effective defenses on the theory that deterrence should rest solely on threat of instant retaliation--the same theory President Reagan sought to transcend.  So the struggle for national missile defense continues. ``It will take years, probably decades, of effort on many fronts,'' President Reagan said, and he was right.  Today, I stand proudly with those who remain committed to the moral vision articulated by President Reagan: ``That the human spirit must be capable of rising above dealing with other nations and human beings by threatening their existence.''  We will continue the efforts President Reagan began. And I hope, that in marking this anniversary, we can take increased devotion to the cause of world peace and freedom--that we can learn from the wisdom, the foresight, the courage and the example of President Reagan.  Like Ronald Reagan before us, we pursue this cause not because some public opinion poll told us it was the popular thing to do. We act because we know it is the right thing to do for our country and for future generations.                               Exhibit 1Address to the Nation on National Security By President Ronald Reagan,                              March 23, 1983       The calls for cutting back the defense budget come in nice,      simple arithmetic. They're the same kind of talk that led the      democracies to neglect their defenses in the 1930's and      invited the tragedy of World War II. We must not let that      grim chapter of history repeat itself through apathy or      neglect.       This is why I'm speaking to you tonight--to urge you to      tell your Senators and Congressmen that you know we must      continue to restore our military strength. If we stop in      midstream, we will send a signal of decline, of lessened      will, to friends and adversaries alike. Free people must      voluntarily, through open debate and democratic means, meet      the challenge that totalitarians pose by compulsion. It's up      to us, in our time, to choose and choose wisely between the      hard but necessary task of preserving peace and freedom and      the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the      best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day.       The solution is well within our grasp. But to reach it,      there is simply no alternative but to continue this year, in      this budget, to provide the resources we need to preserve the      peace and guarantee our freedom.       Now, thus far tonight I've shared with you my thoughts on      the problems of national security we must face together. My      predecessors in the Oval Office have appeared before you on      other occasions to describe the threat posed by Soviet power      and have proposed steps to address that threat. But since the      advent of nuclear weapons, those steps have been increasingly      directed toward deterrence of aggression through the promise      of retaliation.       This approach to stability through offensive threat has      worked. We and our allies have succeeded in preventing      nuclear war for more than three decades. in recent months,      however, my advisers, including in particular the Joint      Chiefs of Staff, have underscored the necessity to break out      of a future that relies solely on offensive retaliation for      our security.       Over the course of these discussions, I've become more and      more deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable      of rising above dealing with other nations and human beings      by threatening their existence. Feeling this way, I believe      we must thoroughly examine every opportunity for reducing      tensions and for introducing greater stability into the      strategic calculus on both sides.       One of the most important contributions we can make is, of      course, to lower the level of all arms, and particularly      nuclear arms. We're engaged right now in several negotiations      with the Soviet Union to bring about a mutual reduction of      weapons. I will report to you a week from tomorrow my      thoughts on that score. But let me just say, I'm totally      committed to this course.       If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to      achieve major arms reduction, we will have succeeded in      stabilizing the nuclear balance. Nevertheless, it will still      be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation, on mutual      threat. And that's a sad commentary on the human condition.      Wouldn't it be better to save lives than to avenge them? Are      we not capable of demonstrating our peaceful intentions by      applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a      truly lasting stability? I think we are. Indeed, we must.       After careful consultation with my advisers, including the      Joint Chiefs of Staff, I believe there is a way. Let me share      with you a vision of the future which offers hope. It is that      we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile      threat with measures that are defensive. Let us turn to the      very strengths in technology that spawned our great      industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we      enjoy today.       What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that      their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S.      retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept      and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached      our own soil or that of our allies?       I know this is a formidable, technical task, one that may      not be accomplished before the end of this century. Yet,      current technology has attained a level of sophistication      where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort. It will      take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts. There      will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be      successes and breakthroughs. And as we proceed, we must      remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and      maintaining a solid capability for flexible response. But      isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world      from the threat of nuclear war? We know it is.       In the meantime, we will continue to pursue real reductions      in nuclear arms, negotiating from a position of strength that      can be ensured only by modernizing our strategic forces. At      the same time, we must take steps to reduce the risk of a      conventional military conflict escalating to nuclear war by      improving our nonnuclear capabilities.       America does possess--now--the technologies to attain very      significant improvements in the effectiveness of our      conventional, nonnuclear forces. Proceeding boldly with these      new technologies, we can significantly reduce any incentive      that the Soviet Union may have to threaten attack against the      United States or its allies.       As we pursue our goal of defensive technologies, we      recognize that our allies rely upon our strategic offensive      power to deter attacks against them. Their vital interests      and ours are inextricably linked. Their safety and ours are      one. And no change in technology can or will alter that      reality. We must and shall continue to honor our commitments.       I clearly recognize that defensive systems have limitations      and raise certain problems and ambiguities. If paired with      offensive systems, they can be viewed as fostering an      aggressive policy, and no one wants that. But with these      considerations firmly in mind, I call upon the scientific      community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons,      to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and      world peace, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear      weapons impotent and obsolete.       Tonight, consistent with our obligations of the ABM treaty      and recognizing the need for closer consultation with our      allies, I'm taking an important first step. I am directing a      comprehensive and intensive effort to define a long-term      research and development program to begin to achieve our      ultimate goal of eliminating the threat posed by strategic      nuclear missiles. This could pave the way for arms control      measures to eliminate the weapons themselves. We seek neither      military superiority nor political advantage. Our only      purpose--one all people share--is to search for ways to      reduce the danger of nuclear war.       My fellow Americans, tonight we're launching an effort      which holds the promise of changing the course of human      history. There will be risks, and results take time. But I      believe we can do it. As we cross this threshold, I ask for      your prayers and your support.       Thank you, good night, and God bless you.
