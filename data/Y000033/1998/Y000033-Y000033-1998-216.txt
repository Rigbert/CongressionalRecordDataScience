Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2807, the Rhino and Tiger Product Labeling Act, a bill introduced by the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans, Jim Saxton.  There is no question that intense competition for land has resulted in the destruction of critical rhino and tiger habitat. After all, we are talking about some of the most densely populated countries in the world.  Nevertheless, the major cause of the decline of rhinos and tigers is the huge ongoing demand for products made from these animals. For generations, Oriental medicines have contained ingredients of rhino and tiger parts that are consumed to fight headaches and fever in children, kidney and liver problems, convulsions, and heart conditions. In almost all cases, rhino horn and tiger bones are obtained from illegal sources.  We must eliminate the market for these products and stop their importation into the United States. This is the goal of H.R. 2807. Instead of spending thousands of dollars trying to prove whether a particular Chinese medicine contains rhino or tiger parts, this legislation simply prohibits them from entering this country if the label says they contain these highly endangered species.  By closing the U.S. market, the hope is that the demand for these products will end and the financial incentives to illegally kill rhino or tiger will no longer exist.  Furthermore, there are synthetic alternatives to these products and it is essential that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service renew their educational efforts. Based on surveys conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the majority of those people consuming traditional medicines have no idea they might be contributing to the destruction of these flagship species.  I urge an aye vote on this bold wildlife conservation legislation which will hopefully stop the slaughter of rhinos and tigers in the wild.                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on ways and means,                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1998.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Don: I am writing to address certain issues with H.R.      2807, as reported by the Committee on Resources on March 11,      1998, which would amend the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation      Act of 1994. The bill contains import prohibition and Customs      forfeiture provisions, which fall within the jurisdiction of      the Committee on Ways and Means.       With respect to the import ban, H.R. 2807, as reported by      the Committee on Resources, prohibits any person from      selling, importing or exporting or attempting to sell,      import, or export any product, item or substance intended for      human consumption containing or purporting to contain any      substance derived from any species of rhinoceros or tiger,      creates criminal and civil penalties, and allows for the      forfeiture of such products. Because these provisions fall      within the Committee's jurisdiction, the Committee would      ordinarily meet to consider the bill. However, because the      bill, as reported, applies the ban in compliance with the      letter and spirit of U.S. obligations under an existing      multilateral agreement governing such trade, I do not believe      that a markup of the bill is necessary.       With respect to forfeiture, section 2 of H.R. 2807, as      reported, includes language within the jurisdiction of the      Committee on Ways and Means. Under normal circumstances the      Committee would meet to consider the bill. However, it is my      understanding that you will be offering an amendment on the      floor of the House of Representatives to substitute the      following language so that the existing statutory Customs      forfeiture provisions would apply:       (c) Forfeitures.--Any product, item, or substance sold,      imported, or exported, or attempted to be sold, imported, or      exported, contrary to the provisions of this Act or any      regulation made pursuant thereto shall be sized and forfeited      to the United States. All equipment, vessels, vehicles,      aircraft, and other means of transportation used to aid the      selling, exporting, or importing, or an attempt to sell,      export, of any product, item, or substance in violation of      this Act or any regulation issued pursuant to this Act, may      be seized and forfeited to the United States. All laws      relating to the seizure, forfeiture, and condemnation of a      vessel for violation of the customs laws, the disposition      of such vessel or the proceeds from the sale thereof, and      the remission or mitigation of such forfeiture, shall      apply to the seizures and forfeitures incurred under this      Act, insofar as those laws are applicable and not      inconsistent with this Act.       Based on your assurances to this effect, and in order to      expedite consideration of this legislation, I do not believe      that a markup by the Committee on Ways and Means will be      necessary on this issue.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      this understanding with respect to H.R. 2807, and would ask      that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be      included in the record during floor consideration. Thank you      for your cooperation and assistance on this matter.           With best personal regards,                                                      Bill Archer,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1998.     Hon. Bill Archer,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth HOB,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.      2807, the Rhino and Tiger Product Labeling Act. Enactment of      this bill will help enforce the existing ban on the sale,      import or export of products containing rhinoceros and tiger      parts and therefore help conservation efforts for these      endangered species.       I agree that the Committee on Ways and Means has      jurisdiction over import prohibitions and U.S. Customs      Service forfeitures. As noted in your letter, current law      already prohibits imports and exports of products containing      endangered species under the Lacey Act and the Convention on      International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and      Flora. In addition, when H.R. 2807 is considered by the House      of Representatives, I do intend to substitute the forfeiture      language of the bill you have identified regarding Customs      powers, as this provision also duplicates Lacey Act authority      for the Secretary of the Interior.       Thank you for your cooperation in this matter, and I will      place our correspondence on this issue in the Congressional      Record during debate on H.R. 2807.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.
