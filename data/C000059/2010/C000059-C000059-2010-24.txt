On Sunday, September 5, 2010, Gene passed away at the age of 85. Although Gene has passed on from this life, he leaves a lasting legacy of generosity and accomplishment that will never be forgotten.  More than 700 people gathered to pay tribute to Gene at the California Baptist University quad, just behind the center that bears his name. The two-hour service brought together people throughout the community that Gene touched during his life, including industry leaders, former employees, friends and family members. Gene's life tells the tale of a man who turned his business empire into a conduit for blessing the lives of people around him.  Gene Yeager was born in Riverside in 1924. He graduated from Poly High School in 1942 and studied engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy. After World War II ended, he returned to Berkeley, where he received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering. Together with his two brothers, Richard and Jacques, they went to work for their father, Ernest Louis Yeager, who founded E.L. Yeager Construction Company in Riverside in 1919. Gene ran the public works side of the operations business which worked on projects to improve major freeways, dams and bridges. The brothers turned the business into one of the largest public works and private construction companies in the United States, and one that changed the landscape of Southern California.  With Gene at the head, the Yeager Company rebuilt two bridges that collapsed in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, built the Highway 91/Interstate 15 interchange in Corona, built the dam at Lake Perris and helped erect the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana.  After Richard was killed in a traffic accident in 1979, Gene and Jacques continued to run the company until 1995, when they sold it to a group of senior managers. In 2002, the business was sold to Skanska, the Swedish construction giant.  Through the years, Gene had become a leader and an industry icon. He is remembered just as fondly by his construction workers as he is with the people at Skanska, because of his intense work ethic and generous heart.  After retiring in 1995, Gene set about traveling the world with his wife, spending time with his family and generously making donations to worthy causes in the Riverside area, including a $1 million endowment to fund environmental research and scholarships at the University of California at Riverside.  In fact, his charitable work earned him ``guardian angel'' status in Riverside. Everyone that knew Gene, knew that he gave from the heart, and did so without any desire for recognition.  In addition to his wife, Billie, Mr. Yeager is survived by sons Ken, of San Jose, and Tom, of Riverside; daughters Beth, of Norco, and Louise, of Newport Beach; stepchildren Terri, of Riverside, and Doug Moore, of Rancho Cucamonga; brother Jacques, of Riverside; nephew Jacques Jr., of Riverside; and 13 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is an honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the life and legacy of my friend Gene Yeager. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his dear family and friends.                          ____________________
