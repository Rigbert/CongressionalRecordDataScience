President, I wish to thank Senators Thurmond and Nunn for agreeing to include this provision in the Defense authorization bill. I also want to thank the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee for their patience and understanding in working with Senator Nickles' and my staff on this issue.  This land transfer will allow Oklahoma to move forward in its attempt to establish a new national veterans' cemetery. This process has taken almost a decade to get to this point, but I believe we now have a satisfactory solution in using available land at Fort Sill, in Lawton, OK.  Finding property for this veterans' cemetery has been a major struggle, and, obviously, this land transfer will mean a great deal to many Oklahoman veterans. I am pleased to be a part of this solution, and I thank the other Senators who have helped to make this happen.
