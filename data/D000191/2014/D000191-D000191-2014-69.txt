Chairman, nothing I have heard has refuted the points I made earlier.  In fact, the gentleman from South Carolina made the point about high diesel prices. Well, if he was harking back to a time when diesel was actually cheaper than gasoline, well, back then, we didn't export much refined diesel. Now we are exporting in the vicinity of 1 million barrels a day of diesel. So the price of diesel is up because we are paying the so-called world price. And if we exported 2 million barrels a day, the world price wouldn't go down.  And then you have the issue with the speculators on Wall Street, as I mentioned earlier. According to the head of ExxonMobil, 60 cents a gallon--and that would be diesel and gasoline--goes directly to speculators on Wall Street, those high-frequency traders who are so vital to our economy.  We do have a few statistics just to keep it straight. Gasoline production was at a record high in May, but unfortunately, gas prices were pretty darn high. This is from the Energy Information Administration, and they quote the American Petroleum Institute, which is the group that wants to begin to export crude oil. So if we produce more crude oil, we will put it in the world market or sell it to China so they can refine it. And that will somehow insulate us against price spikes because we will be flooding the world oil market with oil that is produced more cheaply here but sold more expensively over there. But unfortunately, that means that we pay the same price here that gets paid over there. That is another problem.  But anyway, the chief economist for API, John Felmy, said: ``We've developed a good export market for distillates. So we produce more gasoline than demand warrants.'' Yet the price is up. Go figure.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
