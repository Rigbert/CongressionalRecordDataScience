Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to take the time today to congratulate the Detroit Pistons on their inspiring run through the NBA season and playoffs and on their first NBA as championship since 1990.  Behind the leadership of the legendary Head Coach Larry Brown, the Pistons displayed a sense of purpose and energy often missing in the NBA game today.  On the court a trio of stars and an excellent supporting cast led the team brilliantly. Despite suffering a broken bone in his face, Richard Hamilton led the Pistons offensively all season and played his best basketball of the season in the playoffs, when he averaged 21.5 points per game.  The Pistons' vaunted defense was led all season by two-time NBA defensive player of the year, winner Ben Wallace, who brought a no-nonsense style to the Pistons.  Though one of the league's best teams last year, team finally came into championship form in mid-season this year when a trade brought forward Rasheed Wallace to the team. Mr. Wallace's veteran experience was the final piece needed as the Pistons stormed through the regular season and the playoffs.  In the finals, the Pistons were regarded as the heavy underdog to the Los Angeles Lakers. However, once again, the Pistons bucked these seemingly insurmountable odds and won the championship series in games. This was basketball at its best.  In closing, I join my colleague. I too want to congratulate the Pistons for their spectacular season, and I look forward to watching them bring the same sort of excitement to basketball again next year. It was basketball, good basketball, wonderful basketball.  I have a lot of relatives living in Detroit, and they were rooting for the Pistons, and I was rooting with them for the Pistons. Go Pistons, go.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
