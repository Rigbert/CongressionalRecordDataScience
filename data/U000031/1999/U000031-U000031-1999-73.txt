And as much as we thought we knew each other on the trip, we always learn something new.  I have been in a little prayer group with the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner), and it was only until we got on the bus and my wife and I were sitting in front of Bob and his wife and we sort of talked about our experiences that I thought when I was in the mid-'60s when this event really happened, I did not know about it. I was in fourth grade. I did not see that on the news. I did not watch the news when I was in the fourth grade.  It came out in the description, as I was listening to the gentleman from California, and he was talking about a variety of different events and seeing different things unfold, that I learned that he had been a student in college and had seen some of the events and actually took it upon himself to come down and become, in essence, one of the Freedom Riders on one of those buses.  I know that it was a marvelous experience for him. He actually spent some time in prison because of it. And this was his first trip back to Alabama since then. I would love to hear a little bit of the gentleman's thoughts firsthand tonight.
