 I would like to congratulate this fine organization. For 75 years Allen Health System has diligently carried out its mission of commitment to healing, teaching, caring, and improving the health of the people and communities it serves.  Established in 1925, this organization has, over the years, positively impacted the lives of friends and family in Waterloo/Cedar Falls and surrounding communities of Northeast Iowa. Allen Health System has contributed to the development of healthcare within the community with its high quality of healthcare, professionalism, service and outreach.  The contribution of Allen Memorial Hospital and the nursing education program of Allen Health System over the past 75 years is immeasurable and Allen is to be commended for its unwavering commitment to providing healthcare to those it serves.  This September 2000, Allen Health System associates and students come together to commemorate the organization's 75th birthday and to further enhance their knowledge and skills related to healthcare, I salute them. The community has been strengthened and enhanced by the work of this organization and the men and women who are part of it.                          ____________________
