Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, this bill is about personal responsibility. It is about plugging loopholes in the Bankruptcy Code that result in the shifting of millions and billions of dollars to people who pay their bills on time. It is going to put more vibrancy in our economy because of the fact that debt that is written off is something that has to be absorbed by corporations and people who hire other people who cannot afford that. I would urge the Members to support this legislation.
