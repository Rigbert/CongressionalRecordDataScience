Speaker, in the 105th Congress the Republican majority changed House rules to allow the creation of a nearly $8 million ``reserve fund'' for unanticipated committee expenses.  With the advent of biennial committee funding, setting aside resources for unforeseeable contingencies makes sense.  No one can know with certainty 2 years in advance what demands House committees may face. If contingencies do not arise, and the funds are not needed, they can be used to reduce the public debt.  But somewhere a good idea went awry. Republican leaders used the reserve not as a rainy-day fund for unforeseen contingencies, but as a slush fund for their partisan projects.  Most of the nearly $8 million was eventually disbursed, not for committee expenses a reasonable person would consider unforeseeable, but instead for political investigations of the administration and the working men and women of organized labor.  And under procedures established by the Republican leadership, these millions were disbursed without any vote of the House. Committees devised their plans for partisan investigations, often without even informing the minority. If Speaker Gingrich approved of a plan, the majority of the House Oversight Committee rubber stamped it in a ``ministerial'' act, and the money flowed.  There was no floor debate, vote, or accountability to the American people for how millions of dollars were to be spent.  To improve accountability and bring the process into the open, last March I introduced House Resolution 387, to require a House vote before any disbursements could be made from the reserve fund.  Unfortunately, the Rules Committee did not approve this reform. Today, I reintroduce it with the cosponsorship of the ranking Democrat on every legislative committee of this House.  I had hoped that with a new Speaker who spoke so eloquently on opening day about bipartisanship and meeting the Democratic minority half way, reintroducing this resolution might be unnecessary.  But the rules adopted by the majority that same day again permit creation of a slush fund, from which disbursements may be made without a floor vote, thereby signaling the majority's intention to proceed as before.  Until it is clear that the reserve fund will be used solely as a hedge against unforeseen contingencies, rather than as petty cash for political sideshows, then the House should debate and vote on how those funds will be used.  When Democrats controlled this House, the only way committees could get more funds for unanticipated needs was through debate and approval of a supplemental expense resolution on this floor. That is the time-honored, open process that lets the public see what's going on and know whom to hold accountable.  By contrast, under Republican control, committees can get more money through a process essentially hidden from public view and for which most Members are not accountable.  The lack of openness and scrutiny creates an opportunity for partisan mischief, and the majority yielded to temptation in the last Congress.  In this new Congress, let's not repeat our mistake. Let's following through on the Speaker's promise of bipartisanship and cooperation.                          ____________________
