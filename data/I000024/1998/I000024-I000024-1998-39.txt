Most of the things he stated so eloquently I do agree with. I would like to discuss a couple of them, however.  The 125 nations or so that we are talking about that he referred to who signed this Ottawa Treaty--obviously, we have not. I don't think it is good policy for us to say that we didn't sign it ourselves but we encourage others to do it.  I have not seen any documentation of that. If I did, it wouldn't really be too meaningful to me.
