 President, a significant amount of time and effort goes into preparing this bill every year. I want to take a moment to recognize some of the dedicated staff involved in putting it together.  First, I thank my good friend from Vermont, with whom I have enjoyed working on this issue over the last decade, who is ably served by Tim Rieser and Kate Eltrich. Over the past few months, they have worked alongside my staff helping to draft a bill and report. They have my special thanks for a job well done.  Recognition also goes to LaShawnda Smith, Tom Hawkins, Harry Christy, and Paul Grove of my staff. I thank LaShawnda for keeping the subcommittee running. She does a terrific job.  Since coming to State-Foreign Operations 9 months ago, Tom has proven an invaluable member of our team. His oversight of the security and counternarcotics programs is outstanding. Thank you, Tom.  Instead of protecting the President, Harry, a detailee from the Secret Service, has assumed his temporary duties as an appropriator in a professional manner. His work on State Department accounts has been invaluable, particularly given the most recent expansion of the subcommittee's jurisdiction.  Finally, I certainly want to thank Paul Grove, staff director, for his many years of great service with me on this assignment and other assignments in the past. There are many other people without whose help we would literally have no bill to report at all. I thank Bob Putnam, Jack Conway and, of course, Keith Kennedy. They should know that our staff greatly appreciates their patience, guidance and, when required, good humor.  For words, the editorial and printing shop is top-notch. Richard Larson is a consummate professional, nothing less than a committee treasure. He has my thanks, as do Wayne Hosier, Doris Jackson, and Heather Crowell.
