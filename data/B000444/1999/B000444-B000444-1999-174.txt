 President, I know my colleagues are anxious to get to the business at hand. I assure the floor I will take only 5 minutes. If the clerk will let me know when I am headed towards 5 minutes, I would appreciate it.  I will refrain from responding and speaking to the Test Ban Treaty at length at this moment.  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is not only a colleague, but he is a personal friend. We have strong disagreements on this issue.  I don't mean to nickel and dime this, but we haven't had any hearings on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  At the outset, I send to the desk a list of all the hearings the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had for the 105th and 106th Congress's since submission of the CTBT.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Activities       January 8, 1999, Informal State Department Briefing on      Peacekeeping.
