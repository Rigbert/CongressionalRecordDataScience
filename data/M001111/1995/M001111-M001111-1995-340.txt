 President, I am pleased today to bring to the attention of my colleagues a thoughtful opinion piece by our colleague, the Senator from Maryland, which appeared in the Washington Post on Sunday, January 22. She presents a road map that I believe can help all Senators, on both sides of the aisle, as we develop our priorities in this new Congress. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski's column be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 1995                          Democrats, Get Real                        (By Barbara A. Mikulski)       Democrats need a new attitude and action plan to focus on      solving real problems. This attitude and plan must promote a      shared national vision to create good jobs and give help to      those who work hard, play by the rules and practice self-     help. We need to create a new state of mind that--as      Americans--we can solve our nation's problems together.       Democrats must stop being angst-addicted. We have too often      substituted agonizing for action, and it has paralyzed us. To      connect with middle-class Americans, we must think clearly      and act decisively. Democrats must focus on the day-to-day      needs of everyday Americans--their jobs, families and      opportunities. We also need to look at our country's long-     term needs. We need to generate jobs with pay worth the      effort and education. We need to create a national readiness      that is based on competence and character.       Democrats must focus on being politically effective, not      necessarily politically correct. We cannot use words from a      dated vocabulary. Political labels such as ``right,''      ``left,'' ``liberal'' and ``conservative'' have become      cliches. Labels and stereotypes that go with them have little      meaning.       Being politically effective means helping those who are      middle class stay there or do better. Being politically      effective means helping those who are not middle class get      there through hard work and practicing self-help. Worn-out      sound bites about the economy and crime weaken our      credibility and play into the hands of those who demonize our      ideas by blaming the victim, the government or both.       Democrats must figure out what works. We must be advocates      for people and not automatically defend every government      program. Let's look at the mission of these programs. When      they serve their mission and help people, great. When they      don't, let's get rid of them. We cannot be a rescue squad for      every line item. Often, the good intentions of good people      have gone astray. Tinker Toy reforms ultimately created other      problems.       One example is federal housing policy. We thought that if      we gave people housing, we would give them opportunity. Begun      during the New Deal, most federal housing programs were meant      to provide short-term shelter for people temporarily out of      work. But a series of complicated rules and boutique programs      has rewarded the wrong kind of behavior and made housing      projects Zip codes of pathology. Few residents can find work.      Crime and substance abuse are high.       Some blame the victim. Some identify with the victim. But      Democrat's addition to other people's misery does not solve      their problems or substitute for national policy. While we      must acknowledge the pain of the impoverished, we must also      require them to take charge of their own lives. We must find      ways to reward those who work or get into a program for self-     sufficiency.       We must ensure that welfare rules do not destroy the      family. Democrats should stand up for the family--and that      includes men. We need to end the ``get the man out of the      house'' rule, which has pushed men out of the house so a      family can qualify for public benefits. Shortsighted      intentions have created rules that dismantle families,      emasculate men and deny their children a full-time father.      Being a dad is more than writing a child-support check.       We've heard a lot about angry voters. Actually, I think      voters' anger stems from bewilderment and disillusionment.      This bewilderment and disillusionment is based on the fact      that their personal experience does not reflect what      statistics tell them. People are told that they are fortunate      to live in an economy of low unemployment, low inflation and      rapid growth. Yet, people are one downsizing away from      unemployment, their friends have been laid off, and their      standard of living continues to decline. At the same time,      people feel less secure in their homes, neighborhoods and      workplaces Children are killing children with guns carried      around in school backpacks.       America's future deserves more thought and effort than      partisan bidding wars over tax cuts. It deserves more than      the pursuit of ``faddish'' ideas floated by think tanks.      Americans deserve real solutions to the complex problems of      an increasingly complex world.       Democrats must join together to create this new attitude,      both within the Democratic Party and within the country--to      reward hard work, family stability and playing by the rules.      Together, we can begin to address the very valid concerns      Americans have about their futures, the futures of their      families and the future of their country.                               ____________________
