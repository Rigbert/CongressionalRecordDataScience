President, the last point I would like to make is that included in the bill that came before us is not only an opportunity to change some of the circumstances that might have saved lives in Newtown but also to address some underlying issues of gun violence that is not resulting in a mass killing but the killing on a day-to-day basis of innocent people.  A measure I have joined Senator Leahy, Senator Kirk, and Senator Collins in introducing relates to straw purchases.
