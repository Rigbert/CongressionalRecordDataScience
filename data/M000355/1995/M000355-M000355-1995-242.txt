 President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague. This amendment targets the Appalachian Regional Commission [ARC] for an unfair and disproportionate burden of budget cuts. I have worked with the officials of ARC to pare back the budget and duties of the ARC. The approach we have crafted is balanced, fair, and meets the new budget parameters while continuing to provide essential assistance to the people of Appalachia.  I want to assure my colleagues that the ARC budget proposal does not preserve the status quo. The funding level for the fiscal year 1996 budget of $182 million is $100 million less than what was appropriated in 1995. This represents a 35-percent cut in overall funding.  It has been a mere 2 months since the Senate approved my amendment to reform the ARC. My amendment outlined a blueprint to reform the ARC and set it on a glide path of reduced spending that falls within the guidelines of a balanced budget by the year 2002. I would like to remind my colleagues that this amendment, which passed the Senate, established the fiscal year 1996 funding levels contained in this bill.  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of that vote be included in the Record at the end of my statement.
