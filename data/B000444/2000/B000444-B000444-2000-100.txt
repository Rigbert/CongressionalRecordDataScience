 President, following the recent G-8 meeting in Okinawa and as we move closer to a vote on Permanent Normal Trading Relations with China, I want to briefly remind my colleagues of the importance of having a regional strategy for Asia.  There is a tendency to look at the Korean situation, the relationship between Taiwan and China, our presence in Japan, our presence in Guam, the situation in Indonesia, and so on as independent problems. Or, to just react to one situation at a time, with no overall understanding of how important the regional links and interests that exist are in shaping the outcome of our actions.  If we want to play a role in creating more stable allies in South Korea and Japan, and in ensuring that an ever-changing China is also a non-threatening China, then we must recognize that any action we take in one part of the region will have an impact on perceptions and reality throughout the region.  I do not intend to give a lengthy speech on this right now, instead I just want to draw my colleagues attention to an excellent letter that I received from General Jones, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. He wrote to discuss just this need for a regional and a long-term perspective as we evaluate our presence in Okinawa.  I agree with him that we cannot shape events in the Asia-Pacific region if we are not physically present.  So, as we engage in debate over what the proper placement and numbers for that presence are, I urge my colleagues to approach that debate and the debate on China's trade status with an awareness of the interests of the regional powers and an awareness of our national security interests both today and in the future.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from General Jones be printed in the Record following this statement.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 21, 2000.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Ranking, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden, As the G-8 Summit approaches, the eyes      of the world have turned to the Pacific island of Okinawa.      Opponents of U.S. military presence there may seize the      opportunity to promote their cause. I am well acquainted with      the island, having visited it frequently, and wish to convey      to you my sincere belief in its absolute importance to the      long-term security of our nation.       Okinawa is strategically located. The American military      personnel and assets maintained there are key to preservation      of the stability of the Asia-Pacific region and to      fulfillment of the U.S.-Japan bilateral security treaty.      Okinawa's central location between the East China Sea and      Pacific Ocean, astride major trade routes, and close to areas      of vital economic, political, and military interest make it      an ideal forward base. From it, U.S. forces can favorably      shape the environment and respond, when necessary, to      contingencies spanning the entire operational continuum--from      disaster relief, to peacekeeping, to war--in a matter of      hours, vice days or weeks.       We have long endeavored to minimize the impact of our      presence. Working hand in hand with our Okinawan hosts and      neighbors, we have made significant progress. In 1996, an      agreement was reached for the substantial reduction,      consolidation, and realignment of U.S. military bases in      Okinawa. Movement toward full implementation of the actions      mandated by the Special Action Committee on Okinawa Final      Report continues and the commitment to reduce the impact of      our presence is unabated.       Recent instances of misconduct by a few American service      members have galvanized long simmering opposition to our      presence. While those incidents are deplorable, they are      fortunately uncommon and do not reflect the full nature of      our presence.       Often lost in discussions of our presence on Okinawa, are      the positive aspects of that presence. We are good neighbors:      our personnel are actively involved in an impressive variety      of community service work, we are the island's second largest      employer of civilians, we infuse over $1.4 billion dollars      into the local economy annually, and most importantly, we are      sincerely grateful for the important contributions to      attainment of our mission made by the people of Okinawa. We      are mindful of our obligation to them.       It is worth remembering that U.S. presence in Okinawa came      at great cost. Battle raged on the island for three months in      the waning days of World War II and was finally won through      the valor, resolve, and sacrifice by what is now known as our      greatest generation. Our losses were heavy: twelve thousand      killed and thirty-five thousand wounded. Casualties for the      Japanese and for Okinawan civilians were even greater. The      price for Okinawa was indeed high. Its capture in 1945,      however, contributed to the quick resolution of the Pacific      War and our presence there in the following half a century      has immeasurably contributed to the protection of U.S.,      Japanese, and regional interests.       As you well know, challenges to military basing and      training are now routine and suitable alternatives to      existing sites are sorely limited. Okinawa, in fact, is      invaluable. We fully understand the legitimate concerns of      the Okinawan people and we will continue to work closely with      them to forge mutually satisfactory solutions to the issues      that we face. We are now, and will continue to be, good      neighbors and custodians for peace in the region.           Very Respectfully,                                                   James L. Jones,     General, Commandant of the Marine Corps.                          ____________________
