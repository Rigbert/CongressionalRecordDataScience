 KERREY. Yes, it would be my pleasure. The State of Nebraska requires $2,432,000 for road improvements to provide access to the Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge near Fort Calhoun, Nebraska. Currently, the road that leads to Boyer Chute through Washington County is unpaved. This road is an important thoroughfare and is the most direct route to Boyer Chute. Boyer Chute has become an increasingly popular recreation area and tourist destination. Traffic on the current road has increased and will continue to increase as the National Wildlife continues its expansion next year. Paving the road will greatly improve access to this national treasure--and will be of great benefit to Nebraskans.
