President, I am pleased to join my friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, in introducing tax legislation designed to stimulate the apple industry in the United States. I am pleased that Senators D'Amato and Moynihan are joining me as original cosponsors of the bill.  Our bill revises the Federal excise tax on fermented apple cider, more commonly known as draft cider, to beer tax rates. As one of the senior members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I believe this small tax change will be of great benefit to cider makers and apple growers across the country.  Draft cider is one of the oldest categories of alcoholic beverages in North America. Back in colonial times, nearly every innkeeper served draft cider tohis or her patrons during the long winter. In fact, through the 19th Century, beer and draft cider sold equally in the United States.  Recently, draft cider has made a comeback in the United States and around the world. Our tax law, however, unfairly taxes draft cider at a much higher rate than beer despite the two beverages sharing the same alcohol level and consumer market. This tax treatment, I believe, creates an artificial barrier to the growth of draft cider. Our legislation will correct this inequity.  Present law taxes fermented cider, regardless of its alcohol level, as a wine at a rate of $1.07 per gallon. Our bill would clarify that draft cider containing not more than 7 percent alcohol and marketed in various size containers would be taxed at the beer rate of 22.6 cents per gallon. I believe this tax change would allow draft cider producers to compete fairly with comparable beverage makers. As draft cider grows in popularity, apple growers around the nation should prosper because draft cider is made from culled apples, the least marketable apples.  The growth of draft cider should convert these least marketable apples, which account for about 20 percent of the entire U.S. apple production, into a high value product, helping our struggling apple growers. Indeed, I have received letters from officials at state agriculture departments from across the nation--Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia--supporting the taxing of draft cider at the beer rate because this change would allow apple farmers in their States to reap the benefits of an expanded culled apple market.  I have also heard from the Northeast McIntosh Apple Growers Association, the New York Apple Association, the New England Apple Council and many apple farmers, processors and cider producers that support revising the excise tax on draft cider.  This bill is identical to legislation I introduced with Senators Jeffords, D'Amato and Moynihan in the last Congress. That bill passed the Senate as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, H. R. 3448, but was not included in the conference report on H.R. 3448. I am hopeful that with the leadership of Senators Jeffords, D'Amato and Moynihan, we can enact into law this small tax change that will have a large positive impact on the Nation's apple industry.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
