 President, as I indicated earlier today, the Senate passed the tax relief extension conference report. Chairman Grassley of course did an extraordinary job. He has the gratitude of all of us for his important role in advancing this extremely significant measure, which guarantees the continued robust economy we are enjoying.  Tomorrow we will be in a period of morning business. However, no votes will occur tomorrow. Moments ago we reached an agreement for a vote on Tuesday morning that will be on the Smith circuit court nomination. We will return to the immigration bill on Monday, and we are hoping to have other votes stacked on Tuesday morning in relation to immigration amendments. The votes on Tuesday morning will be the next set of rollcall votes.  Let me further underscore that it would be important for Members who have amendments to the immigration bill to get over here Monday, lay down and debate those amendments. We have a kind of gentlemen's agreement between the two parties here in the Senate that we are going to process a lot of amendments before completing that bill. The occupant of the chair, for example, has been deeply involved in this issue and has been very understanding of the needs of Members on this side who believe that amendments should be processed in the regular order before final passage on a bill of this magnitude. I know there is a demand for amendments on the other side.  The way to accommodate all Senators, obviously, is for Senators to come over here and offer their amendments, not delay; to be willing to accept rather short time agreements so that patience prevails around here and we are able to accommodate the important amendments Senators desire to offer on both sides of the aisle.                          ____________________[Page S4505]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
