  Mr. President, I myself find this a sad day. In a sense, it is a watershed debate, and I very much fear it is the first major legislative thrust to set this Nation back 30 years with respect to freedom of choice.  I am going to speak about what freedom of choice really means. Essentially, to me it means that Government will not become involved in these most intimate decisions that a woman has to make, not become involved in legislating a woman's reproductive system, what she must do, when she must do it, and how she must do it, but that government will essentially leave those intimate decisions to the physician, to a woman, to her faith, and to medicine. And here we have the Congress of the United States essentially saying that every woman in this country who may find out in her third trimester that she has a horribly, severely deformed child with anomalies incompatible with life, and if that child can be born, even if it is a major threat to her health, she must deliver that child.  Unfortunately, no Member of this body is going to be present, no Member of this body is going to hold that mother's hand and tell her that it is OK if she jeopardizes her health perhaps for the rest of her life. No Member of this Congress is going to be present in that delivery room and see a child who is incompatible with life, a baby that may not have a brain, a baby that may have a brain outside the head or other major physical anomalies. No Member of this Congress will be there to see that child delivered to live an hour, 6 hours, a day, 4 days and then die, and the woman's health may be seriously, adversely harmed in a major way for the rest of her life. No one will be there. No one will say, ``I'm so sorry, I didn't know about you when I cast this vote.''  We are all accustomed to legislating, and when we legislate, we legislate for a majority, not for the exception. We legislate with some knowledge, or should, of what we are doing. But I think in this case, it is a very skewed knowledge. It is based on a case that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania put forward of a young woman who I believe could have and would have been born in any event and saying that this one case typifies all mothers that we are talking about. In fact, it doesn't.  I must express my profound dismay. My father was chief of surgery at the University of California Medical Center. My husband, Bert Feinstein, was a distinguished neurosurgeon. And all my life, I have lived in a medical family. As I read the AMA's letter, essentially what they are doing is providing some protection for doctors, but they are doing nothing to see that a woman's health is protected, and I feel very badly about that. Both my husband and my father were members of the American Medical Association.  I take some heart in letters from the California Medical Association which indicate their opposition to this legislation and clearly state that they believe the amended legislation before us today falls very short of the mark. They indicate their strong opposition to this bill. I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record two letters I received from the California Medical Association.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               California Medical Association,                                  San Francisco, CA, May 20, 1997.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We have reviewed the amendments to      HR 1122 and believe that they make no substantive changes to      the legislation. While the debate over late-term abortion is      painful, both within the medical community and the general      citizenry, we believe these decisions must be left to      physicians and patients . . . acting together.       While late-term abortions may have occurred inappropriately      in some instances, they have also saved women's lives and the      health and well-being of many American families. In a society      where values are assaulted on every side . . . the bond      between healer and patient is ever more important. Passages      of HR 1122 would be one more step in eroding that      relationship. The California Medical Association is opposed      to this bill and is saddened the debate appeals to the      emotive, rather than the reasoning, segment of America.           Sincerely,                                             Roland C. Lowe, M.D.,     President.                                  ____                               California Medical Association,                                  San Francisco, CA, May 14, 1997.     Re opposition to H.R. 1122.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The California Medical Association      is writing to express its strong opposition to Congressional      intrusion into the physician-patient relationship, as      exemplified by the above-referenced bill, which would ban      ``partial-birth abortions.'' We believe that it is wholly      inappropriate for a legislature to make decisions which      prevent physicians from providing appropriate medical care to      their patients. Physicians must be allowed to exercise their      professional judgment when determining which treatment or      procedure will best serve their patients' medical needs.       The obstetricians and gynecologists have already eloquently      expressed the medical justifications for this procedure in      rare but very real circumstances. CMA certainly does not      advocate the performance of elective abortions in the last      stage of pregnancy. However, when serious fetal anomalies are      discovered late in a pregnancy, or the pregnant woman      develops a life-threatening medical condition that is      inconsistent with continuation of the pregnancy, abortion--     however heart-wrenching--may be medically necessary.       CMA respects the concern that performing this type of      abortion procedure late in a pregnancy is a very serious      matter. However, political concerns and religious beliefs      should not be permitted to take precedence over the health      and safety of patients. CMA opposes any legislation, state or      federal, that denies a pregnant woman and her physician the      ability to make medically appropriate decisions about the      course of her medical care. The determination of the medical      need for, and effectiveness of, particular medical procedures      must be left to the medical profession, to be reflected in      the standard of care. It would set a very undesirable      precedent if Congress were by legislative fiat to decide such      matters. The legislative process is ill-suited to evaluate      complex medical procedures whose importance may vary with a      particular patient's case and with the state of scientific      knowledge.       CMA urges you to defeat this bill. Many of the patients who      would seek the procedure are already in great personal      turmoil. Their physical and emotional trauma should not be      compounded by an oppressive law that is devoid of scientific      justification.           Sincerely,                                                  Rolland C. Lowe,                                                        President.
