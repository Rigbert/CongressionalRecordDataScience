President, I have the privilege of being a lifelong Vermonter, as were my parents and my brother and sister. All Vermonters realize that in a small State like ours, it takes the dedication and hard work of very special and talented people to make our State great.  I will take a moment as a proud brother to mention one such person, my younger sister, Mary Leahy. Mary's work with adult basic education and teaching and her ability to give adults who have not had the capability to read a newfound ability is profound. It is impossible to calculate the number of lives she has dramatically improved in our State through her work. I still carry the memory of watching a grandfather with tears in his eyes, as he read a simple child's book to his grandchild. He then told me that he had never been able to read to his child, the grandchild's parent, but at least in his later years he could read to the grandchild. I thought what a gift. I thought again of Mary as I read an article printed in a number of our media in Vermont, written by Nancy Graff, about this part of Mary's career. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From VTDigger.org, Dec. 28, 2014]      In This State: For Mary Leahy, Literacy Goes Beyond Reading                            (By Nancy Graff)       Several miles up a dirt road in Marshfield, Mary Leahy's      driveway swings up a modest rise on the right. In the wake of      a recent snowstorm, ice, clumps of snow, ruts, and shattered      branches have created endless road stubble. Traffic is      infrequent. Leahy hasn't seen Camel's Hump, a breathtaking      view normally framed by her house's large west-facing      windows, for almost a week due to stubborn low-hanging      clouds. No other structure or human being intrudes.       In this isolated spot, Leahy has spent 20 years thinking      through what it means to be literate. She believes it all      comes down to creating communities that welcome everyone.       Two years ago Leahy, a Montpelier native, retired from      Central Vermont Adult Basic Education after 34 years as co-     director and four years before that as a field tutor.      Throughout her tenure, she says in her soft voice, she worked      to make adult literacy programs ``as inclusive as any other      form of education, so that everyone could become part of the      cultural community.''       Leahy is sitting in her living room, her telltale shock of      white hair the same color as the walls inside and the snow      piled outside. She can tell hundreds of stories about people      she has encountered over the past decades. One woman holds a      special place in the evolution of her thinking. According to      Leahy, when this woman came to be tutored in reading, Leahy      asked her why she felt the need to learn now, long after she      had left school. She replied that she had a big maple tree in      her front yard, and a dream that one day when she finished      her chores, she would take a book and sit under that tree and      read it.       ``That became the beacon for the rest of my work,'' Leahy      says.       One book in particular provided more inspiration. A middle-     aged man under Mary's tutelage asked if they could read      ``Black Beauty'' together. ``'Why that book?''' she remembers      asking. He had shown no interest in horses. He explained that      ``Black Beauty'' had been popular when he was in school, but      he could never join in the discussions about it because he      couldn't read. He wanted to know how it ends.       ``I think `Black Beauty' was the most formative book I read      as a child. It taught me about being compassionate. I read it      over and over and over,'' she says.       And then there was a favorite nun at Leahy's college, St.      Catherine University, in Minneapolis. She taught Leahy that      ``work has to serve the world.''       After graduating and returning to Vermont, Leahy briefly      tried her hand at farming before she started working in      literacy.       ``Literacy took up my imagination,'' Leahy says. ``It took      up my heart, and I could see the changes in people's lives.''       Among the mementos from her father's shop that Mary Leahy      keeps in her house is the letterpress type that once printed      the ``ICE'' cards that people would put in their front      windows when they wanted the iceman to make a delivery.      Beautifully rendered in wood to begin with, the letter faces      are as smooth as glass after decades of use. Beside them is a      well-used brass can that contained solvent to clean the type.       Soon, however, she began to see that being able to identify      a letter, being able to associate that letter with a sound,      stringing letters into words, and understanding the meaning      of the words were not enough. She recalls men at a local      electric company who were afraid to requisition a part to fix      a machine they could run with their eyes closed because they      were unable to fill out the form needed to get the part. They      learned the fundamentals of reading for their jobs, but until      they could engage with ideas they remained outliers in the      world's cultural community.       ``They needed to be included,'' Leahy says. And that meant      being able to help their children with schoolwork, being able      to articulate their ideas and opinions, being able to teach      themselves to learn.       Bringing the newly literate into the life of their families      and home communities, into the community of ideas that      explore our humanity and world, became Leahy's goal.       These days CVABE serves approximately 600 clients, down      from a high of 800 a few years ago. Leahy is quick to praise      the people with whom she has worked over the years and other      organizations that have made literacy work possible,      especially the Vermont Council on the Humanities, with its      emphasis on teaching reading not just as a vital skill but as      a revelation of the human condition.       Each student presents unique challenges. Some are well-     educated immigrants who need to learn English to work in      their field. Some have learning disabilities that weren't      addressed. Others have lived in such chaotic situations that      school wasn't a priority. Still others have come from such      poverty that illiteracy was a legacy passed from generations.       When she began working for CVABE, the organization stressed      one-on-one in-home tutoring. ABE itself was a feature of the      war on poverty that was an extension of the Department of      Education. Leahy's job was to develop tutoring programs by      recruiting students and volunteers. To find students, she      went door to door asking if anyone needed literacy      assistance.       Being illiterate is not something people want to admit, she      says. ``There's a chronic fear of being found out that you      can't do what everyone else can. You think you're alone in      not being able to do this.''       And so she met them wherever they felt comfortable. She      tutored in homes, in restaurants, in libraries, sometimes in      her car.       Eventually, the Department of Education pushed the ABE      program to move toward a more center-based structure. So      Leahy oversaw that change, as well as many others, including      gaining independence, forming a board, fundraising, starting      an alternative high school program for teens, and very      important, from her perspective, hosting reading and      discussion programs. In 1989 she helped organize the first      statewide conference for Vermont's newly literate, ABE     students who had once believed their opinions did not matter.       Leahy learned early in life what it means to be part of a      community. Her father, a printer, had a shop near the      Statehouse, and like her brothers (one of whom is Vermont's      U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy), she regularly delivered printing      jobs to the capitol. In the process she learned about      government and politics and the obligations of citizenship.      She learned about history and immigrant communities through      their Irish and Italian ancestors, including one grandmother      who was illiterate. These interests have carried over into      her current volunteer work for the Friends of the Vermont      State House, the Vermont Historical Society, and the      Marshfield Historical Society. She wants everyone to have      full access to communities like these that will enrich their      lives.       According to Leahy, her students were a joy to teach      because they were so motivated. With her eyes tearing up she      tells the story of a man who wrote a letter to his first      grandchild. ``Things are going to be different than they were      for me and your mother,'' he wrote. ``Your mother would bring      papers home from school, and I'd keep my distance because I      didn't want her to know. But things will be different with      you and me.'' That change in one family's quality of life,      says Leahy, will resonate for generations. Another student      was 93 when he learned to read. He had vowed to learn to read      before he died.       These Vermonters and all the others whose lives Leahy has      touched in her life's work are no longer outliers.       ``We all belong to a very special group of people,'' she      says. ``We can read and write.''                          ____________________
