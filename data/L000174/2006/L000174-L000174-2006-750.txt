President, the PATRIOT Act reauthorization legislation that the Senate may vote on this week still has serious flaws and troubling omissions. I have spent several months working closely with Members from both parties in an attempt to improve these defects. Even after the Bush administration and congressional Republicans hijacked the House-Senate conference, I tried to get this measure back on the right track. Working with a bipartisan group of Senators, we were able to achieve some improvements. I regret that the final package is not better and that the intransigence of the administration has prevented a better bill with better protections for the American people.  I remain committed to working to provide the tools that we need to protect the American people. That includes working to provide the oversight and checks needed on the uses of Government power and to improve the current reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. I am therefore pleased to join Senator Specter, Senator Sununu, Senator Craig, Senator Feingold, and others in introducing a bill to improve the reauthorization legislation in several important respects.  Most importantly, the Specter-Leahy bill corrects one of the most egregious ``police state'' provisions regarding gag orders. The Bush-Cheney administration used the last round of discussions with Republican Senators to make the gag order provisions worse, in my view, by forbidding any court challenge for 1 year. There is no justification for this mandatory waiting period for judicial review, and our bill eliminates it. Our bill also eliminates provisions that allow the Government to ensure itself of victory by certifying that, in its view, disclosure ``may'' endanger national security or ``may'' interfere with diplomatic relations. These un-American restraints on meaningful judicial review are unfair, unjustified, and completely unacceptable.  I sought to make these changes to the gag orders provisions in an amendment I filed to Senator Sununu's bill, S. 227l, which modified the conference report in various respects. Senator Feingold filed other amendments aimed at bringing the conference report more in line with the bipartisan reauthorization bill that every Member of the Senate approved last year. Regrettably, the majority leader chose to prevent any effort to offer amendments to S. 227l and effectively stifled open debate.  In addition to fixing the gag order provisions, the Specter-Leahy bill adopts the Senate-passed standard for obtaining secret court orders under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Under this standard, the Government can obtain private, confidential records such as library and medical records only if there is some connection between those records and a suspected terrorist or spy. The Specter-Leahy bill also restores the pre-PATRIOT Act rule, adopted by the Senate, that notice of ``sneak and peek'' searches may be delayed for no more than 7 days unless extended. The conference report sets a 30-day rule for the initial delay, more than three times what the Senate, and pre-PATRIOT Act courts, deemed appropriate. Finally, the Specter-Leahy bill adds a 4 year sunset to the national security letter authorities created in the conference report. This sunset provision, like those included in the original PATRIOT Act at the insistence of myself and House Majority Leader Dick Armey, would facilitate oversight and ensure accountability for the use of these administrative subpoena authorities.  Reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act has been a more difficult and far more painful process than it should have been. Under the leadership of Chairman Specter, the Judiciary Committee managed in just a few weeks to produce a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate unanimously. The House-Senate conference took a different course and produced a bill that Members on both sides of the aisle found unacceptable. It has been improved, but critical problems remain. The Specter-Leahy bill corrects the worst of these problems, and I will work with the chairman to enact these commonsense reforms before the end of the year.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. DeMint, Ms.         Mikulski, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Hagel, Mr.         Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Talent, Mr. Allen, Mr.         Frist, Mr. Burns, Mr. Thune, Mr. Reid, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Kerry,         Mr. Bunning, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. Boxer):  S. 2370. A bill to promote the development of democratic institutions in areas under the administrative control of the Palestinian Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, along with my friend, the senior Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, I send to the desk the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 and ask that it be referred to the appropriate committee.  Senator Biden and I are joined in our efforts today by Senators DeMint, Mikulski, Martinez, Senator Nelson of Florida, Hagel, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, DeWine, Talent, Allen, Frist, Burns and Thune, all of whom are original cosponsors of this legislation. This is a bipartisan bill, and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their leadership on the important issue of how the United States addresses the challenges posed by the new Hamas-dominated government in the West Bank and Gaza.  The Palestinian elections of January 25 produced a majority of Hamas supporters in the Palestinian parliament. Perhaps the Palestinians were frustrated with the corruption of the ruling Fatah Party, or perhaps they were tired of the slow pace of reforms. Either way, the Palestinian people cast their ballots for an organization that supports terrorism and rejects Israel's very right to exist. That is antithetical to our security interests in the Middle East, and it should be unacceptable to this Senate.  In light of the recent election, Senator Biden and I are submitting this legislation for the Senate's consideration which we hope will send an unequivocal message to the Hamas leadership: renounce terror, recognize Israel and live up to the commitments made by the previous Palestinian government.  In short, this legislation urges the Palestinian people to take another step toward joining the community of peaceful nations and a step away from the ranks of terrorism.  Our bill would do the following: it would restrict assistance to the Palestinian Authority, PA, unless it is determined that no PA government ministry is controlled by terrorists, that the PA publicly acknowledges Israel's right to exist, that the PA has recommitted itself to all its prior agreements with Israel, that the PA has made progress toward dismantling terrorist infrastructure, and that the PA has instituted fiscal transparency. This bill would essentially deny visas to certain PA officials and restrict their travel to the United States. It also limits diplomatic interaction with Palestinian terrorist groups. Finally, this bill contains rigorous audit and oversight requirements to ensure compliance with its provisions.  Let me also tell you what this bill does not do. It does not cut off assistance to the Palestinian people with respect to food, water, medicine, sanitation and other basic human needs. Thus, humanitarian assistance that does not go through the Palestinian government will continue. Moreover, funding for democracy programs will also be continued. Both Senator Biden and I appreciate the need not to punish the Palestinian people for actions its future government may take. Our concern is with the new regime taking power and in giving them the proper incentives to embrace peace and to abandon the pro-terror stance they have taken up until now.  Democracy is about more than just elections, it is also about responsible, accountable governance. The Palestinian elections a few weeks back reflect this fact. International observers indicate that the Palestinian elections were essentially free and fair--which in and of itself is certainly a good thing.  I strongly support democratic elections. That said, any right-minded person deplores the result of those elections.  A key part of democratic governance is that elected officials are responsible for the actions they take. If Hamastakes power and persists in sponsoring terror, rejecting Israel's right to exist and refusing to accept prior commitments made to Israel, then they should be held accountable for their actions and for the foreign aid investments in the West Bank and Gaza paid for by American taxpayers. The PA's budget is supported in large part by foreign assistance, and Hamas has been put on notice by the United States and many in the donor community about the steps it must take in order to receive assistance in the future.  Along these same lines, I must say I am somewhat mystified at the recent diplomatic efforts undertaken by Russia. Russia broke from the Middle East Quartet and hosted representatives from Hamas in Moscow.  In so doing, the Russians granted Hamas a measure of international legitimacy Hamas had hitherto lacked, while the Russians appear to have received no meaningful concessions in return. I am afraid I fail to see the benefit in Russia's actions other than emboldening other nations to follow a similar course of dealing with a terrorist organization. I suspect the Russians would be less than elated if Israel hosted Chechen separatists in Jerusalem.  Foreign aid is not an entitlement. It is assistance from the American people to other nations, and it should be conducted in furtherance of U.S. interests and those of our allies. It is not to be given to organizations that actively work against those interests. Hamas, as it now stands, is just such an organization.  The ball is squarely in Hamas' court. It can either work for the good of its citizens as an accountable democratic government should, or it can continue to act as a revolutionary group to the profound detriment of its citizens.
