President, Sunday marked the 1-year anniversary of the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. One year ago, I was pleased to stand on a stage at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia with House Judiciary Committee chairman Lamar Smith, Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office David Kappos, Acting Commerce Secretary Rebecca Blank, and others. Together, we watched President Obama sign into law the most important changes to our Nation's patent laws in 60 years.  Many of the provisions of the legislation took effect on the 1-year anniversary, while other important changes, such as the shift to first-inventor-to-file, will take effect in 6 months. I commend the Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, for the work they have done, in a transparent manner, to prepare for the new procedures that take effect this week.  At its best, our patent system encourages exploration and invention, creating wealth, and providing jobs. Abraham Lincoln famously said that ``the patent system added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.'' But when patents are granted on unpatentable subject matter or on obvious creations already in use, they can be misused to stifle competition.  The new patent law will aid the PTO in separating the wheat from the chaff, weeding out low-quality patents that infect our system, and bolstering those patents that truly advance ``the progress of science and useful arts.''  While the changes made by the patent bill were sweeping, I am under no illusion that they solved all the problems that confront our patent system. The assertion of patents is too often still used by patent trolls to extract payment even where there is not infringement of a valid patent because the cost of litigation makes settlement more expedient, and the ``tech patent wars'' among the large mobile phone companies show the perils to competition that can come when companies do not reach business-to-business resolutions of their patent disputes. But the improvements made by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act will go a long way to making the system work better for inventors and implementers.  Enactment of the patent bill was more than a victory for American inventors, large and small; it was a demonstration that Congress can still work in a bipartisan, bicameral matter. I stood proudly on the stage 1 year ago with a Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, watching the President sign a law on which Chairman Smith and I had worked closely together for 6 years.  The legislative success of the patent bill shows what we can achieve when we put aside rhetoric and, instead, negotiate and collaborate in good faith. We held countless bipartisan, bicameral meetings, briefings, and discussions with all interested parties. We worked closely with Director Kappos, then-Secretary of Commerce Locke, and Members of Democratic and Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.  In short, the process that took the patent bill from the Congress to the President for his signature was one of which we can all be proud. In an increasingly partisan Congress, I was pleased to have the opportunity to lead a legislative process that was, from start to finish, both bipartisan and bicameral.                          ____________________
