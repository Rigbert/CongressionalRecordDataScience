 President, reserving the right to object, and I will object, I will point out that the Defense appropriations bill was reported out of the Appropriations Committee today with only three members voting against it. There was a lot of discussion about the Democratic leader saying ``We are not going to pass the bill,'' but when the votes were counted, only three members--all on the Democratic side but only three--voted against reporting the bill out of committee.  My good friend the Democratic leader and I have had this discussion back and forth, but one of the advantages of being in the majority is that we set the schedule, and we are going to do the Defense appropriations bill after we do the Defense authorization bill; therefore, I object.
