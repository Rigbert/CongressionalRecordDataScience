James A. Strayer on his retirement from his position as the Business Manager for the Northwest Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council. Jim, a member of Ironworkers #395 for many years, has dedicated his life to the interests of his fellow tradesman and the entire community in Northwest Indiana. For his lifetime of service to the Ironworkers and the Building Trades Council, Jim will be honored at a retirement dinner taking place at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana, on August 1, 2008.   Jim Strayer has been a member of the Ironworkers #395 for the past 39 years. During that time, he has held numerous positions. After six years as an Ironworker, Jim became an Apprentice Instructor, a position that allowed him the opportunity to pass on his immense knowledge to some of his younger counterparts. For five years, he fulfilled his duties in this capacity with the determination and enthusiasm that would foreshadow what was to come in Jim's career. As his commitment to leading his union remained, Jim would later be named Business Agent for Ironworkers #395. From there, Jim went on to become the President of the Northwest Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council in 1990. After six successful years in this capacity, Jim was named Business Manager for the Building Trades, the position he has excelled at for the past twelve years.   Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. For many years, Jim Strayer has displayed this unwavering dedication to the members of the Building Trades, and his numerous positions have allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of countless individuals. Not only has Jim served his local tradesman, but through his work with the Building Trades, he has been a remarkable example of just how much good an organization can do for a community. When it comes to serving those in need throughout the community, the Building Trades has long been one of Northwest Indiana's most generous organizations, as well as one of its greatest assets.   Although Jim has served the Building Trades and his community with complete dedication, it is his commitment to his family that is most impressive. Jim and his devoted wife, Pat, have two sons, Doug and Andy, and one daughter, Rebecca.   Madam Speaker, James Strayer has given his time and efforts selflessly to the tradesmen he has worked with and represented, as well as to the people of Northwest Indiana through the many charitable efforts of the Building Trades Council. He has been a true role model to his peers and a true friend to Northwest Indiana. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Jim for his outstanding contributions and in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
