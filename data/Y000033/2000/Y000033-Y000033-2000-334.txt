Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the time.  I want to end this 2 days on a good note. You will find out whether it is impossible or not, a good note in the sense that let us not get fighting amongst one another on this bill. If my colleagues do not believe in the merits, vote ``no.'' If my colleagues believe in the merits, vote ``yes.''  I told the gentleman yesterday when this amendment was adopted and I voted against the amendment, I would not attempt to strip it, and I did not do so. I cannot control what is offered inrecommittal. It may be protecting their back side or my back side, but that is the process.  Mr. Speaker, I believe in this House and in this process which we follow. I ask my colleagues respectfully to understand each person's belief in what he stands for and vote our consciences. That is all I ask of my colleagues. That is fair, that is the way of this House of the people. That is what is right. That is what we must do.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
