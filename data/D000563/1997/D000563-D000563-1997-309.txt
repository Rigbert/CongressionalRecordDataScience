President, I rise today to call to the attention of my colleagues a creative and talented journalist from my State--Ellen Warren. I am pleased to announce that Ellen will be inducted into the Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame on April 18.  Chicago, as many of my colleagues know, has a reputation earned over many years as a place where the news business is taken seriously, by practitioners and consumers alike. By elected officials too, I might add.  From the perceptive observations of Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley through the ``Front Page'' days of Ben Hecht to the latter day insights of Mike Royko, Chicago journalism has been of the highest quality--aggressive, competitive, and literary all at the same time.  This year, the name of Ellen Warren of the Chicago Tribune will be among those added to the honor roll of journalists who have, over the course of a career, produced the highest quality work in one of the toughest news markets in the country.  Ellen began her career in 1969 at the City News Bureau of Chicago, a legendary training ground for reporters. At the Chicago Daily News, she was a foreign correspondent as well as the first woman ever permanently assigned to the City Hall beat. At the Chicago Sun-Times, she covered, at various times, Congress, the Supreme Court, and the Carter White House. For Knight-Ridder newspapers, she covered the Bush White House. Since 1993, she has been based in Chicago and has carried out numerous assignments for the Tribune, including that of columnist and political writer.  Ellen Warren has gone about her job with flair, honesty, and dedication. I happen to know that she also is a hall of fame-level wife and mother. For all of her accomplishments, I wish to add my congratulations to Ellen Warren on this occasion of her induction into the Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame.                          ____________________
