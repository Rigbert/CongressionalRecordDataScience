Chairman, we had the opportunity to see a tape from a consultant to a Republican meeting. The consultant said ``Use soothing words for your radical change. Tell them you are saving Medicare. Tell them you are giving them choices. Express moderation in your radicalism and swear that the $270 billion cut in Medicare has nothing to do with the $245 billion cut in taxes,'' and hope that the public is lulled into apathy.  So we hear on this floor talk by our Republican colleagues of preserving and reforming a health care system that 93 percent of them opposed in 1965. Beware, the wolf in sheep's clothing. Beware those who want to save that which they eschew. Beware those who want to come from the majority party in Washington and help you.  Mr. Chairman, if we pass this bill today, before too long Medicare for millions and millions of Americans will become Medigone. Oppose this Republican medical killing proposal.
