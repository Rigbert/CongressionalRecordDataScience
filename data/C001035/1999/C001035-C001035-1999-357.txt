President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate Maine's Community Alliance to End Violence Against Children. The Alliance, which includes the Maine State Police, Catholic Charities Maine, and the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, will improve and expand the coordination of services for preventing and reducing the negative impact that exposure to violence has on young children. As my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire is aware, rural regions have unique problems coordinating and delivering services to children exposed to violence.
