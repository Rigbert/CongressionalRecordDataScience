Mr. Speaker, the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000, which I have introduced with several of my Colleagues, amends the Pittman-Robertson Act and the Dingell Johnson Act regarding the use of funds to administer those Acts. This bill will maintain the integrity of the two Acts by ensuring that funds used for ``true administration'' will be used responsibly and that funds not used for ``true administration'' will pass to the States for restoration projects that benefit fish and wildlife as required under the law. it will ensure that the millions of excise tax dollars from guns, ammo, archery equipment, and fishing equipment paid by sportsmen and sportswomen will go to the States for wildlife and sport fish restoration projects.  During three Congressional oversight hearings in 1999, the House Committee on Resources uncovered numerous spending improprieties involving wildlife and sport fish administrative funds by the Fish and Wildlife Service's Division of Federal Aid. As much as one-half of the ``administration'' money may have been improperly used. This was the first time since Pittman-Robertson was passed in 1937, and since Dingell-Johnson was passed in 1950, that the administration of these Acts has been examined by Congress. Officials testifying from the non-partisan General Accounting Office were critical of the management of administrative funds by the Division of Federal Aid, stating that ``the combined experience of the audit team that did this work represents about 160 years worth of audit experience. To our knowledge, this is, if not the worst, one of the worst managed programs we have encountered.''  The trust has been broken between the sportsmen and sportswomen who fund the Acts through excise taxes and the Fish and Wildlife Service who were responsible for administering the Acts. At each of these hearings we learned that administrative funds were used for expenses unrelated to the administration of the Acts. We learned that administrative funds that were used for administration of the Acts were not used responsibly. We learned that if the administration of these Acts is not properly implemented, the State wildlife and sport fish restoration suffers.  Some internal changes have already been made by the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Division of Federal Aid to address the abuses of administrative funds and we are encouraged that steps are being taken toward fixing the problems. But these are only steps, they are not permanent. Legislation is needed to clearly explain how administrative funds can and cannot be spent. In addition to taking initiative to make changes in the Division of Federal Aid, I am pleased that the Administration has been involved in working with us on this bill. The millions of dollars sportsmen and sportswomen have paid in excise taxes have to be protected. This bill offers them that much needed protection. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this measure and I intend on taking deliberate action to move this bill in my committee in March.                          ____________________
