  Madam President, I note that 12 o'clock has arrived. We will have a vote on the Feinstein-Alexander amendment No. 2460. I will take a brief moment to describe it.  This is an amendment cosponsored by Senators Alexander, Levin, Schumer, Cochran, Bennett, Warner, and I ask unanimous consent to add the name of Senator Boxer.
