Speaker, as Speaker Boehner has said, later today Members and staff from both parties will come together to remember the tragic shooting that occurred 15 years ago in this Capitol when a lone gunman tried to enter the building through what we now know as the Memorial Door. U.S. Capitol Police Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut--Gibson from Virginia and Chestnut from Maryland--courageously placed themselves between the gunman and not only all of us who serve here but all of us who visit here.  They gave their lives, Mr. Speaker, to protect this institution that is the foundation of our democracy. They died protecting the many people who come here each day to serve our country, to see their government in action, and put so much of themselves into making America better and stronger and safer for us all.  On this day--and every day--let us remember the heroic sacrifice of Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut and let us appreciate the dedicated and often unsung service of the United States Capitol Police personnel, who stand watch every hour over our safety, our lives, and our ability to perform our duties without fear of violence.  May God bless their families and keep us safe.                          ____________________
