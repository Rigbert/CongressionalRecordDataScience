 And we have no way, as people allocating this money, to know where it went, how it was spent, whether it is on paperwork or bureaucracy or administration. We will not have any way to show that it makes a difference in our kids' classrooms, whether it increases test grade scores--which is a goal for everyone--and we will not know whether this is going to make a difference in a child's learning.  When we put these teachers in the classrooms, we can follow those kids in those classrooms, and we will know for sure, as the years go by, that these dollars make a difference. We will be able to look at those kids, and we will know.
