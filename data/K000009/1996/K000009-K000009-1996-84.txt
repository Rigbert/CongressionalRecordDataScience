Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a Toledo institution which has been serving women and their families for 75 years. The Beach House has worked to meet the needs of our city's homeless women, children, and entire families.  Our Nation's lack of affordable housing is a crucial problem and a principal reason why women often find themselves and their families without shelter. Beach House provides emergency shelter for 30 days in a clean and safe environment with 24-hour supervision 365 days a year. An on-staff licensed social worker helps clients to establish a plan of action, which includes finding housing and making referrals to other agencies for needed assistance.  Beach House opened its doors in May, 1921, under the guiding hand of Mrs. Helen Beach Jones, the wife of Toledo's Mayor ``Golden Rule'' Jones. Mrs. Jones worked with several women's organizations to establish the shelter, and named it Beach House in honor of her mother Harriet Beach. In 1982, the shelter expanded its clientele to include fathers and husbands in order to keep homeless families intact.  The Women's Protective Association has governed and managed the shelter from its inception. In 1941, Beach House moved to its present location, and in 1963, it received a charter as a nonprofit organization. A recent complete remodeling of the shelter has made it accessible to disabled persons.  Beach House also operates a transitional shelter project called Steinquest House that allows qualifying women and families to continue supportive services for up to 24 months.  Mr. Speaker, at 75, Beach House is a wonderful example of a community helping its own. It has seen good times and bad times. It has seen depression and war, and throughout its years Beach House has served the women of Toledo and their families with steadfastness and with compassion. I commend Beach House to my colleagues. We know it will be there whenever there is need.                 TRIBUTE TO JESSICA AND BRUCE POMERANTZ                                 ______                       HON. ROBERT G. TORRICELLI                             of new jersey                    in the house of representatives                         Thursday, May 30, 1996
