 President, it is my pleasure today to pay tribute to Sarah Nicholson, a great Kentuckian who recently retired from a nearly four-decade career with the Kentucky Hospital Association, KHA. Serving as the vice president of government relations for the statewide professional trade association representing hospitals throughout the Commonwealth, Sarah earned a strong reputation for her legislative acumen and her tireless advocacy.  As the leader of the association's public affairs operations, Sarah has worked with members of the Kentucky General Assembly and the executive branch for the advancement of our State's hospitals. She was also tasked with supporting beneficial legislation at the Federal level. As my staff and I have worked with the KHA through the years, Sarah was an effective advocate for its priorities.  In addition to her diligent work for the KHA, Sarah is passionate about bettering educational opportunities around Kentucky. At her alma mater, Western Kentucky University, she served on its board of advisers, its college of health and human services advisory board, and its alumni board. Sarah was also a representative on the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education Inter-Alumni Council and the Centre College Parents Advisory Committee.  As Sarah begins the next chapter of her life, I am confident that she is looking forward to spending more quality time with her family, especially her husband, retired Jefferson County District Judge James C. Nicholson, and their three children. I hope she enjoys every well-deserved time with them. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Sarah Nicholson on her retirement and thanking her for her work on behalf of Kentucky.                          ____________________
