 This amendment would go a long way in restoring integrity into our system of public assistance.  Madam President, I trust there is not one Senator in this Chamber who would stand here and argue that taxpayers should be forced to subsidize the drug habits of other individuals. Yet, if the Federal Government continues to send cash payments to individuals using drugs, that is exactly what is happening. Not only is that directly contrary to the intent of the AFDC program, and others, and a complete waste of the taxpayers' money, but it is also very harmful to the parents using drugs and the children living in that environment.  Subsidizing the parents' drug habits will, in the end, destroy their chances for ever becoming self-sufficient. They will remain trapped on welfare longer and will require substantial rehabilitation.  However, Madam President, think of what we are doing to the children living in that environment. Giving cash to parents using drugs is one of the cruelest forms of Federal child abuse I can think of. By cutting off or limiting public assistance to those buying drugs, we are limiting their ability to buy the drugs. That will improve not only their lives, but the lives of their children.  Madam President, I believe the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Missouri will restore a great deal to our welfare system. I hope my colleagues will support it.  I yield the floor.
