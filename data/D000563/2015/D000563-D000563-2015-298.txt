President, it was 8 years ago that I first introduced the Fair Elections Now Act. Former Senator Arlen Specter, our late colleague and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was my lead cosponsor. We introduced the bill because we believed that America needs a system that rewards candidates with the best ideas and principles--not just the person who is the most talented in raising special interest money.  I noted that day that our democracy was in trouble because special interests and big-donor money were choking the system and preventing us from facing up to the big challenges of our time. Little did I know that almost a decade later, this problem would have grown much worse.  Through a series of recent cases--including the infamous Citizens United decision--the Supreme Court has allowed wealthy, well-connected campaign donors and special interests to unleash a deluge of cash in an effort to sway Federal, State, and local elections across our Nation. When it comes to understanding the influence of wealthy donors and special interests on Federal elections, the numbers speak for themselves.  In the 2012 election cycle, candidates for both the House and Senate raised the majority of their funds from large donations of $1,000 or more. Forty percent of all contributions to Senate candidates came from donors who maxed out at the $2,500 contribution limit, representing just 0.02 percent of the American population.  We saw this trend continue during the recent midterm elections. The 100 biggest donors gave a combined $323 million during the 2014 election cycle through official campaign contributions and donations to national party committees, PACs, Super PACs, and 527 organizations. In contrast to those 100 donors, an estimated 4.75 million people gave a comparable amount of $356 million through small-dollar donations of $200 or less. Astonishing as these figures are, they don't include the $173 million spent in the 2014 election cycle by tax-exempt ``dark money'' groups that are not required to publicly disclose their donors.  Deep-pocketed special interests are aiming to control the agenda in Congress. It is time to fight back and fundamentally reform the way we finance congressional elections. We need a system that allows candidates to focus on constituents instead of fundraising--a system that encourages ordinary Americans to make their voice heard with small, affordable donations to the candidate of their choice.  That is why I am once again introducing the Fair Elections Now Act. While this bill cannot solve all of the problems facing our Nation's campaign finance system, the Fair Elections Now Act will dramatically change the way campaigns are funded. This bill allows candidates to focus on the people they represent, regardless of whether those people have the wealth to attend a big money fundraiser or donate thousands of dollars.  I would like to thank Sens. Baldwin, Boxer, Brown, Franken, Gillibrand, Heinrich, Klobuchar, Leahy, Markey, McCaskill, Menendez, Merkley, Murphy, Sanders, Shaheen, Udall, and Warren for cosponsoring the Fair Elections Now Act and joining me in this effort to reform our campaign finance system.  The Fair Elections Now Act will help restore public confidence in congressional elections by providing qualified candidates for Congress with grants, matching funds, and vouchers from the Fair Elections Fund to replace campaign fundraising that largely relies on lobbyists, wealthy donors, corporations, and other special interests. In return, participating candidates would agree to limit their campaign spending to amounts raised from small-dollar donors plus the amounts provided from the Fair Elections Fund.  The Fair Elections system would have three stages for Senate candidates. First, candidates would need to prove their viability by raising a minimum number and amount of small-dollar qualifying contributions from in-state donors. Qualified candidates would then be required to limit the amount raised from each donor to $150 per election.  In the primary, participants would receive a base grant that would vary in amount based on the population of the State that the candidate seeks to represent. Participants would also receive a 6 to 1 match for small-dollar donations up to a defined matching cap. After reaching that cap, the candidate could raise an unlimited amount of $150 contributions, as well as contributions from small-donor People PACs.  In the general election, qualified candidates would receive an additionalgrant, further small-dollar matching, and vouchers for purchasing television advertising. The candidate could continue to raise an unlimited amount of $150 contributions, as well as contributions from small-donor People PACs.  Under the Fair Elections Now Act, candidates would have an incentive to seek small donations. And citizens would have an incentive to donate to the candidate of their choice, knowing that their small donation of $150 would be converted to a $900 donation through the 6 to 1 Fair Elections match.  Citizens would also be eligible for a modest, refundable tax credit. The Fair Elections Now Act establishes the ``My Voice Tax Credit'' to encourage individuals to make small donations to campaigns. Citizens could also make their voices heard by aggregating small contributions of $150 or less into a type of small-donor political action committee, known as a ``People PAC.'' People PACs would then be permitted to make campaign contributions to qualified Fair Elections candidates. Coupled with the Fair Elections public financing system, People PACs would elevate the views and interests of a diverse spectrum of Americans, rather than those of the traditional, wealthy donor class.  Our country is facing major challenges. We need to continue to create more jobs and restore economic security for the middle class. We need to build and sustain our transportation infrastructure. We need to fix our broken immigration system. We need to ensure that the right to vote is protected and preserved.  But with high-powered, special interest lobbyists fighting every proposal to make our country stronger, it is incredibly difficult for members of Congress to make progress on behalf of their constituents. This bill would dramatically reduce the influence of these special interests and wealthy donors, because Fair Elections candidates would not need their money to run campaigns. As a result, the bill would enhance the voice of average Americans. Let me be clear: the overwhelming majority of people serving in American politics are good, honest people, and I believe that most members of Congress are guided by the best of intentions. But we are nonetheless stuck in a terrible, corrupting system.  A recent poll found bipartisan concerns about our current system. According to the poll, more than four out of five Americans say money plays too great a role in political campaigns. Two-thirds say that the wealthy have more of a chance to influence the electoral process than other Americans. The perception is that politicians are corrupted by big money interests . . . and whether that is true or not, that perception and the loss of trust that goes with it make it very difficult for Congress to solve tough issues.  This problem--the perception of pervasive corruption--is undermining our democracy, and we must address it. Everyone is entitled to a seat at the table, but wealthy donors and big corporations shouldn't be able to buy every seat.  The Fair Elections Now Act will reform our campaign finance system so that members of Congress can focus on implementing policies in the best interest of the people who elected them--not just the wealthy donors and special interests that bankrolled their success. I urge my colleagues and the American people to support this important legislation.                          ____________________
