Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter), the sponsor of the last amendment, indicated on this amendment, I think we all agree that the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) has offered an amendment which all of us can and should support. Clearly we want to express in the strongest possible terms that the residents of American Samoa are in fact included as U.S. citizens. They are a full part of our country, and although they do not have every right of citizenship extended to them, Mr. Faleomavaega represents them extraordinarily well here on the floor of this House. And we share his view that we ought to make it very clear that his constituents can in fact contribute, exercise their speech rights by contributing to his campaign, and to such other campaigns as they choose, and I certainly know that I think on our side there is unanimous support for his amendment, and I thank him for his leadership on this very important point.
