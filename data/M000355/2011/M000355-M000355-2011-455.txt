  Solving the Nation's fiscal problems will indeed require principled leadership, and I am confident Senator Paulwill play an important role in guiding us toward real solutions.  Senator Paul is a lawmaker to watch. He brings a keen intellect and rare passion to the job. He will be an important voice in this body in the many debates to come.  I look forward to working with him on behalf of Kentuckians and all Americans.  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
