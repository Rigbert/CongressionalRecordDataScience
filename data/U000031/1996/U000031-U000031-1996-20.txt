Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut, my good friend, for yielding during this special order. I must say a couple of things to begin with. One of the things I have said a lot as I have gone around my district and around the State of Michigan and here in Washington too is in this Chamber, sometimes it seems as though we have too many Republicans and too many Democrats, and not enough U.S. Congressmen and women willing to make some tough choices. We have got to do that. I am 42 years old. You and I are about the same age.
