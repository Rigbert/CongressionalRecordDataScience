 President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour before resuming consideration of the Keystone bill. Senators should expect votes on pending amendments to the bill after lunch today. Votes are possible into the evening tonight as well as during tomorrow morning's session of the Senate. We need to make progress on this bill and all Members should expect a busy day.                          ____________________
