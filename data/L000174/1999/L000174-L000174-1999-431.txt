President, today I rise to recognize Bob Clarke, who has served for nearly 15 years as President of Vermont Technical College in Randolph. Under Bob's leadership, VTC has seen its annual budget quadruple, its annual donations have increased twelve-fold, and VTC's standing in the community has grown immensely.  Bob brought to VTC a new perspective for technical education. He has established unique relationships between VTC and the high-tech community. Currently, Vermont Technical College is providing training to employees of companies such as IBM, BF Goodrich Aerospace, and Bell Atlantic. In addition, Bob has listened to the concerns of small businesses in the state. When Vermont faced a shortage of trained auto mechanics, he established a training program in automotive technology. His willingness to listen to the needs of the business community has resulted in increased opportunities for VTC students and alumni alike, and VTC has created a qualified pool of applicants to meet the growing needs of Vermont's high-tech industry.  Over the years, I have worked closely with Bob and VTC on issues including education, workforce retraining and business development. I have been most impressed with Bob's innovation in addressing the evolving needs of the business community. His work is truly inspiring and the results have been felt across the state. Bob has truly raised the bar for technical colleges around the country.  An article recently appeared in the Vermont Sunday Magazine which details Bob's accomplishments during his tenure as President of Vermont Technical College. I ask that this article be printed in the Record.  The article follows:              [From Vermont Sunday Magazine, May 23, 1999]                          Cutting-Edge Clarke                            (By Jack Crowl)       Bob Clarke doesn't exactly fit the central-casting image of      a New England college president. He doesn't have an Ivy      League degree; in fact he doesn't have a traditional academic      Ph. D. at all. Neither does he have a particularly      deferential air toward the life     of the mind, nor the aversion to cozy relationships with      businesses that many academic leaders fear might skew their      priorities and jeopardize their indpendence.       Instead, the president of Vermont Technical College is best      known for his impish grin, the twang in his speech--he's from      the Eastern Shore of Maryland--a love of fast cars, and a      passion for hard work and getting things done. Pass him on      the street unknowingly and you'd likely say, ``That guy must      be a salesman.''       Which he is. Largely by selling himself and his institution      to a bevy of businesses, Clarke has transformed that small      and sleepy two-year, engineering-technlogy school into a      statewide dynamo with substantial influence in the highest      circles of industry, education, and government.       In his nearly 15 years as head of VTC, Clarke has seen its      annual budget grow from about $5 million to more than $21      million, plus more than $13 million in new or renovated      buildings and facilities. Additionally, the college has spent      more than $750,000 a year over the past decade on new      equipment and for several years has boasted of a totally      ``wired'' campus for the information age.       Gifts and grants that once amounted to a paltry $25,000 a      year now total $3 million annually. And the endowment fund,      which didn't even exist when Clarke arrived in 1984, now      amounts to about $3.6 million, VTC employs nearly 500 people      and offers two-year associate degrees in 18 different      technical areas, plus two recently added bachelor's degrees.       But Clarke's contributions to Vermont are more significant      than simply the upgrading of a single institution, important      as that may be. In the process of selling VTC, he's also been      selling the concept of higher education to more and more      people. He's played a big role in changing the tenor of      public discussion about the importance of higher education      and helped move the debate from the theoretical realm of      ideas to the practical world of jobs and profits.       At meetings large and small throughout the state, Clarke      continually chants his twin mantras about the importance of      techology in our modern society and the crucial role that      higher education plays in a healthy economy because of that,      ``We have to have higher education as the centerpiece of our      economic development plans or we're going to be in trouble      when the next recession hits,'' he says.       Clarke was a member of Vermont's Higher Education Financing      Commission, which last winter urged substantial increases in      state funds for colleges and students, and whose      recommendations have been taken seriously by the governor and      legislature. He brought Massachusetts economist Paul      Harrington, an adherent of using occupational-education      programs to help boost the economy, to the attention of the      panel. Harrington's ideas were important in its      deliberations.       Some traditional academic types are somewhat dismissive of      Clarke in private, calling him a ``showboat'' or an ``empire      builder.'' But he has big fans in business and government,      and he has converted some of his harshest critics over the      years. ``If a college president's job is to promote the      institution and raise money, then by God, he does the job      well,'' says Russ Mills, a longtime VTC faculty member and      former president of the state-college faculty union. ``He      does a good job of making the college indispensable to the      business community,'' he adds.       And Clarke's boss, Chancellor Charles Bunting of the state-     college system, calls the VTC president ``an outstanding      model of leadership.''       Robert G. Clarke was born in Lewes, Del. (best known in the      mid-Atlantic area as the terminus of a ferry line across      Delaware Bay from Cape May, N.J.), but his family soon moved      further south on the Eastern Shore to the tiny Maryland town      of Snow Hill. After high school, he spent two years at nearby      Salisbury State College, where he met his future wife.       He then joined the Air Force, where he spent seven years,      picking up along the way a bachelor's degree in occupational      education from Southern Illinois University and a master's      degree in the same field from Central Washington State      College.       In 1978, Clarke joined the faculty of Northampton Community      College in Bethlehem, Penn., where in six years, he rose to      Dean of Business, Engineering and Technology while also      earning a doctorate in Higher Education Administration and      Supervision at Lehigh University.       In 1984, VTC was in the doldrums. Its enrollment was      declining. No new buildings had been built in 12 years. It      had no endowment and few private gifts. The Vermont State      College trustees tapped the 33-year-old Clarke, giving him      the charge to rescue the college and lead it to new heights.      The rest, as they say, is history.       Last fall, the state Chamber of Commerce honored Clarke as      the 1998 Vermont Citizen of the Year and the accolades flew      fast and furiously. Vermont's entire congressional      delegation, state and college officials, and businesspeople      of all stripes joined in paeans to Clarke's hard work,      vision, and leadership. He was called, in no particular      order, ``A man who fixes things;''. ``A man in a hurry;'' and      ``Not just a man with a plan, but a man who gets things      done.''       Said Gov. Howard Dean, who presented the award: ``Bob      Clarke was talking about workplace investments and public-     private partnerships before anybody else knew what they      were.'' And, he added, ``What I know best about (him) is his      ubiquity. I've never been to any meeting about education and      jobs, in my 7\1/2\ years as governor, that he or someone who      works for him wasn't either at the meeting or was next on the      appointment list.''       In his acceptance speech, Clarke noted that it was      relatively rare for both an educator and a non-native-     Vermonter to receive the coveted award, and that he was awed      to be mentioned in the company of the other honorees--most of      them governors, statesmen, or captains of industry. He      unsurprisingly reviewed his college's accomplishments and      thanked his colleagues. But he ended on a different, bolder      note. ``Much still needs to be done,'' he said. ``Consider      that:       ``Vermont ranks 49th among the states in per capita support      of higher education.       ``Unlike most states, Vermont's two-year colleges receive      no local support.       ``Vermont has no post-secondary vocational education      system.       ``There is a tremendous state need for workforce education      and training.       ``There is a shortage of skilled Vermonters to fill high-     paying jobs.''       At the end of the banquet, the Chamber of Commerce's chair,      Millie Merrill, announced that the organization's board that      day had unanimously and strongly endorsed the concept of      additional funds for higher education. When Clarke arrived      the next morning at a meeting of the Higher Education      Financing Commission, the assembled college presidents and      state legislators gave him a standing ovation.       The chief feather in Clarke's off-campus cap is the IBM      Educational Consortium, under which VTC, is partnership with      the University of Vermont and the other state colleges,      manages all employee education and training for the state's      largest private employer. The consortium has 22 full-time      employees on-site at IBM. Gov. Dean lauds it as ``a model      program, not only for the state but for the whole country.''       Landing the IBM contract was a major coup for Clarke and      VTC. The big computer manufacturer has for many years taken      great pride in running its own training department, and it      took some serious horse-trading and a trial period before IBM      officials agreed to turn over all their training to the      consortium.       In many other places, a small two-year college would be      expected to be only a junior partner in such an arrangement,      not the organizer. But, says Clarke, with obvious pride: ``We      do education and training. We're good at it. Often businesses      are not. That's why I job out my campus food service and      bookstore operations to outside experts.''       That's not, of course, VTC's only business-training      contract. Clarke has developed a slew of them, and he's been      willing and able to make special arrangements for companies      with different needs whenever traditional training programs      seem unlikely to work. Two examples:       He's delivering a program that leads to a two-year degree      in engineering technology on the premises of BF Goodrich      Aerospace in Vergennes. In that partnership, Goodrich      executives are working with the VTC faculty to develop the      curriculum, and faculty members travel across the state to      teach the courses.       He's arranged for selected Bell Atlantic employees, who are      scattered all over the state, to come to the VTC campus in      central Vermont once a week to work toward a degree in      telecommunications technology. The telephone company      orchestrates the work schedules of student-employees to      accommodate the program.       Clarke likes to point out tat ``90 per cent of Vermont      companies have fewer than 20 employees. We need better      training not linked to specific programs.'' So in 1992, the      college took over the Vermont Small Business Development      Center, which had been housed at the University of Vermont.      Since then, it has served more than 7,000 clients, providing      small Vermont companies with counseling, training, help in      marketing and financial management, and assistance in finding      money for startups or expansion. As part of its outreach      program, the center maintains offices at five different sites      around the state.       The center helps put on trade shows and seminars and works      in conjunction with other colleges, state agencies, trade      associations, and the federal Small Business Administration      (which provides most of its operating funds).       It also maintains an environmental assistance program,      which conducts workshops and confidential environmental      assessments for businesses that Clarke maintains might be      reluctant to deal directly with government agencies, which      have the power to levy penalties for rules violations.       Vermont Interactive Television is another pioneering Clarke      innovation. Headquartered on the VTC campus in Randolph, it      coordinates 12 sites around the state, where businesses,      government officials, educators, and non-profit organizations      can conduct meetings, training, and hear and see what folks      at the other sites are saying and doing, all without the      costly statewide travel that can be onerous or even dangerous      during winter.       VIT has been in operation for more than 10 years. It has a      contract with the state for meetings and training, and it      collects user fees for non-state-government meetings.      Individual sites donate the use of their facilities. A 1996      study reported that the state government was saving some 55      percent on     meetings conducted over VIT instead of having employees      travel around the state to one central location. Many      committees of the state legislature conduct public hearings      via interactive television, so they can collect input from      citizens without forcing them to travel to Montpelier.       A more recent innovation is the Vermont Manufacturing      Extension Center, a joint venture among VTC, the state's      Department of Economic Development, and a couple of units of      the U.S. Department of Commerce. In three years, this center      has worked with more than 500 Vermont manufacturers in      projects involving a number of trade associations, colleges,      and other non-profit organizations.       The center has been in the forefront of efforts to raise      Vermonters' awareness about the potential problems of Y2K or      the Millennium Bug, which could cause most computers to      malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, because they may not be able to      recognize the date. VMEC is closely affiliated with the      state's Y2K Council and it's working with manufacturers to      identify and head off any computer problems that could occur.       Whenever his institution lacks the expertise to pull off a      full-fledged training program on its own, Clarke develops      partnerships with other post-secondary institutions. Too many      exist to name here, but VTC currently has 18 such joint      projects with the University of Vermont alone.       Meanwhile, back on the campus, Clarke encourages      innovation, but he runs a tight ship. Too tight for some      faculty members, who over the years have chafed at the      directions he wants to take the school, the speed with which      he likes to make changes, and his impatience with those who      disagree with him.       Early in his tenure, one teacher who was vocally less than      enthusiastic about Clarke's plans did not have his contract      renewed, despite the strong support of the rest of the      faculty, who felt he was an outstanding teacher. Incensed,      the faculty called for Clarke's resignation by a two-to-one      margin. Clarke refused to resign, and he was wholeheartedly      backed by the state-college trustees. That ended the faculty      rebellion, but left many teachers with a long-simmering      dislike and distrust of the president.       Some faculty leaders now argue that Clarke has changed      since that confrontation. They think he's a bit more fair-     minded and can now consider others' points of view, even when      he disagrees with them. ``He's developed a delicate touch in      personnel matters,'' says Russ Mills, the veteran faculty      member, who thinks that, if confronted with the same      situation again, Clarke would react differently today.       Nonetheless, there's no question that Clarke likes to be in      control of what's happening on his campus. Even today, he      boasts that he personally interviews all finalists for campus      jobs.       A quick review of several campus innovations by Clarke and      his academic colleagues offers some idea of the breadth of      his interests and concerns:       Several years ago, the college took over the state's      training programs for Licensed Practical Nurses. It continued      to offer the standard one-year program at four sites      throughout the state, but added a second year for students      interested in becoming Registered Nurses. And it offers      academic credit for its programs, so that nursing students      who wish to get bachelor's degrees can transfer to a four-     year institution.       In 1989, the Vermont Academy of Science and Technology was      founded. Under that program, gifted Vermont high-school      students can enroll at VTC and simultaneously complete their      final year of high school and their first year of college      work. VTC is accredited as a private high school for that      purpose. Students who complete that year's work can continue      there or transfer to another college.       The college plays host every summer to a Women-in-     Technology program. About 250 young women spend a week on      campus, where they engage in classes, seminars and workshops      with female scientists and engineers, as a way of providing      role models and encouraging more young women to consider      careers in science and technology.       The Vermont Automobile Dealers' Association, worried about      a critical shortage of auto technicians who can deal with the      technology of modern cars, built and equipped an automotive      technology center on the VTC campus, so that the college      could add a two-year degree program in automotive technology.      It now also provides scholarships for auto tech students.       Clarke seems to be willing to talk with just about any      interest group that could conceivably help his institution.      He once struck a deal with the state to buy a farm adjacent      to the campus where officials wanted to locate a veterans'      cemetery. He agreed to manage the cemetery--and VTC still      does--in order to get the remainder of the land for campus      expansion.       Not all such proposals come to fruition, however. Clarke      offered land to the Woodstock-based Vermont Institute of      Natural Science when it was looking for a new home last year      (it decided to move elsewhere) and he had serious      negotiations with Gifford Hospital in Randolph (where he once      served on the board) to establish a nursing home that didn't      work out, either. It was during that time, when negotiations      were also under way for an early-childhood education program,      that one faculty wag observed at a VTC meeting: ``Now we can      have it all--cradle to grave, without leaving campus.''       What's next on the agenda for Clarke? For starters, he says      he's committed to staying in Vermont. He admits that when he      first took the job, he viewed it as a stepping stone, but he      says the people here have been so welcoming and unlike the      flinty New Englander stereotype, that he and his wife Glenda      have fallen in love with the state and plan to stay. The      college provides housing on the campus for the president, so      the Clarkes built a ``weekend'' home in Addison, near Lake      Champlain.       On the college front, he's planning more relationships with      businesses. He's working to develop one with IDX, the      Burlington-based medical-software company, which recently      announced an expansion. He hopes to provide a six-month      program of technical training to liberal-arts graduates.       Clarke also wants to assist Vermont businesses to get into      what he calls ``e-commerce,'' selling their wares over the      Internet. ``We know the technology and we can help,'' he      says. ``Most businesses are barely scratching the surface.''       And he wants to encourage the state to come up with a      coordinated effort to deal with vocational-technical      education.       He applauds the efforts of the Higher Education Financing      Commission on which he sat, but feels the key to having its      recommendations work is a multi-year commitment by the state.      For example, he notes that the new Trust Fund just passed by      the Legislature is about $8 million to start and its use is      limited to the earnings from the amount.       ``It's an important first step,'' he says, ``but one that      will have marginal impact until it grows.'' For each of the      state colleges, the fund will produce about $20,000 a year      for scholarships as it now stands. He's disappointed,      however, that there are no ``workforce development'' funds.      Most states provide funds for training and re-training      workers, but in Vermont the cost must be borne entirely by      the companies.       Unless, of course, some clever entrepreneur somewhere--     someone like Bob Clarke--can find the money and the backing      to put a package together.                          ____________________
