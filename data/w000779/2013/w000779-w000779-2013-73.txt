President, in my view, this is a very practical amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Oregon Senator Merkley. It involves a study on standby power.  The amendment would, in effect, fund the study at the Department of Energy to look at standby power standards in States and other parts of the world to determine what is the most feasible and practical way to approach it. There is no authorization here.  I think it is pretty obvious to Members of the Senate, there are a large number of electronic products, from televisions, cell phone chargers, to microwaves, that cannot be completely turned off without being unplugged, and we ought to find ways to reduce wasted standby power.  It is my intention to support this amendment. I think it is a practical idea. I yield any time to Senator Merkley to explain his thoughtful amendment.
