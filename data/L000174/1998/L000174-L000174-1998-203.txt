President, I am pleased to join Senator Jeffords today in introducing the Rural Opportunity Communities Act of 1998. This bill will greatly enhance the Empowerment Zone program by providing incentives to reward well performing Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. The bill will also offer communities which face significant economic problems, but do not fit the strict definitions of the Empowerment Zone program with an alternative built on the same long-term, comprehensive, community-based planning.  In 1995 the first round of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities were designated. Those communities have well demonstrated the potential of the program to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods and poverty stricken rural areas. In Burlington's Old North End, Vermont's only Enterprise Community, the benefits of this program have been tremendous. What was once a decaying section of the city is now a vital neighborhood. Equally important, the ``New North End'' has become an integral part of the city through the network of organizations and community members that pulled together to develop a plan to revitalize the area.  A new round of Empowerment Zone awards will allow additional communities to benefit from the program. This bill further enhances the Empowerment Zone program by recognizing those communities which have made the most progress in implementing their ten year plans and improving their neighborhoods. These model Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will be eligible to compete for special incentive grants so that the successful programs they have initiated can continue to flourish. The success of well-performing Enterprise Communities will also be recognized by giving them additional points on their applications for empowerment zone status.  FInally, the bill establishes a special demonstration program, the Rural Opportunity Communities. This demonstration is designed to test the Empowerment Zone model of long-term, community based planning, with communities which are facing economic problems different from those defined by the Empowerment Zone program. Among other factors, the ROC demonstration will recognize the very real problem of under-employment, a significant problem in Vermont. The northeastern corner of Vermont, known as the Northeast Kingdom, is regularly responsible for one of the highest unemployment rates in the state. This is a very rural area where many families also hold down multiple jobs to make ends meet.  Last year I worked to bring together a group of economic development organizations and local officials to take a broader look at the problems facing the region, and work to find a common approach to addressing those problems. Since that time this group, known as the Northeast Kingdom Enterprise Collaborative, has continued to grow and has begun to lay the groundwork for a long-term plan for the three-county area. The ROC demonstration will offer a perfect opportunity for areas like the Northeast Kingdom, that are interested in pursuing this Empowerment Zone model, to gain access to the resources they need.                                 ______                                       By Mr. D'AMATO:  S. 2419. A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to protect the nation's electricity ratepayers by ensuring that rates charged by qualifying small power producers and qualifying cogenerators do not exceed the incremental cost to the purchasing utility of alternative electric energy at the time of delivery, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.          the electric power consumer rate relief act of 1998  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, S. 2419, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2419       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Electric Power Consumer Rate      Relief Act of 1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) certain courts have found that States are preempted      under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 from      engaging in certain ratepayer protection activities critical      to ensuring reasonable rates for in-State ratepayers;       (2) those courts have found that, although States have the      authority initially to establish rates charged by qualifying      small power producers and qualifying cogenerators to local      electric utilities, that such States thereafter are preempted      by that Act from ensuring over time that rates--       (A) are just and reasonable to the retail electric      consumers of purchasing electric utilities and are in the      public interest; and       (B) do not exceed the incremental cost to such purchasing      electric utilities of alternative electric energy at the time      of delivery;       (3) other courts have found that States are preempted from      monitoring effectively the operating and efficiency      performance of in-State cogeneration and small power      production facilities for the purpose of determining whether      such facilities meet Federal Energy Regulatory Commission      standards for qualifying cogenerators; and       (4) that Act should be amended to clarify the intent of      Congress that States have the authority--       (A) to ensure that rates charged by qualifying small power      producers andqualifying cogenerators to purchasing electric      utilities--       (i) are just and reasonable to the electric consumers of      such purchasing electric utilities and in the public      interest; and       (ii) do not exceed the incremental cost to such purchasing      electric utilities of alternative electric energy at the time      of delivery; and       (B) to establish effective programs for monitoring the      operating and efficiency performance of in-State cogeneration      and small power production facilities for the purpose of      determining whether such facilities meet Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission standards for qualifying cogenerators.     SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF RULES.       Section 210(f)(1) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies      Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 824a-3(f)(1)) is amended--       (1) by striking ``(1) Beginning'' and inserting the      following:       ``(1) By state regulatory authorities.--       ``(A) In general.--Beginning''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(B) Requirements.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      this section, a State regulatory authority may ensure that      rates charged by qualifying small power producers and      qualifying cogenerators--       ``(i) are just and reasonable to the electric consumers of      the purchasing electric utility and in the public interest;      and       ``(ii) do not exceed the incremental cost at the time of      delivery to the purchasing utility of alternative electric      energy and capacity.       ``(C) Monitoring.--A State regulatory authority may      establish programs for monitoring the operating and      efficiency performance of in-State cogeneration and small      power production facilities for the purpose of determining      whether the facilities meet standards established by the      Commission for qualifying facilities.       ``(D) Amendment of contract.--A State regulatory authority      may require that any     contract entered into before the date of enactment of this      paragraph be amended to conform to any requirements imposed      under subparagraph (B).''.                                 ______                                       By
