Speaker, coming from a family of combat infantry men and Marines, I must say that anytime this Congress is asked to consider the authorization for the use of force, it is a request that we consider very seriously. I might add that most of those who are making this request from the White House have never served in combat themselves. Certainly the Secretary of Defense has not. Certainly the Communications Director of the White House who made the flippant statements this week that one silver bullet is cheaper than going to war, in referencing a possible assassination in Iraq, is one of the most appalling comments I have ever heard from a White House official. If he had been in the service of Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman or John Kennedy, he would no longer have a job.  The resolution this Congress will be asked to consider next week is a work in progress. Initially it started with inspections where we had the broad support of the international community. And all we needed to do was expand that a little bit and be rigorous, as we have done before, working with our allies around the world. But, no, the ante was raised by the White House conveniently 4 weeks before an election now and the objective is regime change.  The President has said it, it is not disallowed in the resolution that is brought up to us; and I want to speak tonight a little bit about how the United States, not just through this resolution but through the rhetoric that has been spewing out of Washington here across the Islamic and Arab world, is going to increase terrorism, is going to increase hatred toward the United States of America. When the President of the United States uses terms like dead or alive, do you think General Omar Bradley would have ever said that? General Hugh Shelton, would he have ever used those terms so publicly?  When you have not been to war, you are loose with your rhetoric.  Senator Warren Rudman, who helped produce a report with Senator George Mitchell about the rising threat of terrorism around the world, sobered our membership when he came up here a few months ago and said though he had traveled the world as a Senator, he did not realize until he got into the issue of terrorism how much he found America hated around the world.  Tonight I want to place in the Record a longer analysis of what is really wrong with U.S. policy towards that region of the world, but let us be clear where the hatred comes from and what spawns the terrorism.  First of all, we have the lack in the Middle East and Central Asia of a real resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has been with us in the free world for over 50 years. We do not have a peace process under way. Every night we see in the newspapers or we see on television more killing of Israelis by Palestinians or vice versa.  There was a great cartoon, a sad cartoon, in one of the newspapers recently showing Mr. Sharon and Mr. Arafat holding hands and falling together down a deep cavern and blaming one another as they fell to their certain deaths.  We as a world need to organize in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Without it, terrorism will continue not only in that region of the world but will find its way creeping into our homeland as we saw on 9-11.  The other major issue deals with U.S. ties to the oil kingdoms in the Middle East on which we have become even more dependent than during the oil crises of the 1970s and the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s, and importantly to the repressive regimes that our dollars help support. There is a very rude awakening in the Middle East and Central Asia for a different way of life and America is fast becoming the excuse for the repression under which the majority of people live all in undemocratic regimes.  So my first advice tonight is please, Mr. President, do not position the United States as the common enemy that serves as a unifying force against which all the disparate malcontents and discontents of the Middle East and Central Asia can unite. We saw a sign of that in our homeland last year. But not only our homeland, across the world American embassies are being built like bunkers. Our diplomats are being killed more and more, every 10 years more of them are killed, whether it is Africa, whether it is Malaysia, whether it is the Middle East.  To achieve long-term stability, the United States' policy toward the Arab and Islamic world must be shaped multilaterally and affirm our belief in democratic principals. Unfortunately, the Bush administration's policies continue us down this dangerous path.                 Allies Working Toward a Secure Future       To achieve long-term stability, U.S. policy toward the Arab      and Islamic world must be shaped multilaterally and affirm      our nation's belief in democratic principles. The Bush      Administration's initiatives will lead to neither. Indeed, it      is positioning the U.S. to be the common enemy in a volatile      region where terrorism grows with each passing decade of war      and remembrance.       Bush policies--such as threatening regime change or the      ``one bullet policy'' on Iraq--are destabilizing and pose a      real threat to U.S. long-term interests. These irresponsible      policies inject the U.S. into the festering antipathy of      disparate forces whose common denominator is growing anti-     Western sentiment.       Thus, a resolution that employs all diplomatic and economic      means to draw broad multilateral support to allow U.N. arms      inspectors access to conduct robust investigations of Iraq's      suspected weapons sites is of paramount importance. As a      first step, Congress should support the recently negotiated      international agreement allowing inspectors to return to Iraq      after four years. Especially in this region of the world,      former Senator George Mitchell emphasizes the importance of      diplomacy in the Mitchell Report, ``Whatever the source,      violence will not solve the problems of the region. It will      only make them worse. Death and destruction will not bring      peace, but will deepen the hatred and harden the resolve on      both sides. There is only one way to peace, justice, and      security in the Middle East, and that is through      negotiation.''                              first strike       Based on the lack of verifiable evidence presented to      Congress and the American people, the President's proposal to      pre-emptively, or unilaterally, strike against Iraq is      unacceptable. Due to the predictably destabilizing effect on      the region, the U.S. should avoid a first strike. Dr. Mark      Juergensmeyer, Director of Global and International Studies      at U.C. Santa Barbara, ``It is essential that a multilateral      force be deployed if action is contemplated.''       If America goes to war, the cause must be just and better      justified.                        toward a changed region       Powerful Islamic stirrings inside undemocratic regimes in      the Middle East and Central Asia, including violent forces      operating outside nation-states (like Al Qaeda), create      conditions for emerging revolutions. In responding to these,      the U.S. must act in a manner that is true to our founding      principles as the world's oldest democratic republic. We,      too, have been a revolutionary people aspiring to a better      way of life.       We must not wed ourselves to monarchy, dictatorship, or      repression. As a superpower, the U.S. must position itself      for long-term, relations with many emerging nations. The U.S.      should not become the inheritor of a new world order in the      Middle East and Central Asia, nor an occupying force. Simply      put, U.S. dominance there is not unilaterally sustainable.                grave and gathering vs. imminent threat       Congress must ask: what is the ``imminent threat'' to the      U.S. that justifies a war resolution now? The President, in      his remarks before the U.N., stated, ``Iraq is a grave and      gathering danger.'' He did not say ``an imminent threat.''       What has Iraq done differently in the last 4 months than      the prior year to warrant invasion now? Yes, Iraq is a      secular state that seeks greater domination over the Arab      world. But intelligence briefings have indicated that Iraq      has fewer military capabilities than it did 10 years ago.      Secretary Rumsfeld has stated that Iraq's army is only 40% of      what it was 10 years ago. The Central Intelligence Agency and      Defense Intelligence Agency have verified that Iraq's      chemical and nuclear capabilities are substantially less than      10 years ago. However, in the area of biologics, Iraq is      likely ahead of where it was 10 years ago.       The international community has the opportunity to use its      united efforts to require Iraq to abide by U.N. resolutions      requiring immediate access to verify Iraq's commitment to rid      itself of weapons of mass destruction and long-range      missiles.            there is a distinction between al qaeda and Iraq       Congress must ask the Bush Administration to distinguish      between Al Qaeda and Iraq. The carnage that took place on      September 11, 2001, was committed by members of the Al Qaeda      terrorist network. Al Qaeda's primary objective is to rid the      Middle East of all foreign influence and impose strict      Islamic religious rule based on its particular interpretation      of the religion. Iraq, rather, is a secular state headed by a      military dictator, Saddam Hussein, holding the second largest      oil reserves in the Middle East. Saddam's chief objective is      to control the entire region's oil reserves and eventually      gain greater power in the Arab world.       America's war on terrorism began as a clear campaign      against Al Qaeda, not Iraq. Neither Congress nor the American      public has been presented with any evidence of a connection      between Iraq and Al Qaeda. Though some terrorists may be      ``present'' especially in the northern zone of Iraq, which      Hussein does not control, there is no linkage of evidence      between them and the government of Iraq. The President      asserted in his draft resolution that members of Al Qaeda are      ``known to be in Iraq'' and that Iraq may give weapons to      terrorists. His statements are filled with innuendoes, not      facts. No intelligence information has been presented to      Congress to add certainty to the President's statements.       oil is the primary underpinning of u.s. ``vital'' interest       Congress must ask: For how long will Americans be asked to      die for ``vital interests'' centered in the oil kingdoms? The      economic underpinning of Iraq is oil--the second largest      reserves in the world. 95% of Iraq's economy is oil driven.      Americans might ask the question: ``Why has the U.S. become      bogged down in this region so many times in modern history?''      and ``Why have all of America's major recessions in the past      30 years been triggered by rising oil prices?'' In fact,      rising oil prices triggered our current recession, and prices      are rising again.       During the 1970's, two Arab oil embargoes drove the U.S.      economy into deep recession. President Jimmy Carter tried to      move America toward energy independence, calling the      challenge the ``moral equivalent of war.'' But as world oil      prices dropped through O.P.E.C. price manipulation, America      lost its edge on energy independence. Though conservation and      alternative energy development progressed, their pace was not      sufficient to meet demand.       In the early 1990's, America went to war over Iraq's      invasion of neighboring Kuwait's oil fields and port access.      In October 2000, the USS Cole, a Navy destroyer protecting      the oil shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf, was suicide      bombed in Yemen's harbor. Even now, as the President      contemplates invasion, 8% of America's oil originates in      Iraq.       Oil is not worth one more American soldier's life, nor any      more disruption to our national economy. America needs a      national commitment to become energy independent again in      this decade, much like the space program of the 1960s that      led America into the heavens. Ms. Robin Wright, Foreign      Diplomatic Correspondent for the Los Angeles Times has      stated, ``To build a more peaceful world, the U.S. must deal      with the oil issue. It must also deal with the political      destiny of people in that part of the world who want to have      some say in their futures.''                naked aggression in not the american way       Yes, Iraq is in gross violation of U.N. resolutions calling      for inspections, but America should not pressure Iraq      unilaterally, without maintaining that same broad-based      international support. It was proper for President Bush to      deliver an address at the United Nations. Our nation has      always sought to be a constructive partner among the      community of nations. We need to maintain this policy of      engagement with the nations of the world.       Naked aggression by a superpower with no evidence presented      to its lawmakers is discomforting to the American people and      not the way to forge alliances in a troubled part of the      world. America, surely, does not wish to be perceived as the      ``bully on the block'' in the most oil rich region of the      world where not one democratic state exists.                         a plan for the future       As a first step, we should support International Strategic      Partnership to Eliminate a Common Threat (INSPECT), an      alternate resolution encouraging the President to support the      recently negotiated inspection plan between the Iraqi      Government and international representatives calling for a      robust team capable of ensuring that Iraq is no longer in      violation of international agreements. The resolution rejects      any unilateral military action by the U.S. until Congress is      able to grant its approval. In addition, the President must      submit a report to Congress, at least every 30 days, on      matters relevant to this resolution. According to David      Albright, President of the Institute for Science and      International Security. ``Nuclear threat is not imminent.      Because the threat is not imminent, inspectors could be      beneficial.''                          ____________________
