 It is a commonsense, entrepreneur friendly solution to many of the problems plaguing the Patent and Trademark Office.  Over the years, we have heard numerous complaints from constituents about the long time it takes the Patent and Trademark Office to review patent applications and render a final disposition. It is my understanding that in most cases, it takes almost 3 years for the Patent and Trademark Office to make a final decision on an application which can be costly to the applicant.  We have also heard from Patent and Trademark Office officials about the difficulties that have arisen because of their lack of control over the agency's funding model.
