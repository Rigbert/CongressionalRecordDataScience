Chairman, I would mention to the gentleman, with all due respect, the President never asked for these offsets. And, also, I know that inside the Department of Agriculture they are drowning in commodities. When the administration sends a request up here, it is not always perfect because of what happens over at OMB.  I know, and the gentleman obviously knows, that silos across this country are bursting at the seams. We have food to send around the world, and our farmers need help on the price in order that they can make it through this planting year.
