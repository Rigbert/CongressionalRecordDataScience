President, I started in opposition to this amendment, but I now rise in support of this amendment. I think the Senator from Idaho is right. I think we should adopt this amendment with an overwhelming margin, and I believe he was right yesterday during the course of the debate when he said:       A general firearm safety rule that must be applied to all      conditions is that a firearm should be stored so that it is      not accessible to untrained and unauthorized people.  The Senator went on to say:       Proper storage of firearms is the responsibility of every      gun owner.  The next amendment after we adopt the Craig amendment will give us a chance to adopt a children's access prevention law which says to every gun owner in America, you have the right to bear arms; you have the responsibility to store them safely. I urge all my colleagues to vote with Senator Craig and then support the Durbin-Chafee amendment.
