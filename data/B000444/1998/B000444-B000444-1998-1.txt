 President, included within this omnibus appropriations bill are two important pieces of legislation related to foreign policy. The first, produced on a bipartisan basis in the Foreign Relations Committee, is the ``Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act,'' which involves the institutional structure of, and funding for, the foreign affairs agencies of the U.S. government. The second bill is legislation necessary to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention, a treaty approved by the Senate in April 1997.  The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act is not perfect, and unfortunately it differs in one critical respect from the original bill approved by the Senate 16 months ago. I say ``unfortunately'' because this bill does not contain a single dime for our UN arrears. Last year, Chairman Helms and I agreed on a proposal to authorize the payment of $926 million in arrears to the United Nations, conditioned on a series of reforms in that body. The Senate approved the Helms-Biden legislation twice in 1997, first by a vote of 90-5 in June, then by a voice vote in November.  The obstacle to making good on our commitments to the United Nations? A small minority of members in the other body, who have insisted that our arrears payments to the United Nations should be held hostage to an unrelated issue regarding family planning. The specific provision--the so-called Mexico City amendment --would require the withholding of funds from foreign, non-governmental organizations which use their own funds to perform abortions or discuss the issue with foreign governments. The President has indicated on several occasions that he will veto any bill presented to him that contains the Mexico City language. Nonetheless, a handful of obstructionists in the other body march steadily ahead, determined to undermine U.S. foreign policy interests in order to advance their unrelated cause.  I deeply regret such irresponsible action by the other body, but it is emblematic of the reckless disregard that many in that body have for the important responsibilities the United States has as the world s leading superpower.  In the past few weeks, the Chairman and I attempted to include a $200 million down payment on our UN arrears, which would have been linked to certain of the conditions in the Helms-Biden legislation. But even this limited payment of our arrears proved to be too much for the members in the other body who have taken American foreign policy hostage.  It is essential that we find a way to repay our arrears next year. For better or for worse, the United Nations is a valuable means to advance our foreign policy and security interests around the world, by providing a forum for improved cooperation with other states and by allowing us, in some instances, to share the burdens and costs of world leadership.  Our status as a deadbeat is unquestionably hurting our interests, not only at the UN but with our leading allies--many of whom are owed money by the UN for peacekeeping operations they undertook, but for which we have not yet paid. The cost to our interests cannot be measured with precision, but the resentment against the United States for its failure to pay its back dues is having a corrosive effect on our agenda at the UN and elsewhere. It is bordering on scandalous that a big nation like ours, blessed with abundant wealth, has failed to pay its bills on time.  Next year, the President is expected to nominate Richard Holbrooke to be our representative to the United Nations. Ambassador Holbrooke's nomination offers us a chance for a fresh start in the negotiations on UN arrears and reforms. Mr. Holbrooke is one of the most creative diplomats and negotiators of our time, and I am confident he will bring fresh insights and endless energy to this important issue. I am also hopeful that the Chairman remains committed to trying to move legislation in the next Congress to repay the full amount agreed to last year in our negotiations.  Let me turn now to the provisions of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act that are contained in the omnibus bill. Much of the legislative history of bill is set forth in the conference report to H.R. 1757, which was approved by both houses last spring. But I would like to take a few minutes to summarize the bill and highlight several issues.  First, the legislation before us establishes a framework for the reorganization of the U.S. foreign policy agencies which is consistent with the plan announced by the President in April 1997. After several years of debate, last year the President agreed to the abolishment of two foreign affairs agencies, and their merger into the State Department. The first agency to be abolished will be the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), which will be merged into the State Department no later than April 1, 1999; the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) will follow no later than October 1, 1999. As with the President s plan, the Agency for International Development (AID) will remain a separate agency, but it will be placed under the direct authority of the Secretary of State. And, consistent with the President s proposal to seek improved coordination between the regional bureaus in the State Department and AID, the Secretary of State will have the authority to provide overall coordination of assistance policy.  The integration of ACDA and USIA into the State Department is not intended to signal the demise of the important functions now performed by these agencies. On the contrary, their merger into the Department is designed to ensure that the arms control and public diplomacy functions are key elements of American diplomacy.  In that regard, the bill establishes in law two new positions in the State Department, an Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, and an Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy. These senior officers will have primary responsibility for assisting the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of State in the formation and implementation of U.S. policy on these matters.  It is expected that the officials who will be named to these positions will be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. The conference committee on H.R. 1757 rejected a proposal by the Executive Branch to seek authority toplace officials who are now in analogous positions in these newly-created positions.  One issue of particular concern regarding ACDA in the reorganization is the need to maintain the highest standards of competence and objectivity in the analysis of compliance with arms control and non-proliferation agreements. As the Foreign Relations Committee stated in its report last year, it is vital ``that the Under Secretary be able to call upon expert personnel in these areas who will not feel obligated to downplay verification or compliance issues because of any potential impact of such issues upon overall U.S. relations with another country.'' Chairman Helms and I have urged the Secretary of State to find a way to make the official for compliance a Senate-confirmed, Presidential appointee.  The bill puts flesh on the bones of the President's plan with regard to international broadcasting. The President's proposal was virtually silent on this question, stating only that the ``distinctiveness and editorial integrity of the Voice of America and the broadcasting agencies would be preserved.'' The bill upholds and protects that principle by maintaining the existing government structure established by Congress in 1994 in consolidating all U.S. government-sponsored broadcasting--the Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Worldnet TV--under the supervision of one oversight board known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Importantly, however, the Board and the broadcasters below them will not be merged into the State Department, where their journalistic integrity would be greatly at risk. Instead, the Broadcasting Board will be an independent federal entity within the Executive Branch. The Secretary of State will have a seat on the board, just as the Director of the USIA does now.  Second, the bill authorizes important funding for our diplomatic readiness, which has been severely hampered in recent years by deep reductions in the foreign affairs budget. This Congress has stopped the hemorrhaging in the foreign affairs budget, but I believe that funding for international programs remains inadequate, given our responsibilities as a great power.  Although the Cold War has ended, the need for American leadership in world affairs has not. Our diplomats represent the front line of our national defense; with the downsizing of the U.S. military presence overseas, the maintenance of a robust and effective diplomatic capability has become all the more important. Despite the reduction in our military readiness abroad, the increased importance of diplomatic readiness to our nation s security has not been reflected in the federal budget.  Significantly, this omnibus appropriations bill contains the emergency funding requested by the Administration for embassy security. The bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa in August demonstrate that many of our missions overseas remain highly vulnerable to terrorist attack; it is imperative that we provide the State Department the resources necessary to protect our employees serving overseas. We should understand, however, that the urgent funding in this bill is just the beginning of a long-term program to enhance security at embassies around the globe.  I am especially pleased that the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act is also incorporated in the omnibus spending bill. The Senate passed this legislation unanimously in May of 1997, and we have waited since then for the leadership of the other body to accept that complying with our international commitments is a requirement, rather than a political football. The enactment of this measure will enable the United States to file the comprehensive data declarations required by the Convention, and therefore to demand that other countries' declarations be complete. The United States will now be able to accept inspections of private facilities, and therefore to request challenge inspections of suspected illegal facilities in foreign countries. The United States will finally be able also to protect confidential business information, acquired in declarations or on-site inspections, from release under the Freedom of Information Act. After nearly 17 months of waiting, it is about time.  In closing, I want to pay tribute to Chairman Helms for his continued good faith and cooperation throughout the last two years on these and other issues. He has been the driving force behind the legislation to reorganize the foreign affairs agencies, and I congratulate him for his achievement. I also want to thank our colleagues in the other body, particularly the ranking member of the Committee on International Relations, Lee Hamilton, who is retiring this year after over three decades of noble service to his district in Indiana and to the American people. We wish him well as he moves on to new challenges.  Mr. President, I want to reiterate that we are leaving important unfinished business--the payment of our back dues to the United Nations. It must be at the top of our agenda in the next Congress. I look forward to working with the Chairman and the Secretary of State to find a way to finish the job.
