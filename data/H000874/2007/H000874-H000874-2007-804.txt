Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 44, ``Honoring and praising the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on the occasion of its 98th anniversary.''  Coretta Scott King once said that ``struggle is a never-ending process and freedom is never really won--you earn it and win it in every generation.'' And since 1909, generations of Americans who have fought for racial equality and the expansion of liberty have had a friend and advocate in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  While its name entails that the NAACP seeks to advance the fortunes of African Americans, I believe that its true mission is to advance the goals of all Americans--for when we move closer to becoming a beacon of hope and opportunity for all people, regardless of race or ethnicity, we all reap the benefits.  When the light of social justice is shined in the dark corners where prejudice and bigotry still exist, our nation becomes stronger. When people who had been mistreated and oppressed become empowered to take steps towards the American Dream, our nation becomes stronger. And when we take actions that elevate the things that unite us above those that drive us apart, our nation becomes stronger.  And that is what the NAACP is all about--strengthening our nation by reminding us that while we have come a long way in our struggle for freedom and equality, we are not yet perfect, and must always remain vigilant in pursuit of a world where all men and women are treated with the respect and dignity that all human beings possess.  I'm proud to be a member of the NAACP. I'm proud to be from the state that the NAACP has called home for so many years. And I'm grateful that the NAACP has provided such strong and talented partners in working for social justice both in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District and throughout our nation as a whole.  I'd like to congratulate the NAACP on 98 years of promoting what is best about America--and I look forward to continuing to work together with NAACP members toward our shared goals of equality and prosperity for all.  I urge all Members to support this important bill.                          ____________________
