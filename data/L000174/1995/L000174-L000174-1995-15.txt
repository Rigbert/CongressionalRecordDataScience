President, Marvin L. Stone, the chairman and president of the International Media Fund, has issued a final report on a 5-year effort he headed to assist emerging journalists in the former Soviet Union in identifying their new role as skeptics, rather than employees, of the state.  Mr. Stone and volunteers from the U.S. newspapers and media have taught, trained, and conducted workshops to give a boost to men and women who were struggling to nurture new independent media in the post-Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  It was not an easy task. Mr. Stone reports that IMF encountered a bloated, entrenched, corrupting bureaucracy in the wake of the Communist collapse. And this bureaucracy, Stone adds, continues to fight a rear guard attempt at redemption--and a return to power.  The guiding principle brought to Central and Eastern Europe by Mr. Stone is the first amendment, a beacon that has kept America on course for more than 200 years. We can only hope that at some future date, it will be in the preamble of every constitution adopted by the countries of the old Eastern bloc.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the message from Chairman Stone be printed in the Congressional Record so that other Americans may learn of the work of this native Vermonter and the important contribution of IMF to sustain democracy in the post-cold-war world.  I have relied on his advice and his dedication to public service for a generation. All Americans owe him thanks for all he does.  There being no objection, the material was the ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Message From the Chairman                          (By Marvin L. Stone)       Five years ago a few of us started a three-year project      whose goal was both simple and straightforward: to give a      boost to men and women who were struggling to nurture new      independent media in the post-Communist countries of Central      and Eastern Europe.       It may cross the mind that we overstayed our leave by two      years. The fact is that we, and others in the field,      underestimated how difficult was the challenge. The      Communists left behind a bloated, entrenched, corrupting      bureaucracy. Even now it is obvious that these same      apparatchicks are fighting a rear guard attempt at      redemption--and a return to power.       So, while we are wrapping up our five years before the job      is finished, we are eager to share our experiences with      others who will continue what we have started. Perhaps the      report on these pages will be of help.       Largely, ours is a story of going in cold to work with a      skeptical bunch of journalists in countries as different as      Estonia is from Albania, as Poland is from Hungary.       ``Why are you here?'' was always question Number One.       It soon became known that although the International Media      Fund was financed largely by U.S. government dollars, it had      a fiercely independent Board of Directors and an army of      volunteer American editors, publishers, broadcasters and      academics willing to join in our effort. From the start is      was understood that the U.S. government would not interfere      with policy decisions of the Board.       Surveys by our own staff soon indicated what we had already      sensed: that it was not going to be possible to try to build      the new media from the top down. The ideological roots of      anyone over 40 were too deeply implanted. So we decided to      build from the bottom up. Training was aimed at younger      newcomers starting to work in the field. We invited local      universities to let us help train      their youngsters, the opinion-molders of tomorrow. And we also helped      establish journalism resource centers to work with college-     age students and professionals--and, yes, wannabees off the      street. At the same time, we did not neglect business      workshops, to help the new independent newspapers and      broadcast stations survive in the competitive marketplaces of      ideas and economics.       We've tried to put some numbers together (including our      work over the last two years in Russia).       By our reckoning:       We conducted 29 workshops for about 1,300 broadcasters.       We arranged 14 special broadcast survey and consultation      trips.       We conducted 13 business workshops for some 650 newspaper      executives.       We held 22 journalism and business workshops, jointly held      for about 1,000 broadcast and newspaper participants.       We established 14 university radio and television training      facilities or stations.       We helped start 16 university student publications.       We worked with 19 Central and Eastern European      universities.       And those figures do not include the participants at the      great many workshops and training courses held at the six      journalism resources centers supported by the Fund, or the      training equipment supplied by the Fund to those centers, or      the participation by Fund representatives as speakers or      discussion leaders in numerous media conferences arranged by      others in the U.S. and Europe.       Our donations of technical equipment is equally impressive.      In fact, the Media Fund is leaving behind a substantial      presence--giant printing presses, computer units, radio      stations, television companies, journalism centers and      university courses, none of which existed five years ago.       But beyond a check list is something more important. Our      hundred or so American volunteer professionals made a lasting      impression whenever they ventured--from Vladivostok in the      east to Prague in the west, from Tallinn in the north to      Tirana in the south, with Warsaw and Bratislva and Bucharest      and other cities in between. And our own small staff, of      course, made all this possible--a vigorous start to a job yet      to be completed. We are leaving the scene early only because      our primary source of funding no longer allows us the freedom      and flexibility to carry out the mission for which we were      created.       The labor of these five years is our legacy from those of      us who have lived in a land with a free press to those      journalist sin other lands who wish to enshrine democracy in      the future.                          ____________________
