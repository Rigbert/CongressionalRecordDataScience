 President, we are again here on Monday afternoon talking about a very important bill that came to the floor last Thursday. That is the investment in infrastructure, transportation, and housing across the country. We have many issues important to many Members who want to get this bill passed and to the President as quickly as possible so we can move forward. My colleague from Missouri and I have worked very hard to put the bill together. We are here this afternoon ready and waiting for our colleagues to offer amendments so we can get to final passage. I know the majority leader wishes us to finish this fairly quickly. We have a number of appropriations bills we want to complete before the end of September deadline. So we ask our colleagues to get their amendments up, and we will move through them as quickly as we can.
