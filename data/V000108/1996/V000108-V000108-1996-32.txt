Speaker, it is the belief of many that we are all put on this Earth for a reason. Mr. Hilbert L. Bradley has accomplished his mission in life after spending a lifetime working unselfishly to improve the lives of citizens in the city of Gary, as well as the entire State of Indiana. In a congratulatory celebration, the community of Indiana's First Congressional District will gather on Sunday, June 23, 1996, for a testimonial dinner to honor Hilbert. This dinner will take place at Marquette on the Lagoon in Gary, IN.  As an attorney dedicated to his profession, and a community activist dedicated to the well-being of others, Hilbert has tirelessly led the fight for equal opportunity, and civil and human rights protections for all people. He has provided legal counsel in landmark civil rights cases, as well as pro bono services for the NAACP. Hilbert is a noted trial lawyer and has had a distinguished career as a deputy prosecutor, corporation counsel, and interim judge and mediator.  In 1987, Hilbert founded the Indiana Coalition for Black Judicial Officials, and he serves as the group's general chairman today. The organization's purpose is to increase the number of black judicial officials in the State of Indiana. The Indiana Coalition for Black Judicial Officials organizes statewide public awareness campaigns which have resulted in an increased number of black referees and judges pro tem, the election of a black judge to the Lake County Superior Court, the appointment of Robert Rucker, the first African-American to serve on the Indiana Court of Appeals, Fifth District, and Myra Selby, the first female and the first African-American to serve on the Indiana Supreme Court.  Hilbert also cofounded the Fair Share Organization in 1958. Its purpose was to assure that black people receive their fair share of the fruits of American democracy. One major accomplishment of the organization was the employment of the first black managers of a major chain store, the A&P, in Gary.  Outside of the legal profession, Hilbert has reached out to several civic organizations. Hilbert's distinguished memberships include: lifetime memberships of the NAACP and the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity; the Urban League of Northwest Indiana; St. Timothy Community Church; Calumet Inn of Court; James C. Kimbrough Law Association; the Lake County Bar Association; the Indiana State Bar Association. He also serves as a board member for the Methodist Hospitals.  Moreover, he has received local and national recognition for having excelled in his profession. In 1994, Hilbert received the National NAACP William Ming Award, the Valparaiso University Black Law Students Association Education and Civil Rights Award, the Omega Psi Phi Inc. Citizen of the Year Award, and the Phi Delta Kappa (Beta Mu Chapter) Outstanding Service and Leadership Award. In 1992, Hilbert was inducted into the Steel City Hall of Fame, and, in 1991 and 1958, he received the NAACP Mary White Ovington Award. Hilbert is the only member to whom the Gary branch has twice presented this award. In 1990, Hilbert was presented with the Gary Frontiers Drum Major Award, the Focus 2000 Great Garyite Award, the NAACP Community Service Award, and the Tolleston Community Council Service Award.  As Hilbert reflects back on his career and community activism, he can hold his head high and be proud of his accomplishments. Hilbert is a true role model for all young professionals and citizens. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in honoring Hilbert Bradley for his unselfish dedication to make Indiana's First Congressional District, as well as the entire Nation, a better place in which to work and live.                          ____________________
