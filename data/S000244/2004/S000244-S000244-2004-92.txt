Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4453, introduced by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran), would extend the program under which foreign doctors can avoid having to return home for 2 years by agreeing to practice in medically underserved areas here in America.  Aliens who participate in medical residencies in the United States on the ``J'' exchange program visas must generally leave the U.S. after the completion of their residencies and reside abroad for at least 2 years. The intent behind the policy is to encourage American-trained foreign doctors to return home to improve health conditions and advance the medical profession in their native countries.  In 1994, Congress created a waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. State departments of public health may request a waiver for foreign doctors who commit to practicing medicine for no less than 3 years in geographic areas designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals. The number of foreign doctors who can receive this waiver is limited to 30 per State each year.  The waiver program has proven to be an important means of ensuring quality medical care in areas of the United States with physician shortages. This bill would extend the program to June 2006. It would also allow each State to place five of the doctors it sponsors each year in areas not designated by HHS as physician-shortage areas.  The bill continues the practice of allowing foreign doctors receiving a waiver to receive an H-1B visa regardless of the H-1B visa quota and will allow doctors receiving waivers to practice specialty medicine.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
