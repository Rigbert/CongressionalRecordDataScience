 When we had this vote in the last Congress, if I recall correctly, we got 48 votes. It wasn't really crystal clear what the excesses were at that time. Now we have documentation of the excesses. We have literally billions of dollars of fraudulent trades, wash trades, round-trip trades, whatever you call them, but fraudulent trades. So we know. We also know that Mr. Fortney was arrested and two others have plead guilty to creating these schemes. To continue to allow that kind of thing to exist would be a real dereliction of this Congress.
