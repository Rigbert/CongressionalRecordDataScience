 President, the conclusion of the General Accounting Office's, GAO, recently released report on Cambodia is deeply troubling--but comes as no surprise to those of us who have long followed developments in that country.  While GAO has noted some progress by the Royal Government of Cambodia, RGC, to implement public finance, military, and land management reforms, the lack of headway in other areas--including legal and judicial, public administration, anticorruption, and forestry management--is glaringly absent.  Until the RGC fully implements legal reforms and embraces the rule of law, the international community has no choice but to consider any and all progress in Cambodia as limited and impermanent.  The obstacles to good governance in Cambodia are many, but the lack of political will by the ruling Cambodian People's Party, CPP, to implement much needed reforms poses the single greatest challenge to meaningful democratic, economic and social development.  The abuses of Prime Minister Hun Sen and the CPP are legion, and it is past time that the international community holds them accountable for their repressive actions. This Senator has not forgotten the many innocent Cambodians killed and injured in the March 1997 grenade attack in Phnom Penh, or the Prey Veng farmers who continue to gather in the capital following massive floods caused by the Cambodian military's rampant illegal logging.  The international community would be wise to hold the RGC accountable not for what it says, but for what it does. In this respect, donors should aggressively and relentlessly push forcredible parliamentary elections next year, through which the Cambodian people can freely choose new leadership.  In the post-September 11 world, America can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to authoritarian and lawless regimes. Just as Cambodia has become a haven for the Asian underworld, America should be concerned that terrorists and their finances will seek refuge in that lawless country.                          ____________________
