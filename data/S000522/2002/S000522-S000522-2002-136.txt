Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, just let me say at the outset, I want to welcome the Bais Faiga Lakewood school eighth grade students who are here and Mrs. Faigy Uhr, who is the assistant principal, notwithstanding the admonishment from the Speaker, and let them know how welcome they are to be here today.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to extend my congratulations in support of the brave and courageous people of East Timor. Yesterday May 20, 2002, was their independence day. East Timor is now officially the first new nation of the third millennium.  The people of East Timor have every right, Mr. Speaker, to be proud of their newly won independence, because their road to freedom was long and arduous, full of intense suffering and death. It entailed not only 400 years of colonial rule, but also 24 years of brutal military occupation by Indonesia that included massacres, forced sterilization, and attempts at cultural annihilation.  Indonesia's tyrannical rule over East Timor reached its zenith during the 1999 Scorched Earth campaign conducted by the Indonesian-backed militia with ties to the Indonesian military. Women were beaten and raped, families were separated, and nearly three-fourths of the nation's infrastructure was destroyed. According to U.N. estimates, over 500,000 people were displaced.  Against tremendous odds, however, the brave people of East Timor persevered and triumphed. Despite terror, beatings and threats from the Indonesian military, the East Timorese people overwhelmingly chose independence in August of 1999. Ninety-eight percent of the eligible population voted, and almost eight out of ten chose independence.  Under almost 3 years of U.N. guidance, they continually embraced democracy with very high voter turnouts, electing an assembly in August of 2001 and on April 14, their first President, their heroic independence leader, Xanana Gusmao.  Mr. Speaker, when I was chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, my good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), and I worked on held hearings on Indonesia and East Timor.                              {time}  1300  I had the privilege of joining Joseph Reese, the general counsel and staff director of the subcommittee, on a visit with Xanana Gusmao in Cipinang prison. I was struck by his sense of poise. He radiated strength and confidence. I was struck by his determination, and his fervent belief that one day East Timor would be an independent, free state where democracy would flourish. I found that even the warden of that prison in Jakarta had an enormous amount of respect and admiration for this man who is now president.  Mr. Speaker, I introduced this resolution, H. Con. Res. 405, and I am very proud that the distinguished Democratic leader, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), also a cosponsor, along with the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), and the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Kennedy) and other Members of this body who have joined us in this effort to say, in a bipartisan way, congratulations on a job well done. I especially want to thank Chairman Henry Hyde for both his strong support of this resolution and his indefatigable and tenacious promotion of human rights everywhere.  Mr. Speaker, while our resolution commemorates East Timor's independence, it also addresses the serious challenges this new nation faces. It is not going to be easy. These include development of a stable economy, holding accountable those who carried out crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide during Indonesia's reign of terror, and caring for those many victims who still suffer tremendously from the scars of war and poverty.  Obviously, the United States has an interest, Mr. Speaker, in ensuring that those who carried out war crimes are brought to justice. Crimes committed against the East Timorese have been well documented by the United Nations and other international organizations, yet most of their perpetrators reside in Indonesia with impunity, while the Indonesian government fails to cooperate with the international justice system.  Indonesia refuses, for example, to extradite alleged war criminals, and the jurisdiction of its own ad hoc tribunal is so severely limited that Indonesian human rights advocates seriously doubt whether the most egregious violators of human rights will be brought to justice. H. Con. Res. 405 expresses deep concern over the lack of justice in the region, and calls on the President to use all diplomatic resources necessary to ensure that those responsible for these grave human rights abuses are held accountable.  Similarly, given the well-documented linkages between human rights abuse in East Timor and the Indonesian military, our resolution expresses the need for continued restrictions on U.S. military assistance and training for Indonesia's military in the Foreign Operations Appropriation Act for fiscal year 2003.  Mr. Speaker, the humanitarian needs of the East Timorese people are as great as anyone in the world. U.S. foreign aid dollars can do much to assist East Timor in developing agricultural programs, building solid education, health care, and judicial systems, aiding refugees, and repairing the country's infrastructure. Our resolution expresses our hope that Congress and the President will adamantly support these endeavors.  I would point out that in fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002, Congress approved approximately $25 million in aid to East Timor. The President's request for 2003 is about $19 million, and my hope is that we can work together with the President in making sure that that which is needed, and it will probably be more than that, the $19 million, will be made available.  Mr. Speaker, several amendments to the original resolution have been submitted today. These amendments commend the President for immediately establishing diplomatic relations with East Timor and include other technical changes made for the sake of clarity.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say that, as Americans, we will forever honor the brave leaders who founded our Nation by fighting valiantly for freedom and democracy, the great ideals we cherish so greatly. They guided a revolution based on these ideals that is continued on through the ages in so many places throughout the world and, in our time, it has been so ably displayed, so nobly, by the East Timorese. The desire to live in freedom cannot be extinguished, and they are again another people who have risen to that challenge to say we will be free.  Again, I want to congratulate the people and also especially President Gusmao on their independence, because they have set another example for those who continue to live under dictatorship to follow.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
