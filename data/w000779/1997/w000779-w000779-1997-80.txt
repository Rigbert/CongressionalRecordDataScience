President, all children should have access to a quality education, regardless of whether they have disabilities. The importance of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] is that it enables parents to acquire special educational assistance for their children who may be fully capable of becoming productive members of society, but may need some extra help along the way. I am pleased that Members of Congress on a bipartisan, bicameral basis have worked out a compromise that allows us to reauthorize this important piece of legislation.  While I generally support the compromise on the IDEA bill that is before us today, I want to touch briefly on an issue that some school nurses have raised with regard to this legislation.  I have heard from many Oregon school nurses about the importance of including nurses in the individual education program [IEP] development process. Under current IDEA regulations, school nurses are considered qualified health professionals and are considered fully capable of assessing a student's disabilities during the IEP process. The school nurses had asked to be mentioned specifically in the statute as ``related service providers'' in a disabled child's multidisciplinary team. While this could not be worked out, I understand that the committee report addresses this issue, and I want to convey my support for the inclusion of school nurses as part of the IEP process.  In this country we frequently underestimate the excellent quality of care provided by this Nation's nurses. School nurses have the training and provide the supervision to safely deliver specialized health services. For children with chronic or special health care needs, the school nurse is often a crucial member of the multidisciplinary team that enables children with disabilities to participate fully in their educational program. As long as they are fully qualified to make an assessment of a child's disability, there should be no reason that localities should discriminate against nurses.  Again, I complement my colleagues for breaking through the logjam on this important reauthorization, and I want to reemphasize my support for the school nurses who play such an important role in the care of children with disabilities.                          personnel standards
