Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1458) to require any Federal or State court to recognize any notarization made by a notary public licensed by a State other than the State where the court is located when such notarization occurs in or affects interstate commerce, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1458       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. RECOGNITION OF NOTARIZATIONS IN FEDERAL COURTS.        Each Federal court shall recognize any lawful notarization      made by a notary public licensed or commissioned under the      laws of a State other than the State where the Federal court      is located if--       (1) such notarization occurs in or affects interstate      commerce; and       (2)(A) a seal of office, as symbol of the notary public's      authority, is used in the notarization; or       (B) in the case of an electronic record, the seal      information is securely attached to, or logically associated      with, the electronic record so as to render the record      tamper-resistant.     SEC. 2. RECOGNITION OF NOTARIZATIONS IN STATE COURTS.        Each court that operates under the jurisdiction of a State      shall recognize any lawful notarization made by a notary      public licensed or commissioned under the laws of a State      other than the State where the court is located if--       (1) such notarization occurs in or affects interstate      commerce; and       (2)(A) a seal of office, as symbol of the notary public's      authority, is used in the notarization; or       (B) in the case of an electronic record, the seal      information is securely attached to, or logically associated      with, the electronic record so as to render the record      tamper-resistant.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Electronic record.--The term ``electronic record'' has      the meaning given that term in section 106 of the Electronic      Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C.      7006).       (2) Logically associated with.--Seal information is      ``logically associated with'' an electronic record if the      seal information is securely bound to the electronic record      in such a manner as to make it impracticable to falsify or      alter, without detection, either the record or the seal      information.
