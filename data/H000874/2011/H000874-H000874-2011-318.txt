Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule not for small reasons of this rule or that rule but because it authorizes trillions of dollars of new debt without paying for it.  There are two ways to create debt: You can buy things and not pay for it, or you can simply cut revenues and make yourself unable to pay for things. Statutory PAYGO was designed to accomplish the objective of having us do what is difficult to do--pay for what we buy. If we are honest with one another, it doesn't matter whether you want to spend or simply cut revenues. If you don't do both--cut spending and either maintain or cut revenues consistent with your cutting of spending--then you will inevitably create new debt.  Now, all of you have heard about my three children, my three grandchildren, and my one great-granddaughter. They, frankly, won't care how the debt was created, whether it was created because we cut revenues but didn't cut spending, which is what happened, of course, in the 2000s, or what happened in the eighties, where we incurred trillions of dollars of additional debt. During the Clinton administration, we didn't do that, and we restrained spending. Our Republican colleagues were very helpful in doing that, obviously, and we continued to pay for what we bought. We created 4 years of surplus. So I oppose this rule because of the trillions of dollars that it will authorize, be incurred in new debt.  Secondly, I oppose this rule, as do my friends from the various territories, from Puerto Rico, from the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, and the Pacific Islands. We talked about, during the course of the campaign, listening to people. We have almost 5 million people who are American citizens. How do we listen to them? We listen to them when their Representatives put their green or red on the board.  I will be introducing a resolution tomorrow, which will be referred to the Rules Committee, and I hope you will consider it.
