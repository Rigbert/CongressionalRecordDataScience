 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to offer this tripartisan amendment which is cosponsored by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Quinn), the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).  This amendment is similar in many ways to an amendment that was passed by voice vote last year, and that passed with 248 votes 2 years ago. This amendment is also supported by a broad coalition of environmental and public interest groups, including the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Public Citizen, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the National Association of State Energy Officials.                              {time}  1245  This amendment accomplishes three primary goals. First, in the midst of the worst energy crisis that this country has faced in 25 years, this amendment adds $24 million to the very successful weatherization program. All over this country, lower income people and senior citizens are wasting huge amounts of energy because their homes are inadequately insulated. While I appreciate the good work of Ranking Members Obey and Dicks and Chairmen Young and Skeen to increase funding for this program from last year, it is still not enough. In fact, the $249 million provided in this bill for weatherization is $24 million less than the President's budget request. In other words, all that we are doing here is funding the weatherization program at the same level the President has requested. I should tell Members that I have been very critical of the President's funding for energy in general.  In addition, Mr. Chairman, this amendment provides an additional $12 million for a number of other energy conservation programs. The various programs have been highly successful in leveraging State and private funds in terms of reducing the energy used by homeowners, schools, hospitals, farmers and others. No one denies that our country can do much more in a wide range of energy conservation efforts, and this additional funding will provide some help in that direction.  Lastly, Mr. Chairman, this amendment also increases the payments in lieu of taxes program by $12 million, something that I and many other Members have been deeply interested in for a number of years. Mr. Chairman, the PILT program was established to address the fact that the Federal Government does not pay taxes on the land that it owns. These Federal lands can include national forests, national parks, fish and wildlife refuges and land owned by the Bureau of Land Management. Like local property taxes, PILT payments are used to pay for school budgets, law enforcement, search and rescue, fire fighting, parks and recreation and other municipal expenses. The PILT program benefits 1,789 counties in 49 States throughout the country. I appreciate the committee's increasing funding for this program. They have. But once again because of woefully inadequate funding in recent years, we have got a long way to go. We cannot talk about respect for local government and then not pay them the amounts of money that we have to.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman).
