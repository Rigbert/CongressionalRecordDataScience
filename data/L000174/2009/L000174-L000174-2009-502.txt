President, I am in complete agreement with the Senator from Arizona that no money should be diverted to Hamas. That is why the omnibus bill already does that. When Senator Gregg and I wrote this bill we included specific provisions. Section 7040(f) of the bill prohibits funding to Hamas, to any entity effectively controlled by Hamas, or to any power-sharing government.  When it comes to what the State Department might do, the State Department lawyers have said they would not do anything differently if the Kyl amendment were adopted, because laws that protect against the diversion of funds to Hamas are already in the bill. You can vote against the Kyl amendment and still be on record as voting for blocking funds to Hamas. Nobody in this body, Republican or Democrat, wants any funds to go to Hamas. This is an unnecessary amendment. I oppose it.
