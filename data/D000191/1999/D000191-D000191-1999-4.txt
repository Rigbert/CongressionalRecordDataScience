Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) for his assistance in drafting and moving this bill through the House. As he pointed out, the need is great. In fact, numbers I have seen estimate that we could spend more than twice the amount of money allocated for these five states in Oregon alone to take care of this problem. So this is not an ultimate solution, but it is a down payment and something that will help us move along in protecting these fish in the Pacific Northwest and in northern California.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson).
