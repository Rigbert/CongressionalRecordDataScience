 President, I rise to pay tribute to Northern Kentucky University's Metropolitan Education and Training Services, METS, program. The ceremony to formally dedicate the METS center is scheduled for this morning in Boone County, KY.  The rapid rate of economic growth in the Northern Kentucky / Cincinnati metropolitan area has created a need for better-trained workers. In an attempt to address this problem, Northern Kentucky University has developed an innovative partnership with the Tri-County Economic Development Corporation, the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, and Delta Air Lines. The partnership ensures that the workforce has the skills needed to promote the region's growth.  Businesses that need educational services or a certain skill-set for its employees can contact METS, who will work with Northern Kentucky University to design the appropriate curriculum. If Northern Kentucky University does not offer a particular set of classes, METS arranges for students to take classes at other institutions via the Internet or Tele-conferencing.  The opening of this new state-of-the-art corporate training center is exciting for the region's business community and Northern Kentucky University. I am confident that METS can serve as a model for rapidly growing metropolitan communities, and I am pleased that this facility is in the Commonwealth. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the official dedication of Northern Kentucky University's METS center.                          ____________________
