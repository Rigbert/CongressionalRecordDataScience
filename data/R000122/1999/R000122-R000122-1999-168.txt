President, I rise today to recognize the achievement of St. Philomena School of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, which was recently honored as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School.  It is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School. Through an intensive selection process beginning at the state level and continuing through a federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, 266 of the very best public and private schools in the nation were identified as deserving this special recognition. These schools are particularly effective in meeting local, state, and national goals. However, this honor signifies not just who is best, but what works in educating today's children.  Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to reach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and that we make their education come alive. That is what St. Philomena School is doing. St. Philomena is a kindergarten through eighth grade school that emphasizes student achievement.  Since opening in 1953, much has changed for St. Philomena. For a brief time, it offered a comprehensive education from elementary through high school. But since the late 1960s, St. Philomena has focused exclusively on elementary education, and its students have benefitted from this wise decision. While the school has grown in size--adding four new buildings to its facilities, its administration and faculty have taken a personalized approach to each student's education.  Mr. President, St. Philomena is dedicated to the highest standards. It is a school committed to a process of continuous improvement not only for students but for teachers as well. Indeed, St. Philomena's teachers hone their skills as educators by continuously pursuing educational opportunities of their own.  Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very best we can do for students and the techniques that can be replicated in other schools to help all students succeed. I am proud to say that in Rhode Island we can look to a school like St. Philomena. Under the leadership of its principal, Sister Ann Marie Walsh, its capable faculty, and its involved parents, St. Philomena School will continue to be a shining example for years to come.                          ____________________
