Speaker, Rheta Long is survived by a large and loving family, including her daughter, Valerie Tramel; son, John; sisters, Wilda York and Leona Thompson; and grandsons, Kenneth and Christopher Tramel, and Nicholas Long. Rheta was preceded in death by her husband of 11 years, Thomas; her brothers Earl and Andrew Dean Bender; father, Andrew Bender; and grandson, John Thomas. Rheta was 60.  Rheta was born in Guymon, OK. She attended Guymon High School and graduated in 1952. Afterwards, she attended Panhandle State College and Phillips University to study education. She earned a bachelor of science degree in education in 1955.  Rheta was married in the summer of 1955 and dedicated herself to her family and church. She was an active volunteer with the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America. In 1968, Rheta began teaching mathematics in Guymon and found the experience rewarding. She said it was a pleasure to show children that school and learning could be fun.  Rheta began her 20-year Federal career in 1974 as a military personnel clerk with the U.S. Army. In 1978, Rheta transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Guymon, OK, to take a clerical position. Rheta came to APHIS in Oklahoma City in October 1982, where she served as a program clerk. She handled workers' compensation claims, and was the final authority on payment eligibility for indemnity claims. She was very active in the Federal Employees Women's Group and Equal Employment Opportunities Committees. Rheta had a vision disability and she served as the Persons with Disabilities Special Emphasis Program Manager as a means of helping educate people about the challenges of working with a physical handicap.  Rheta was active with the Christian Women's Foundation and looked forward to the Jewel Box Theater's seasonal plays. A devoted grandmother, Rheta was very proud of her grandchildren and kept snapshots of them at her desk. Her dedication, cheerful attitude, and many contributions to the effectiveness of the office helped many of her coworkers in their time of need. She will be greatly missed by all.  Mr. Speaker, the members of the Committee on Agriculture, the chair of [[Page H5570]] the Committee on Agriculture, the distinguished chairman emeritus of the Committee on Agriculture, and the gentleman from Oklahoma, [Mr. Lucas], share in the sense of personal loss and share in the sense of personal pride regarding the contribution of these employees. Perhaps an appropriate closing is this from Helen Steiner Rice.     When I must leave you for a little while,     Please go on bravely with a gallant smile     And for my sake and in my name,     Live on and do all things the same--     Spend not your life in empty days,     But fill each waking hour in useful ways--     Reach out your hand in comfort and cheer,     And I in turn will comfort you and hold you near.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for taking this special time.  Mr. de la GARZA. I thank my distinguished colleague.  Mr. Speaker, if I might add a personal note, we notice that Mr. Bloomer served at the screwworm eradication plant in Mission, TX, the years when my father worked there, so I feel certain that they knew each other in those days and they have already found each other up there and they are talking about the good old days at the plant in Mission.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my two colleagues. The seven that we lost not only belonged to APHIS, to USDA, they belonged to our Nation and they belong now to all of us. May they rest in peace.                          ____________________
