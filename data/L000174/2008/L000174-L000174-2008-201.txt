President, just one other point, if I might. Was the majority leader aware that on at least a couple of occasions, for circuit court of appeals judges, when I came back from Vermont during a recess to hold a hearing at the request of Republicans because they were anxious to get these court of appeals judges through, that the Republicans then criticized me for coming back and holding the hearings and getting them confirmed? Is the leader aware of that?
