 President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed S. 1525, the ``Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act of 1998.''  Last congress, the Senate passed the ``Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act''--led by Senators Specter and Kohl and co-sponsored by myself and nearly every member of the Judiciary Committee. This law provides for the education of the spouse and dependent children of federal law enforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of duty.  The purpose of the legislation was to remove a significant financial burden from the families of these deceased officers and to allow them to continue on the educational path they would have followed had their parent or spouse not been killed in the line of duty.  Last fall, about 30 young men and women were able to go to college under this program. Unfortunately, this program is only available to the children of federal law enforcement officers.  The Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act, which Senator Specter and I introduced last year, extends these same educational benefits to the dependents of all public safety officers--in other words, not just federal--but also state, county and local law enforcement officers, and fire and rescue personnel--who have given their lives in the line of duty.  Under this bill, the Attorney General will administer a program which will provide up to $4,485 per child, per year to attend a 4-year college. This is the same amount of educational assistance the federal government provides to veterans.  The Justice Department estimates the total cost for this year to be about $300,000. What is more, the Justice Department already has the funds to pay for this $300,000 within their current budget--so we will not need any additional appropriations.  It is critical that we remember the families of those officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe. This bill is intended to allow the dependents of public safety officers to continue with their education as they would have been able to do had their parent not been killed or totally disabled in the line of duty.                          ____________________
