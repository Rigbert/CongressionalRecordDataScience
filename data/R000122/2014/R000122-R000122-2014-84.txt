I particularly wish to thank Senator Heller, whose leadership from the beginning has been instrumental, as well as Senator Collins, whose leadership, wise counsel, and thoughtful proposals have been one of the really strong forces sustaining our efforts throughout. I also thank Senator Portman, who has consistently thought about progressive changes for our training programs so that people are better prepared for jobs, as well as Senator Murkowski for her support, and Senator Kirk, both of them valuable contributors. I thank all of my colleagues today who came forward.  This is not the end of the story, but it is an important step forward for over 2 million Americans who are looking desperately for work, who need the benefits, and who will contribute to our economy.  With that, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.
