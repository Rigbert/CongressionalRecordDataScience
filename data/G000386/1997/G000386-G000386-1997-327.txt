  On January 28, I spoke here on the floor about irresponsible financial accounting policies being pursued over at the Department of Defense. This policy is the responsibility of the chief financial officer at the Pentagon. The person holding that position now is Mr. John Hamre, but it would be applicable to anybody holding this position. The chief financial officer is supposed to be tightening internal controls and improving financial accounting. That is exactly why we passed, in 1990, the Chief Financial Officer's Act. Mr. Hamre should be cleaning up the books at the Pentagon and watching the money like a hawk. If that had been the case, we would not need to have a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, if we had been doing that properly over the last 25 years.  Sadly, the job is not being done. To make matters worse, the bureaucrats are pushing a new policy on progress payments that will loosen internal controls and cook the books. This new policy is embodied in draft bill language that was being circulated in the Pentagon for review as recently as January 30. I expressed my concerns about the new policy in my statement on January 28. In a nutshell, this is what I said then and it is still appropriate today:  I am afraid that this new draft language would subvert the appropriations process that is so key to keeping tight control on how the taxpayers' dollars are expended by the Congress of the United States.  I even alerted the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to the bad aspects of this language. The new language is not one bit constructive. It would not fix Defense's crumbling accounting system. It would merely condone and perpetuate crooked bookkeeping practices.  Since raising this issue here on the floor, I have exchanged letters with Mr. Hamre. I ask unanimous consent that correspondence be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Under Secretary of Defense,                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 1997.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I was astounded yesterday to see      that you went to the floor of the Senate to personally attack      me. You made no effort to discuss your concerns with me      either directly or through your staff. You did not contact me      to ask me to explain my position on a draft proposal      circulating within the Department for comment. And the      ``concerned citizen'' you cite in your letter who provided      this information has never contacted me. This was a Pearl      Harbor attack, and I am very disappointed in it.       Frankly, we have done more in the past 3 years to clean up      financial management problems in the Department than anyone      else has done in the past 30 years. Secretary Perry deserves      high praise for making this a priority. I have certainly      dedicated myself to this task. You can ask any objective      individual in town and they would tell you we have made      enormous progress.       In the past 3 years we have closed over 230 inefficient      accounting offices and consolidated them into new operating      locations with improved business practices and equipment. We      have closed over 300 payroll offices and transferred accounts      from some 25 old outdated payroll systems into a new modern      system with a 500 percent improvement in productivity. We      have reduced problem disbursements by over 70 percent in 3      years. We have instituted new policies that freeze activity      on accounts that are in deficient status, and I am forcing      the Services to obligate funds to cover negative unliquidated      obligations. We are prevalidating all disbursements of funds      for all new contracts and have lowered the prevalidation      threshold on existing contracts.       Yet without even offering to discuss the issue with me, you      blast me from the floor of the Senate, claiming I am ``ready      to throw in the towel'' on financial management reform. That      is nonsense, and I am disappointed that you would suggest it.      I don't blame you personally. I worked for the Senate for 10      years and I know how busy Senators are. I know that you are      often given material by staff who represent the fact as      correct. But it is disappointing that you would not even ask      me to come over to discuss it with you. After you had heard      my side, it would be perfectly fair for you to blast me if      you still disagreed. But you didn't even ask me to meet with      you.       For the record, the language which you criticized has      nothing to do with the M account as you allege. It would not      ``thumb our nose'' at the appropriations process or the law      as you state in your speech. It would not pool funds at the      contract level. This language merely clarified that progress      payments are a financing device to lower borrowing costs. In      their 40 year history, progress payments were never designed      to do anything other than finance a contract. Every progress      payment we make is linked directly to the source funds      identified to the contract, and detailed audits are conducted     before the contract is closed. We don't reimburse contractors      for the full costs they incur precisely to guarantee that we      don't overpay contractors. This language was designed to      clarify a problem we have with progress payments. Progress      payments cannot be linked to funding sources unless the      acquisition community mandates that every contractor in the      country change its accounting systems to accommodate DoD      fiscal law prohibitions and invoice us in terms of      congressional appropriation categories. That would not be      good business sense and violates the underlying purpose of      progress payments.       Next time, Senator Grassley, please contact me first before      you attack me on the floor of the Senate. You actually set      back financial management reform by your attacks because      people pull back from actions just to avoid the criticism.           Sincerely,     John J. Hamre.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1997.     Hon. John J. Hamre,     Under Secretary of Defense, 1100 Defense Pentagon,          Washington, DC.       Dear John: I am writing in response to your letter of      January 29, 1997, expressing anger and disappointment about      my recent speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the      lack of ``Accountability at the Department of Defense.''       Your anger and disappointment seem to flow from one main      source. You think I made no effort to discuss this matter      with you before blasting you on the floor of the Senate. You      state, and I quote:       ``You made no effort to discuss your concerns with me      either directly or through your staff. You did not contact me      to ask me to explain my position on a draft proposal      circulating within the Department for comment.''       John, that statement is totally false, and I demand an      apology.       As soon as the draft language on progress payments came to      my attention, my staff contacted your personal office      directly at 703-695-3237 to express concern about it. That      was the very first thing we did. My staff was informed that      you were out of the building on travel and to call Navy      Captain Mike Nowakowski, one of your congressional liaison      officers. That was done immediately. Initially, on January      14th, Captain Nowakowski reported that he could find no trace      of the draft language on progress payments but indicated that      he would keep looking. At that time, my staff communicated my      grave concerns about the proposal in detail, including a      warning that I would go to ``battle stations'' if this      language was, in fact, under active consideration. When      Captain Nowakowski was unable to locate the language, I was      able to obtain a copy elsewhere. My office faxed the document      to him at 4:03 pm on January 14th. During a subsequent      conversation on January 22nd, Captain Nowakowski confirmed      that the language was indeed under review within the      department. He also told me that he had personally briefed      you on all my concerns.       John, those are the facts. The facts show that I did      everything humanly possible to communicate my concerns      directly to you. Your letter is out of line and inconsistent      with the facts.       Furthermore, I believe Captain Nowakowski is telling the      truth. He briefed you in detail about my concerns. He made      that statement on January 22nd and reconfirmed it again this      morning. I shared my concerns with you--as best I could      through that unresponsive and cumbersome bureaucracy that is      your office. So why did you say I made no effort to discuss      my concerns with you either directly or indirectly through my      staff? And why didn't you react and respond to my concerns?      You should have called me and asked to see me. My door is      always open to you.       John, you know that when I am disturbed about some      development at the Pentagon, I usually go to the floor and      talk about it. My staff informed one of your other      congressional liaison officers--``Hap'' Taylor--that I was      planning to do exactly that. When I do it, it is usually an      unpleasant experience for some. But it's unpleasant only for      those who fail to be responsible and accountable for the      taxpayers' money. Since I am not a member of the Armed      Services Committee, I think of the floor as my committee      forum for defense issues.       John, you owe me two things. First, you owe me an      explanation. If Captain Nowakowski is tell the truth--and I      believe he is, then you need to explain the inaccurate      assertions in your letter. Second, you owe me an apology.       I look forward to your response.           Sincerely,                                               Charles E. Grassley     U.S. Senator.                                  ____                                   Under Secretary of Defense,                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1997.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I have received your January 30      letter demanding an apology. I am sorry that I won't do that      because I believe I am the wronged party. You blasted me on      the floor of the Senate and I wrote you a personal letter. It      seems to me that a modicum of decency would hold that if you      intend to criticize me by name on the floor of the Senate, I      should have a chance to talk with you first before you do      that. Yet you didn't do that.       You state in your letter ``I did everything humanly      possible to communicate my concerns directly to you.'' I      really don't know how you can conclude that. On two separate      occasions in the past I had breakfast with you. I have spoken      with you in previous occasions on the phone and at hearings.      I have repeatedly stated my willingness to meet with you at      any time. You have written me numerous letters and I have      written back. Yet on this occasion you did not call my      office, you did not ask me to come to meet with you, you did      not send me a letter outlining your concerns.       My staff aid, Captain Nowakowski, told me that your      staffer, Mr. Charles Murphy, had a copy of this language and      ``had some serious concerns.'' At the time the document was      in circulation for comment and did not represent Department      policy. It is still in the coordination stage. We hadn't      decided on what to do yet, so it was inappropriate to respond      to a staff call expressing concerns on something that the      Department had not adopted. Even then, Charlie (whom I have      known for 10 years and consider a friend) didn't call me or      ask to meet with me to relay your concerns.       Senator, I do respect you, but I owe you no apologies.           Sincerely,     John J. Hamre                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 1997.     Hon. Ted Stevens,     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Ted: I am writing to express concern about a      legislative proposal that is under consideration within the      Department of Defense (DOD).       This provision, if approved, would significantly loosen      controls over progress payments. DOD progress payments total      about $20 billion per year. A copy of the proposed language      is attached.       First, the Inspector General (IG) has been keeping a close      eye on this whole problem for a number of years. IG audit      reports consistently show that the department regularly      violates the laws that the proposed language would undo. This      is like legalizing the crime--instead of trying to fix the      problem.       Second, this proposal is inconsistent with Comptroller      Hamre's commitment to begin the process of matching      disbursements with obligations before a payment is made. In      last year's Report No. 104-286 (pages 18-19), your Committee      directed Mr. Hamre to develop a detailed plan, including      dollar thresholds and milestones, for eliminating all problem      disbursements. The attached language would put that whole      idea on a back burner indefinitely.       Third, the attached language would subvert the      appropriations process. If DOD is to be authorized to merge      and pool acquisition monies--R and procurement funds--at      the contract level, then Congress must make some kind of      corresponding adjustment in the way those monies are      appropriated. To do otherwise might make the appropriations      process irrelevant somewhere down the road.       I would like to ask you to urge Mr. Hamre to reconsider the      attached proposal and search for a better way to solve the      problem. Ted, there is obviously a problem in the payments      process. We need to understand the problem before we try to      fix it.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                     U.S. Senator.
