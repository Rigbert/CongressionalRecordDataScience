I compliment the gentlelady for her determination. She has really worked this amendment hard on more than one occasion. The House has already spoken on this issue. When we considered earlier H.R. 1, this amendment was defeated by more than 100 votes, 448-281.  But this is a recruiting tool. I don't think any of us want to go back to a draft. I think we like the fact that we have an all-volunteer service. But if you feel an all-volunteer service means you have got to recruit, then you use more than just NASCAR or sporting events or advertising in newspapers to gain recruits so that we can have an all-volunteer military, as opposed to a conscripted, drafted military.  The Army National Guard estimated that it engaged more than 83,000 prospects in the year 2010. The Air Force reports that their NASCAR sponsorship is the second-highest source of accessions of all event sports sponsorships. The Army expects that they will, this year, engage 28,700 prospects and gain access to 182 schools through its sponsorship of NASCAR.  Now, the gentlelady, as I said, is persistent. She uses the occasion to mention the fact that the Marine Corps does not use sporting, does not use NASCAR for recruiting. Which is true. But that is not a reason why we should discontinue the program. The Navy and the Marine Corps do not sponsor motorsports, NASCAR. But they both use the sponsorship of sporting events as part of their recruiting programs. The Navy is a sponsor of the X Games, while the Marine Corps sponsors a variety of events, including the Ultimate Fighting Championship.  The fact of the matter is we spend a lot of money for recruiting, and the recruiting for our programs that are successful ought to be continued and should not be denied for whatever the reason that someone objects to using the money for sponsoring race car vehicles.  The National car took seventh place, by the way, in Daytona this past weekend. And not only do we get the sponsorship, the excitement of the crowds and many of whom go to the recruiting stations, but we get newspaper coverage for free, we get television coverage for free, coverage that we don't have to pay for because of these events that we do sponsor.  So, as we did in the Appropriations Committee, and as we did on H.R. 1 earlier in this year, I just hope that we will, once again, defeat this amendment, and I rise in opposition to this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  2240  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Minnesota will be postponed.                   Amendment Offered by Ms. McCollum  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the      following:       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may      be provided to the Task Force for Business and Stability      Operations in Afghanistan or used to carry out section 9012.  Ms. McCOLLUM (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Minnesota?  There was no objection.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, Section 9012 of this Defense appropriations bill contains language authorizing the Pentagon, under the direction and control of the Secretary of Defense, to operate a task force for business and stability operations in Afghanistan.  The bill provides $150 million to the Secretary of Defense to operate this business task force. Our brave military men and women have been in Afghanistan for 10 long years confronting the Taliban, killing terrorists, and helping secure a better future for the Afghan people.  When in the course of this long war did it become the Department of Defense's role to facilitate business opportunities for Afghan and foreign companies?  Is it really within the Pentagon's expertise or mission to excel at business development, farming, or mineral exploration?  This bill gives the Department of Defense authorization to carry out ``projects that include private investment, industrial development, banking and financial system development, agricultural diversification and revitalization, energy development in and with respect to Afghanistan.''  Afghanistan is an active war zone.  American servicemembers are under attack and our Department of Defense should be solely focused on their security. The Pentagon's focus should not be on starting up businesses or facilitating business development tours for corporate CEOs. Economic development is an important part of America's overall strategy in Afghanistan, but that is the role of civilian agencies like USAID, the Department of State, or the Department of Commerce.  Congress needs to invest in America's civilian capacity to carry out this function. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in this House does not believe international development activities are a component of national security. If they did, they would not cut vital foreign assistance capacity and programs.  Every House Member needs to ask why the Pentagon is supporting the development of the Afghan carpet industry while U.S. soldiers are under attack. Afghan carpets should not be a strategic priority for the Department of Defense.  Every House Member needs to ask why the Department of Defense is helping Kate Spade, an exclusive New York handbag designer, to source raw materials in Afghanistan? Since when did the Pentagon invest taxpayer dollars in promoting women's fashion?  The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense described his role in heading up the task force in The Washington Post: ``We do capitalism. We're about helping companies make money.''  Colleagues, helping companies make money is not the role of the Department of Defense. This is the worst example of mission creep. It is up to Congress to perform its oversight duty and rein in the Pentagon.  Getting people to work in Afghanistan is important. Afghans who are working on farms, in factories, in functioning government ministries, and in the police and military are likely not shooting at our troops. But this report that accompanied the Defense authorization bill that passed in May said it best, and I quote from the Defense authorization bill: ``The function of private sector business development falls outside of the core competency of the Department of Defense.''  The House Armed Services Committee's report went on to further state: ``The mission of TFBSO should eventually fall under the jurisdiction of a different agency, likely USAID or possibly the Department of Commerce.''  The Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan and its $150 million budget should not be funded and not authorized in the Defense authorizations bill. This function and this money belongs in the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill.  This task force is another example of the militarization of foreign assistance that diverts the Pentagon from its core mission of security and war fighting. It also dangerously blurs the line between military-affiliated personnel in a war zone and civilian personnel carrying out development activities.  America needs the Department of Defense to take care of its top priority: ensuring the national security of our country. We all know there will be fewer and fewer military personnel in Afghanistan in the coming months. Troops stationed in Afghanistan will be in increasing danger. We must allow those troops to focus on their security mission.  If the Secretary of Defense truly believes business development and the work of the task force is vital to national security, then the Pentagon can contract with professionals at USAID to carry out this function.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and get the business development and cooperative investment support out of the Pentagon.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
