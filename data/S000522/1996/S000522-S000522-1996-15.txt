Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 515, offered by my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], who has been a tireless ally in defending the helpless, the imprisoned, the enslaved, and the persecuted, particularly persecuted Christians. I want to commend my colleague for authoring this legislation and recognizing the modern-day travesty of religious intolerance, imprisonment, and increasingly, the growing numbers of people who are martyrs.  In recent years, Pakistani Christian Javid Mashi was martyred; Iranian Christians, including Bishop Haik, have been killed and martyred by those regimes; Catholic and Protestant Church leaders in China, as well as ordinary believers, are regularly being arrested, regularly being beaten and fined by the dictatorship.  I have led three human rights trips to the People's Republic of China, Mr. Speaker. I have seen people in this country, the community that has made it to this country and gotten asylum, and also people who have risked much to tell stories in China itself, about the incredible repression that the house church movement and the Catholic Church that is aligned with Rome endures on behalf of their belief in Christ. It is unbelievable, the beatings, the middle of the night visits by the security police, who drag them off to be interrogated, and then the long incarcerations for their faith.  As a matter of fact, we met with one bishop who is aligned with Rome who actually celebrated mass in his apartment, only to be arrested and then get thrown back into prison for that expression of his religious belief, having already spent more than a dozen years in incarceration because of his faith.  We see that the same thing is happening in Vietnam. There are a number of believers who are not aligned with officially recognized churches, which are controlled by the dictatorship, who are languishing in prison and often being tortured and imprisoned for their faith.  Mr. Speaker, the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, which I chair, held a series of hearings in the springtime on religious persecution, and we spent an entire day looking at the rising tide of persecution against Christians.                              {time}  1700  The most compelling stories at that hearing and those that were submitted to us came from the actual victims who told us of the sufferings and of what they had endured. Persecution occurs in countries including Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, and Turkey, where Government policies repress religious practice and where Islamic extremists stir public uprisings against Christians, particularly those who seek to share their faith and perhaps to witness for Christ or those who convert from Islam to Christianity. People can be killed simply for changing their faith. Where is the religious freedom in those countries where that is practiced?  Persecution also occurs, as I said, in the People's Republic of China, in Cuba, in Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam, where Communist regimes feel threatened by Christians whose faith ultimately transcends the reach and control of political authorities.  In many parts of the world, those in political power rightly see that the inner freedom and human dignity inherent in the Christian faith undermines the pervasive thought control imposed by those dictatorial regimes. Tragically, the testimony heard by our subcommittee confirmed that in countries governed by antidemocratic andanti-Western regimes, Christians even become the scapegoats and as a means to vent and popularize hatred of the West and of the United States.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the worldwide persecution of Christians continues to this day, and regrettably it is on the rise, one of the most compelling human rights issues in modern times. The martyrdom of Christians has reached absolutely staggering and shocking levels in this century. People of conscience have committed themselves to prayer and to action on behalf of those who are suffering.  I commend the National Association of Evangelicals for their clarion call to action. Pope John Paul II earlier this year denounced the persecution of Christians by Islamic extremists and by Communist regimes. The World Evangelical Fellowship has spearheaded an international day of prayer for the persecuted church. The first annual day of prayer is set for Sunday, September 29.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] has raised all of our attention for years to this. I have traveled with him to such disparate places as the PRC and Romania, and we have seen persecuted Christians. This is another manifestation of his concern for our suffering brethren. I hope everybody votes for this and supports it and joins in this effort to provide freedom and some help for our suffering brethren.
