 The Senator is the ranking member of the Budget Committee. He has heard my point. Let me make it again.  My friend from New Hampshire, from the other side of the Connecticut River, says we have a progressive system. My God, those rich people are paying a fortune. Well, wealthy people do pay a lot. Do you know why? The richest people in this country are earning far more than they used to, while the middle class is shrinking and poverty is increasing. For example, according to Forbes magazine, the collective net worth of the wealthiest 400 Americans increased by $290 billion last year--400 families, $290 billion. The wealthiest 1 percent earn more income than the bottom 50 percent. Yes, my friend from New Hampshire, I do know they pay more in taxes. The reason is, they get all of the money.  Every economist understands that in recent years what has been going on is the middle class is shrinking, real income is going down, and poverty is increasing. The rich are making out like bandits. Yes, they are paying more in taxes because they are making a huge amount more. That is not progressive taxation. What that is about is the fact that we have the most unfair distribution of wealth and income of any major nation on Earth.  I ask my friend, don't you agree with me? That is my question. Of course, you do.
