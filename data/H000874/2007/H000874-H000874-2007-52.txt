 Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will not be in session so that we can observe Veterans Day in honor of those who have sacrificed for our country, served our country so ably and well, and to remember those who have paid the ultimate price for our freedoms that we enjoy today.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 for morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business and 9 a.m. on Friday. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills, of course, will be announced by the close of business today.  Under rules, we expect to consider H.R. 3915, Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, and the conference report on H.R. 1429, Improving Head Start Act. In addition, we hope to be able to consider additional conference reports as they become available. And in light of the fact it's our last week before the Thanksgiving break, if there are other items that come to our attention, we will try to move those forward as well. But we don't have notice of those at this point in time.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
