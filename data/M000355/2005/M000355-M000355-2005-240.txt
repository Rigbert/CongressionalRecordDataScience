 President, a provision of the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act conference report was intended to transfer certain funds. Unfortunately, an error in drafting made that transfer ineffective. It was clearly the intent of the conferees on that act to provide for the transfer of certain unobligated and unexpended balances to the University of Alaska. We will be taking steps to correct that error at the earliest possible opportunity.  Before the Senate votes on this conference report, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to Deb Fiddelke at the White House and Michael Allen at the National Security Council for their helpful input and insights into the State Department portion of this bill and the fiscal year 2006 foreign operations and related programs conference report. I appreciate the many courtesies they extend to my staff.  Finally, Secretary Rice and the entire State Department should be aware of the outstanding job Cindy Chang performed in conveying the priorities of the Secretary--indeed, the President--regarding funding for the State Department and our foreign aid programs. My staff and I appreciate the solid working relationship that Cindy has developed with the State Department, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Subcommittee, and she remains vigilant in support of the President's foreign policy agenda.                          ____________________[Page S12940]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA  Mr. McCONNELL.
