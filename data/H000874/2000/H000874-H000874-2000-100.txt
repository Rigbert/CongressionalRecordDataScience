Speaker, this is a bad proposal. It is not entitled ``supply side economics,'' it is not entitled ``voodoo economics,'' however, this tax bill we are debating today and its reckless siblings threaten to pull the plug on our unprecedented prosperity and plunge us right back into the dark days of budget deficits.  Even worse, this bill today is a direct threat to the Medicare Trust Fund. To the extent we take funds out of the general fund, they are funds we cannot use to pay down the debt. And to the extent that our extrinsic debt does not go down, our intrinsic debt is tougher. Over the next 10 years, it will drain $117 billion from Medicare. Hear me now: This bill would drain over the next 10 years $117 billion from Medicare.  Whatever shell game my colleagues may argue, those are the facts. Every Member of this House knows the real danger of this bill becomes clear when it is added to the tax cuts we have already passed: $900 billion plus. My colleagues, be fiscally responsible, protect Medicare, and vote against this bill.
