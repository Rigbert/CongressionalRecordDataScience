 President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, we had a vigorous discussion at lunch about moving forward on this bill. I think I am safe in saying that the overwhelming majority of the members of the Republican caucus would like to have been voting today on amendments; nevertheless, that appears not to be possible. So at least we can debate these three amendments and get started in that way. I think that is a step in the right direction.
