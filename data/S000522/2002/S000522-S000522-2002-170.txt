Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume just to thank our professional staff again for the hard work that they have done on all of these bills before us. I especially want to call the attention of the House to, and thank, Mrs. Kimberly Cowins, who will be leaving the committee's majority staff at the end of this month for a new opportunity in Southern California.  Mrs. Cowins has been the consummate professional as a staff member of our Subcommittee on Health of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. She was instrumental in our work last year that led to passage of the Homeless Assistance and Health Care Benefits Acts, and she has been a major contributor this year to the health legislation that we are considering today.  Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Cowins devoted 10 years in serving as a medic in the United States Navy, including duty at facilities in Great Lakes, Jacksonville, Corpus Christi, my own facility of Lakehurst, New Jersey, and Orlando Navy hospitals.  After leaving active duty, she worked in the health care systems of the VA and in the private sector prior to joining our staff. She holds a bachelor's degree in biology from Ryder University, which used to be in my district, and a master's in public administration from Texas A University.  Mrs. Cowins is returning to the Navy in San Diego as the business manager of pediatrics at the Balboa Navy Hospital. Mr. Speaker, Balboa's gain is a significant loss for our committee, because of her intelligence, positive attitude, experience and good humor.  We wish Mrs. Cowins and her family every blessing under heaven, and good fortune in her future endeavors. We know with confidence she will achieve the same level of excellence in her work at Balboa Navy Hospital as she did in her congressional service to America's veterans.                             General Leave
