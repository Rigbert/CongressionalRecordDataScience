President, at approximately 11:20 a.m., Senators should expect a series of up to three rollcall votes. Those votes will be in relation to two DeMint motions to suspend the rules and on the motion to concur with the Murray amendment on FMAP and teacher funding with respect to H.R. 1586.  Tomorrow, the majority leader would like to reach agreements to consider the child nutrition bill and to vote on confirmation of the nomination of Elena Kagan to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.                          ____________________
