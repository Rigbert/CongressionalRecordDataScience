Speaker, so the public understands and our colleagues understand, what I indicated was that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), the ranking Democrat on this committee, who has been here over a quarter of a century, wants to offer an amendment that was supported in the committee; and he has been precluded from offering that amendment.  To that extent, the Republicans have undermined the free and fair debate on this floor. That was my point. And I believe I was absolutely correct.
