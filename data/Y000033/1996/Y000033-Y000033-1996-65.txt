Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I ask only, I would suggest to our friend, the gentleman from California, Mr. Miller, all I am asking in this legislation is, let the Congress, the House of the people, have some say. I cannot, for the life of me, see why anyone would object.  Members have not heard me attack the U.N. I am very reasonably attacking those agencies that actually implement and instigate the heritage areas. All I am asking for is for us to play a role.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. Cooley].
