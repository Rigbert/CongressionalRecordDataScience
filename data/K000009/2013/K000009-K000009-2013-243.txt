Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a woman of remarkable achievement, Karen Krause, of Toledo Ohio. This weekend I was privileged to join Karen as a 2013 honoree of Progress Ohio, from which she received the Barbara Klass Sokol Award. The award is given to a person who embodies the Columbus, Ohio activist's ``high level of energy, humanitarianism, love of the arts, concern for the environment; who cared deeply about good government and spent a great deal of time and effort working to get good people elected at the state and local level, who was a champion for a fair and just society for all.'' Though this description is of the activist herself, it could just as easily have been written in describing Karen Krause, a woman who has spent her life defining public service.  After graduating from Toledo's Whitmer High School, Karen received her nursing training from the Maumee Valley Hospital School of Nursing. She went on to obtain her undergraduate degree from the University of Toledo and a Masters of Public Health Degree from the University of Michigan. She also attended the University of Toledo Law School.  Karen began her public service on the front lines, as a public health nurse with the Lucas County Health Department. Though her jobs changed, Karen never left the front lines in service to Ohio's vulnerable people. Karen became the Director of Nursing for the Lucas County Health Department in 1967 and remained at the helm until 1993. During part of those years she also served as a consultant to the Ohio Department of Health. Her advice and counsel was sought by many as an expert on matters of health care.  Following her ``retirement'' from the health department, Karen became the principal consultant at Community Health Consulting. She also served as Executive Director of the Mildred Bayer Clinic for two years. Rounding out her public service, Karen lent herself as Executive Director of Toledo District Nurses Association, Ohio AFL-CIO NWO Retiree Coordinator, Ohio Health Policy Consultant in the 2004 Presidential Campaign, Social Justice Chair of Toledo Area Jobs with Justice, and as President of AFSCME Retirees in Wood & Lucas Counties. All the while she has served 32 different organizations in various ways. She has been wise counsel to myself and many others, sharing her knowledge of health careand the need for affordable, available coverage. As if that isn't enough, Karen has also given to our community as a one of the most capable and caring elected officials, having served on the Lucas County Educational Service Center since election in 1999 and on which she has served four terms as Board President.  Throughout, Karen has opened her heart and home to others. Those young people are now grown with children of her own, and Karen is now a proud grandma. We share with her family our pride in her accomplishments and in the receipt of the honor most recently bestowed. The Barbara Klass Sokol Award is a special award and this year it has been given to a very special woman.  Karen Krause's legacy in our community runs deep. As was noted when the presentation was made this weekend, Karen is truly ``a champion of the people,'' a mantle she wears most humbly. She has travelled a path of her own and brought up many others along the way. Her servant's heart is her true gift, and one she has shared willingly in more than fifty years of public service. She has truly practiced Christ's Word that ``Whatsover you do to the least among you, that you do unto me.'' Her efforts have earned her the respect of those of us lucky enough to call her friend. This weekend's recognition was a chance for all of us to say, most heartfelt, ``Thank you Karen.''                          ____________________
