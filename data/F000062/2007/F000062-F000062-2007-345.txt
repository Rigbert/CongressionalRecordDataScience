 President. I rise today with Senator Voinovich to introduce legislation that would expand the Federal student loan forgiveness program to include Head Start teachers.  Nationwide, only 31 percent of Head Start teachers have completed a baccalaureate or advanced degree program.  In California, that number is even smaller: only 21 percent of Head Start teachers have completed a bachelor's degree.  To prepare Head Start children for elementary school, we must recruit highly qualified teachers who have demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, early childhood development, and other areas of the preschool curriculum with a particular focus on cognitive learning.  Recruiting and retaining teachers with such qualifications is critical to ensuring that our children start elementary school ready to learn.  A survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES), found that ``teachers with higher education levels were found to have more high quality language activities and more creative activities in their classrooms.''  In order to give every child a jump start in life, we must continue to recruit highly qualified teachers to the Head Start field and prevent the best teachers from leaving.  Many Head Start programs across the country, including in California, are losing qualified teachers to local school districts in part because the pay is better.  Nationally, the average Head Start teacher earns a salary of about $21,000--almost half the amount of elementary school teachers' salary of about $43,000.  Low pay, combined with increasing student debt, makes it increasingly difficult to attract and retain highly qualified Head Start teachers.  We must provide incentives to encourage recent graduates, current Head Start teachers without a degree, and college students to enter and remain in this important field.  This legislation would allow recent college graduates (obtaining a minimum of a bachelor's degree), and current Head Start teachers without a degree, to receive up to $5,000 of their Federal student loans forgiven in exchange for 5 years of teaching in a qualified Head Start program; and provide Head Start teachers with the same opportunity as currently offered to eligible elementary and secondary school teachers to receive up to $5,000 in loan forgiveness in exchange for 5 years of service.  Providing our Nation's low-income children with access to highly educated and qualified Head Start teachers so that they enter school ready to learn is critical to their future success.  Head Start is the primary Federal program that has the potential to reach out to low-income children early in their formative years when their cognitive skills are just developing.  Research shows that Head Start is a smart investment in our children's future.  For example, a 2003 Kindergarten Readiness: Head Start Success study of more than 600 graduates in San Bernardino County, CA, demonstrated that society receives nearly nine dollars in benefits, i.e. increased earnings and employment, for every one dollar invested in Head Start children.  That is why we must act now.  Every teacher that the Head Start program loses impacts the quality and access to services for our Nation's neediest children, and ultimately can impact their future success.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Voinovich in supporting this important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 883       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
