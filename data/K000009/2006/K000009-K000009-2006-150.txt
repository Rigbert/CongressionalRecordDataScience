Res. 703 Recognizing the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and supporting continued efforts to control radiation and mitigate the adverse health consequences related to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. I applaud the leadership of Congressmen Gallegly, Hyde, Lantos and Wexler on this important issue.  Twenty years ago this month, a human error triggered an explosion at the Chernobyl Power Plant's Reactor No. 4, causing the worst civilian nuclear catastrophe in the history of mankind, one which transcended geographic boundaries. Immediately after the explosion, increased levels of radiation were registered as far as Japan and the United States. The hardest hit were the people of Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia, collectively taking close to 70 percent of the radioactive fallout.  The scope of devastation that followed was truly unprecedented. More than 600,000 emergency workers, liquidators, risked their lives putting out the reactor's inferno that raged for 10 days while exposing themselves to extremely high and deadly doses of radiation. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to leave their homes because of radioactive contamination. More than 5 million people in Ukraine, Belarus and western Russia found themselves coping with life in towns and villages contaminated by iodine and cesium. Thousands of square miles of agricultural land and forests had to be removed from use because of contamination.  Twenty years after the initial fallout, Chernobyl has not been relegated to history books. Twenty years later, it continues to cause human suffering, environmental and economic hardship.  The disaster at Chernobyl has triggered a well documented epidemic of thyroid cancer, particularly among those who were infants and teenagers at the time of the explosion. Long latency periods for other types of cancers and ailments suggest that the toll on human health in the affected populations is a developing story, and not a thing of the past.  The consequences to the environment, as well as agriculture are equally devastating. Shortly after the fallout, short-lived iodine deposits onto vegetation entered into the food supply, mainly through milk, delivering large doses of internal radiation to consuming public. As for long-lived long-lived cesium, that will remain a problem for decades to come.  The Chernobyl disaster has been causing tremendous economic hardships as well, with Ukraine and Belarus spending up to 5 percent of their respective GDP on mitigation of its consequences. Environmental and economic degradation in the affected regions, increased health care costs, loss in productivity of human capital add to the heavy burdens of Chernobyl's enduring legacy.  As scientists and researchers continue their pursuit of a greater understanding of Chernobyl's long term consequences on human health and environment, it is important that we avoid closing the page on Chernobyl by rushing to speedy conclusions. Instead, I join many of my constituents in urging caution in accepting as definitive and conclusive some of the findings of the IAEA-led Chernobyl Forum report, particularly in the area of health consequences. Our Ukrainian colleagues in particular, encourage long term commitment to researching and analyzing Chernobyl's legacy. The whole world stands to benefit as together, we advance our understanding of man-made environmental disasters of this scope.  Another important aspect of Chernobyl's legacy is its impact on energy policy choices that are before the Government of Ukraine. It is my belief that Ukraine's long term energy security is not feasible without renewed emphasis on renewable energy. We share the same concerns in U.S., and both of our countries share great potential for development of bio-fuels, and other renewable energy technologies, such as fuel-cells, wind power.  It is also critically important that we address the issue of completing the Shelter Implementation Plan with the urgency and efficiency it deserves. President Yuschenko has highlighted this priority in his address to the Joint Session of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. It is often said that the next Chernobyl can be Chernobyl itself--the decaying concrete-and-steel sarcophagus, hastily constructed after the accident to secure the Reactor No. 4, has an estimated warranty of 20 years. That time is now, as the structural integrity of the encasement causes great concern. It is not just an Ukrainian issue, but indeed an issue of European security. As the largest single country donor to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, the U.S. provides important leadership in this multi-national donor effort. I urge the redoubling of efforts by all stakeholders to the Shelter Implementation Plan to ensure its timely completion.  The Congressional Ukrainian Caucus is stepping up to the plate in commemorating the somber milestone of the 20th anniversary of Chernobyl. I am grateful to my colleagues and our Caucus Co-Chairs, Congressmen Weldon, Levin and Bartlett, for their strong leadership and support in organizing events commemorating Chernobyl's anniversary. They include a special commemorative photo exhibit Chernobyl: 20 which documents the human experience there over the past 20 years, looking through the lenses of the world's top photographers. The exhibit is scheduled to open at the Rayburn Foyer on April 26, 2006 at 10 a.m.; an in-depth briefing, scheduled for April 27, 2006, 2 p.m-6 p.m, will explore a broad range of Chernobyl issues, including impact on human health and agricultural/food systems, environmental, economic and social rehabilitation in the affected regions, U.S. and international assistance, Chernobyl Shelter Implementation Plan progress; and finally, the Congressional reception honoring the tireless work of NGOs dedicated to improving human condition in the effected regions, scheduled for the evening of April 27, 2006, 6 p.m.-8 p.m.  The U.S. has provided assistance in remediation efforts in the aftermath of the catastrophe, followed by technical, humanitarian and economic assistance in the subsequent years that. One of the objectives of the briefing on Chernobyl is to review past U.S. assistance to the countries stricken by Chernobyl disaster, and identify current priorities that require continued commitment and financial support.  Life in the Chernobyl affected regions of Ukraine, Belarus and western Russia would have been a much more difficult challenge were it was not for the tireless work of many NGOs that go wherever they see human needs and opportunities to improve people's lives. Many lives were not just improved, but saved, because of the work of such organizations as Children of Chernobyl Relief and Development Fund and Chernobyl Children's Project International. This month, these charities send multi-million dollar convoys and airlifts of valuable medical equipment and medicine to Ukraine and Belarus, over the past decade bringing more than $100 million worth of medical supplies to those in need. This example of human compassion and resilience in the face of adversity is truly a hopeful sign for all survivors of the Chernobyl catastrophe.  I am submitting for the Record the respective statements of Children of Chernobyl Relief and Development Fund and Chernobyl Children's Project International in connection with H. Res. 703.  Finally, I would like to mention the political dimension of this catastrophe. When the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl blew up 20 years ago, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and other countries were part of the closed Soviet society, one where secrecy prevailed and freedom was denied. In my view, there was a direct link between the inefficiencies of the Soviet system, indeed its criminal disregard for the environment and for its citizens, and the disaster we commemorate today. In many ways, Chernobyl was a wake-up call for the Soviet Union, for the world. We dare not fall asleep again. We must continue to support Ukraine's democracy and ease her transition to the European Union; we must align ourselves with the brave people of Belarus who are trying to advance their own beleaguered country; and must build a strong relationship with Russia so that the authoritarian practices of the past that led to such disastrous results can be transformed to a more open, hopeful society, whose future will be of unlimited potential.  The occasion of the Chernobyl' s 20th anniversary offers a unique opportunity to step back in time and reflect on fragility of human life as we interact with powers of nature and technology. Let us be thoughtful and mindful of the lessons of Chernobyl in our everyday actions.                   Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund       The Children of Chornobyl Relief and Development Fund      wishes to add its support to House Resolution No. 703:      ``Recognizing the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear      disaster and supporting continued efforts to control      radiation and mitigate the adverse health consequences      related to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant''.       For the past sixteen years our organization has been      working to address the human legacy of the world's worst      environmental accident. Relying almost exclusively on private      contributions, CCRDF has delivered over $53 million dollars      worth of medical supplies, state-of-the-art technology and      physician training programs to help save the lives of      children stricken with thyroid cancer, leukemia, birth      defects, and early childhood diseases.       The children who are undergoing treatment in our 20 partner      hospitals offer painful but eloquent testimony to the      critical need for continuing medical aid to the Chornobyl      survivors. It is now well established that the nuclear      disaster caused an epidemic in thyroid cancer beginning in      the 1990s. Children and adults who were exposed to      radioactive iodine were stricken at a rate of 80 times higher      than normal. Over 9,000 additional children in Ukraine have      been diagnosed with precancerous conditions. But thyroid      cancer is just one of many health problems confronting the      Chornobyl communities. Fully one-third of all children in      some provinces suffer from endocrine disorders or tumors that      require medical or surgical intervention. Children who live      in contaminated territories suffer from immune deficiencies      and depleted levels of killer-T cells at a much higher rate      than children from relatively clean zones.       Recent studies by Ukrainian and Israeli scientists have      shown that the children born to Chornobyl nuclear cleanup      workers--the so-called ``liquidators'' have a seven-fold      increase in chromosome damage as compared to their siblings      born prior to the Chornobyl accident. There is growing      evidence that birth defects have doubled in the wake of      Chornobyl, and the rate of some birth defects, such as spina      bifida and cataracts are even higher. The Ukrainian-American      Association for the Prevention of Birth Defects under the      direction of an eminent geneticist from Alabama--Dr.      Wolodymyr Wertelecki has been tracking birth defects among a      very large population of newborns in the provinces of Rivne      and Volyn in northwestern Ukraine. They have found an      epidemic of spina bifida, and a wide range of other      deformities that are ordinarily extremely rare. Although      USAID has discontinued funding for Dr. Wertelecki's research      centers, we believe that his program has proven its value.      The next stage could be even more important as Dr.      Wertelecki's team is developing programs to reduce the      incidence of birth defects through prenatal programs and the      introduction of folic acid into local foodstuffs.       The United States could play a vital role in creating a      nationwide birth defects registry in Ukraine and Belarus. Our      government could also help to save the lives of thousands of      youngsters who are born each year with congenital heart      defects by providing training and technology to diagnose      these life-threatening conditions at birth or in early      childhood,       We have seen how even modest investments can have a      dramatic impact on infant survival and cancer remission rates      at several of our partner hospitals. In Kharkiv Children's      Hospital No. 16, for instance, the recovery and remission      rates for childhood leukemia have improved from a dismal 5      per cent in 1991 (a virtual death sentence) to 75 per cent in      2004 thanks to the installation of modern equipment such as a      blood cell separator and a full protocol of chemotherapeutic      agents. We have created model neonatal intensive care units      in Poltava and Lviv and Dnipropetrovsk, where infant      mortality has dropped by as much as 45 to 80 per cent, even      as the hospitals began to take on a larger volume of infants      with more difficult pathologies. By raising the standard of      care, we have also stimulated citizen initiatives, private      philanthropy and indigenous government programs that were      virtually unheard of during the Soviet era.       Thanks to the generous support of the Ukrainian-American      community, and thanks to corporate donors such as John Deere,      Monsanto, Philip Morris and UMC, we have been able to bring      doctors the tools and training they needed to achieve quantum      leaps in the kind of care they can provide their patients.       Unfortunately, Chornobyl's legacy is likely to endure long      after this 20th Anniversary. We have to remember that the 20-     year latency period for many forms of cancer is just      beginning to toll, and already, Chornobyl liquidators are      dying of oncological illnesses at a rate almost triple the      rate of working age males in Ukraine. Of the 34,000      liquidators who have died in Ukraine to date, 25% died of      various forms of cancer as compared to a rate of 9% for most      Ukrainians. Our colleagues at the National Institute of      Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology in Kyiv have found      evidence of cesium-137 and strontium-90 in placentas and      breastmilk, showing that newborn infants are being directly      exposed to highly dangerous radioactive materials at their      most vulnerable stage. We need to remember that the half-life      for these elements is 30 years, so they will be with us for      many years to come.       In the coming years, the United States Government should      make significant efforts to strengthen Ukraine's medical      infrastructure, and to invest in better maternal and      children's health. We must also provide funding for      independent research studies that will look at a wide range      of other health problems such as the accumulation of      radionuclides in the gastro-intestinal tract of youngsters      who live in areas contaminated with radioactive materials.       For our part, we will do everything in our power to reduce      the impact of Chornobyl by giving Ukrainian children a      fighting chance to overcome even the most daunting illnesses.      We thank you for your consideration.                                                Alexander B. Kuzma     Executive Director                                  ____                                      Chernobyl Children's Project                                                International,                                                     New York, NY.       Chernobyl Children's Project International supports House      Resolution No. 703: ``Recognizing the 20th anniversary of the      Chernobyl nuclear disaster and supporting continued efforts      to control radiation and mitigate the adverse health      consequences related to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.''       Chernobyl Children's Project International has worked with      health care institutions and communities in Belarus for      fifteen years. A partnership between Ireland and the United      States, we have delivered over $70 million in humanitarian      and medical aid. Working with citizens of Belarus, we provide      a children's cardiac surgery program, community care programs      for disabled children, nursing and therapeutic programs and      training, foster homes and hospice services.       In Belarus, 1.8 million people continue to live in      radiation-contaminated zones--over 420,000 of them children.      Our work keeps us in close contact with scientists,      researchers, NGOs and physicians in Belarus who have first      hand knowledge of the social, economic, and health needs of      the communities they serve. They observe and have documented      increases in cancer, birth defects, and cardiac and immune      disorders since the Chernobyl disaster. Data from experts and      health professionals in the affected regions is often      overlooked by their counterparts in the West. The Belarusian      Academy of Sciences reports that among children, morbidity,      sicknesses have increased by almost one-third, new cancers by      1.5 times, and blood diseases by 1.5 times. Sixty to 70      percent of Belarusians who live in contaminated zones who      have been checked at the Belarusian Institute of Radiation      Medicine have critical levels of radiation in their bodies.       Although the link between the Chernobyl disaster and      thyroid cancer has by now been firmly established, it is      important to note that it took years for this epidemic to      emerge. Screening and early intervention programs have thus      been able to minimize but not erase the human toll of thyroid      cancer. The first warnings were sounded by the medical and      NGO communities in Belarus and Ukraine well before the link      between the disease and the disaster were widely      acknowledged, and in fact initial reports of increases were      dismissed.       The latency period for the emergence of many cancers is 20+      years, and today respected researchers and clinicians are      voicing concern over the emergence of birth defects, non      thyroid cancers and blood and immune disorders.       The Chernobyl Forum report made an important contribution      to the understanding of the consequences of the Chernobyl      disaster by highlighting the complex interplay of factors      that impact the quality of life in Chernobyl affected      regions, and by encouraging the international community to      focus on projects that address poverty, lack of economic      opportunity, inadequate health care, and environmental      degradation. While we support this holistic approach, it is      far too soon to say that we know all there is to know about      the long term health effects of Chernobyl. We strongly submit      that the U.S. Government and the international community must      acknowledge the need for further research and to continue to      examine the health effects of the Chernobyl disaster.
