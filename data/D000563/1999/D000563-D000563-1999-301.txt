President, this Saturday, August 7 will mark the tenth anniversary of the death of Congressman Mickey Leland, who was an extraordinarily effective advocate for the hungry people here at home and throughout the world. In remembering his tireless work for the hungry, I think it is fitting to redouble our own efforts to fight hunger and malnutrition.  The United States recently released its plan to reduce hunger. I am offering an amendment today to ask that the President include in his budget request next year specific proposals to implement the U.S. plan.  In November 1996 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization convened a World Food Summit in Rome. The goal of the conference was to ``renew the commitment of world leaders at the highest level to the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all, through the adoption of concerted policies and actions at global, regional, and national levels.'' Summit participants pledged to cut the number of undernourished people in half by 2015. Each participating country was to decide independently how it could contribute to the goal of food security for all.  This March of this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture published the U.S. government's plan to meet the goals of the 1996 World Food Summit, entitled U.S. Action Plan on Food Security, Solutions to Hunger. The plan outlines how the United States will fight hunger both at home and abroad. The plan is broad and involves a number of U.S. agencies and policies. It aims to reduce both U.S. and world hunger by addressing the ``policy environment,'' promoting trade and investment, strengthening food security research and educational capacity, integrating environmental concerns into food security efforts, improving the ``safety net,'' better identifying ``food insecure'' individuals and populations, and addressing food and water safety issues.  The USDA report was issued after the President had already submitted his budget. Many of the recommendations in the report are policies already in place and so already addressed in the President's budget. The report has some specific recommendations, but many are broad principles that need to be fleshed out to lead to specific actions.  I want to be sure that this report does not become one of the many government reports that leads nowhere, that fulfills the requirements of an international conference with lofty goals but little follow-through.  I am offering this amendment today, which simply says that it is the sense of the Senate that the President should include in the fiscal year 2001 budget request funding to implement this plan, to encourage the Administration to submit specific proposals and budget requests to follow through on our fight against hunger.
