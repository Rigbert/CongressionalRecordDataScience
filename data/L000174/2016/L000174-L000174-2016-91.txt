President, I want to take a moment to recognize the achievements and contributions of a remarkable advocate and distinguished leader in my home State of Vermont.  This summer, Allen Gilbert will be stepping down from his position as executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont. For more than 12 years, Allen has inspired Vermonters and many others as an advocate for personal freedoms.  When Allen began at the ACLU-VT, the office had three staff members, only one of whom was full time. Under Allen's leadership, the office has grown to a staff of five, with two lawyers committed to the State's legislative activities. Allen has become widely known for expanding the work and visibility of the ACLU-VT. Those who have had the privilege of working with Allen cite his boundless wisdom and passion for civil liberties among his many notable qualities.  During his time with the ACLU-VT, Allen has been a champion of free speech, government transparency, and privacy rights, not just in Vermont but nationwide. I have long counted him as an ally in my own work. I was proud to invite him to testify before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007 about the REAL ID Act. More recently, Allen's contributions were extremely helpful as I developed reforms to curtail government surveillance powers, culminating in the enactment of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. Allen and I have also worked together to end Federal vehicle checkpoints near White River Junction.  Among many successes, Allen is well-known in Vermont for his work on cases to protect students' rights to freedom of speech and political expression and the rights of the LGBT community. More recently, Allen and the ACLU-VT have worked to create more consistency among Vermont law enforcement agencies regarding the use of force. And Allen's work highlighting automated license plate readers, cell phone tracking devices, facial recognition technology, and the use of domestic drones has helped to educate Vermonters and its policymakers about the need to address these evolving technologies. In doing so, Allen has once again demonstrated his leadership in protecting Vermonters.  I am not alone in recognizing Allen's talents and tenacity. In 2012, the Vermont Press Association awarded him with the Matthew Lyon Award for his lifetime commitment to the First Amendment and protecting the public's right to know. The award is named after the Vermont Congressman who won reelection from jail in 1798, while serving time for violating the Sedition Act because he challenged the power of the Presidency. Matthew Lyon is considered one of our Nation's earliest free speech heroes.  Allen's commitment to freedom of speech and equality extends far past his 12 years at the ACLU-VT. In earlier years, Allen was a reporter and editor at the Rutland Herald and the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus. He also taught writing at a number of Vermont colleges and served as chair of the Worcester, VT, School Board while it supported a case for equal education opportunity. That 1997 Vermont Supreme Court case ultimately changed the way we fund public education in Vermont.  Although Allen is leaving ACLU-VT, I know he will remain a lifelong advocate for the freedoms and liberties we hold dear. As Allen has said, ``There's a saying that civil liberties are never permanently won; you have to continue to fight for them constantly.'' He is an exemplary Vermonter, and I know he will continue that fight.                          ____________________
