President, I rise to present the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006. This bill will help to close dangerous gaps in our ability to protect our shipping lanes and seaports from attack.  A number of our colleagues have worked very hard on this bill. This bill reflects not only bipartisan consultation and support but coordination among the Senate Homeland Security Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Finance Committee. I thank our leader, Senator Frist, for encouraging and facilitating those discussions.  I particularly wish to thank my colleague, Senator Murray, who joined me in sponsoring the GreenLane cargo security bill in November of 2005, whichhas served as the basis for the legislation we debate tonight. Senator Murray has been steadfast in her commitment to enhancing port security. She has been working on it since the attacks on our country 5 years ago. She has been a terrific partner.  Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator Grassley, Senator Lieberman, Senator Baucus, Senator Coleman, and Senator Allen have also played critical roles on this important legislation.
