President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I rise in support of this amendment. When you have people who are so dirt poor that they can't come up with the $175 filing fee, we usually say in civil actions that we are going to waive the fee in court. For some reason, that waiver is not in the law in bankruptcy. It certainly should be. People wouldn't be coming to the bankruptcy court were they not in dire straits.  I support the Senator from Wisconsin because this has been tried successfully. It does not result in a mad dash to the courthouse by people who otherwise would not file for bankruptcy.  Now, the milk of human kindness curdled a few moments ago on the Senate floor when it came to bankruptcy lawyers, and the poor folks didn't do too well a few minutes ago when it came to minimum wage. Please stop and think about this for a minute. The poorest of the poor, coming to bankruptcy court trying to turn their lives around, want the same kind of treatment people get in all other civil suits. That is not unreasonable.
