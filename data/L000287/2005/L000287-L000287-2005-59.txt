Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, why are we here tonight? We have not been ordained or called by some all-powerful force to play God or play doctor.  Every day American families make life-and-death decisions governed by their own faith and led by their own hearts. This Congress does not interfere with most personal decisions of these American citizens. Why then, Mr. Speaker, why have we come here tonight?  Where is the respect for individual responsibility that is waved like a banner in this Chamber? Where is the respect tonight for States' rights that we said we hold so dear? If we really believe in those values, we will stay out of Terri Schiavo's life today and let the decision of her husband and the ruling of the Federal court stand.  Leadership must lead. Tonight this leadership is a taillight. It is not the headlight for democracy and for a citizen's right to privacy that it should be.  This is demagoguery. This is a step in where we have no business. This is walking where the angels fear to tread. We are playing with a young woman's life for the sake of politics. This is not about values. This is not about religion. It is pandering for political gain with the next election in mind.  Mr. Speaker, how much further can we slide down this slippery slope of hypocrisy? How much lower can we sink? How much more unprincipled can we be?  In a democracy, sometimes we disagree with individual decisions. Sometimes it is hard to bear judgment that we do not understand. But if we truly believe in individual freedom and the right to privacy, then we must get out of the way and let people be free.  This is a matter that should rest with the family, their consciences, and their God. The Florida courts have spoken, and we should not intervene.  This is a very, very sad night for the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, is it possible for us to let this young woman take her leave in peace?
