Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend Jack Parton, of Hebron, Indiana, for his exemplary service to Indiana's First Congressional District. Since 1982, when Jack was serving as the District 31 Director of the United Steelworkers of America, he has organized an annual golf outing to raise money for the National Kidney Foundation. This year, in honor of his great efforts and activities on behalf of the Kidney Foundation, Jack was honored by the foundation during the Cadillac Invitational Golf Tournament, on June 15, 1998 at the Broadmoor Country Club in Merrillville, Indiana.  The 16th annual `Kidney Days Golf Outing' fundraiser for the National Kidney Foundation will be held on August 21, 1998. The event will take place at five golf courses in Northwest Indiana and is expected to include almost one thousand participants. Profits will be given to the Kidney Foundation to help the ailing and needy, with expected proceeds to be in excess of $4,000. In the previous 15 years of this event, over $100,000 has been raised and donated to the National Kidney Foundation.  A strong leader of the United Steelworkers of America, Jack first joined in the union in 1959 as a member of Local 1014 at U.S. Steel's Gary Works, where he served two terms as its President. Jack was elected Director of District 31 in 1981, and he was subsequently re-elected in 1985, 1989, and 1993. In 1995, District 31 was re-organized into District 7, which now encompasses all of Illinois and Indiana, and Jack served as its first director. In March of 1998, Jack was installed once more as the District 7 Director. Dedicated to the union, Jack has assumed numerous important responsibilities, including chairing contract negotiations with Inland Steel, Ryerson, Acme Steel, Northwestern Steel & Wire, and LTV Steel, where he serves as Secretary of negotiations. In addition, Jack established the District 7 Labor/Management Safety and Health Conference, which was the first district-level conference of its type in the USWA. In 1996, Jack served as the Secretary of the 1996 Convention Officers' Report Committee.  Jack, while deeply committed to his work, is also dedicated to his family. He often travels back to Virginia to visit his mother and spend time with his other relatives. His future plans include working to facilitate the unification merger of the United Autoworkers and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers with the United Steelworkers of America. Together with other union leaders, Jack will ensure that the membership of these three unions unites to form one comprehensive, united, and strong voice for working men and women. This newly invigorated union will be dedicated to serving, protecting, and aiding its membership.  Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to one of the region's true humanitarian leaders, Jack Parton. Jack's service to his community, co-workers, and union is worthy of the highest praise and emulation. Northwest Indiana is lucky to have sucha incredibly altruistic, dedicated, and upright individual.                          ____________________
