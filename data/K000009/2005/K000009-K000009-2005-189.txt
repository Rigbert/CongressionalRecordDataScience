Speaker, it is a privilege to pay tribute today to Mr. Chester Devenow, an Ohio business and civic leader whose recent loss our community has sustained. Regarded as a ``titan of industry,'' Chester Devenow always took on broader missions to those beyond his board and firm. He located Sheller Globe's headquarters in the heart of our community to strengthen it economically, and struck labor agreements with its employees that helped build our region's middle class. He was highly regarded for his philanthropy and contributions to the institutions of our community.  His business acumen enabled him to create a Fortune 500 company, and he was truly a leader in industry. In his later career, his skills were often utilized in the mediation of labor-management disputes. Even after a well-earned retirement, Chester Devenow's abilities remained valuable to area business leaders. His knowledge and institutional memory were well-regarded by his peers.  Upon graduation from high school in Detroit, he studied music at the Julliard School. Adecorated veteran, Chester Devenow received a degree in political science from New York University and attended Harvard Law School.  President Theodore Roosevelt noted ``We demand that big business give the people a square deal; in return we must insist that when anyone engaged in big business honestly endeavors to do right he shall himself be given a square deal.'' Chester Devenow earned this distinction among the industry's titans.  We offer our sympathy to Maudette, loving wife of 27 years; his brother Leonard; sons Mark and Jeffrey; daughter Susie; stepchildren William and Abigail Schachner; his six grandchildren; and his numerous friends. May they find some small peace as Chester Devenow joins his daughter Sara and the Creator of us all.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E2547-E2548]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     TRIBUTE TO MR.
