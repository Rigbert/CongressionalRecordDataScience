 President, this is a very important debate, which I always enjoy with my distinguished colleague from South Carolina, who fully admits that the various campaign finance reform bills we have tried to pass here in the last few years are unconstitutional. He is right, and I commend him for his observation.  That having been stated, clearly, the only way you can do the kinds of reform bills that have been proposed around here in the last 10 years is to amend the Constitution--amend the first amendment for the first time in history, to give the Government the power to control the speech of individuals, groups, candidates, and parties. The American Civil Liberties Union calls that a recipe for repression. It clearly is, and I am happy today that we are finally having the debate on this amendment, which is indeed a recipe for repression.  I see my good friend, the Senator from Kansas, here, who is anxious to speak on this. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.
