Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 710, introduced by Senator Trent Lott from Mississippi, authorizes a feasibility study of the Vicksburg Campaign during the Civil War. The Vicksburg Campaign was one of the most important, decisive events of the Civil War. Vicksburg was the Confederacy's most vital defensive citadel, located on the Mississippi River. Its capture was considered essential to the Union plans to gain control of the Mississippi in 1863.  The fall of Vicksburg effectively split the South in two and gave the North complete control of the Mississippi River.                              {time}  1415  Clearly, many of the battlefields along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail are of important historical significance and their preservation would contribute to the understanding of the heritage of the United States. Mr. Speaker, S. 710 would authorize a feasibility study on the preservation of many of the Civil War battlefields along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail to determine what measures should be taken to preserve these historical battlefields.  In addition, this bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to establish a management entity for Civil War battlefields and to acquire funds and lands for use in managing these battlefields.  Mr. Speaker, I urge members of the House to support S. 710.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
