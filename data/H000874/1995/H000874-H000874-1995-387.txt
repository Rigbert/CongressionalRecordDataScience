Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, following some of these incidents, there were at least five hearings. We had days of hearings, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot] and I. The fact of the matter is that the director resigned under pressure. The head of the law enforcement side of ATF, after Waco, resigned. The fact of the matter is they are gone. The agents to which the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot] referred were disciplined. They are not in law enforcement.  But the fact of the matter is this is painting with a very broad brush everyone who serves us, everyone whom we ask day in and day out to go out and risk their lives to make this country safer.  Do some transgress? Yes. Rodney King was a transgression. But we did not damn the entire police force of Los Angeles nor cut their salaries because we knew it was critical for the safety of our streets and our country and our democracy that we maintain law and order in this country.  Ladies and gentlemen, do not, with a broad brush damn everybody who serves this country so well.  Reject the Chenoweth amendment.
