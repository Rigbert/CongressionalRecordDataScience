 President, I rise to express my concern about the conference report to H.R. 3210, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. When the Senate first considered this bill in June, I expressed the hope that Congress would send the President a bill that was fair and balanced with respect to basic liability protections for all victims of terrorism. However, I believe that the conference report before us fails to provide reasonable restrictions on lawsuit liability, and instead exposes the American taxpayer to potentially excessive costs of unmitigated litigation as a result of terrorist attacks beyond anyone's control. Consequently, I am reluctant to vote for final passage of this conference report.  I am glad that the final version of the terrorism reinsurance legislation is only a temporary fix. As a general matter, the Government should not be in the business of writing claims.  Some have implied that we wrongly predicted an insurance crisis following the events of September 11, 2001, which was the reason for this temporary backstop. The insurance companies have survived without government support thus far, and banks are still lending where there is uncovered risks. According to the Wall Street Journal, ``the economy has continued to grow, albeit slowly, and some companies have started offering insurance again, albeit at very high premiums.'' The article states that a short-term solution would be nice, but the bill is ``a bonanza for the trial lawyers, an entitlement for insurers.''  Again, I do not believe that this legislation contains adequate liability protections. While some restrictions were negotiated in conference, I don't believe that they go far enough. Basically, American companies that are themselves victims of terrorists acts should not be subject to predatory lawsuits or unfair and excessive punitive damages. If that happens, not only will Americans be the victims of another attack, but the taxpayers will be the victims of trial lawyers who will seek the deepest pocket and rush to the courthouse to sue anyone regardless of fault. There needs to be careful restrictions on lawsuit liability to protect taxpayer funds from being exposed to opportunistic, predatory assaults on the United States Treasury.  In fact, I agree with an editorial in the Washington Post: the other side of the aisle should be ``embarrassed by their efforts to defend trial lawyers at the expense of the American economy.'' Rather, we should be working to enforce the long-standing Federal policies behind the Federal Tort Claims Act: namely, that lawyers should not be making handsome profits when they are paid from the U.S. Treasury. I agree with a statement made by House Judiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner, that ``especially today, in a time of war, excessive lawyer fees drawn from the U.S. Treasury should not be allowed to result in egregious war profiteering at the expense of victims, jobs and businesses.''  Many say we can come back and revisit these provisions later. I say we get it right the first time we sign it into law.  I ask unanimous consent to print the Wall Street Journal article to which I referred in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 6, 2002]                      A Terrifying Insurance Deal      A bonanza for the trial lawyers, an entitlement for insurers       After the elections the 107th Congress is threatening to      return to pass some unfinished business, including a      compromise on terrorism insurance. Having looked at the      details of the insurance deal, we can only hope they'll all      stay home.       The two parties have been battling for a year over this      bill, especially the extent to which trial lawyers could      profit from acts of terror. Republicans and some Democrats      want to ban punitive damages against property owners. But Tom      Daschle, carrying his usual two oceans of water for the      plaintiff's bar, resisted any erosion in the right to sue the      owner should a plane crash into his or her building.       And it looks like Mr. Daschle has prevailed. The compromise      permits such suits, albeit before a single federal court as      opposed to the more accommodating state courts. In other      words, the White House appears to have caved, and after      months of arguing the opposite now says terror insurance is      about ``jobs, not tort reform.''       Well, we're not sure it's still about jobs either. The bill      makes insurance companies liable for claims amounting to a      certain percentage of their premiums, puts the government on      the hook for 90% of losses over that deductible, and allows      the government to recover some portion of its payment by      levying a surcharge on all policy owners. The best news is      that government help sunsets in 2005, or at least that's the      promise.       Unfortunately, the bill ignores the crucial problem of      risk. Risk-based premiums--which reward the careful and      punish the careless--are a superb tool for reducing risk.      Consider: There are lots of things property owners can do to      reduce the damage from terrorism--retrofitting air-filtration      systems to guard against biological agents, redesigning      underground parking garages to prevent bomb attacks,      fireproofing steel girders to minimize fire damage. And      insurance companies can discipline them to take these      measures by charging risk-based premiums.       If insurers were required to pay premiums to the government      based on the premiums they receive, market incentives to      reduce risk would improve markedly. If, on the other hand,      terror insurance is essentially free, as it would be under      the current bill, insurers have less incentive to charge the      full cost of risk; instead they have every incentive to      underprice it.       An alternative has been suggested by David Moss, an      economist at Harvard Business School: Let the federal      government pay 80% of losses from a terrorist attack, as long      as insurers also pass along 80% of the premiums they collect.      This way, says Mr. Moss, insurers would price risk near or at      its full cost, exerting discipline against the careless, and      prices would be set in the private market.       We mention Mr. Moss's idea because, despite heavy breathing      by the insurance industry, it isn't at all clear that there's      an immediate economic need for this legislation. It's true      that right after 9/11 the property insurance market seized      up. Insurers didn't know how to price for the risk of another      attack, and so rent their garments that the economy would      collapse without government reinsurance. We were also open to      the idea, but it turns out they were wrong. The economy has      continued to grow, albeit slowly, and some companies have      started offering insurance again, albeit at very high      premiums.       We aren't arguing that a federal backstop might not perk up      business in the short term, or that some sort of insurance      wouldn't be nice to have in place before another attack. But      the assertion that billions of dollars of projects have been      shelved and 300,000 jobs lost is bogus. Despite efforts to      quantify a slowdown, including a survey by the Fed, evidence      of suffering is scattered and anecdotal--and mostly confined      to trophy properties.       The bigger point here is that any legislation is likely to      be permanent, since no entitlement of this size has ever been      allowed to ride quietly into the sunset. That argues for      doing it right, and waiting until the next Congress if need      be. Many Republicans are privately unhappy with the deal the      White House has cut with Mr. Daschle. We hope they'll urge      President Bush to insist on something better.
