 But Senator Leahy and I have cleared five amendments. We would like to dispose of those first, which means we will have completed action on 15 amendments. There will be approximately 20 remaining. But the good news is only about four of those are going to require rollcall votes.                   Amendments Nos. 5030 through 5034  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I send five amendments to the desk, en bloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.
