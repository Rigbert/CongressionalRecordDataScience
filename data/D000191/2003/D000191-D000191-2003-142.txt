  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 2 weeks since the embarrassing revelations that the $350 billion Republican tax cut left behind 6.5 million working families with incomes of $10,000 to $27,000 a year. Not a penny to them and their 12 million children. They were stiffed to make room for more millionaire tax cuts.  Last week, the Senate rushed to fix this. The President has endorsed what the Senate did; and if the Republican leaders here in the House really cared about these families and their kids, they would take up, pass the Senate bill today, send it down to the President tonight, get him to sign it; and they could get refund checks next month along with other families. But, no, that is not what they are going to do.  They are going to turn these families into second-class citizens. If this bill passes today, they can file for the money next year. A lot of working families with parents in combat will be excluded under this bill. They will be left out altogether, but it really does one thing that they really want to do. It assures this bill will not become law because they really do not care about those 6.5 million families and their 12 million kids. They are low-income people. They do not care.                          ____________________
