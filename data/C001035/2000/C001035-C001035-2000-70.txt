President, today, along with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, I am introducing legislation to stem the proliferation of web sites that distribute counterfeit identification documents and credentials over the Internet.  In May, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held hearings on a disturbing new trend--the use of the Internet to manufacture and market counterfeit identification documents and credentials. Our investigation revealed the widespread availability on the Internet of a variety of fake ID documents or computer templates that allow individuals to manufacture authentic looking IDs in the seclusion of their own homes.  The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 will strengthen current law to prevent the distribution of false identification documents over the Internet and make it easier for Federal officials to prosecute this criminal activity.  The high quality of the counterfeit identification documents that can be obtained via the Internet is simply astounding. With very little difficulty, my staff was able to use Internet materials to manufacture convincing IDs that would allow me to pass as a member of our Armed Forces, as a reporter, as a student at Boston University, or as a licensed driver in Florida, Michigan, and Wyoming--to name just a few of the identities that I could assume, using these phony IDs. We found it was very easy to manufacture IDs that were indistinguishable from the real documents.  For example, using the Internet, my staff created this counterfeit Connecticut driver's license, which is virtually identical to an authentic license issued by the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles. Just like the real Connecticut license, this fake with my picture on it, includes a signature written over the picture--which is supposed to be a security feature. It includes an adjacent ``shadow picture,'' and it includes the bar code and the State seal for the State of Connecticut.  Each of these sophisticated features was added to the license by the State of Connecticut in order to make it more difficult to counterfeit. Yet the Internet scam artists have been able to keep up with the technology, and every time a State adds another security feature it has been easily duplicated.  Unfortunately, some web sites sell fake IDs complete with State seals, holograms, and bar codes to replicate a license virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Thus, technology now allows web site operators to copy authentic IDs with an extraordinary level of sophistication and then distribute and mass produce these fraudulent documents for their customers.  The web sites investigated by my subcommittee offered a vast and varied product line, ranging from the driver's licenses that I already showed to military identification cards to Federal agency credentials, including those of the FBI and the CIA.  Other sites offered to produce Social Security cards, birth certificates, diplomas, and press credentials. In short, one can find almost any kind of identification document that one wants on the Internet.  The General Accounting Office and the FBI have both confirmed the findings of the subcommittee's investigation of this dangerous new trend. The GAO used counterfeit credentials and badges readily available for purchase via the Internet to breach the security at 19 Federal buildings and two commercial airports. GAO's success in doing so demonstrates that the Internet and computer technology allownearly anyone to create convincing identification cards and credentials.  The FBI has also focused on the potential of misuse of official identification, and just last month executive search warrants at the homes of several individuals who had been selling Federal law enforcement badges over the Internet.  Obviously, this is very serious. It allows someone to use a law enforcement badge to gain access to secure areas and perhaps to commit harm. For example, the FBI is investigating a very disturbing incident where someone allegedly displayed phony FBI credentials to gain access to an individual's hotel room and then allegedly later kidnaped and murdered that individual.  The Internet is a revolutionary tool of commerce and communications that benefits us all, but many of the Internet's greatest attributes also further its use for criminal purposes. While the manufacture of false IDs by criminals is certainly nothing new, the Internet allows those specializing in the sale of counterfeit IDs to reach a far broader market of potential buyers than they ever could by standing on the street corner in a shady part of town. They can sell their products with virtual anonymity through the use of e-mail services and free web hosting services and by providing false information when registering their domain names. Similarly, the Internet allows criminals to obtain fake IDs in the privacy of their own homes, substantially diminishing the risk of apprehension that attends purchasing counterfeit documents on the street.  Because this is a relatively new phenomenon, there are no good data on the size of the false ID industry or the growth it has experienced as a result of the Internet, but the testimony at our hearing indicates that the Internet is increasingly becoming the source of choice for criminals to obtain false IDs.  The subcommittee's investigation found that some web site operators apparently have made hundreds of thousands of dollars through the sale of phony identification documents. One web site operator told a State law enforcement official that he sold approximately 1,000 fake IDs each month and generated about $600,000 in annual sales.  Identify theft is a growing problem that these Internet sites facilitate. Fake IDs, however, also facilitate a broad array of criminal conduct. We found that some Internet sites were used to obtain counterfeit identification documents for the purpose of committing other crimes, ranging from very serious offenses, such as identify theft and bank fraud, ranging to the more common problem of teenagers using phony IDs to buy alcohol.  The legislation which Senator Durbin and I are introducing today is designed to address the problem of counterfeit IDs in several ways. The central features of our legislation are provisions that modernize existing law to address the widespread availability of false identification documents on the Internet.  First, the legislation supplements current Federal law against false identification to modernize it for the Internet age. The primary law prohibiting the use and distribution of false identification documents was enacted in 1982. Advances in computer technology and the use of the Internet have rendered that law inadequate. This bill will clarify that the current law prohibits the sale or distribution of false identification documents through computer files and templates which our investigation found are the vehicles of choice for manufacturing false IDs in the Internet age.  Second, the legislation will make it easier to prosecute those criminals who manufacture, distribute, or sell counterfeit identification documents by ending the practices of easily removable disclaimers as part of an attempt to shield the illegal conduct from prosecution through a bogus claim of novelty.  What we found is that a lot of these web sites have these disclaimers, in an attempt to get around the law, saying that these can only be used for entertainment or novelty purposes. No longer will it be acceptable to provide computer templates of government-issued identification cards containing an easily removable layer saying it is not a government document.  I will give an example. this is a driver's license from Oklahoma. It is a fake ID which my staff obtained via the Internet. It is enclosed in a plastic pouch that says ``Not a Government Document'' in red print across it, but it was very easily removed. All one had to do, with a snip of the scissors, was cut the pouch, and then the ID is easily removed and the disclaimer is gone. That is the kind of technique that a lot of times these web site operators use to get around the letter of the law. Under my bill, it will no longer be acceptable to sell a false identification document in this fashion.  Finally, my legislation seeks to encourage more aggressive law enforcement by dedicating investigative and prosecutorial resources to this emerging problem. The bill establishes a multiagency task force that will concentrate the investigative and prosecutorial resources of several agencies with responsibility for enforcing laws that criminalize the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit identification documents.  Our investigation established that Federal law enforcement officials have not devoted the necessary resources and attention to this serious problem. by prosecuting the purveyors of false identification materials, I believe that ultimately we can reduce end-use crime that often depends on the availability of counterfeit identification. For example, the convicted felon who testified at our hearings said that he would not have been able to commit bank fraud had he not been able to easily and quickly obtain high-quality fraudulent identification documents via the Internet. I am confident that if Federal law enforcement officials prosecute the most blatant violation of the law, the false ID industry on the Internet will wither in short order.  By strengthening the law and by focusing our prosecutorial efforts, I believe we can curb the widespread availability of false IDs that the Internet facilitates. The Director of the U.S. Secret Service testified at our hearing that the use of such fraudulent documents and credentials almost always accompanies the serious financial crimes they investigate. Thus, my hope is that the legislation we are introducing today will produce a stronger law that will help deter and prevent criminal activity, not only in the manufacture of false IDs but in other areas as well.                                 ______                                       By
