One additional, and I think final, item, the continuity of Congress challenge that we have has been discussed. There are obviously a number of different proposals, including constitutional amendments, as well as legislative action, as well as rules considerations. We have heard on this side there may be something happening next week. The gentleman did not mention it in his announcement. Can he tell us whether or not there is any possibility of having that matter on the floor next week.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman asking about the continuity in Congress bill. We had it sort of waiting in the wings, but it looks like next week is going to be a pretty full week, and we may have to look for another time to bring that bill to the floor.
