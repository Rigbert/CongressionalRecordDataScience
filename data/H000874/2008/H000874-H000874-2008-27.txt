 There was a mistake made in the notice that was given to the minority. That was not anybody's intention; it was a mistake. We want to give another opportunity to consider the rule with the minority having the proper information in front of them when we do so.  I have discussed this with the minority, and I think this is the appropriate procedure for us to fairly follow. And I've discussed it with your leadership.
