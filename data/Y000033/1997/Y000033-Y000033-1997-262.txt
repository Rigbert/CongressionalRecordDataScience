Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation on behalf of numerous Alaska Native veterans who answered the call of their country to serve, fight,and preserve the rights of all citizens of the United States during the Vietnam war. Many of these same Alaska Native veterans continue to serve their country by becoming involved in their communities, and in local and State government. Others continue to serve their country by their enlistment in the Alaska National Guard, a reserve component of the Army.  Alaska Natives, who were in service to their country during the Vietnam war, missed their opportunity to apply for a Native allotment under the Native Allotment Act. Many were in war zones and others had not received their application from the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA]. It is my firm belief that our Alaska Native Vietnam veterans merit the same rights as other Alaska Natives under this act. It is morally wrong of our country, of which our Alaska Native veterans are first class citizens, to deny them the basic right afforded to other Alaska Native citizens under this act. This legislation will correct this inequity and give them the opportunity to apply for their allotment under the Native Allotment Act.  I think it is appropriate that I offer this legislation prior to our national observance of Veterans Day, November 11, 1997. My legislation respectivefully requests of this administration not to tarnish the service of our Alaska Vietnam era Native veterans and to grant them the same rights to apply for their Native allotment.  Another provision in this bill would restore land to the Elim Native Corp. By Executive Order 2508, January 3, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson set aside the Norton Bay Reservation ``for use of the United States Bureau of Education and the natives of indigenous Alaskan race'', including adjacent islands within 3 miles of the coast. This area contained 350,000 acres.  In 1919, Congress mandated that the withdrawal of public lands for use as Indian reservations could only be made by an act of Congress (43 U.S.C. 150, 41 Stat. 34). Congress in 1927 declared that no changes could be made in the boundaries of Executive Order reservations for the use of Indians except by an act of Congress (25 U.S.C. 398d, 44 Stat. 1347). The 1927 act is applicable to Alaska (70 I.D. 166 (1963)). After the 1927 act, President Herbert Hoover issued Executive Order 5207 which revoked approximately 50,000 acres of land from the Norton Bay Reservation for use of homesteading by ex-servicemen of World War I. No ex-servicemen applied for any land within the old Norton Bay Reservation.  When I brought this issue before the 102d Congress, the Secretary of Interior agreed that Elim was entitled to the 50,000 acres. See April 21, 1992, letter from deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management to Chairman Miller. The administration is ignoring the fact that only Congress can revoke reservation lands. Therefore, it is my lawful belief that Elim Native Corp. is entitled to the 50,000 acres and that the administration should disregard Executive Order 5207 issued by President Hoover and restore the 50,000-acre Elim entitlement.                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,                                       Office of the Secetary,                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1992.     Hon. George Miller,     Chairman, Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: This responds to your request for the      Department of the Interior's (the Department's) views on      eight proposed amendments to H.R. 3157, the ``Alaska Land      Status Technical Corrections Act of 1991,'' a bill which      would amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).       On February 24, 1991, the Department submitted written      testimony on H.R. 3157, as introduced. The issues raised in      our testimony still are of concern to the Department. This      letter sets forth only the Department's concerns with the      eight proposed amendments. The proposed amendments will be      discussed in the same order and have been given the same      headings as those submitted with your letter requesting our      views.      ratification of land transfers to caswell and montana creek       This proposed amendment involves the Cook Inlet Region,      Inc. (CIRI) and the Caswell and Montana Creek Native Groups,      all of whom entered into a settlement agreement in 1982.      Pursuant to the settlement, CIRI conveyed approximately      11,000 acres to each group with the understanding that the      conveyances satisfied their entitlements under section 12(b)      of ANCSA. The Department was not a party to the settlement      agreement. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to ratify      the transfers and satisfy the Department's ANCSA land      transfer obligations to the two groups and CIRI.       The conveyances to Caswell and Montana Creek were made by      CIRI from lands received from the State of Alaska under      Paragraph II and Appendix C, Part 1.A. (Kashwitna Pool) of      the Terms and Conditions for Land Consolidation and      Management in the Cook Inlet Area (ratified by Section 12(b)      of the Act of January 2, 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1611 n.).       Conveyances from Appendix C are debited from CIRI's      entitlement under Section 12(c) of the ANCSA. The Terms and      Conditions provided for methods of satisfying entitlements      that are somewhat different from the normal procedures, i.e.,      ordinarily, the United States conveys land directly to groups      but, by virtue of special legislation affecting CIRI, land is      conveyed to the regional corporation and it then reconveys to      village corporations and groups. In order to avoid a double      charge for the Caswell/Montana Creek group entitlements, we      recommend the following language by adding at the end of the      proposed amendment: ``The ratification of the conveyances      made by CIRI in this section shall not be a basis for or      generate a claim by CIRI, or either of the groups named      herein, for additional conveyances of land or money or any      other thing of value against either the State of Alaska or      the United States.''                elim native corporation land conveyance       Under this proposed amendment, 50,000 acres of land would      be withdrawn, subject to valid existing rights, for selection      by the Elim Native Corporation. These lands were excluded in      1929 by Executive Order from the original Elim reserve. Elim      was one of five native corporations that elected to take      lands set aside in reserve for the benefit of Natives instead      of participating in the ANCSA land selection process.      Pursuant to its election, Elim received patent to 297,982      acres on September 14, 1979--the lands that were included in      the Elim reserve on the date of entitlement under the ANCSA.      Elim did not appeal the decision to convey and accepted the      patent.       We suggest that proposed amendment tie authority for      conveyance of additional acreage to some existing      entitlement. Moreover, the proposed amendment presents a      problem in that about 11,440 acres of the described lands      proposed for conveyance to Elim have been validly selected by      the Native village of Koyuk. This would leave only 38,560      acres for Elim instead of the 50,000 they desire. If the      proposed amendment is included in H.R. 3157, it should      include clear Congressional intent and guidance as to which      entity will receive the 11,440 acres, and a proviso that the      conveyance is in full satisfaction of Elim's entitlement      under Section 19(b) of the ANCSA.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there      is no objection to the presentation of this report from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                               Richard Roldan,                                       Deputy Assistant Secretary,                                     Land and Minerals Management.
