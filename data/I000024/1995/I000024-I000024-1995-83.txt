President, this is what is going on around the country. I just feel very strongly that the people are not willing to buy this.  I wish I had a blowup of it, but there is a cartoon that has been sent out, I guess, into all the districts by the Democrat senatorial committee that depicts us as individuals who are trying to cut taxes for the superrich and we are going to be cutting Medicare. The things are just outrageous. It says: ``Inhofe feasts on tax cuts for the privilege while children go to bed hungry.''  This is something that is, in my opinion, so extreme that the American people are not going to buy it.  It was not long ago, just a little over a year ago, that the Democrats were trying at that time to sell to the American people a program where the Government would run the health care system and discard a health delivery system that has been the most successful system in the history of all nations, of all mankind, and it was one to adopt a program that was similar to what they have in Canada, or the age-old failure in Great Britain or the Scandinavian countries; and that is, all presume that the Government can run things better than the private sector.  We were all so distressed at that time. Keep in mind this is just a year and a half ago. Even the American Medical Association bought a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal and said they were throwing in the towel, raising the white flag, ``We surrender.'' For a few crumbs, they were willing to give up this system and take Hillary's health care system, and that was only a year and a half ago.  I had an experience a couple weeks ago that drove home to me what a great system we have now. I have a close friend, Mr. President. He is an ear, nose, and throat surgeon in Tulsa, OK, one that has a very, very fine reputation among his peers and nationwide. I was talking to him and shared with him in casual conversation, about 20 years ago, that I lost my sense of smell. He said, ``Come around sometime and I will examine you.''  I went in and he said, ``You need to have surgery.'' It is called endoscopic nasal surgery. It is a really yucky thing to talk about. But nonetheless, this is 2 weeks ago. Today, I am walking around and I have characterized this, Mr. President, as the most significant non-Christian experience that I have had or change in my life. I now have had this restored, and I have a sense of smell. This could not have happened in any other country, where you have a choice of practitioners to go to, you have the state of the art and a degree of professionalism that none of the other countries have. It happened to me.  Now, a year and a half ago, we were willing to give that up. And now, if you surveyed the American people, they know that we are making changes, that we need to do something about medical malpractice. They know we are going to come up with medical savings accounts and improve the system we have now. But the Government is not going to take it over.  Well, this is what we are going through right now. By the way, this is, I think, unprecedented for the Washington Post to do. They came out with another editorial, and this was on September 25, called ``Medagogues, Cont'd.'' I will read the last two sentences:       The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut      connection because it is useful politically. It allows them      to attack and to duck responsibility, both at the same time.      We think it's wrong.  Again, that is what the Washington Post said.  I ask unanimous consent that at this point this editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 25, 1995]                           Medagogues, Cont'd       We print today a letter from House minority leader Richard      Gephardt, taking exception to an editorial that accused the      Democrats of demagoguing on Medicare. The letter itself seems      to us to be more of the same. It tells you just about      everything the Democrats think about Medicare except how to      cut the cost. That aspect of the subject it puts largely out      of bounds, on grounds that Medicare is ``an insurance      program, not a welfare program,'' and ``to slash the program      to balance the budget'' or presumably for any purpose other      than to shore up the trust fund is ``not just a threat to . .      . seniors, families, hospitals'' etc. but ``a violation of a      sacred trust.''       That's bullfeathers, and Mr. Gephardt knows it. Congress      has been sticking the budget knife to Medicare on a regular      basis for years. Billions of dollars have been cut from the      program; both parties have voted for the cutting. Most years      the cuts have had nothing to do with the trust funds, which,      despite all the rhetoric, both parties understand to be      little more than accounting devices and possible warning      lights as to program costs. Rather, the goal has been to      reduce the deficit. It made sense to turn to Medicare because      Medicare is a major part of the problem. It and Medicaid      together are now a sixth of the budget and a fourth of all      spending for other than interest and defense. If nothing is      done those shares are going to rise, particularly as the      baby-boomers begin to retire early in the next century.       There are only four choices, none of them pleasant.      Congress can let the health care programs continue to drive      up the deficit, or it can let them continue to crowd out      other programs or it can pay for them with higher taxes. Or      it can cut them back.       The Republicans want to cut Medicare. It is a gutsy step.      This is not just a middle-class entitlement; the entire      society looks to the program, and earlier in the year a lot      of the smart money said the Republicans would never take it      on. They have. Mr. Gephardt is right that a lot of their plan      is still gauzy. It is not yet clear how tough it will finally      be; on alternate days you hear it criticized on grounds that      it seeks to cut too much from the program and on grounds that      it won't cut all it seeks. Maybe both will turn out to be      true; we have no doubt the plan will turn out to have other      flaws as well.       They have nonetheless--in our judgment--stepped up to the      issue. They have taken a huge political risk just in calling      for the cuts they have. What the Democrats have done in turn      is confirm the risk. The Republicans are going to take away      your Medicare. That's their only message. They have no plan.      Mr. Gephardt says they can't offer one because the      Republicans would simply pocket the money to finance their      tax cut. It's the perfect defense; the Democrats can't do the      right thing because the Republicans would then do the wrong      one. It's absolutely the case that there ought not be a tax      cut, and certainly not the indiscriminate cut the Republicans      propose. But that has nothing to do with Medicare. The      Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection      because it is useful politically. It allows them to attack      and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. We think      it's wrong.
