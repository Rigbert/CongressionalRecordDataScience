 President, there may be honest differences of opinion between the Senator from North Dakota and I, but when he makes the claim that this tax bill is not fair, I refer to the chart behind me.  When our legislation is passed, this bill will make the income tax system more progressive. We have heard the other side say that the upper income gets more out of the tax cuts. First, the people paying the taxes will get more tax reductions. But after this bill is enacted, the wealthy will be paying more of the taxes than they are paying now.  As we can see specifically, where the Senator from North Dakota said that the top group would be getting 33 percent of the benefit, take into consideration that they are paying 35.9 percent of the total taxes today.  I have a second chart. This chart shows that the tax relief share is greatest in families earning less than $50,000. It is all because of our bill. More than half of the $750 billion that we have in rate cuts in this bill go to the new 10-percent rate. We can see here that we have very carefully tried to craft a bill that is progressive and retains the progressiveness of the present tax system.  About the President's proposal, we are not dealing with the President's proposal on the floor today, as the President would like to have it. With the reality of the makeup of the Congress, it never will be. But let's just say that we were debating today the President's proposal that he announced in the campaign and behind which he still stands as his policy. If it were carried out, the top income people in America would be paying a higher percentage of the total income tax take of the Federal Treasury than they do today. So I don't want to hear anybody talk about the progressiveness of our tax system being diluted at all because of either this bill or the President's bill.  I yield the floor.
