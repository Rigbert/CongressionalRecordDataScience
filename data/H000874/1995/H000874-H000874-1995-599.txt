 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight with my colleagues to highlight the many achievements thus far of the reinventing government efforts under the Clinton administration.  With the leadership of the Vice President and the strong support of the House Democrats and, I might say, the Republicans, we were able to enact many more reforms which have already had a positive impact on the people they were designed to help, the American people, the taxpayers. Congresswoman Maloney has cited a number of examples. The opportunities for reinvention in the Treasury Department under the jurisdiction of the appropriations subcommittee I chaired were great. As a result of our efforts, the Treasury Department and related agencies are more customer-friendly, more cost-effective, and much, much more efficient. Where we could eliminate waste, we have. Before reinvention, every time the Government made a small purchase, it spent on an average $50 in paperwork over and above the cost of the item. This obviously accounted for tens of millions of purchases last year, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in paperwork costs.  I want to show this Visa care, which has Bill Clinton's name on it. Now with this purchase card, the very same purchases are made with no paperwork cost at all. Let me reiterate that. No paperwork cost at all. Eliminating an average $50 cost on millions of purchases. That is tens of millions of dollars instantly saved by our Government because of this little card that all of us use all the time.  Let me show you what that meant. We used to purchase this stapler for $54. Outrageous. That did not mean that the stapler cost $54, but in order to purchase it, we had to spend $54 on the paperwork.  Bill Clinton and Al Gore came to town and said, ``That is done.'' Bill Clinton and Al Gore said we can save the American taxpayers millions and millions of dollars if we cut out all that paperwork and simply use this little card.  Now with Bill Clinton and Al Gore's reinvention of government, we pay $4 for this stapler, which is what we ought to pay for this stapler. Fifty dollars on just one item. That is the kind of government American taxpayers expect and want.  The American people have asked us to cut our pork and justify Federal projects. As a result of reinventing government, the General Services Administration now carefully reviews all Federal construction projects in a program called Time-Out and Review. They assess the Federal need and appropriate size and design of these projects and ensure that the costs are fully justified.  Very frankly, Mr. Johnson, who is the administrator of that agency, was asked by President Clinton and Vice President Gore to look at these projects, see if we can save some money. Some of these projects are in districts that are represented by Democrats, some in districts represented by Republicans. This was not a political matter. This was a commonsense matter. How can we exercise common sense and save our people money?  Madam Speaker, I know you will be pleased to hear that so far over 200 projects have been reviewed and, you are not going to believe this, a $1.2 billion savings has been effected, now that Bill Clinton and Al Gore are looking at these things very carefully.  These reforms have taken what was wasteful and inefficient and reinvented these programs into efficient successes.  Madam Speaker, how many times have we heard tragic stories of people who have never received or lost their Government checks and have had to wait for countless weeks for their new checks to be processed? A critical problem, a crisis for some. Many times these checks, often Social Security checks, are vital to pay for medical expenses, rent, food, medicine. Checks missed that created crisis in home.  Because of reforms instituted as part of Vice President Gore and President [[Page H1959]] Clinton's reinventing government initiatives, the Financial Management Service office of the Treasury located in my home State of Maryland has turned their once horrible 54-day turnaround into a more customer-friendly less than 2-week turnaround and alleviated the concerns of many average working Americans and Americans who are retired and concerned and reliant on those checks. This office now processes 8,000 check requests a month, over 400,000 claims each year, quickly, efficiently, and in a way that is customer friendly.  Perhaps, Madam Speaker, what is most surprising about this success story is that this office improved their customer service and productivity with 32 percent less staff, which is what the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Maloney] was talking about in terms of that little graph going down. And in the face of a 28 percent workload increase. Twenty-eight percent increase in workload, 32 percent decrease of staff, and doing it in 25 percent less time than it used to take. Those Federal workers should be commended, Madam Speaker, for their efforts at not only taking part in initiating these reforms but also for successfully implementing the new techniques and procedure.  As the Vice President has correctly pointed out on many occasions:       We don't have bad workers, we have bad systems. We have      worked hard and succeeded at reinventing the bad systems into      systems that work and work well.  Madam Speaker, I want to close with one of the biggest examples of wasted paper and inefficiency. During the previous 12 years prior to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore coming to town, the Federal personnel management manual had been thousands of pages. They spell out many of the policies and procedures for Federal employees. But unfortunately it contains too much unnecessary information and red tape.  Because of our efforts last year, and I want to show a picture here of Mr. King, Jim King, who is the director of OPM. He has a wheelbarrow full of paperwork.  I know all of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about, ``We need to get rid of all this paper.'' Well, here is a wheelbarrow that Mr. King is pushing full of paper. We have reduced those forms.  Madam Speaker, you will recall when our President was talking about the Federal budget. This is the paperwork that we had when we came to town. Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton, this is what they have gotten rid of.  We no longer have that to deal with. Luckily, the table withstood the impact of all that paper. We are getting rid of it.  Why? Not just for the sake of having a gimmick that I can put on the table here and make sort of a funny little demonstration of, but because all of us know that America is drowning in paper. Business complains about it, educators complain about it, citizens complain about it, and we are doing something about it.  The Vice President in his leadership of reinventing government at the direction of President Clinton has said, We hear you, Mr. and Mrs. America. We hear that you want a smaller, more efficient, less costly government. We hear you, that you want you government reinvented so it does more with less and does it better, like those checks getting to recipients in a much quicker fashion.  I am very pleased to join my colleague from New York in saying that we are not there yet. We have more to do. There is still 10 percent. Ninety percent of the paperwork we have gotten rid of. But there is 10 percent left.                              {time}  2250  We are still looking at that to make sure that manual is as lean and effective as we can make it.  As important, Madam Speaker, as these reforms and other reforms are, it is equally crucial that we continue to build on these many successes and continue to enact more reforms in this Congress.  We are pleased that our Republican colleagues are joining us in the effort to reinvent government. Yesterday's government is behind us now and we must continue the task of doing our share in developing the government of the 21st century.  I have high hopes that the success of reinventing government in the 103d Congress that the Democrats so proudly enacted with the help of many of our Republican colleagues is only the beginning and that the second National Performance Review will be as successfully implemented in the months ahead.  I thank my colleague from New York, Mrs. Maloney, for her leadership on this issue and for yielding to me for this time.
