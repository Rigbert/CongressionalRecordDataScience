President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator Kennedy, Levin, Reed, and Schumer to introduce the Children's Firearm Access Prevention Act of 2001.  My legislation is modeled after similar legislation that Texas enacted into law under then Governor George W. Bush in 1995. It is my sincere hope that President Bush will work with Congress to enact this important bill.  While many in Congress have argued that the Second Amendment guarantees individuals the right to bear arms, there has been far less discussion about the corresponding responsibilities of gun owners to keep their firearms away from children.  The Children's Firearm Access Prevention, CAP, Act of 2001 subjects gun owners to a prison sentence of up to 1 year and a fine of up to $4,000 when they fail to use a secure gun storage or safety device for their firearms and a juvenile under the age of 18 uses that firearm to cause serious bodily injury to themselves or others. The CAP bill also subjects gun owners to a fine of upto $500 when they fail to use a secure gun storage or safety device for their firearm and a juvenile obtains access to the firearm.  My legislation includes commonsense exceptions. Gun owners would not be subject to criminal or civil liability when a juvenile uses a firearm in an act of lawful self-defense; takes the firearm off the person of a law enforcement official; obtains the firearm as a result of an unlawful entry; or obtains the firearm during a time when the juvenile was engaged in agricultural enterprise. Gun owners would also not be liable if they had no reasonable expectation that juveniles would be on the premises, or if the juvenile was supervised by a person older than 18 years of age and was engaging in hunting, sporting, or other lawful purposes.  CAP laws have reduced unintentional shootings in states that have enacted these laws. In Florida, the first State to pass a CAP law, unintentional shooting deaths dropped by more than 50 percent in the first year following enactment. 17 states, including my home state of Illinois, have enacted CAP laws.  A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, in October of 1997 found a 23 percent decrease in unintentional firearm related deaths among children younger than 15 in those States that had implemented CAP laws. According to the JAMA article, if all 50 States had CAP laws during the period of 1990-1994, 216 children might have lived.  While I understand that some Americans feel safer with a gun in the home, the sad reality is that a gun in the home is far more likely to be used to kill a family member or a friend than to be used in self-defense. Over 90 percent of handguns involved in unintentional shootings are obtained in the home where these shootings occur. Many unintentional shootings could be prevented if firearms were safely stored.  Children and easy access to guns are a recipe for tragedy. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in this effort to protect children from the dangers of gun violence.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1355       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
