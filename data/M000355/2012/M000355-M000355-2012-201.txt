 President, today I wish to recognize the Rotary Club of Louisville, which is celebrating its 100th year of service to the Louisville community this year. Chartered on July 22, 1912, it has left Louisville, the State of Kentucky, and our Nation better off thanks to its efforts over the past century.  The Rotary Club of Louisville was the first Rotary Club in Kentucky and the 45th worldwide, welcoming members from 10 regional States. Today, between 450 and 490 Louisville-area residents are members of this organization.  In its early years, the Rotary Club of Louisville engaged in several local service initiatives. One of the club's first major projects was to restore the burial place of President Zachary Taylor, a Louisville native. In 1918, members established a student-loan fund for young men at Male High School and Manual High School during World War I. When radio was in its infancy, a weekly radio program was broadcast by the Louisville Rotary Club in 1922 and 1923. In the flood of 1937, members of the club assisted in cleanup and repair throughout the State.  During the World War II era, the Louisville Rotary Club expanded its outreach to the world, fundraising for the war effort and working with defense-related agencies. Many of the club's members also served in the Armed Forces. After the war, notable accomplishments included the building of George Rogers Clark Park, as well as founding the Harelip and Cleft Palate Foundation.  In 1953, the Louisville Rotary Club began its time-proven training for new members, or ``Yearlings,'' which is still used today, and the following year, the Club adopted the Rotary International Constitution. In 1987, the historically male club admitted its first female member, Patricia W. Hart, the Club's executive director. Also in 1987, members of the club donated $137,000 to the Rotary International program to eliminate polio worldwide.  The Rotary Club of Louisville has created several awards to honor its members for their contributions. In 1975, Howard Fitch was recognized as the club's first Paul Harris Fellow for his contribution to the Rotary International Foundation. Today, there are 275 Paul Harris Fellows. In 1991, the Rotarian of the Year Award was started, and in 1999, the ``Lifetime Service Award'' was established and first awarded to Henry Heuser Sr., posthumously.  In recent years, members of the Louisville Club volunteer locally by providing career guidance for high-school seniors and graduates and a mentoring program for high-school students. Along with this, members regularly work as bell-ringers for the Salvation Army. Internationally, the club works with student-exchange programs and various diverse scholarships, including the Ambassadorial Scholarship Competition, the International Scholarship Competition, and the Kentucky Rotary Youth International Exchange.  In 1996, the ``Saving Lives Worldwide Program'' was created to collect and deliver U.S. medical supplies to the world's poorest countries. During its first 8 years, this program completed 17 shipments valued at $4 million to 10 developing countries, including Nicaragua, Latvia, Nepal, Romania, Panama, Ecuador, Belize, and Ghana. Along with this, the Louisville Rotary Club has worked with clubs internationally to open six new dental clinics in Panama, Ecuador, and Nepal.  The Rotary Club of Louisville has created the Rotary Leadership Fellows Program, which identifies individuals early in their careers with the potential to become community leaders. These individuals are then invited to participate in a 3-year Rotary Leadership Development Program.  In honor of the club's centennial celebration, the Promise Scholarship program has been initiated to provide hundreds of high-school graduates with grant money to help pay for college tuition.  The past 100 years have seen the Louisville Rotary Club meet and exceed the Rotary International credo of ``Service Above Self.'' It is an honor to represent here in the U.S. Senate so many civic-minded Kentuckians of goodwill who understand the value of public service. I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the Rotary Club of Louisville for its 100 years of service to the Louisville community, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the world.                          ____________________
