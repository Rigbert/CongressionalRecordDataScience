We need a new attitude in terms of rebuilding our infrastructure and bringing it up to a state of good repair at the White House.  There seems to be some reluctance. The President said after his jobs summit that he just had to admit that shovel ready wasn't always shovel ready, and he seemed to be referring to infrastructure. But actually, the infrastructure money is already 60 percent spent and underway and the other 40 percent will be obligated before spring to begin to catch up with that deficit.  Now, the Department of Energy has already spent about 8 percent of their money; HUD, I don't know if they've spent any of it. There are all sorts of fantasy programs out there that were in the stimulus where money hasn't been expended, but in transportation and infrastructure it has been invested and it is going to save lives and it is going to get people to work with less congestion and less damage to their vehicles by bringing the infrastructure up to date.  I would like to try and bring this home to the White House because they just don't seem to be listening. This was--or is--a lag bolt; it's about 60 years old. You can see it's kind of missing the bottom. Well, this lag bolt was involved in an accident on the Chicago Transit Authority. This is what holds down the metal plates that hold down the rail. They have a life span of about 40 years. There are thousands of them on the system waiting to fail.  Now, when the Chicago Transit Authority got $250 million--that's a lot of money--under the stimulus bill, they spent the money in 30 days. Thirty days. These aren't just your old public works construction jobs; these are, first off, almost all private sector jobs bid out on contract. Secondly, much of it was invested in sophisticated equipment and manufactured goods. So that $250 million produced a huge multiplier effect. They were buying new buses because their buses are decrepit. People who build buses were getting good wages. The people who build things to go on buses--tires, brakes, all that because of ``Made in America''--they were getting jobs, too. So actually, the shovel-ready stuff was ready and is underway when it comes to transit and highway infrastructure.  Like this failed bolt in Chicago, the Chicago Transit Authority could spend another $6.5 billion just to bring their system up to a state of good repair, and they can spend that money very quickly with a huge multiplier effect. Why can't the economic team at the White House understand that? Their pointy-head theories about, oh, infrastructure takes so long and it doesn't have a good multiplier, unlike giving people a little bit of money in withholding--or green grid, whatever that is, where a penny hasn't been spent. Somehow this is just too old school for them, fixing up our country, putting people to work, manufacturing and construction jobs.  We have 160,000 bridges on the Federal system that should be posted. The American people should see a big sign saying, ``Danger, the bridge over which you are about to drive is either weight limited, structurally deficient, or functionally obsolete.'' One hundred sixty thousand bridges. Now, if we began a program to replace those, it doesn't take long, look how quickly we replaced the bridge in Minnesota. It doesn't require lengthy environmental impact statements or planning, it's replace and fix the bridges, it's concrete, it's steel, it's workers, it's aggregate, it's made in America. You can't export those jobs.  But somehow the people on the President's economic team don't get that, or maybe from the back seat of their limousines they can't see that the bridges and the infrastructure are deteriorated, and they sure as heck aren't on the creaky public transit systems that are falling apart and here in D.C. killing people because the infrastructure is so outmoded and so substandard.  It is embarrassing for the greatest nation on Earth to be devolving toward a fourth-world infrastructure--we're not even third world. We are investing less of our GDP in our infrastructure than are many third-world countries. We are formerly first world, formerly world leader. Now we are watching our competitors around the world vault ahead of us with high-speed rail, with modern transit, with beautiful new highways, with safe bridges that are designed to current standards. But no, we can't afford it. And even if we could afford it, like taking some of that unspent TARP money or maybe some of the other unspent stimulus money, they don't want to do it downtown.  It's time for a new attitude downtown. Don't jeopardize the people of America with this kind of outmoded infrastructure anymore. Get it, guys. This means jobs, and it's something the American people believe in.                          ____________________
