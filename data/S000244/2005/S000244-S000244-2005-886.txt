Chairman, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. Chairman, we have heard another attack on delayed notification or sneak-and-peek warrants. Let me tell you what has happened earlier this month. A U.S. district judge in Washington State executed or authorized a delayed-notification warrant to look into a building on the U.S. side of the northern border. And what was discovered but a rather sophisticated tunnel between Canada and the United States to smuggle contraband, and perhaps terrorists, through the border and into this country without being detected by our border patrol.  Using a delayed-notice search warrant, the DEA and other agents entered the home on July 2 to examine the tunnel. Shortly thereafter, a U.S. district judge authorized the installation of cameras and listening devices in the home to monitor the activities in the home.  Using these twice, Federal, State and local law enforcement officials observed multiple trips by three defendants through the tunnel carrying large hockey bags or garbage bags. These bags were loaded into a van on the U.S. side and driven south for delivery.  Ninety-three pounds of marijuana were found in these bags when the Washington State Patrol stopped the car. That never would have happened without a delayed-notification warrant. And if they can bring 93 pounds of marijuana in, they can bring terrorists in as well.  These warrants are good. They protect us. They ought to be kept.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Sweeney). The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Harman) each will control 15 minutes of debate from the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra).                              {time}  1400
