And for my entire career, I have voted for clean coal research and development because southern Ohio has a whole lot of Btus underground in the form of coal.  However, I really object to the gentleman taking the funds from the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy account. I would like you to know that that account, in this bill, is cut $986 million below last year's level, and that is a deep concern because that is the part of our economy that is growing.  Ten percent of the jobs produced in the energy sector are in renewables, and we actually employ more people in solar and in wind energy than we do in coal extraction. So we know that a major part of our future lies in new energy technologies, these developingtechnologies which have been proving themselves.  An additional cut of $33.4 million in the EERE account would further weaken these new technologies. And I will guarantee you that the technologies are so valuable that the Russians and the Chinese are hacking into these companies repeatedly because of their importance to the future, and they recognize where the future is headed. And we have got a real job on our hands to hold on to these technologies because of that and because of their market manipulation.  China is a great market manipulator. She has a state-run economy, and it is not fair. If they can't steal the technology directly--if you invest over there and you take your technology there, they steal your IT there.                              {time}  2100  So just since 2003, our country has spent $2.6 trillion importing foreign petroleum. When you think about the importance of America being energy independent here at home, coal, clean coal, has a role to play in that, but these new technologies have a major role to play as well. We all support a diverse energy portfolio to eliminate our reliance on imported energy--some would say addiction to imported energy. We have been breaking that addiction.  We should be advancing technology to clean up fossil energy, yes, and this bill already does that with sufficient funding to the fossil energy accounts. Our country should be leading investment in these technologies, not just for our own energy security, but also for economic opportunities and the jobs that this expanding market is already providing us.  We can't really afford to cede this market to any other country in the world, and I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, let me just close quickly by saying we are not talking about West Virginia. We are talking about all across the country. These laboratories are located in colleges and universities all across America.  Coal is something that is expanding. Our exports are up 58 percent. People around the world are going to use coal. I think it is the responsibility for us to show them how to burn it cleanly. China is going to increase their use by 43 percent. India is going to double its consumption in that same timeframe.  When you compare the amount of research, only 18 percent currently of all the Federal dollars for research is in fossil fuel, but 56 percent is in renewable. That is not balanced.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).  The amendment was agreed to.
