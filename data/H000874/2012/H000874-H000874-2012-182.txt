Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, all of us through our lives meet people, particularly when we were young--and I'm sure this happened to people who were with leaders of our country. Thomas Jefferson, a young man, I'm sure there were people who met Thomas Jefferson when he was 25 and they said to themselves, boy, this guy's really got his head in the clouds. And then he became one of the great people of democracies in our world.  When I was 23 years of age, in 1962, I was working for a United States Senator whose name was Daniel Brewster from our State of Maryland. That summer, he hired as an intern a young woman--younger than me, but about my age--close--and we had the opportunity to get to know one another. We sat approximately 12 feet from one another as a young college graduate and a young law school student. That was 1962.  Through the years, I stayed in Maryland, and that young woman got married and moved to California. Just a few years later, I came to the Congress of the United States, and 6 years later she came to the Congress of the United States, after having been the chairman of her party in the largest State in the Union, having been very much involved with the United States Senate, having been a leader in our country, not as a Member of Congress, but in her role as a significant party leader and a member of the Democratic National Committee.  When Sala Burton died, herself a member of a distinguished political family, this young woman ran for Congress of the United States. Her father had served in the Congress of the United States, been a member of the Appropriations Committee, been mayor of Baltimore city, and been the father of a mayor of Baltimore city. How proud he would be of this young daughter he raised at his knee, not, frankly, as somewhat caricatured as a San Francisco, but as a Baltimore City pol--I say that with great affection--who knew how to put neighborhoods together, who knew how to take care of citizens in that city. That's where she learned her politics.  As Thomas Jefferson had people who attacked him bitterly, she has had the same. We all have that in this game that we participate in that we care deeply about. That young woman that I first worked with in 1962 became the highest-ranking woman in the history of our country in our government. And now we note--some celebrate, others note--her attaining of a quarter of a century of service in this body.                              {time}  1410  And all of us will be able to tell our grandchildren. I have my grandchildren now. Maybe I'll have more, but I have a number of them now, and a number of them are young women, and I tell them how proud they can be of the leadership and the trail that has been blazed by this extraordinary woman.  I've talked to a number of you on the Republican side of the aisle, my good friend Roy Blunt, and he says to me, he said, Boy, that woman has a spine of steel. And that she does. Those of us who have dealt with her know that she's one of the strongest leaders any of us have served with, whether you agree with her or don't agree with her.  So I rise, Mr. Speaker, to note this anniversary of 25 years of service of Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi, from the State of Maryland, the very proud State of Maryland, to have a daughter like Nancy, and a State that is proud of its citizen servant, Nancy Pelosi.  Ladies and gentlemen, I now have the great honor of yielding to my friend. He's of a different party, but we're both Americans. We both love this institution, and he is now, himself, not quite as historic a figure because there have been many men who have been Speaker of the House of Representatives, but my friend, John Boehner, Speaker of the House.
