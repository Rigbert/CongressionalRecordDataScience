 President, and I will be very happy to have Senator Feingold in this.  I think this is really the kind of discussion that we should be having. I welcome the free flow.  If I knew a better way of solving the problem Senator Kyl mentioned, I would do it. But my view and what Intelligence staff and others have said to me is that the way it is worded creates a rubberstamp out of a FISA judge, once you take out that agent of a foreign power connection. I guess the reason they believe that is that it puts them into the other side, the title III side.  If I could think of another way, I would. But it is one added guarantee against an overreach. You and I have both known zealous prosecutors. You and I have both known people who would misuse this. The question comes, How do we prevent misuse from happening?  I am happy to yield to Senator Feingold.
