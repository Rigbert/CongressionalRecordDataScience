President, I rise today to highlight the concerns of some of my constituents who are participating in an adult basic education program conducted by the ARC of Northern Rhode Island.  Earlier in this session, John Mullaly, on behalf of his classmates, wrote to me to express his concerns regarding the use of the word ``handicapped''.  Mr. President, individuals who live with disabilities are one of the nation's great untapped resources. They have much to contribute, and they deserve to be fully integrated into every aspect of society. I am proud that so many of my colleagues share this point of view and that 70 senators have joined in cosponsoring S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act, legislation that allows individuals with disabilities to join the workforce while maintaining their health benefits under Medicare or Medicaid.  As we debate this and other related legislation in the Senate, I hope that my colleagues will also consider the vocabulary we use. Mr. Mullaly and his classmates have suggested that we replace the term ``handicapped'' with the phrase ``persons with physical/mental challenges''. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of Mr. Mullaly's letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             The ARC of Northern Rhode Island,                                                 February 2, 1999.     Senator Jack Reed,     Providence, RI.       Dear Senator Jack Reed: We are students of Adult Basic      Education at the ARC of Northern Rhode Island. We believe      that everyone should be treated equally and be given the      chance to be the best that he or she can be. No one should      suffer discrimination. We know you agree with this. We are      trying to educate the general public and we need your help.       We are trying to tell them that it discriminates against us      to refer to us as ``handicapped''. It is not an appropriate      word because it puts a stigma on us and a limit as to what we      can do. It is incredible what we can do and we would prefer      to be referred to as persons with physical/mental challenges.      We will take the challenge! That term gives us inspiration to      meet our goals. What are our goals? To be the best we can be,      to give others love, kindness, and inspiration. Also, to      protect the rights of others like us, and to educate the      public.       Will you help us? Will you work towards using the new      terminology on signs in public places? We would also like      suggestions from you on how we can help bring this about and      protect the integrity of all concerned.           Sincerely,                                       John Mullaly, spokesperson,     Adult Basic Education Classes.                          ____________________
