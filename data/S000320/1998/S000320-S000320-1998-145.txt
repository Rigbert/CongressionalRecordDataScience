 It is my hope that this funding will be made available expeditiously and equitably to those States currently recovering from disasters. While the funding provided through this bill, due in great part to your assistance, will help, I believe that Alabama will still face huge hurdles in its recovery process. I look forward to continuing to work with you to address the needs of those trying to rebuild.
