 Speaker, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations.  As the chairman knows, I am particularly concerned with the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It has been very cold in my part of the country, and during earlier CR's there have been disruptions in funding for this vital program.  The administration has released $810 million to the States, but I am concerned that the flow of funds to the States could again be disrupted. Generally I would like to know whether this CR will affect the full commitment of funds to the--funds of LIHEAP--to the States. Specifically, is it the chairman's understanding that under the current bill before the House, funds for LIHEAP will be allocated to the States and be available for distribution to the States in the normal fashion?
