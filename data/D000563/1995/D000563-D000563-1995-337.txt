Speaker, everyone concedes, Democrat, Republican, and Independent alike, that the welfare system in America is a failure. My political party, the Democrats, should not be so proud that they do not concede that fact as well. But the Republicans should not be so spiteful or short-sighted as to believe that just ending or getting tough on welfare will solve the problem.  We have got to take people off of welfare and put them to work. That is why we had 205 Members, 1 courageous Republican, and all of the Democrats on this side of the aisle who voted, voted for the Deal substitute last night. Liberals, conservatives came together and said, ``Let us put people to work.''  Why does the Republican welfare reform bill fail when it comes to work? Because they will not invest money in education, training, day care, the obvious things you need to bring someone off welfare.  What do the Republicans do with the money they save from their welfare reform? They put it into a tax cut, a tax cut for the privileged few. Now, does that make sense?   [[Page H3741]] If we are going to solve the welfare mess for good, take people off welfare permanently. We need to put them to work. The Deal substitute did it. The Republican welfare plan does not.                          ____________________
