President, I am pleased today to recognize the 55th anniversary of Electro Scientific Industries, Incorporated, ESI, and to honor the accomplishments of Mr. Douglas C. Strain, ESI's founder and first president and chairman of ESI's board.  Established in Portland in 1944, ESI was among the first high-technology companies in Oregon. Since that time, ESI has grown into a global leader in the manufacturer of precision laser trimmers and memory repair equipment, as well as a worldwide supplier of electronic production equipment. From humble beginnings, ESI has become a $200 million company, employing more than 900 individuals in Oregon and around the world, and helping to establish Oregon as one of this country's high-tech capitals.  Accomplishments such as these are often born of tough challenges. Having overcome a devastating fire in the 1950's, ESI had to rebuild itself from the ground up, and has had to re-invent itself on a number of occasions since that time. The company has proven itself adept at adapting to the fast-pace that characterizes the high-technology sector. From test and calibration equipment, electron microscopy, and analog computing to laser trimming, memory repair and vision, handling, packaging, and drilling technologies, ESI products have always been at the leading edge of technology developments.  I especially pay tribute to a remarkable Oregonian, Electro Scientific's founder, Mr. Douglas C. Strain. On October 24, Doug will celebrate both his 80th birthday and his retirement from ESI's board of directors. Mr. Strain's vision and perseverance have brought the company successfully to the end of this century, and I believe that ESI will continue on with equal success well into the next century. I congratulate Doug on his accomplishments and wish him the very best as he undertakes new challenges in his life.                          ____________________
