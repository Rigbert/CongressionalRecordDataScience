He and I have worked together on this issue over the past several years. We proposed that the Appropriations Committee address the issue of an operational test and evaluation in its bill and they did so after the Army failed to comply with report language that was included in the FY 1998 Defense Appropriations Conference Report. To me, it is clear that the Congress directed the Army, in bill language in Title IV of the FY 1999 Defense Appropriations Act, to begin the development of a test and evaluation plan during this fiscal year using the $15 million provided in Title IV as well as to commence work integrating the two candidate missiles on an AH-64D helicopter; and that the money could be used for no other purpose. Does the distinguished Chairman agree with me?
