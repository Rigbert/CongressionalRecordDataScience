Mr. Speaker, I do rise in strong support of this legislation. I am a little bit chagrined my good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cunningham), recognized the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) and thanked him for his support but forgot the chairman, except later on. There is a priority here, and I always worry about that.  Other than that, this is a good piece of legislation. The gentleman is absolutely correct. The idea that a fish, or a shark, could be caught, and they have enough bad times the way it is, but to take just the fins, et cetera, and return them to sea to die a very hideous death is beyond my comprehension.  Whatever can happen, sometimes these types of pieces of legislation can have good intentions and they are not implemented by the State Department, because we have to recognize we have a lot of rules about how one sees interception now with our salmon in Alaska, and yet we have documentation where the Coast Guard has identified the death curtains at high seas and the Coast Guard tries to implement and enforce our international agreement and the State Department tries to pull them off and say we do not want an international incident.  I will say again, I voted against trading with China and I will say again the Chinese Government is the guiltiest one of all of catching these fish at high seas with these huge, long nets. Until the State Department sees fit to enforce those type of laws, these sound good and feel good on the floor of the House; but we have to have someone with a little backbone and an administration that will say, all right, this is the law, this is an agreement we reached and enforce those laws so that we can stop the heinous-type action with shark finning, and of course, with catching the fish at high seas.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation.
