Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Massachusetts and his very articulate self has kind of laid forth the Democratic platform on what they would like the Congress to accomplish during the next 2 years. We are not dealing with prescription drugs and all of the other issues that the gentleman from Massachusetts is talking about. We are dealing with the simple proposition of whether the Constitution should be amended to make it harder for Congress to raise taxes. That is the proposal that is before us, and that is the proposal that we are voting upon today.  Now, I would submit that the American people think that it should be hard to raise taxes, and I would also submit that the American people historically have not trusted Congress very much when the time comes to deal with bills that raise taxes. So all this amendment proposes to do is to force there to be a national consensus on raising taxes, which is required in a two-thirds vote. It is really pretty simple.
