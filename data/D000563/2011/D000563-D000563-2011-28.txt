President, I have a press report that was released today relative to the testimony of Director Robert Mueller of the FBI, which I referenced in my speech. So that his statement will be reported more fully at this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the press report from Politico.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From www.politico.com, Dec. 14, 2011]  On National Defense Authorization Act, Robert Mueller Not Satisfied                           (By Josh Gerstein)       FBI Director Robert Mueller said Wednesday said he remains      concerned that a defense bill containing provisions about      military custody for terrorism suspects could interfere with      the FBI's ability to investigate terrorist incidents and      interrogate those believed responsible.       On Monday, a House-Senate conference committee announced a      revised version of the National Defense Authorization Act      that lawmakers said addressed many of the concerns that led      White House officials to threaten a veto. However, at a      Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday morning, Mueller      said he remains worried about aspects of the bill.       ``The drafters of the statute went some distance to      resolving the issue related to our authority but the language      did not really fully address my concerns. . . .'' Mueller      said during questioning by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),      who opposes the detainee-related language in the bill. ``I      was satisfied with part of it with regard to the authority, I      still have concerns and uncertainties that are raised by the      statute.''       Mueller said he fears that the legislation would muddle the      roles of the FBI and the military.       The bill ``talks about not interrupting interrogations,      which is good but gaining cooperation is something different      than continuing an interrogation,'' Mueller said. ``My      concern is that . . . you don't want to have FBI and military      showing up at the scene at the same time on a covered person      (under the law], or with a covered person there may be some      uncovered persons there, with some uncertainty as to who has      the role and who's going to do what.''       Mueller said later that he worries confusion caused by the      legislation could affect the FBI's ability to build rapport      with suspects.       ``Given the statute the way it is now, it does not give me      a clear path to certainty as to what is going to happen when      arrests are made in a particular case. And the facts are gray      as they often are at that point,'' the FBI director said      under questioning by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) ``The      possibility looms that we will lose opportunities to obtain      cooperation from the persons in the past that we've been      fairly successful in gaining.''       Backers of the defense bill say it will improve      intelligence collection by making military custody the      default for certain terrorism suspects. President Barack      Obama has established civilian custody and courts as the      default for terrorism cases, with the option to direct them      to military commissions when the Justice and Defense      departments deem it appropriate.       Since the conference bill was unveiled Monday, the White      House has been mute about whether the changes to the bill are      enough to win Obama's signature or whether he plans to carry      through with the veto threat.
