President, this morning I had the opportunity to address the issue of missile defense from my perspective as the chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee.  In the course of our deliberations over many months, with many hearings, hours of testimony, and more hours of briefings and staff contacts, we looked very closely at the proposed budget for missile defense this year by the Department of Defense. We supported many of their initiatives.  We are recommending $6.8 billion of new funding for fiscal year 2003. But let me put that in a larger context. For fiscal year 2002, the Department of Defense estimates they have only spent $4.2 billion of previously authorized money, leaving approximately $4 billion of carryover funds for fiscal year 2003. So our recommendation, together with carryover funds, will give the Department of Defense more than $10 billion of available funding for fiscal year 2003.  That is a staggering amount of money. It is the largest 1-year funding source for missile defense I think we have ever had in our history. It is the combination of not only what we authorize this year for fiscal year 2003, but what has been authorized and not spent for fiscal year 2002.
