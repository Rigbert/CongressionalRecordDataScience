 I think he is absolutely correct. We have a very limited number of days this year upon which to accomplish anything. It is going to require a high level of bipartisan cooperation to advance measures that are essential to the country, which we all, for the most part, agree on--not to mention items that may be more contentious. I thank my friend.                          ____________________
