 I do not think the American people are particularly interested in that.  What we know they are interested in, all the surveys indicate what they are interested in, is seeing the Congress work together to do something important about the No. 1 issue in the country, and that is the price of gas at the pump.  We have a chance, if we stay on the subject--I am optimistic that we are going to have some amendments that are agreeable to both sides. We can move forward. The majority leader, who is in charge of the schedule, can get us back on any subject he chooses at any time of his choosing. So I would hope our colleagues would vote to stay on the subject of lowering the price of gas at the pump for the American people.
