President, in the 1980's, we were told that it was possible to increase defense spending, cut taxes and still balance the Federal budget. The national debt quadrupled in those years. President Clinton was elected on a pledge to reduce the budget deficits that had crippled the economy through the Reagan-Bush years. For the first time in two decades, we have actually cut the deficits and the economy is improving. Now, we are again hearing the siren song of tax cutting and increased defense spending from the same people who were the source of our national discontent. We have to build upon the solid accomplishments of the last 2 years--not upon the wreckage of the previous 12 years.  Senator Bumpers is offering this thoughtful list of future spending cuts that will save taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. They are in contrast to the many words being tossed about to justify a return to the failed policies of the past.  I support most of the spending cuts proposed here today. But we need support from the new Republican majority to relieve the American taxpayer of the burden they impose on all of us.  Some of these cuts will actually enhance existing programs. For example, if we cap production of the C-17 cargo plane at 40 planes and instead buy existing aircraft like Boeing 747's or Lockheed C5's, we can save $5 billion over the next 5 years and increase our air cargo capabilities.  If we cancel the fifth and sixth military communication satellites known as Milstar, we can save $2 billion over the next 5 years. These satellites were designed to survive a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, a nation that doesn't even exist any more. Instead, we should accelerate development of the smaller, cheaper Milstar III, which will deliver more communications capability for the regional conflicts that we are most likely to encounter in the future.  The international space station will consume $52 billion of taxpayer money over the next 15 years. I am not against space exploration, but NASA has never justified the immense cost of this program in terms of scientific returns.  We need to intensify our efforts to develop cheap, reusable launch vehicles that make space more accessible. then we can consider space stations, space factories and other futuristic projects.  The Navy wants to spend $3 billion over the next 5 years to refit our Trident ballistic missile submarines with the super-accurate D-5 nuclear missile. These missiles were designed as bunker-busters for Soviet ICBM's, which are being disarmed as we speak. And we have D4 missiles that can deliver an acceptable nuclear punch in the unlikely event of total nuclear war.  I don't agree with everything Senator Bumpers proposes. We differ on his recommendation to cut $5 billion from the intelligence budget. I prefer to await the recommendations of the Presidential commission set up last year by Congress to review the roles and missions of our intelligence agencies.  I reserve my opinion on the Advanced Neutron Source reactor because I have not had an opportunity to analyze the details of this program. I may very well join Senator Bumpers in opposition in the future--but I just don't know enough to make an educated judgement at the present time.  In sum, there are tens of billions of dollars to be saved in these spending cuts, without any threat to national security, and the very real possibility that our defense will be strengthened as a result.  Along with Senator Bumpers, I urge incoming Senators and Representatives to make a genuine, bipartisan effort to review these options to make our government less costly and more efficient. We have some old white elephants straining the costs of government. We don't need great new ideas--just a little courage--to end these programs.                                 ______      By
