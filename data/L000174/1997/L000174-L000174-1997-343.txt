President, on March 16, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Senator from New York State, turned 70. Senator Moynihan has been referred to, quite properly, as the intellectual of the Senate and called by many, a renaissance man. I mean no disrespect when I say that during a couple of the gatherings of the Irish on March 17, he was also referred to as the ``World's Largest Leprechaun.''  To me, Senator Moynihan is a good friend and a mentor, a wise voice that I heard before I was in the Senate, and since. He is a man who has spoken with great prescience on issues involving families and the economy, global power and welfare reform, on so many things.  Senator Moynihan has served in administrations of both Democrat and Republican Presidents. He has always been ahead of his time, sometimes with a controversial voice that then turns out to be the only accurate voice.  Like all other Senators, I wish him very well as he heads into the latest decade of his life.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a column by David Broder entitled ``The Moynihan Imprint'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 16, 1997]                          The Moynihan Imprint                          (By David S. Broder)       Today is the 70th birthday of a unique figure in the public      life of this nation for the past four decades, the senior      senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Tomorrow, a      day-long symposium and a celebratory dinner at the Woodrow      Wilson Center will make it clear just how large Moynihan's      legacy is.       Previewing the papers to be delivered, as Georgetown      professor Robert A. Katzmann, a onetime student of Moynihan's      and organizer of the tribute, allowed me to do, was a      reminder of just how rich and varied the New York Democrat's      contributions have been.       He has been prescient about subjects as diverse as the      crisis of the American family and the breakup of the Soviet      Union. As his fellow scholar Seymour Martin Lipset points      out, his 1965 report for President Johnson, titled ``The      Negro Family: The Case for National Action,'' was bitterly      controversial at the time. But 30 years later, everyone has      come to understand that the wave of out-of-wedlock births and      the scarcity of jobs in the inner cities are overwhelming the      welfare system and threatening the stability of the whole      society.       As Michael Barone of Reader's Digest notes, it was Moynihan      in January of 1980 who said that ``the defining event of the      decade might well be the breakup of the Soviet empire.''       Moynihan was unable to persuade his colleagues in      government to move in timely fashion to head off the family      crisis he discerned, or to curb the excessive costs of the      1980s arms race with the Russians.       But as Stephen Hess, his deputy in the Nixon White House,      and half a dozen others argue, he was a shrewd and often      successful operative in policy jobs and diplomatic posts      under four presidents (two of each party) and for the last 20      years as a member of the Senate.       For all his focus on social problems, Moynihan has left a      strong physical imprint on the nation as well. In his Labor      Department days under President Kennedy, he managed to      rewrite the architectural standards for government      buildings and to launch the rehabilitation of Pennsylvania      Avenue into what is now nearing completion as the grand      ceremonial thoroughfare of the Republic.       As a senator, Moynihan six years ago fundamentally      redirected national transportation policy by converting the      traditional highway program into something grandly called the      Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act--a charter      for states and communities to use federal funds for mass      transit as well as roads. Characteristically, as another      paper points out, he had written a magazine article as far      back as 1960 on the negative impact the highway-building boom      of the 1950s was having on older cities like New York.       Sweeping as they are, the papers to be delivered tomorrow      do not embrace all the aspects of the Moynihan persona.      Together with his wife, Liz, a warmhearted woman with the      toughness it takes to have run most of his campaigns,      Moynihan has a great gift for friendship, a talent for      keeping score of slights or rebuffs--and a really wicked      sense of humor.       On the last point, a speech that Moynihan delivered at a      Gridiron Club dinner during the Reagan administration remains      indelible in the memories of all who were there. It was his      idea to explain to a bemused President Reagan that David      Stockman--Reagan's precocious but controversial budget      director, who had been a live-in baby sitter of the Moynihans      during his Harvard graduate student years--was in fact a      Democratic mole who had been programmed to subvert the Reagan      presidency from within. It may have been the funniest      Gridiron speech ever.       I also cherish the memory of a Moynihan speech in      Philadelphia during the Democratic presidential primaries of      1976. Moynihan was supporting his great friend, Sen. Henry M.      ``Scoop'' Jackson of Washington, and had been dispatched by      the Jackson campaign to fire up a dinner audience of labor      union Jackson backers. They were, of course, drunk and      boisterous by the time he arose, but Moynihan delivered a      scholarly discourse on the forces shaping the American      economy and the Western alliance, worthy of a Harvard      seminar. And when he got around to his candidate, a man of      sterling qualities but no great pizazz, he was inspired to      describe Jackson with one of the most gracious phrases ever      applied to someone who was really boring. ``Our candidate,''      said Moynihan, ``is blessed with the charisma of      competence.''       The union guys had no idea what the hell he meant, but they      knew it deserved applause. That's the way many of us in the      press feel about Moynihan. He's sometimes over our heads, and      often light years ahead of us. But we know he's something      special.
