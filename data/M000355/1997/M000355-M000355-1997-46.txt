  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Education Association,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1997.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 2.3 million member National      Education Association (NEA), we urge you to support real      campaign finance reform and to reject legislative attacks on      unions that are currently being presented in the guise of      reform. NEA is supportive of the revised McCain-Feingold bill      that was offered on the Senate floor on September 29. We are      strongly opposed to the Lott amendment that would unfairly      curb the advocacy rights of unions, including the NEA.       While NEA favors a broad package of reforms that would      include voluntary spending limits coupled with partial public      financing, the McCain-Feingold bill is an important first      step. First and foremost, it would ban the unregulated and      excessive ``soft money'' donations that have undermined the      integrity of our political system. Further, it contains      important provisions to ensure greater disclosure and      stronger election laws. We are particularly pleased that the      revised proposal drops any limitation on contributions by      political action committees (PACs). NEA believes that small-     donor PACs level the playing field and allow working      Americans to have a more effective voice in politics.       NEA is supportive of full disclosure provisions affecting      issue advertising. We do, however, have concerns about      McCain-Feingold's provisions that would curb issue      advertising in the 60 days prior to elections. These      provisions are ill-defined and overly restrictive of      legitimate legislative advocacy, and would inhibit the      ability to speak freely on issues while they are being      debated and decided in Congress. Despite this caveat, we      believe that McCain-Feingold merits your support.       The Lott amendment is clearly intended not to advance the      important cause of campaign finance reform, but to subvert      it. The amendment is based on the false premise that members      of unions do not join voluntarily; in fact, membership is      voluntary. Further, unions in general, and the NEA in      particular, operate under democratic decision-making      processes. The annual NEA Representative Assembly, which      determines the Association's policy and sets the legislative      program, is the largest democratic decision-making body in      the world.       On the other hand, the Lott amendment raises serious      constitutional issues of free speech and association. It is a      transparent attempt to curb the rights of unions to engage in      not only political but legislative advocacy at the federal      and state levels. The NEA strongly opposes this measure,      since it would cripple our ability to advocate on behalf of      our membership on the many important issues affecting      children and education that come before Congress.       It is patently unfair for the Lott amendment to single out      the voluntary dues of unions for this restrictive treatment,      while allowing a host of other groups across the political      spectrum (such as the Christian Coalition and the National      Rifle Association) to continue to collect voluntary dues to      fund their lobbying and advocacy efforts. The same double      standard is applied to corporations, since the Lott amendment      would not require businesses to effectively seek the approval      of stockholders before using their funds for political      activities.       In summary, we urge you to support McCain-Feingold and      oppose the Lott amendment. This is an important turning point      for the American political system, and it is critical that      the congress take action that will foster, not hamper, the      participation of working Americans in our democracy.           Sincerely,                                                        Bob Chase,                                                        President.  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?
