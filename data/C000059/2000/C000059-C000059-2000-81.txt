Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.                              {time}  1315  I come from Southern California. We are being attacked by what is called the glassy-winged sharpshooter, which is capable of totally destroying the wine industry.  I want to make one point, Mr. Chairman: Insects do not wait. They do not wait for a competitive grant, they do not wait for a competitive investigation of whether one insect is more deserving of investigation or research than another. We do not have time. When an insect first hits the ground, it starts reproducing at a rapid rate. They become endemic very quickly.  We have found in California if we do not respond, for instance, to the fire ant that was found recently, or the Formosa termite, which was literally eating its way across San Diego, or the Medfly, and continue to have research on that most destructive insect, I think everyone would agree in the United States, which totally destroyed, by the way, the citrus industry in Florida many years ago, that these research grants need to be responded to immediately. They cannot wait. We do not have the time. We have to give the responsibility to people to make those types of decisions.  I would say that I join my friends on both sides of the aisle in opposition to this amendment. I would hope for the sake of the produce industry, certainly something very important in California, that this amendment is voted down.  We do not get subsidies on our crops in Southern California. We are produce farmers: strawberries, fruits and vegetables. Our farmers really have to succeed on the price of their produce. The only thing that we have to get us in some kind of a competitive advantage is good research. I want to stand for research and in opposition to this amendment.
