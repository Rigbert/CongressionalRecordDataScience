 President, careful consideration was given to the formation of the National Swine Research Center.  A national peer panel recommended the establishment of the Swine Research Center because the needed research was not being conducted in any other State or Federal laboratory nationwide.  The program of research is not duplicative.  The mission of the research center is to develop technology to ensure that the U.S. pork industry operates as an environmentally sound and efficient animal production system.   [[Page S4796]] It will help maintain and increase the competitiveness and efficiency of U.S. pork production and marketing.  This is the answer which the Agricultural Research Service of the USDA gave in response to a question from the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee.  Concerns expressed by Members of the House of Representatives have not been about the facility itself or the research that it will conduct.  Their concerns have been with the outyear funding of research.  The ARS and the pork producers are currently working on this and are making a good faith attempt to consolidate swine research programs in the future to reduce program funding requirements.  Pork production is on the increase in many States.  The research at this center will help pork producers nationwide.  ARS has no swine research projects in the areas of waste management, marketing, economics, housing, management, human health, or swine health, welfare, and behavior in production systems.  Permit me to try to answer the key questions about the National Swine Research Center.         national swine research center facility justification  What national strategic issues are associated with pork production?  Conservative projections indicate that the United States, in an environment of trade liberalization and increased demand, will have an opportunity to triple its pork exports, currently 262,000 tons), in the next 10 to 15 years. At that level, the impact would be the creation of 36,000 U.S. jobs and $1.1 billion in income, U.S. input-output model. Other parts of the world, including areas in Europe and South America, are poised to take advantage of this opportunity.  What are the barriers to growth in U.S. pork production and pork exports?  Major barriers to growth in U.S. pork production are related to manure management/nutrient utilization, odor control, water quality, employee health, animal well-being, and housing and food safety questions associated with increased pork production. Current USDA facilities are not designed to research these questions; nor are they staffed by scientists with the expertise to study them; nor is it feasible to convert them for the type of research the industry urgently needs.  What are the social concerns associated with increased pork production?  Our society places a high value on environmental quality, water quality, protection from odors associated with swine production, worker health, and animal well-being. At a 1994 international meeting of experts on odor perception and odor production, scientists agreed that the difficulty of obtaining objective measures of odors was a serious problem for the swine industry.  We must develop systems that allow U.S. producers to be competitive while meeting our Nation's social and environmental expectations.  How can these problems be solved?  A national group, including representatives from major pork-producing States and the public and private sectors, examined the opportunities and threats facing U.S. pork production. These group recommended the establishment of the National Swine Research Center, concluding that a unique new swine research center was required to provide the conditions for addressing complex, systems-based issues of critical importance to the survival and growth of the Nation's pork production sector.  Why should a public institution conduct this research?  The center will focus on the type of research that is best suited to public institutions. Private sector incentives to conduct such research are inadequate; advances are likely to be widely useful within the United States; and results will provide a national strategic advantage in pork production with positive impacts on rural development, the national economy, and the Nation's balance of trade.                        research program summary  Research at the National Swine Research Center will focus on environmental quality, including water and air quality, utilization of manure, and housing designs to improve conditions for rearing swine and preventing human health problems.  In addition to areas of research already described in this document, proposed projects include:  Development of manure-based soil amendments for urban use,  Separation/concentration/drying/fermentation technologies for manure,  Methods to store and handle manure,  Production of biomass energy crops with organic fertilizer, and  Production of methane from manure.  The center will be the source of creative new research on a wide range of production, health, environmental, and socioeconomic issues that must be resolved to support U.S. producers' bid to claim a substantial share of growth in the world market for pork.  Finally, this is a list of current major ARS swine research projects:                   USDA-ARS Program on Swine Research       In FY 1995, $26.1 million was appropriated for ARS to      conduct swine research at 13 ARS locations. The areas of      swine research currently pursued are: foreign animal      diseases; domestic animal diseases; reproduction; food      safety; nutrition; systems; parasites; stress; pork quality;      genetics; and growth. ARS has no swine projects in the areas      of waste management, marketing, economics, housing,      management, human health, or swine health, welfare, and      behavior in production systems.            Current Major Areas of Research on Swine in ARS       Genetics (Beltsville, MD, Clay Center, NE) Development of      genomic map; identify genes associated with disease      resistance; identify animals with superior reproductive      capacity.       Reproduction (Athens, GA, Beltsville, MD) Sorting of male      and female sperm cells, cryopreservation of gametes and      embryos; neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction; genetic      and physiological factors that influence litter size.       Nutrition and Growth (Athens, GA, Beltsville, MD, Clay      Center, NE, Columbia, MO, Fayetteville, AR) Neuroendocrine      and bioregulation of physiological and genetic factors that      influence fat and protein metabolism; endocrine control      studies to increase the lean and reduce the fat in pork.       Domestic Diseases (Ames, IA, Peoria, IL) Viral-induced      reproductive diseases; enteric diseases; bacterial and      microbiological factors that influence the level of disease      and production efficiency       Foreign Animal Disease (Greenport, NY) Foot-and-mouth      disease; African swine fever.

Lafayette, IN) Improve baby      pig survival by reducing stress and environmental factors;      breed and diet effect on quantity, quality, and composition      of pork; metabolic regulation of fat synthesis.       Food Safety (Albany, CA, College Station, TX, Clay Center,      NE, Wyndmoor, PA) Rapid test to identify drug and antibiotic      residues; microbiological safety of port carcasses and pork      products; control of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria on      meat.  I do feel the managers of this bill want to get to a vote soon. I believe with the forceful response that the Senator from Washington just gave as to the wrongness of the amendment by the Senator from Arizona, plus the defense of this decision of the subcommittee on this specific swine research center, I do not need to add a great deal to how unjustified the amendment is that is offered at this point.  I will simply make a couple points, one in regard to the Federal Government's involvement in agriculture research. It has been a policy of the Federal Government since 1862, with the establishment of the land grant universities, to have the Federal Government very deeply involved in agricultural research and education to enhance the productivity of our farms and to enhance the quality of the product of our farms. That research is much more sophisticated today than it was 132 years ago. That research must still continue to go on to keep our agricultural industry competitive.  It happens that there is a research facility proposed at Iowa State University. There are swine research facilities located at other universities, or research centers. The one established at Iowa State University is not duplicative. I have an official response from ARS on that that I am going to read in closing.  It should not be surprising to anybody that the Iowa State University would be very deeply involved in agriculture research in the first place and even specializing to a considerable extent in swine research because my State is first in the production of corn, [[Page S4797]] my State is either first or second to Illinois in the production of soybeans, and we are No. 1, way beyond any other State, in the production of pork. One out of every four pigs in America reside in my State. We are a massive pork producing State. And Iowa State University is right in the middle of it. So nobody should be surprised whatsoever if there is a determination made by a national organization, the Congress, following up on proposals by outstanding research groups in America that we need to do specific research in a specific aspect of the swine industry that might be located at Iowa State University.  That is the history of agricultural research. I wish to speak to a specific point, and I am just going to read a short statement on this point, about the suggestion by the Senator from Arizona that there is so much swine research already, why do you need another swine research facility?  Well, the simple answer to that is the different specializations of the different facilities around the United States. I could give a long list, but I will not bother to do so, of what research has been done. But a Congressman from my State, Mr. Latham, had an opportunity to ask the Agricultural Research Service this question:       The National Swine Research Center--  And that is the one that the Senator from Arizona proposes to delete. I wish to start over again. Mr. Latham asked the question:       The National Swine Research Center has been criticized on      the basis that it will conduct duplicative research. What is      your opinion on the research mission of the center and do you      think it is duplicative?  This is the response from the Agricultural Research Service of the USDA to the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee:       A national peer panel recommended--  I wish to stop just a minute. The reason I wish to emphasize, ``A national peer panel recommended,'' this is not some Congressman or Senator getting something for their particular State. This was a studied approach.       A national peer panel recommended the establishment of the      National Swine Research Center because the needed research      was not being conducted at any other State or Federal      laboratory nationwide. The program of research will not be      duplicative. The mission of the National Swine Research      Center is to develop technology to ensure that the U.S. pork      industry operates as an environmentally sound and efficient      animal production system. It will help maintain and increase      the competitiveness and efficiency of the U.S. pork      production and market.  I hope those are adequate responses to the supposed justification of the Senator from Arizona for this deletion so that my colleagues will not rescind this project and that we will move forward.  If we make a decision to move forward, I wish to emphasize what the distinguished Senator from Mississippi said. We are only going back to conference with the House and take a second look at this. My judgment is a second look based upon the recommendation of a national peer panel will show that this is not duplicative and it is needed, particularly in the area of cleaning up the environment and having an environmentally sound pork producing system; that this will move forward.  I yield the floor.
