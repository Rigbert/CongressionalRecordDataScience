President, I am pleased that the Senate has acted quickly and in a bipartisan way to ensure that fees collected by United States Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, are not diverted for other purposes this fiscal year.  The Director of the USPTO has done a remarkable job in his short tenure dealing with a massive backload of patent applications and a serious budget shortfall. The action that Congress has taken today will at least provide short term financial help to the agency by ensuring that the USPTO is not penalized for having done more work this fiscal year than it had anticipated.  More needs to be done to modernize and improve our patent system, which is a crucial component of our economic recovery. Bipartisan patent reform legislation is ready for Senate action. This bill will provide the legal structure we need to allow our inventors to flourish. It will improve our economy and create jobs without adding a penny to the deficit.  While I strongly support the action the Senate has taken today, we cannot fix our overburdened and outdated patent system simply through additional appropriations. Congress must act on meaningful patent reform legislation this year.
