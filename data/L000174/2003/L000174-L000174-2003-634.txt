President, we have moved the time up, I realize, in the next 6 minutes for the first vote. That is something I have agreed to accommodate a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle who have commitments. As a result, also as a result of yielding time to the distinguished Senator from Alabama, who had one of the nominees and, of course, appropriately should be speaking, and others, I will not be able to say all the things I wanted to.  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 20 minutes after the conclusion of the final rollcall vote today.
