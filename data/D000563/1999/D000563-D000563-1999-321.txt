I ask the Senator if he would consider the following:  In this Nation where we revere free speech, we basically let people say what they want to say. Some people have gone so far as to suggest that tomorrow will be the end of the world. Well, when tomorrow comes and goes and the world doesn't end, most of those people shrink away.  The people who are offering this amendment, in 1993, said the Clinton plan for deficit reduction was the end of the economic world for America. We would see deficits as far as the eye could see. We would have unemployment, high inflation, the economy was in terrible shape. As a result, not a single Republican would vote for the Clinton plan.  I ask the Senator, did the world end, as Senator Gramm and others suggested, with this Clinton plan? The same group is suggesting to us today that Alan Greenspan is wrong, Bill Clinton is wrong again, and that we have to pass this tax break for wealthy people which will endanger our economy.
