Many working families depend on the minimum wage. In fact, 73 percent of those affected by the proposed minimum wage increase are adults. Many are trying to support their families on a minimum wage, and that minimum wage has been mauled by inflation. This should be a bipartisan issue.  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut just said, as others have, the last time it was raised it was--I believe my good friend from New York will agree with this--under a Republican President, and the time before that, the Senator from New York reminds me. We had Republicans and Democrats joined together on this. The last minimum wage increase, which was a 2-year 90-cent increase just like the one that is under consideration today, received overwhelming bipartisan support when it was voted on in 1989. In fact, it passed the House by a vote of 382 to 37--better than 10 to 1. It passed the Senate by a vote of 89 to 8--again, better than 10 to 1.  Back then, Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich voted for raising the minimum wage, but today some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle fiercely oppose any raise in the minimum wage. I find it ironic that some of the same Senators who would vote to give tax breaks to the wealthy are against giving working families a raise. Some have said they will fight with ``every fiber of their being'' the idea that a person who works 40 hours a week could make as much in a year as Members of Congress make in a month.  So let us not play politics with the lives of working families struggling to live on the minimum wage. We need to pass a minimum wage increase now. I hope my colleagues will support Senator Kennedy's amendment and support this bill to make the minimum wage a living wage.  Let us be serious about what we are talking about. Let us think, would any of us accept for ourselves or our families the basic minimum wage today? Would any of us accept the idea that our family, members of our family, would try to support a family, whether it is our children, our siblings, cousins, or anybody else, at the minimum wage?  They cannot live on it in Vermont. They cannot live on that in California or Texas or, frankly, Mr. President, in any State in this country. So let us let the Senate at least stand up and do the right thing.  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator from New York.                               Exhibit 1             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 12, 1993]    The Working Poor: Minimum-Wage Jobs Give Many Americans Only a                              Miserable Life in rural vermont, some go week to week, hoping no major bills hit them                       hunting bear for the table                           (By Tony Horwitz)       Newport, VT.--On payday, Brian Deyo's sole purchase is a      $4.96 box of cheap bullets known as ``full metal jackets.''       Mr. Deyo works full time at a hockey-stick factory. He      takes home $188.40 a week. After rent and utilities, that      leaves about $20 for food--and no margin at all for      misfortune, such as the one Mr. Deyo now faces. Vermont's      brutal cold hit freakishly early this fall, and he must buy      heating oil three paychecks ahead of plan.       ``Every day I'm making choices,'' says Mr. Deyo, who has a      wife and a chronically ill two-year-old daughter. ``Do I pay      the rent and risk having the power cut? Or do we take a      chance on both and buy food?''       This payday, the choice is clear: He's two weeks late on      the rent, and the fuel tank must be filled. Unable to afford      food, he will hunt for it. Stalking through the icy woods      beneath the Green Mountains, Mr. Deyo mulls his life. At age      28, he senses he has done something wrong, but he isn't sure      what. ``I'm proud to be a workingman,'' the son of two      factory workers says. ``I only wish I made a living.''       ``Making work pay'' has become a Clinton administration      catch phrase, but one that appears increasingly hard to      fulfill. Put simply, the aim is to lift working Americans      above the poverty line--a threshold that Mr. Deyo and 9.4      million others currently don't reach. Almost 60% of poor      families have at least one member working. ``Someone who      plays by the rules and tries to work full time should be able      to support a family,'' says Lawrence Katz, chief economist at      the Labor Department.       However, with universal health insurance--one means toward      achieving this goal--under siege, the administration has      retreated from another. In late October, after arguing for      months that a modest rise in the minimum wage is needed to      help pull workers out of poverty, Labor Secretary Robert      Reich shelved his campaign until after Congress votes on      health-care reform. This delay was welcomed by business      groups, which argue that an increase would cost jobs because      employers would automate, relocate overseas or cut staff to      recoup higher labor costs.       But what's often obscured by such policy debate is the      sheer harshness of life in low-wage America. The minimum      wage--currently $4.25 an hour--was mauled by inflation in the      1980s and now provides an income so meager that welfare      recipients often do better if they turn down jobs paying it.      A full-time minimum-wage worker grosses $8,840 a year--$2,300      under the poverty line for a family of three. In 1979, the      same worker earned $459 above the line.       The depressed minimum wage also anchors the bottom end of a      pay ladder so low that even people who, like Mr. Deyo, climb      up a few rungs are still in poverty. In fact, such workers      often are worse off than those earning $4.25 an hour because      they are more likely to be adults and heads of households      qualifying for little or no government assistance. Many      minimum-wage workers are young part-timers with other income      from spouses or parents.       ``Families where the main breadwinner is making $5 or $6 an      hour--these are the people who are really hurting,'' says      Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings      Institution. This largely forgotten group also helps account      for the 44.3% jump in the number of working poor between 1979      and 1992.       America's working poor are mostly white, mostly high-school      educated and disproportionately rural--a profile that is      typified by the three-county corner of Vermont known as the      Northeast Kingdom. This bucolic landscape of moose crossings,      maple-syrup stands and scarlet foliage also harbors 10%      unemployment, closed mills and ramshackle homes.       Barbara Stevens runs a crisis center in Newport, a town of      4,700 that is a two-hour drive from Burlington. The morning      after the first big chill, her office was crammed with      disheveled people unprepared for the winter and seeking help.      Many were on their way to work. ``They'd say things like,      `I've got two kids and no oil in the furnace, so we slept in      the car last night with the heat on,' '' Ms. Stevens says.       One such visitor is Mr. Deyo, the hockey-stick worker. Late      paying his bills, he has had his electricity disconnected      several times. This is a special calamity for Mr. Deyo; his      daughter has asthma and relies on a ventilator. Letters from      Ms. Stevens and local doctors have helped him to get his      power switched back on.       Ironically, Mr. Deyo is earning more than he ever has.      After years of minimum-wage jobs, he gets $5.50 an hour      stenciling trademarks onto hockey-stick blades. His annual      gross income is so near the poverty line that now he      qualifies for very little public assistance. In principle,      this suits him fine; he's a former National Guardsman and      a conservative Republican wary of government and liberal      ``do-gooders.'' But in practice, just a minor setback--     even a blown-out tire on his 1980 Buick--sets off a cycle      of late bills, ruined credit ratings and shakey      employment.       Though the cost of living here is low, his take-home pay of      $188.40 a week barely covers his fixed costs: $60 rent for a      cramped apartment, about $40 for heat, $40 for power (high      because of his daughter's ventilator and humidifier), $10 for      gasoline and $15 for installment payments on the family's few      possessions. The Deyos can't afford a phone. That leaves      about $20, mostly spent at a discount market that sells      dented cans and crushed boxes.       ``We don't buy taped boxes because the food could have      spilled on the floor and been scooped back in,'' says Roxanna      Deyo, who stays home because she is loath to put her frail      child in day care.       The Deyos also live in terror of small shocks that can      knock them off their tightrope budget. Three years ago, for      instance, their car developed transmission trouble. Unable to      afford a $500 repair bill, Mr. Deyo had to abandon the car--     and his job cleaning kitchens at a ski resort more than an      hour's drive away.       Soon afterward, the Deyos, seeking work in higher-wage      Massachusetts, sold all they owned to go there. But they ran      out of money before finding jobs. Two years later, they are      still making payments on the used, now-tattered furniture      they bought on their return north. Many needs are put off      indefinitely. Plagued by painful, rotted teeth, Mr. Deyo      waited two years until he was laid off and eligible for      Medicaid before having a few pulled.       Week to week, the Deyos still cling to one luxury. To      ``break the constant tension,'' Mr. Deyo says, he buys a      take-away dinner every Saturday, usually a plain pizza      costing $5.99.       ``I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do,'' says Mr.      Deyo, who dreamed of studying forestry when he graduated from      high school but couldn't afford the fees and went to work at      McDonald's instead. ``I work hard, my family's together. But      I'm running just to stay where I am, which isn't a real great      place.''       His most recent frustration: an attempt to free his family      of rent--and of their grim quarters--by purchasing a $24,000      trailer to park on his parents' land. A local bank refused      his loan request, citing ``excess obligations'' and      ``insufficient income.''       One upbeat note: the Deyos, who anxiously await their      annual rebate from the earned-income tax credit to catch up      on bills and buy appliances, should see the amount double in      early 1995 to about $3,200 because of a recent change in the      law.       A growing number of Americans share the Deyos' plight.      Lawrence Mishel of the Washington-based Economic Policy      Institute says 28% of adult workers are at wage levels too      low to keep a family of four out of poverty, compared with      21% in 1979. He also notes that their privation has deepened:      14.3% of adult workers now earn wages below 75% of the      poverty line, triple the 1979 percentage.       Mr. Mishel and other economists cite various reasons, such      as the decline of manufacturing jobs and of unions in an      ever-more technological economy. In addition, minimum-wage      increases, which tend to bump up the whole bottom of the pay      scale, didn't occur between 1981 and 1990. That especially      hurt young workers, such as Mr. Deyo, who began working      during the 1980s at the minimum wage and have edged up very      slowly ever since.       However, the depressed minimum wage may have kept alive      some jobs that otherwise would have vanished. Along Newport's      railroad tracks, in an old flour depot, American Maple      Products Corp. employs 40 people bottling syrup and making      candy Santas and other treats. The family-owned company is      typical of the light, often-marginal businesses that employ      many low-wage workers nationwide.       ``Maple candy,'' the company's president, Roger Ames, dryly      observes, ``is not your basic growth industry.''       Starting most workers at the minimum wage, Mr. Ames ekes      out profits of 3% on sales from what he admits is a creaking      plant. At one conveyor belt, nine people fill jugs with      syrup, then cap, date and box the jugs by hand--a task, Mr.      Ames says, that costly new machines can perform with two      workers. Nearby, two people run a 50-year-old device that      drops candy into molds, while other workers use their fingers      to smooth the fuzzy edges left by the plant's old tools.       ``If you're paying the minimum wage and it takes 20% more      time to do a job than it should, it doesn't seem that      critical,'' Mr. Ames says.       He adds that a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage would      cost him about $100,000 a year and force him to ``take a hard      look'' at labor-saving machinery. He would stop replacing      workers who leave or retire and go to a peacework system that      might penalize older employees.       ``I don't have a sweatshop mentality,'' Mr. Ames says. But      he says neither he nor other employers are likely to raise      their pay simply out of charity, particularly in a      competitive industry. ``If you had someone who mowed your      lawn every week for $5, would you reach in and pay $10 the      next week?'' he asks.       Moreover, he is under no pressure to raise pay because few      employers deviate from the prevailing wage. The result: an      uncompetitive labor market that traps low-skilled workers      even as they climb the pay scale. Connie Lucas went to work      at American Maple 12 years ago at the minimum wage and now      earns $6.10 an hour. With a weekly take-home pay of only      $151.50, and worried     about the plant's future (her husband also works there), she      decided to seek another job.       ``But every opening offers the same--$4.25, $4.25, $4.25,''      the 35-year-old Ms. Lucas says. ``I can't afford to work      another 12 years just to get back to where I am.''       Bonnie Buskey wonders whether she can afford to work at      all. Last spring, both she and her husband were unemployed      and received about $1,000 a month in public assistance. Now,      he works in construction, and she works full time at American      Maple at the minimum wage. Together, they bring home about      $1,200 a month.       But Ms. Buskey pays a baby sitter $2 an hour to look after      her two girls for part of the day, slicing her real wage      during those hours to $2.25. And now that the Buskeys are off      welfare, they no longer qualify for Medicaid. Unable to      afford health insurance, Ms. Buskey spent a week's pay on a      recent visit to the dentist and lives in dread of serious      illness.       ``The message from the government seems to be, `Stay home,      vegetate in front of the TV, and you'll be better off,' ''      the 29-year-old says. Asked why she doesn't, she shrugs.      ``Good old American pride. I like to think that I earn      whatever I get.''       In fact, some people do quit jobs because they can do      better on benefits. Ms. Stevens, the Newport social worker,      says she feels forced to advise jobless people to turn down      work at or near the minimum wage. ``I have to tell them, `The      job's good for your soul and good for your mind but not for      your pocketbook,' '' she says.       Trapped at the bottom by the low minimum wage, such workers      also must compete with people sliding down the pay ladder. At      the hockey-stick factory, Mr. Deyo's brother-in-law and co-     worker, Garth Shannon, has never worked for the minimum wage.      His first job after finishing high school was at a shoe      factory that paid $9 an hour. But after a wage dispute, the      plant moved to the Dominican Republic, and Mr. Shannon has      bounced down the pay scale ever since, enduring plant      closings, layoffs and menial jobs.       ``Most people plan for when things get better,'' says the      35-year-old Mr. Shannon, who wears thick glasses on which he      pays monthly installments. ``I try to plan for when things      get worse.''       As a foreman, he is among the factory's best-paid workers,      earning $5.95 an hour. But with a family of five, his poverty      is even worse than Mr. Deyo's. He heats his jerry-built home      with a wood stove in which he burns old doors and other scrap      timber salvaged from abandoned houses. He burns kerosene      lamps to save on electricity. Like the Deyos, the Shannons      can't afford a telephone. They also couldn't afford a      foundation when they built the house seven years ago; stones      and wood props keep it from sliding downhill.       A conservative man with a fierce work ethic, Mr. Shannon      has urged his wife to work part time rather than stay home      with their youngest daughters, age five and eight. As a      nursing-home housekeeper, who earns $4.61 an hour and brings      home $20 a week after baby-sitting bills. ``Work is what made      this country great,'' says Mr. Shannon, who has draped an      American flag across the front of his house.       But as he cooks home-made pizza for his girls, he confesses      to occasional despair at how little his labor provides for      his family. the worst moment came when his five-year-old's      kindergarten class took a day trip to a zoo in nearby Canada.      The Shannons couldn't afford the $12 bus fare and were too      proud to borrow. ``We kept her home that day so she wouldn't      feel bad about missing the trip,'' he says.       David Price, Mr. Shannon's and Mr. Deyo's boss, is      sympathetic. He helped pay for Mr. Shannon's glasses and      recently gave him his own children's outgrown clothing. But      like Mr. Ames at American Maple, Mr. Price doesn't need to      raise pay to keep his 13 workers; he has 500 job applications      on file.       So Mr. Price does small things, such as treating workers to      a birthday lunch. In October, it was Mr. Deyo's turn.      Devouring a prime-rib sandwich, he confides that it is his      first meal out in six months. Mr. Price also gives workers a      turkey at Christmas and a ham at Easter; Mr. Deyo still has a      bit of ham left, in his freezer, ``for emergencies,'' he      says.       But there is little else in the larder. So, on payday,      after banking his check to cover the rent, Mr. Deyo buys      bullets and drives to his brother-in-law's home. The two men      hike off in search of an animal Mr. Shannon recently spotted      in a cornfield. ``I've never eaten bear,'' Mr. Deyo says      excitely, toting a used military rifle he bought for $80.      ``But they look like they have a lot of meat on them.''       The two men soon find tracks but no bear. At dusk, after      two hours of tramping through dense woods, Mr Deyo spots a      crow--``edible if you cook it just right,'' he says. But he      can't get close enough for a shot. Frustrated, he aims at a      chipmunk. Mr. Shannon talks him out of it. ``There wouldn't      be enough meat there for a sandwich,'' he says.       Exhausted and cold, the two head back. Mr. Deyo tosses his      gun in the trunk. Mr. Shannon touches his brother-in-law on      the arm. ``It could have been worse,'' he says. ``At least we      didn't waste any bullets.''
