We hear all the time in this body and all representative bodies about what is desirable. It reminds me of the guy who went to the department store, and this beautiful, young, voluptuous saleslady came up to him and she said: Sir, what is your desire? And he said: Well, my ``desire'' is to pick you up after work, go out to dinner and drink some champagne and make mad, passionate love to you, but I ``need'' a pair of socks.  We have to distinguish between desire and need, and I think it is a difficult thing to do.
