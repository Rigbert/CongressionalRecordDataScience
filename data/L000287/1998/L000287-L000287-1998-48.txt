Let me just thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Dickey) for those words. I think tonight we are deeply grateful, in a sense we are more than lucky but really blessed that we have an organization like Faith in Politics Institute that brought us together. It is my hope that as a group that we will stay together and from time to time we will engage in other discussions and dialogue. This is only, as I said, but the beginning. This is just one step on a very long journey before we create the beloved community and open society.  I want to thank all of my colleagues for participating in this dialogue tonight.                          ____________________
