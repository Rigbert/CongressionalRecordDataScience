Speaker, before yielding to my friend for next week's schedule, I would like to join, I know, with all of our colleagues in wishing him a happy birthday. It is the majority leader's birthday today, and because I don't want him to retaliate, I'm not going to mention which birthday it is, but I want to congratulate him and wish him the very best. We'll have a birthday colloquy today.  I thank him for his leadership, and I yield to him to explain our schedule for the week to come.
