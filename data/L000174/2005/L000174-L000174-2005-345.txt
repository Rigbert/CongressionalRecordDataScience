President, as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition, and General Legislation of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee I am today introducing a bill with Senator Harkin, the ranking member on that committee, to provide additional emergency food assistance in response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, and the flooding in the aftermath of that massive storm. It is very similar to the efforts of Senator Landrieu and Leader Reid but it just focuses on food assistance.  This legislation will provide USDA with additional funding and authorities to provide a strong and continuous response to the food needs of thousands of families adversely affected by Hurricane Katrina.  While thousands may have perished in America's largest natural disaster, we must turn to the living to do what we can to help. I am especially troubled by the horror stories I have heard about the treatment of the elderly. It was almost impossible to watch the images on television.  Another terrifying image was of children separated from their parents, trying to survive on their own. The most gruesome was the bodies floating in black water.  In the Federal response to this national catastrophe there is a bright spot.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has done a good job. FEMA gets an ``F,'' in contrast. In fact, I heard today on NPR that the Navy was not given the go-ahead by FEMA to send ships with hospital facilities down to New Orleans and that senior naval officers were very frustrated that they could not help earlier.  In contrast, USDA has quietly and efficiently assisted thousands of displaced persons. Secretary Johanns, Deputy Secretary Conner and Under Secretary Bost have done a great job within the limitations of their authority. They responded immediately.  I also appreciate the work of the Food and Nutrition Service within USDA. I thank them.  This bill provides USDA with additional funding to continue its efforts and gives USDA some additional authorities regarding the food stamp program and child nutrition programs. Our effort on this legislation should be taken as a supplement to what they are already doing, and an enhancement of their authority.  USDA is not only helping in areas which will need to be rebuilt, but they are helping those families who have been displaced and been forced to move.  There has been a huge outpouring of sympathy from every corner of every county in my home State of Vermont. In addition to the assistance already provided, Vermont stands ready to help the displaced families, the unemployed workers, the distraught children, and the destroyed communities.  This bill was written to be referred to the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee where nutrition bills have always been handled in a bipartisan fashion.  I look forward to working with all the Senators on that committee.  Chairman Chambliss has tackled every issue the committee has faced this year in a direct and effective fashion and I look forward to working with him, and all members of the committee, on an emergency food assistance package that goes to the White House for signature.  I know that he and his staff have been coordinating with USDA and that Senators on the Committee will, of course, work with Senators from all of the affected States on any advice or changes that are appropriate. Some of the provisions in the bill are modeled after ideas that worked well in responding to Hurricane Andrew where, once again, USDA was commended for handling the emergency very well.  This bill is a starting point, not an end point. I know that, but I wanted to get the ball rolling to have language to run by my colleagues who represent areas demolished in this disaster. I want to thank Senator Reid and Senator Landrieu for coordinating with Senator Harkin and me on this matter.  All the Senators in the affected areas have been working day and night on trying to get aid to those in need, whether from local, State, charitable, non-profit or Federal Government sources. I will continue to work with all of them.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of Hurricane response to food stamps and food assistance be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Summary of Hurricane Response/Food Stamp and Food Assistance Response                         The Food Stamp Program       This proposal would provide USDA with additional funding      and authorities to provide     a strong and continuous response to the food needs of      thousands of families adversely affected by Hurricane      Katrina. It would improve the Food Stamp Program's response      to Hurricane Katrina. It generally would expire no later than      the end of federal fiscal year 2006. The President would have      the authority to terminate its provisions earlier if      conditions improved. The proposal would target three groups      of low-income households: those living in areas Katrina hit,      those that lost jobs in the disaster area, and those      relocated from the disaster area to other parts of the      country.       The proposal would incorporate the terms of USDA's      Hurricane Katrina disaster relief policy for the period      specified above:       States must act within seven days on all food stamp      applications from affected households.       Households doubled up with friends or relatives could apply      for food stamps on their own.       Work requirements and the three-month time limit on      childless adults regarding finding a job would be suspended      for disaster victims.       The legislation would expand food stamp assistance to      disaster victims:       To account for higher food costs for people in disaster      areas and people displaced by Hurricane Katrina, the maximum      benefit provided through the food Stamp Program is increased      by 10 percent.       The gross income limit for disaster victims would increase      from 130 percent of the poverty line to 150 percent. This      would help disaster survivors that suddenly incur high      shelter costs when, for example, they temporarily live in a      motel. (The net income limit would remain at 100 percent of      the poverty line to ensure that only low-income people      receive food stamps.)       All vehicles of disaster survivors, both those that they      have with them and those they left behind, would be excluded      from determining the household's resources.       For one year, all vehicles and bank accounts would be      exempt from the $2,000 resource limit in recognition that      households are facing many extraordinary expenses and should      not be required to spend down to $2,000 when their savings      may have to last them until they can find new jobs. In      addition, disaster relief aid from federal, state, or local      governments, charities, insurance settlements, and other      sources would not count as resources.       Assets owned by a household, but which are currently      inaccessible to the household due to the emergency, will not      be counted for purposes of determining food stamp      eligibility. for example, a family should not be rendered      ineligible because of a house or car the family had to leave      behind in the disaster area.       Food stamp benefits would not be prorated for the month      based on the date the household applies. Under disaster      conditions, families' applications may be postponed through      no fault of their own. During this time, the families are      forced to spend their scarce funds on food and remain just as      needy as families that were able to get a ride to the food      stamp office sooner.       The legislation also would streamline procedures for aiding      affected households by:       Having the federal government assume 100 percent (rather      than the usual 50 percent) of the administrative costs of      serving disaster victims. State expenses to address the range      of issues presented by these disaster victims are rising      constantly and this change will assist states in their time      of need.       Encouraging states to work aggressively to serve affected      households by excluding any errors in applying disaster      procedures from error rate calculations.       Waiving any claims for inaccurate issuances to affected      households except in cases of fraud.       Requiring USDA to work with states to eliminate duplication      between households initially certified for food stamps in      their home state that are then relocated to a different      state. Except where someone deliberately lies to get double      benefits, displaced persons would not be required to keep      track of which food stamps they received from which state      while this overlap is being resolved. Recipients should be      encouraged to spend food stamp benefits to feed their      families even when they are uncertain about the status of      their cases. This is particularly true since overburdened      state food stamp agencies may be ill-equipped to answer their      questions.    The Emergency Food Assistance Program and Commodity Distribution       In terms of immediate emergency relief, food stamp receipt      may, in some cases, not be the most timely form of assistance      that a family may access. Emergency commodities may be a      faster and more efficient manner by which to provide      immediate food assistance through food banks, food pantries,      and congregate meal sites. In order to provide USDA with      sufficient funding by which to provide emergency funding,      this food assistance emergency package includes;       $200 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program      (TEFAP), to be spent either on commodities or for      transportation, processing, and administrative costs.       $200 million for USDA to procure bulk commodities using      Section 32 authority.       $20 million for USDA to replenish Commodity Supplemental      Food Program commodity stocks destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children                                  (WIC)       To allow for unexpected increases in WIC caseload as well      as the possibility of rising food costs in the WIC program,      this package provides $200 million dollars (available October      1) for the WIC program.
