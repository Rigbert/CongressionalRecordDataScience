Mr. Chairman, as you know, the budget resolution includes a reserve fund for highways and highway safety. My reading of the relevant provisions indicates to me that if the Appropriations Committee reports a bill with obligation limitations for programs within the highway category in excess of $23.864 billion, then you as the chairman of the Budget Committee may increase the allocation for outlays for the highway program if the Appropriations Committee bill allocates the additional funding in accordance with TEA-21.                              {time}  1415  In addition, the outlays from the reserve fund cannot exceed $1.18 billion. Is that correct?
