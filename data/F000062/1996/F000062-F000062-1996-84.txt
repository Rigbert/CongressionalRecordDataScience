 President, Senator Graham offered an amendment which deals with the receiving of benefits by people who are newcomers to this country but here in a legal status as legal aliens. This amendment relates to that amendment. It provides that the ban on public benefits for newcomers to this country become effective September 1 of this year and last until they become citizens of this country, which can take place in 5 years. In essence, what we would do is take the provision of the bill which effectively prevents and throws off of any benefit program people in this country legally and we would make that prospective.  I do this as a Californian. This bill and this amendment has an enormous impact on California, and I want to say why.  Presently, in California, are 52.4 percent of all of the legal immigrants in the country on SSI. Fifty-two percent of all the legal immigrants in the country on SSI, aged, blind and disabled, are in the State of California.  This bill is where a good deal of the savings are gathered, whether the savings are $16 or $18 billion, clearly, 52 percent of those savings comes from California. I am here with my colleague, Senator Boxer, to tell you that 1 million people--bigger than the population of many States--on the date this bill becomes effective will be thrown OFF of AFDC, will be thrown off of SSI immediately. This includes in my city, San Francisco, very elderly and very senior Russian immigrants.  I remember watching a woman walk down Grant Avenue, she happened to be Chinese. She was so hunched over, she could barely walk. She is on SSI. She is a legal immigrant to this country. She would be summarily thrown off of SSI.  I happen to agree with something Albert Schweitzer once said: How you treat the least among us is a test of our civilization. Yet, I understand the need to make the changes. The costs have become so great and people are hesitant to pay these costs through their taxes. Therefore, what do you do?  Do you throw people off into the streets without no source of support, or do you send a message to the world and say: henceforth, when you come to this country as a newcomer, know that for the time you are not a citizen, you will not be able receive any of these benefits; know that before you come; know that your children will not be eligible for AFDC; the grandmothers will not be eligible for SSI or health benefits--know that before you come, the term on which you are coming to this country.  I think that is a fair judgment to make, to send that message. But, I think it is an unfair judgment, and possibly a very difficult judgment. It is easy to come up to this Chamber and come up to the desk and cast that aye vote. It is not going to be so easy when you see that crippled woman, whether she be Hispanic, or whether she be Chinese, Russian, African, or any other newcomer, white too, unable to survive, unable to participate in a program like Self-help for the Elderly or Unlock in My City, which deals with Chinese elderly newcomers to a great extent. I think that is a real dilemma in this bill.  Let me talk about what it does in California. It is estimated by the State and by the Department of Health and Human Services that the loss for California is anywhere from $7 billion over the period of this bill to $9 billion. The 20 highest-loss metropolitan areas are: No. 1, Los Angeles and Long Beach; then San Jose, Stockton, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Fresno, Modesto, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento, Oxnard, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Lompoc. Those are the areas that are impacted with the largest numbers.                           LOS ANGELES COUNTY  This measure is an unfunded mandate, essentially, on Los Angeles County. Its numbers and costs are a huge transfer of funds. Los Angeles County does not have the right to say ``OK, we have canceled SSI and your AFDC, so go home.'' People will still be there. If they can't walk down the street, if they are senile, if they are blind, if they are totally disabled, they will have no recourse but to fund them.  Let's take a look at how many people are involved in Los Angeles County, and what this transfer of cost is in the largest county in the United States.  This will immediately, in this county alone throw off of SSI 93,000 people who are aged, who are blind and who are disabled. The transfer to the county is $236 million this year and every year. It will throw off of AFDC 190,313 families. On the Medicaid provisions alone, the cost to the county is $100 million. So, the cost to Los Angeles County per year in just basic, preliminary estimates in terms of what would end up being a transfer is $336 million a year. I am told from some this could create a situation of bankruptcy for the county.  Is this really what we want to do? Some say welfare reform is a battle for the soul. Some say it is a battle for the heart. I really think it is a battle for the future. I understand the need to save costs, but I also understand that truly how we treat the least among us is the ultimate test of this Nation.  I would submit to you that, yes, if this amendment passes, we will reduce the savings of the bill. I would alsosubmit to you that unless we do this, in the largest State in the Union, in 2 or 3 years, we are going to see an absolute picture of devastation.  Forty percent of the Federal funding losses over the 6 years come from California. The bill, the way it stands, is estimated to cost $7 billion to $9 billion, nearly a million people are effected in the State of California, and in Los Angeles County alone, the estimate is 400,000 to 500,000 people impacted unless this amendment passes.  My statement to this body is, in essence, ``you could establish your principle, your public policy, which is, after all, what this body is all about, without actually harming and hurting people now who are deserving, whose total ability to live and exist in this country depends on their ability to receive SSI, or their ability to receive AFDC, or their ability to receive the medical care that they are covered to get under the law today. In essence, we change the law midstream on the most vulnerable people and are in this country legally.  I have a real problem with that. I would think anybody looking at this bill would have a real problem with that, at least I would hope they would. Come to Chinatown in San Francisco, for example, and stand on a corner for an hour and watch the elderly go by. Take 52 percent of all of them that you see and know that they are SSI, and know that tomorrow or September 1, they won't be. That is what this bill does. It has a very profound implication for California.  That is why Senator Boxer and I stand here today, and why Senator Graham has tried to move the amendment he did and now supports our amendment. I would submit to you that the big States, the growth States, are going to have the biggest impact.  I would submit to you that they will be: California, on a tier all by itself; certainly Florida; certainly Texas; certainly New York; certainly Illinois; and certainly to an extent New Jersey. These are the big States that will be affected by this bill.  I know the votes are here to defeat the amendment.  The ultimate test of a civilization is how we treat the least among us. It is one thing to change the rules ahead, so everybody knows what rules we as a country play by, and both Senator Boxer and I are willing to do that. It is another thing to say, when you have no other means of subsistence, ``we are going to change the rules on you today.''  I yield 10 minutes of my time to Senator Boxer.
