There can be disagreement on the substance, but the merits, the importance, and the criticality should be obvious to all of us. I would hope to find a way to have votes on these amendments.  The same logic applies to Senator Shaheen and Senator Moran. They have amendments that they have worked tirelessly on for days. They are being frustrated, not by the majority of the Senate but by a few individuals.  I think we have reached the point now where we have very little time left. If we could come together at least on a good-faith package of consents to deal with all of these or a majority of these and then continue to work forward for votes on all of them, I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.  So, again, I just want to underscore the fact that the issues that Senator Murray and Senator Gillibrand have raised are deserving of a vote, and we should have a vote on these issues.  With that, I yield the floor.                             Cloture Motion
