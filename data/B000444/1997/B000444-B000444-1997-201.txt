 I will speak to a couple of points. With regard to Ken Adelman, I am sure our colleague from Oklahoma didn't mean to impugn his motivation by suggesting for whom he worked. I would not suggest that of Mr. Rumsfeld because of where he works now, that it caused him to have that view. Ken Adelman--although I disagree with him most of the time, he was an able member of the administration. He was viewed as a hawk at the time he was here. For the record, I am sure there was no intention to do that?
