 President, I rise today to salute Susanne B. Wilson, who will be honored with the 1995-96 distinguished Tower Award by San Jose State University.  Since 1972 the Tower Award has been presented to alumni, faculty, and community leaders recognizing exceptional and continuous service to San Jose State and the university community. Continuing the tradition of the award, Susie Wilson is a longstanding leader in Santa Clara Valley as a public official--a member of the county board of supervisors and a member of the San Jose City Council--and in her work for numerous organizations.  Susie's active leadership role at San Jose State University spans nearly three decades--first as a student then as a faculty member, and now as a volunteer alumna. She earned her bachelor's degree in political science in 1976, and later served as a lecturer during the 1980's. In 1994, she was the first visiting professor in the SJSU leader-in-residence program, teaching a senior seminar in the ethical issues in politics.  Susie was one of the founders of and participants in the Walk for Women of Sparta, which was the largest fundraiser by women for women athletes, which raised over $1 million for women's athletic scholarships. She has also been active in the Spartan Foundation, a key fundraising organization of the San Jose State, and is currently serving on the executive committee and board of directors.  Susie Wilson built a reputation of leadership as a member of the San Jose City Council where she served for 6 years, then as a member of the County of Santa Clara Board of Supervisors. Susie solved problems, brought opposing parties together in compromise, and worked through consensus to prevent political stalemates. It is no surprise that when Susie retired from the board she started her own business called SOLUTIONS.  Susie has continued to be a community leader, lending her insight and expertise to organizations such as the United Way, the Boy Scouts of America, and Cambrian Park United Methodist Church, her church of over 30 years. A champion of social justice, one of her most important accomplishments was her success as chair of the YWCA Villa Nueva Capital Campaign. Villa Nueva is a 63-family residential housing unit for lower income families which houses transitional and affordable housing, mostly for single parents and their kids. To honor Susie, the building was named in her honor when it opened in 1993. In addition, she is a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus and a member of the American Association of University Women.  Susie Wilson is truly a model of effective leadership in a community. I join with her wonderful husband Bob, a retired IBM engineer, their sons, Bill, Rob, and David, as well as their families and six grandchildren in celebrating this well-deserved award.  I congratulate Susie Wilson as she is honored with the Tower Award for her years of giving to others and for her well known, more private, and very personal accomplishments. And I congratulate President Caret for his selection of Susie which honors San Jose State University and the previous recipients of the award.                          ____________________
