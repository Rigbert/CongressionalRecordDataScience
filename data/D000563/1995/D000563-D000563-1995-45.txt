Speaker, let me tell Members what this debate is all about. It is about this glass of drinking water and others like it across America. When you pour a glass of drinking water for your children, you can be confident that it is safe for them to drink it. The confidence, of course, is based on sensible government monitoring and regulation.  This appropriation bill has 17 different environmental protection laws repealed without 1 day of hearing, 17 different protections for American families so that there is not arsenic in this water, benzene, dioxin, lead, and known carcinogens.  Why in the world would some of the extreme Republicans, unlike the gentleman from New York [Mr. Boehlert], want to repeal this protection? Because the special interests demand it. They are in the corridors of this Congress right now watching this debate. They want to see this bill go through. They want these provisions that protect our families repealed, because they can make more money.  What is more important? If this Government cannot protect the water that we drink, then we have lost our soul.
