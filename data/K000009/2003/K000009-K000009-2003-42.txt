Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Latham).

We believe this to be a Federal responsibility.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).  The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Kaptur
