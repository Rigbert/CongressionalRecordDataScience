  The Senator from Iowa is correct; under his amendment there would be no taxpayer funding provided you complied with the Government speech limit. The problem is, if you do not, your complying opponent gets tax dollars from the Government to counter your excessive speech. That is the constitutional problem with the proposal of the Senator from Iowa.  I do not think that makes the spending limit voluntary if, when you encroach above the Government-prescribed speech limit, the Government subsidizes your opponent. That is more than a hammer, that is a sledgehammer.  Also, it is worthy to note that all of the challengers who won last year, as far as I can tell--and the Senator from Iowa can correct me if I am wrong--I believe all the challengers who won last year spent more than the spending limits in his amendment, further proving my point that a challenger needs the freedom to reach the audience. To the extent we are drawing the rules, crafting this in such a way that we make it very difficult for the challenger to compete, we are going to win even more of the time. Of course, incumbents do win most of the time, but we would win more of the time if we had a very low ceiling.  In any event, my view is this is clearly unconstitutional. It is taxpayer funding of elections, more unpopular than a congressional pay raise, widely voted against every April 15 by the taxpayers of this country.  We have had this vote in a slightly different way on two earlier occasions. The Wellstone amendment got 36 votes; the Kerry amendment got 30. I hope the amendment of the Senator from Iowa will be roundly defeated.  I do applaud him, however, for recognizing the importance of nonseverability clauses in campaign finance debates.                          ____________________
