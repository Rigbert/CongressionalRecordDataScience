 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, those of us who believe in protecting innocent and precious life may have lost a vote today, but we are steadily winning a larger argument--a critical argument that goes to the heart of who we want to be as a society. We can feel momentum for life on the rise just as we see extremism on the other side increasing. By placing their allegiance with the far left instead of women, Democrats are making a losing bet they will come to regret over the long term.  Today, however, we must grapple with the challenges of the present. Democrats' insistence on blocking the strategy pursued today means we have to consider the options now before us. The reality is that the government will shut down next week if Congress does not act.  The president of Right to Life said to those of us who believe in protecting life:       There are two different roads we can take. One is to insist      that no more money go to Planned Parenthood and cause a      government shutdown (which won't result in actually defunding      Planned Parenthood). The other is to take a slightly longer-     term approach, taking advantage of the fact that we have the      attention of the country as probably never before. . . .      Every well-informed pro-lifer wants to defund Planned      Parenthood. I want to defund Planned Parenthood. There are      wonderful pro-life men and women in Congress who want to      defund Planned Parenthood. And, certainly National Right to      Life wants to defund Planned Parenthood. The difference here      is in strategy.  This is not the end of this debate or this discussion.  I urge colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation I am about to file which would ensure that the government remains open.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
