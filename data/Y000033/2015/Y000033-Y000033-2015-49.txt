Mr. Chairman, I understand the concern of the gentleman from Louisiana on the current status of red snapper management in the Gulf of Mexico and your interest to support actions taken by the Gulf States that are supported by many of your constituents.  The amendment being offered today is a start in the process, but I respectfully suggest it needs further discussion. I support regional solutions but have concerns with proposals that will take the red snapper fishery outside of the Magnuson-Stevens Act management process.  I am willing to continue to work with the gentleman from Louisiana, Chairman Bishop, and other Members, as well as fishing groups involved, to try to find a resolution to the management issues impacting the red snapper fishery.
