 It overwhelmingly passed the House back in April 285 to 140. This legislation is important to millions of Americans who want to be able to exercise their second amendment rights. There is simply no reason we should not be able to complete action on this bill expeditiously--there are not many measures around here that have that many cosponsors--that is, unless people want to delay its consideration with unrelated amendments.  In an effort to address this matter fairly and efficiently, I have indicated to my good friend and colleague, the assistant Democratic leader, that I will propound the following consent request as a way to possibly expedite consideration of this measure which is supported by a substantial majority of our colleagues on a bipartisan basis.  Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to consideration of S. 1806; that there be 6 hours of general debate on the bill equally divided; that the only amendments in order be two relevant amendments offered by each side, with each first-degree amendment subject to a second-degree amendment which shall be relevant to the first degree amendment; provided further that each first-degree amendment be limited to 1 hour of debate evenly divided, and each second-degree amendment be limited to 30 minutes of debate equally divided; provided further that upon expiration of all time, the Senate immediately proceed to a vote on all pending amendments; after disposition of the pending amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate immediately proceed to a vote on final passage, without intervening action or debate.
