President, it is always good to have someone in the media with a sense of history. Walter Pincus demonstrates that time and again. His June 19 column in The Washington Post is a prime example and I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 2014]     Dick Cheney Wants To Forget History and Write His Own Version                           (By Walter Pincus)       Why should anyone take seriously what Dick Cheney says      about President Obama's policy in Iraq?       In their Wall Street Journal op-ed this week, Cheney and      his daughter Liz began by cherry-picking Obama quotes from      over three years about the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria      (ISIS).       That warmed-over technique is what Cheney, President George      W. Bush and other top aides cleverly used with intelligence      reports in the fall of 2002 as they drummed up public support      for their invasion of Iraq. That, of course, set the stage      for today's terrible events.       ``Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much      at the expense of so many,'' the Cheneys chortled. ``Too many      times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is ending' the wars      in Iraq and Afghanistan--as though wishing made it so.''       Let's return to a Dick Cheney speech on Aug. 27, 2002, in      Nashville, before the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and see      how many times a vice president could be ``so wrong about so      much at the expense of so many.''       He told his audience: ``In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime      and al-Qaeda terrorists have met the fate they chose for      themselves. And they saw . . . the new methods and      capabilities of America's armed services.''       Here's another applause line: ``In the case of Osama bin      Laden--as President Bush said recently--`If he's alive, we'll      get him. If he's not alive--we already got him.''       The Bush team never got him. Obama did.       When Cheney was speaking, bin Laden was very much alive.      Al-Qaeda terrorists and the Taliban had just retreated, but      they were able to regroup as the Bush team, satisfied with      its ``victory'' in Afghanistan, had turned its attention and      U.S. military forces toward Iraq.       It was in this speech that Cheney began what a former Bush      chief of staff, Andrew Card, would describe as the fall 2002      public-relations plan to ``educate the public'' about     the so-called threat from Iraq. That effort would lead to a      congressional joint resolution authorizing the president to      use U.S. armed forces to ``defend the national security of      the United States against the continuing threat posed by      Iraq'' and ``enforce all relevant United Nations Security      Council resolutions regarding Iraq.''       Cheney told the VFW: ``The Iraqi regime has in fact been      very busy enhancing its capabilities in the field of chemical      and biological agents. And they continue to pursue the      nuclear program they began so many years ago.''       He added: ``We've gotten this from the firsthand testimony      of defectors--including Saddam's own son-in-law, who was      subsequently murdered at Saddam's direction. Many of us are      convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly      soon.''       A former White House deputy press secretary, Scott      McClellan, would later write that a White House Iraq Group      (WHIG) was ``set up in the summer of 2002 to coordinate the      marketing of the [Iraq] war,'' and will continue ``as a      strategic communications group after the invasion had toppled      Saddam [Hussein]'s regime.''       It was Cheney at the VFW convention who first said:      ``Regime change in Iraq would bring about a number of      benefits to the region. When the gravest of threats are      eliminated, the freedom-loving peoples of the region will      have a chance to promote the values that can bring lasting      peace.''       He also said: ``Extremists in the region would have to      rethink their strategy of Jihad. Moderates throughout the      region would take heart. And our ability to advance the      Israeli-Palestinian peace process would be enhanced, just as      it was following the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.''       Show me a better example of ``as though wishing made it      so.''       The Cheneys also cavalierly forget that the status of      forces agreement with Iraq that Bush signed Dec. 14, 2008,      made way for the withdrawal of all U.S. combat troops by the      end of 2011. That agreement protected U.S. forces on duty      from prosecution by Iraqi courts. It was the Iraqis' desire      to modify this that led Obama--on the advice of his military      chiefs--to not leave a residual force of military trainers.       One more sign of the Cheneys' convenient amnesia: They said      of Obama's initiative toward involving Tehran in the effort      to put down ISIS advances in Iraq, ``Only a fool would      believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the      world's largest sponsor of terror.''       In November 2001, the Bush White House, despite icy      relations, approved talking directly to Iran diplomats before      and during the Bonn conference called to try to establish a      post-Taliban government in Afghanistan. As a result, U.S.      Ambassador James Dobbin got what he described as Tehran's      ``major contribution to forge a solution'' among various      Afghan groups, which in turn led to a unified temporary Kabul      government under Hamid Karzai.       On Dec. 5, 2001, a White House spokesman described Bush as      ``very pleased'' with the Afghan agreement. However, in his      Jan. 29, 2002, State of the Union speech, Bush described      Iran, Iraq and North Korea as the ``axis of evil'' at the      same time there were meetings underway between U.S. and      Iranian diplomats to see whether talks could go beyond      Afghanistan.       In contrast to the Cheneys, people should listen to former      secretary of state James Baker III, who in Thursday's Wall      Street Journal called on the United States to organize an      international coalition of regional countries, including      Iran. Recalling Iran's cooperation on Afghanistan, Baker said      today's ``reality is that Iran is already the most      influential external player in Iraq and so any effort without      Iranian participation will likely fail.''       Baker has a successful track record and a memory. The      Cheneys have neither.                          ____________________
