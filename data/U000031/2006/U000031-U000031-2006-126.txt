Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the members of the International Fire Marshals Association (IFMA), who will be celebrating their 100th anniversary on June 6. I particularly would like to commend Ron Farr, Past President of IFMA and current Fire Chief and Fire Marshall for the Kalamazoo Township Fire Department. I applaud Ron and his courageous colleagues for their tireless efforts to keep our community safe.  Since it was formed in 1906, the men and women of the International Fire Marshals Association have dedicated themselves to saving the lives, homes, and properties of folks throughout our great Nation. Today, the Association has over 1,800 members representing over 20 nations and we are truly grateful for their service here in southwest Michigan.  There is nothing more important to us than the safety of our loved ones, and this organization has stood watch, protecting the public for the last 100 years. I would like to thank the International Fire Marshals Association and its membership for the continued quality service they provide our community and congratulate them once again on this milestone. We are truly fortunate to have folks like Ron Farr and his colleagues in southwest Michigan, dedicating their lives in the name of public safety.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1000]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]         CONGRATULATING INTERNATIONAL FIRE MARSHALS ASSOCIATION                                 ______                                                             HON.
