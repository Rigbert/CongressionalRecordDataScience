President, I would like to submit a statement delivered by our colleague Senator Dodd on January 8th at the commencement of the impeachment trial of President Clinton.  This statement, like the others delivered that day, is remarkable in several respects.  First, it captures the rich history that has transpired over the years in the Old Senate Chamber--a history marked often by greatness, but occasionally by shame.  Second, it wonderfully expresses Senator Dodd's own personal sense of the history of the Senate. His reflections on past Senators--from Roger Sherman, the Founding Father whose seat Senator Dodd occupies, to his own father, former Senator Thomas Dodd--remind us that the Senate is an institution made up of individuals, and that the totality of their actions shapes the destiny not just of the Senate itself but indeed of the entire country.  Third, and most importantly, Senator Dodd's statement stands as a powerful plea for cooperation and bipartisanship in the discharge of the Senate's profound responsibility in this trial. Senator Dodd's statement played a critical role in setting the stage for the historic bipartisan agreement reached at the outset of the trial, and for the spirit of civility that prevailed throughout this ordeal. I commend Senator Dodd's statement to all citizens who in the future may wish to learn something of how the Senate was inspired to conduct the impeachment trial of President Clinton in a noble and dignified manner.  I am beginning my 25th year in the Senate. After Senator Dodd spoke I told him his speech was one of the finest I had heard in those years.  No Senator ever spoke more directly--or more persuasively--to other Senators about the duty we all have to the Constitution and the Senate. I am proud to serve with him.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Senator Dodd's statement be printed in the Record.Remarks by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Old Senate Chamber, January 8,                                   1999
