Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), my good friend and ranking member on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, to prohibit the use of funds in fiscal year 2002, to implement the administration's proposal that military retirees be required to make an irrevocable choice between military or VA health care for a defined period of years.  While we certainly want to encourage more efficient use of scarce Federal health resources, at this juncture, we simply do not have enough information about the potential impact of that specific proposal. I do not think either the VA or the Department of Defense is really prepared to deal with the implications of requiring this choice, and both health care systems are already experiencing considerable strain serving their beneficiaries. We need to understand the implications of this proposal much, much better.  Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman for his amendment, and I urge my colleagues to adopt it.
