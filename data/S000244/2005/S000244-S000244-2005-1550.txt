Speaker, today I am introducing the Digital Transition Content Security Act of 2005. This legislation is designed to close the ``analog hole'' that has arisen as a result of the transition to digital transmission technologies. The term ``analog hole'' refers to the use of devices to convert analog content into digital versions which can easily be uploaded onto the Internet. Although many of those who convert analog content into digital form are not engaging in any illegal conduct, there are unfortunately criminals who take advantage of existing deficiencies in current law and technology to obtain copyrighted content in order to redistribute this content for profit at the copyright owner's expense.  There is no doubt that piracy of intellectual property can be a profitable criminal activity. Just this week, a software pirate pled guilty in Alexandria, VA, to making $20 million in sales of counterfeit intellectual property. The House Judiciary Committee has extensively examined efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property laws to address intellectual property theft made possible by new technologies. This legislation is no different.  The ``analog hole'' is unfortunately a potential source of pirated content that becomes an attractive target for pirates as high quality sources of content are made available to the public in high definition format. Congress is already considering another technology, the ``broadcast flag,'' to address the redistribution of high definition content. The analog hole is its counterpart.  Congress has previously mandated the use of technology to limit and frustrate redistribution of video content. Enacted at 17 U.S.C. 1201(k) as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Congress required the use and detection of Macrovision technology in several analog devices. This new legislation builds upon this existing law by mandating the detection and response to two separate technologies that work together to defeat pirates. The two technologies are the Content Generation Management System--Analog, CGMS-A, and Video Encoded Invisible Light, VEIL.  The timing for this legislation is readily apparent. New technologies have made the widespread redistribution of copyrighted content significantly easier. Some have referred to the Internet as the world's greatest copyingmachine. While the Internet has without question been a huge benefit to society on a number of levels, some have used the Internet for criminal gain, notably the redistribution of copyrighted content without the copyright owner's permission. Enactment of the Digital Transition Content Security Act of 2005 will help ensure that the rights of copyright owners are respected.  The legislation would require that devices that convert analog content pass through the CGMS-A and VEIL content protection signals contained in the original version. To ensure that the technology used does not become outdated, the Patent and Trademark Office is authorized to conduct ongoing rulemakings to update the technology.  The Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property held a hearing on a discussion draft of this legislation last month. Witnesses from the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, the Consumer Electronics Association, and Public Knowledge testified. Their testimony covered piracy issues generally as well as more specific issues regarding the legislation.  The bill I am introducing today makes several changes to the original discussion draft. Various provisions of the bill have been rewritten to ensure that the intent of the bill is clear. The references to several tables in the original draft have been clarified so that the Patent and Trademark Office develops these tables after an open, public rulemaking. The original draft had assumed that these tables would have been developed by the industry groups in time for the introduction of this legislation. This has not yet happened.  Finally, I urge all interested parties to continue to negotiate to see if a private sector solution can be fully developed to address the ``analog hole.'' This issue is simply too important for parties to avoid negotiations. I look forward to working on this and other legislation to protect intellectual property in the second session of the 109th Congress.                          ____________________
