 According to industry sources, telecommunications equipment manufacturers will need approximately two years after the FCC sets a final standard to develop technology to meet the new standard.  CALEA authorized the Attorney General to reimburse the industry up to $500 million for the costs directly associated with modifying equipment that was installed or deployed before January 1, 1995 (the statutory ``grandfather date''). Since January 1, 1995, a significant portion of all wireline switches, a majority of cellular switches, and virtually all personal communications services devices have been installed.  Mr. President, I am concerned that if the FCC sets a new CALEA technical capability standard and there is no change to the January 1, 1995 statutory grandfather date, industry may be required to retrofit that equipment at their own expense at a cost that could exceed hundreds of millions of dollars.  I do not think that the American people want to pay what could be considered an electronic surveillance tax running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. I know that the people in my state of Kentucky do not. I recognize that this is a complicated controversial issue, but I believe that Congress must act this year to adjust both the statutory compliance and grandfather dates contained in CALEA to allow the statute to work and avoid the prospect of an electronic surveillance tax on consumers.  I would like to work with the Chairman and the distinguished Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. Hollings of South Carolina, to see if together, we can find a way to address this problem this year.
