Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Congress' newest caucuses--The Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus.  This Congressional Member Organization (CMO) was co-founded and is co-chaired by my good friend Representataive Bart Stupak of Michigan and me. The Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus is dedicated to improving the healthcare and overall quality of life for the 70,000 Americans and their families living with spina bifida.  This year has been a successful year for the patients and families who live with spina bifida, especially the members of the non-profit Spina Bifida Association of America who have done indefatigable work promoting an agenda of hope and research. In addition to securing $2 million to establish the National Spina Bifida Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this year, a major gathering of leading spina bifida researchers was held here in Washington this past May. The successful conference played a major role in helping to chart the future path of spina bifida research.  Yesterday, we marked another milestone--the official launch and first briefing of the Congressional Spina Bifida Caucus. In very short time, more than 20 Representatives supportive of our mission have joined the caucus. As more Members learn of the mission and legislative focus of the caucus, we are confident they too will join. I look forward to hosting additional informative briefings to better educate both Members and staff about spina bifida.  All of these successes would have been impossible if not for the work of the Spina Bifida Association of America and the Spina Bifida Foundation. Under the Leadership of Foundation President Hal Pote, Association President Alex Brodrick, and CEO Cindy Brownstein, the SBAA has made tremendous strides these past few years in helping all Americans--and their families--who live with spina bifida.  I wish the SBAA the best for continued success and I look forward to continuing to lead efforts in Congress on behalf of spina bifida patients and families.                          ____________________
