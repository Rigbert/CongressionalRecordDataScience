President.  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Gregg amendment and the rejection of the Hutchinson amendment. First, it is quite clear that this legislation is going to, in fact, study all of the questions related to the subject this bill deals with thoroughly. Let me just read into the Record exactly what it says with respect to what will be studied. It says:       The Commission shall conduct a thorough study of Federal,      State and local, and international taxation and tariff      treatment of transactions using the Internet and Internet      access and other comparable interstate or international sales      activities.  So it is right there at pages 21 and 22.
