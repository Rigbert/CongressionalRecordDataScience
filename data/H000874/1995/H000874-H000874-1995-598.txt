Speaker, I am honored to join my colleagues today to commemorate Black History Month. Particularly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Stokes and Mr. Payne for requesting this special order.  Black history is more than just a designation on a calendar; it is a time when all Americans can reflect upon the towering achievements African-Americans have made and continue to make in this country. It is a time when we honor men and women who have influenced and shaped American culture and life.  We thank those who through their writings and teachings have enabled all of America to know and appreciate the African-American legacy, past struggles, and present dreams. We pay tribute to America's sports heroes. We honor scientists and educators who labored so hard to overcome racial barriers in our society and proved that America could not afford squander the talent and knowledge of African-Americans.  I want to honor and share with you the story of an African-American whose history is deeply rooted in the part of the congressional district I represent. The achievements of Henry Jenifer, a person who dedicated his life to preserving the lives of others, deserves a place in our history books.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to submit Henry Jenifer's story for the Record.           [From ``I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey'']                         (By Leonidas H. Berry)       Buried in the small family cemetery at Deep Falls in      Chaptico is a celebrated Revolutionary War soldier and a      former Maryland governor. Far from the stately house with      ornately carved doorways handsome chimneys and rolling falls,      a small clump of trees stands out in the middle of a farmer's      soybean field. There, obscured and buried in the overgrowth,      is the site of former slave cabins that once housed the      working force of the Southern Maryland tobacco plantation.      The hills and fields are silent now, but there is a story      passed down from oral tradition of African-American History,      the legend of a natural healer and his passage to freedom.       Henry Jenifer was a slave of Dr. William Thomas, owner of      Deep Falls. Henry's family served the Thomas' for      generations. Thomas' brother, James, was Maryland's 26th      governor. From the time he was a boy, Henry cared for the      doctor's horse and buggy, accompanying him on his rounds of      serving the Chaptico community.       As he grew older, Henry learned medicine, not only from      watching the white physician as he performed his practiced      skills, but from the ancient healing ways of his African      ancestors. Using simple methods such as looking at the tongue      or a patient's eyes, he could diagnose the illness, amble to      the deep woods and emerge with root, tree bark or plant to      effectively cure what ailed them. The black folk began      calling him ``Doc'' Henry, and at times when Dr. Thomas was      away or had failed to produce a cure the whites called upon      Doc as well. Like the Native American preceding them on the      landscape, the African American combined spiritual as well as      physical remedies to heal his patients, often with great      success.       At times Dr. Thomas would send Henry to tend his patients.      A white farmer with a large open wound on his foot was      treated by the white physician with a solution of carbolic      acid and water, and it was Henry's job to bathe the wound in      the solution on a daily basis. After the gash failed to heal,      Doc Henry offered to help, but only if his patient agreed not      to tell. The slave soaked some wheat bread in water and left      it in the open air until it was covered with a heavy growth      of mold. This he applied to the wound, which healed in a      short time. Dr. Thomas never knew that his patient was cured      by a crude form of penicillin--a hundred years ahead of its      time.       As 1848 dawned in St. Mary's County, a severe outbreak of      yellow fever ravaged the countyside. When the epidemic      reached its height, Henry was taught the art of      ``bloodletting'' by his master, through which patients were      bled to leech out the poison in their system. As the fever      raged through the long, hot      summer, fear soon mingled with ignorance. Residents      attempted to flee to other areas, but were stopped at the      county's borders by gunpoint and forced to return. Henry's      services became invaluable as he tended to the sick,      sometimes while family members lay dead nearby.       As summer waned into fall, the yellow fever epidemic      finally began to subside. It lasted 10 weeks and took      hundreds of lives. The dead were buried in graveyards and      cornfields. Prayers of thanksgiving were offered. Black and      white, slave and free man, mourned together. Their joy and      their sorrow knew no color, no race.        [[Page H2053]] Throughout Henry's servitude, Dr. Thomas      allowed him to earn money for his work, and promised his      trusted servant that when he had enough money Henry could buy      his freedom with it. His master kept the money for him at the      plantation. When the epidemic was past, Henry approached Dr.      Thomas about buying his freedom. By then, Henry's services      had become too valuable to the physician, who informed him      that the money had been stolen. Depressed and feeling      betrayed, Henry conceived a plan. Unbeknownst to Dr. Thomas,      Henry had saved some money on his own. He got word to ``dat      Harriet woman'' that he wished to leave St. Mary's County on      the Underground Railroad. Harriet Tubman's ``underground      train'' was situated on Maryland's Eastern Shore, but had a      network that stretched throughout Southern Maryland.       One day Dr. Thomas waited with frustration for Henry to      arrive and hitch up his horse to buggy in order that he might      make his daily rounds. Henry, however, had fled across back      roads and fields to Leonardtown, eventually making his way to      the Patuxent River, then on to Cove Point in the Chesapeake      Bay. Dozens of participants, black and white, from every      profession, helped make up the ties of the underground      railroad, which led from Dorchester County to Canada. Before      he left Maryland, Henry was to meet his benefactor, Harriett      Tubman, in Cambridge.       After long weeks passed, the former slave reached his      destination a safe and free man. He mourned having left      behind his family, still in bondage at Deep Falls. Another 15      years would pass before they were awarded freedom during the      War Between the States, the same war in which their masters      would fight for Confederate Army.
