Mr. Speaker, today I want to acknowledge and welcome the March 14th statement of the President of Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze, pledging his commitment to religious freedom for all Georgians and promising the punishment of individuals complicit in mob attacks on religious minorities. (I am submitting the statement for the Record below.) President Shevardnadze made this pledge during an ecumenical service in Tbilisi's Evangelist-Baptist Cathedral Church, attended by leaders of the Georgian Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Baptist churches and many individuals from the diplomatic community. The U.S. Ambassador to Georgia, Richard Miles, also attended and addressed the gathering. Reportedly, so many people came that hundreds had to listen via loudspeakers in the churchyard.  The service was initially planned for late January, but defrocked priest Basil Mkalavishvili and his crowd of thugs assaulted worshipers and clergy an hour before it was scheduled to begin--as they have been doing with impunity since 1999. Individuals were beaten as they tried to leave, with rocks and stones being reportedly thrown. While President Shevardnadze quickly condemned that attack, ordering the Interior Minister, the Prosecutor General, State Chancellery Head, and the Security Council Secretary to investigate and punish the perpetrators, no arrests or prosecutions followed.  Despite Georgia's appalling record on religious tolerance for the last few years, I hope President Shevardnadze's speech at the Baptist church signals a new determination to arrest and aggressively prosecute the mob leaders and their henchmen. He promised that ``as the President of Georgia and a believer, I shall not restrict myself only to a mere expression of resentment. I do promise that the President and the Authorities of Georgia will do their utmost to grant every person freedom of expression of faith.'' Driving home the point further, Mr. Shevardnadze declared, ``the state will exert its pressure on whoever comes in defiance of this principle. You may stand assured that the aggressors will be brought to justice.''  As Co-Chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, over the past three years I have watched with increasing alarm the escalation of mob violence. On September 24th I chaired a Commission hearing focused on this disturbing pattern. The Jehovah's Witnesses have borne the brunt of attacks, along with Baptists, Pentecostals, Adventists and Catholics. Most disheartening has been the government's indifference; victims throughout the country have filed approximately 800 criminal complaints, without one criminal conviction.  Despite a series of statements by President Shevardnadze, Georgia's Minister of Interiorand Prosecutor General appear unwilling to effectively enforce the rule of law, refusing to arrest mob leaders like Mkalavishvili and Paata Bluashvili and not attempting serious prosecutions. For example, the trial of Mkalavishvili has dragged on for more than a year, without a single piece of evidence considered yet. I would hope the provision of adequate and visible security, which took months to organize, will continue and that the prosecutor will begin his case shortly. Also, the inauguration of trial proceedings against Bluashvili in Rustavi is positive; I trust the delays and shenanigans seen in Mkalavishvili's trial will not be repeated there. I also urge the Government of Georgia to arrest and detain Mkalavishvili, Bluashvili and other indicted persons who continue to perpetrate violent criminal acts against religious minorities.  Undoubtedly, President Shevardnadze's presence at the March 14th service and his statement illustrate his personal commitment to religious tolerance and basic law and order. Yet, while I appreciate his gesture, it is time for real action. If the attacks are allowed to continue, it will only become more difficult to rein in this mob violence. If presidential orders are repeatedly ignored, it will only further weaken the government's ability to enforce the rule of law. And, of course, we must not forget the plight of minority religious communities that continue to live in a state of siege, without any real protection from their government. Ironically, it appears that minorities religious communities are freer to profess and practice their faith in regions of Georgia not under the control of President Shevardnadze's government.  In closing, I urge President Shevardnadze to fulfill his most recent commitment to punish the aggressors, thereby restoring Georgia's international reputation and upholding its international commitments as a participating State in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  I and other Members of Congress are acutely interested in seeing whether the Government of Georgia will actually arrest the perpetrators of violence and vigorously prosecute them.Representatives of all Religions and Nations have to Raise Prayers for                              Peace Together       My dear friends, Christians, dear Ambassadors: I am here to      give utterance to my contentment and admiration, which      derives from seeing you, all Christians, or, to be more      precise, representatives of all Christian folds, assembled      here, under the same roof of this temple, in the capital      of Georgia famed as the Virgin's lot.       I am happy to be a witness to this occurrence. I am happy      because you are together, because we are together. But all of      us have our own faith.       I am an Orthodox believer, but we are all Christians. It is      what we should always bear in mind and keep intact this      wholeness and unity.       Georgia is one of those countries on the planet whose roots      go back the farthest in history. Tolerance has become      particularly entrenched in its history and nature since the      days we embraced Christianity.       Christ granted that we be together. And more than this:      Georgia is a multinational country, where Muslims and      followers of other confessions have dwelt along with      Christians in the course of centuries.       We live presently in a world of stark contradictions. It      remains anybody's guess when a bomb may blast. You probably      understand what I mean. Therefore, we should pray for peace,      and these prayers should be raised by all of us: Christians,      Muslims, representatives of every religion, confession and      nation.       But prayers alone will not keep us together. We have also      to struggle, in order that, through our benevolence, faith,      love and respect to one another, we may put up resistence to      the eradicating processes of which I already made a mention.       As was customary with my great ancestors, I go to an      Orthodox church. But nor do I keep distance from synagogues,      mosques or churches of different Christian confessions.       I feel respect for all who have confident belief in      kindness and its victory.       I am happy to see, along with Georgian citizens, the      attendance of the distinguished ambassadors and diplomats      accredited in Georgia, who have come this evening to share      our happiness.       I cannot but express a deep sense of regret, even      resentment at the gross infringement of our unity, mutual      respect and freedom of faith by some of the aggressors.       As the President of Georgia and a believer, I shall not      restrict myself only to a mere expression of resentment. I do      promise that the President and the Authorities of Georgia      will do their utmost to grant every person freedom of      expression of faith.       The state will exert its pressure on whoever comes in      defiance of this principle. You may stand assured that the      aggressors will be brought to justice.       I would like to greet you once more and wish you happiness      and advancement of goals. So as with Georgia, a multinational      country of various religious confessions, my wishes are for      joy, happiness and prosperity.                          ____________________
