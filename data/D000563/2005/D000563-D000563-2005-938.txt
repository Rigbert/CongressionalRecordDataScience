President, this is a sad day in the Senate. It is a sad day in two respects. Yesterday, we were debating a bill, the Department of Defense Authorization Act. It is an important bill. It is a $440 billion bill for our American military: our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, members of the Coast Guard, Guard and Reserve. We were trying, in that bill, to help our fighting men and women and their families.  We had a long list of amendments that we wanted to consider: extra pay for totally disabled veterans, help for the widows and orphans of combat soldiers who die in the line of duty, fair compensation for Guard and Reserve when they are activated and they are Federal employees, daycare for the families of soldiers who are activated, quality-of-life issues for the men and women in uniform who are fighting for America.  A decision was made by the Republican leadership to leave that bill, leave that issue, to come to this one. What could be more important for us to consider than the safety, the lives, and fortunes of the men and women who serve our country and risk their lives, on military duty, and their families?  Well, in the estimation of the Republican leader, Senator Frist, there was one issue that was more important than talking about our men and women in uniform. That issue was providing immunity from liability for one industry in America, to say that of all the businesses in America that provide us with goods and services, all of the businesses that are currently held responsible for wrongdoing, we will create one exception. We will say, if the gun industry is guilty of wrongdoing, they cannot be sued. That is right.
