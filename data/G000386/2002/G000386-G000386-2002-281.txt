 Excluding participations and residuals from a property's initial depreciable cost basis under the income forecast method results in a mismatching of income from the property and the expenses incurred in producing the property. The Ninth Circuit reached this conclusion in Transamerica.

We should remove this uncertainty to avoid needless disputes and to ensure the accurate reflection of taxpayers' income.
