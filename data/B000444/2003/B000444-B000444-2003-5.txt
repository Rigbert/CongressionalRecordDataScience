 Con. Res. 83       Whereas a survey conducted by Freedom House in 2003,      entitled ``Freedom in the World'', found that of the 192      governments of nations of the world, 121 (or 63 percent) of      such governments have an electoral democracy form of      government;       Whereas, the Community of Democracies, an association of      democratic nations committed to promoting democratic      principles and practices, held its First Ministerial      Conference in Warsaw, Poland, in June 2000;       Whereas, in a speech at that Conference, Kofi Annan, the      Secretary-General of the United Nations, stated that ``when      the United Nations can truly call itself a community of      democracies, the [United Nations] Charter's noble ideals of      protecting human rights and promoting `social progress in      larger freedoms' will have been brought much closer'', that      ``democratically governed states rarely if ever make war on      one another'', and that ``in this era of intra-state wars, is      the fact that democratic governance--by protecting      minorities, encouraging pluralism, and upholding the rule of      law--can channel internal dissent peacefully, and thus help      avert civil wars'';       Whereas a report by an Independent Task Force cosponsored      by the Council on Foreign Relations and Freedom House in      2002, entitled ``Enhancing U.S. Leadership at the United      Nations'', concluded that ``the United States is frequently      outmaneuvered and outmatched at the [United Nations]''      because the 115 members of the nonaligned movement      ``cooperate on substantive and procedural votes, binding the      organization's many democratic nations to the objectives and      blocking tactics of its remaining tyrannies'';       Whereas, at the First Ministerial Conference of the      Community of Democracies, the representatives of the      participating governments agreed to ``collaborate on      democracy-related issues in existing international and      regional institutions, forming coalitions and caucuses to      support resolutions and other international activities aimed      at the promotion of democratic governance''; and       Whereas that agreement was reaffirmed at the Second      Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies in      Seoul, Korea, in November 2002: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring),     SECTION 1. PROMOTION OF A DEMOCRACY CAUCUS WITHIN THE UNITED                    NATIONS.       Congress urges the President to instruct any representative      of the United States to a body of the United Nations to use      the voice and vote of the United States to seek to establish      a democracy caucus within the United Nations as described in      this Resolution.
