Speaker, at this point, I would yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. McCotter).  Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, it is a great day for Michigan. Having grown up there, I first heard the name Dingell used in conjunction with the auto industry because the people in my neighborhood, whether they were blue collar, white collar or car dealers, knew that there was one person in this Congress who would always look out for them and that, as long as he was in this body, they would have a voice and a hope.  Today, we celebrate the fact that that voice has been in this Chamber longer than any other Member of the United States House. As someone from Michigan, I am eternally grateful, not only for his service to this institution but for his service to neighborhoods like mine throughout our entire State and our country.  As I have told you earlier, it is often said on the radio that mere greatness is fleeting but that goodness and greatness are timeless.  Chairman Dingell, with your service to this institution, to your beloved State of Michigan and to the country which you defended as a veteran, they will always consider your service timeless as will be their gratitude for it.
