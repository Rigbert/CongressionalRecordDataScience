Mr. Speaker, I would just like to put a plug in for charter schools period. The Amy Biehl school is an example of what can be done under charter schools and how it does serve a purpose.  We have been very successful in the State of Alaska with our charter schools, and I think it is crucially important to understand that sometimes other schools can fulfill that gap.  Apparently, this one does a good job, according to the young lady that sponsored the bill and the gentleman that is managing this bill. But let's just remember that when education is failing, then we have to look for other alternatives, and this is a classic alternative.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
