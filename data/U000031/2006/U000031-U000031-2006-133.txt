Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the members of the 415th Civil Affairs Battalion from Kalamazoo, MI who have bravely served our Nation overseas in Iraq. This Sunday, March 5th, the entire Battalion will be honored for its distinguished service in Iraq, receiving the prestigious Meritorious Unit Commendation that is bestowed upon battalions that are particularly meritorious and exceptional in their services against an armed enemy during Operation Iraqi Freedom.   In addition to the Battalion's group recognition, 100 members of the unit will also be personally awarded the Combat Action Badge, which provides special recognition to Soldiers who personally engage the enemy, or are engaged by the enemy during combat operations.  I am so proud of the 415th Battalion because they represent all of the many and diverse jobs that our troops have set out to accomplish in Iraq. For example, this Battalion has administered over 1000 reconstruction projects, implemented and managed 43 separate school reconstruction projects, provided medical screening to Iraqi citizens, even helped forge a relationship between Harvard University's medical school and Iraq's Tikrit University of Medicine.  The work of these men and women represents the positive progress that is actually going on in Iraq. The stories and accomplishments of the 415th Battalion are the ones that should truly be grabbing the headlines back home. Once again, I would like to congratulate the 415th Battalion for their much-deserved recognition and thank them on behalf of all the folks in Southwest Michigan for their great service. We are safer as a nation for your service--you make us all proud.                           ____________________
