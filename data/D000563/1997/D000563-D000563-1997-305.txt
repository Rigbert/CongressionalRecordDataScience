President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey and join him today in introducing the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of 1997.  Mr. President, Interstate 55 runs straight through Mississippi to Memphis and St. Louis before veering northeast into Springfield and Chicago. And, in addition to carrying cars with their passengers and trucks with their cargo, I-55 is a firearm freeway into my home State. Gunrunners ship trunkloads of guns up I-55 for use by criminals.  Two years ago, one of those guns--that probably came into Illinois via I-55--was used to shoot Chicago Police Officer Daniel Doffyn in the head. Officer Doffyn was fresh out of the police academy. He was out on a burglary call, and a Tec-9 from Mississippi killed him.  The legislation Senator Torricelli and I introduce today lets everyone know that we are committed to closing down the illegal gunrunning operations that put that Tec-9 into the hands of the man who killed Daniel Doffyn.  And let no one underestimate the deadly impact of gunrunning across State lines. My home State of Illinois has tough gun laws. The local firearms dealers, police, and licensing authorities work hard to make sure that felons cannot go into a store and buy guns. They also work hard to keep the illegal gun market under control.  But we have learned that one State alone cannot overpower the illegal gun market. Earlier this year we obtained data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms detailing the results of their efforts to trace guns used in crimes. We analyzed that data and produced a report. That report concluded that:  First, guns used in crimes are most likely to come from just a few States with relatively weak gun control laws. Of the traceable guns used nationwide in crimes, 16,635 of the 47,068, or 35 percent, were out-of-State guns.  Second, in States with strong gun laws, criminals obtain many of their guns from other States with weaker gun laws.  Third, in States with lax gun laws, criminals obtain the majority of their guns from their home State.  Fourth, the trafficking of guns moves primarily in one direction; from States with weak gun laws to States with tough gun laws.  Fifth, when neighboring States have different levels of gun control laws, the State with lax laws floods its stricter neighbor with guns.  In Illinois we can see how these conclusions play out. Illinois is a net traced-guns importer. In 1996, Illinois accounted for a total of 399 crime guns traced in all the other States combined. However, 1,596 guns from out of State were traced to crimes in Illinois. Thirty-five percent of the guns traced from crimes in Illinois were from out of State. And 10 percent of the guns traced from crimes in Illinois were from Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. Mississippi is the top supplier of out-of-State guns to Illinois, 306, and Wisconsin, 75. In contrast, Illinois exported only two guns traced to crime in Mississippi.  In Mississppi, 268 guns involved in a crime were traced right back to Mississippi. In contrast, 306 Mississippi guns were traced to crimes in Illinois. Overall, Illinois pays a heavier price for Mississippi's lax gun control laws than Mississippi does.  In contrast to the weak gun law States, Illinois has tough gun laws. That's why per capita, Illinois barely plays a role in the gunrunning business. States with laxer gun control laws are acting as exporters to Illinois. Illinois accounted for 2 percent of the gun exports traced in crimes in other States. In contrast, Texas and Florida accounted for almost 14 percent of those gun exports.  Mr. President, I believe that it is time to shut down the firearms freeway to Illinois. That is why I am happy to sponsor this bill. This measure will let everyone know that we are quite serious about this, that the gunrunning black market is not just a harmless little business venture. People who run trunkloads of guns into another State are doing so for the sole purpose of making money off selling guns to people they know intend to use the gun in crime. This bill provides for a 3-year mandatory minimum for gunrunners. And the penalties will go up with the number of guns. If you run 50 guns, the penalty is 15 years. This legislation also makes gunrunning a RICO or racketeering predicate. With this tool in place, we can shut down entire gunrunning syndicates.  I believe that we should all easily support this measure. It is aimed at taking guns out of the hands of criminals.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 658       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

These profiteers legally buy weapons      in a state with mild gun laws, and then sell them illegally      in another state with tough rules.       When these smugglers load up their car trunks with piles of      lethal merchandise, they transfer countless weapons from      legitimate commerce to the black market--and the guns often      end up in criminals' hands.       A handful of states like Mississippi and Florida are      typical shopping stops for the nation's gunrunners, who then      sell the weapons in states like New York, New Jersey, and      Illinois--the losers in this deadly game of firearms      smuggling.       The five worst offenders per capita are Mississippi, South      Carolina, West Virginia, Nevada, and Kansas.       Several interstate highways are ``firearms freeways''--     favorite smuggling routes for gunrunners. Illegally      transported guns head north up I-95 from Florida, Georgia and      South Carolina to New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, or      north from Mississippi along I-55 to Illinois.       This independent analysis of data on 1996 firearms traces      makes several trends crystal clear:       1. Gunrunners' bazaars: Guns used in crimes are most likely      to come from just a few states with relatively weak gun      control laws. Just the top four states--Florida, Texas, South      Carolina, and Georgia--account for a quarter of the traces.      This trend is even more stark when analyzed based on      population: several small states provide far more than their      share of guns to criminals, and these states have      particularly weak laws.       2. Home sweet home: In states with strong gun laws,      criminals obtain the majority of their guns from other      states; in states with weaker gun laws, criminals obtain the      majority of their guns locally.       3. One-way streets: Illicit traffic along the ``firearms      freeways'' moves only in one direction: from states with less      gun control to those with more.       4. Love thy neighbor: When neighboring states have      different approaches to firearms regulation, the state with      lax laws floods its stricter neighbor with guns that are used      in crime.       These clear patterns show the urgent need for a nationwide      effort to stop gun smuggling between states. In particular,      Congressman Schumer is proposing tough new federal penalties      for gunrunning crimes and increased resources for      investigations of firearms trafficking.               findings: gunrunning is a national problem       The tables that follow this page tell the story of a      thriving illegal trade that crisscrosses the nation. The      customers for this business are street gangs and murderers,      drug dealers and muggers. The salespeople are interstate      gunrunners who exploit the discrepancies in different states'      gun laws to supply weapons on the black market. And the      suppliers are states where gun laws get a failing grade.                   Table 1: Guns crossing State lines       Table 1 shows how many guns sold in a particular state were      traced to crimes in other states by the federal Bureau of      Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in 1996.       The table demonstrates how lopsided these figures are. The      two states that provide the most guns to criminals in other      states--Florida (1,243) and Texas (1,068)--account for almost      14% of all such traces, and the top four states account for a      quarter. A majority of the out-of-state guns (54.2%) come      from just the top ten states--more than the other 40 states      and Washington, DC combined.       Note that the numbers in Table 1 account for all guns      recovered by law enforcement and traced, not all guns used in      crimes. In reality, these states are selling far more guns to      criminals than indicated on the table.             Table 2: Guns crossing State lines per capita       Table 2 adjusts for population, more clearly demonstrating      the link between weak gun laws and the sale of guns used in      other states' crimes.       The ``export rate'' shows how many guns were traced from      crimes elsewhere per 100,000 state residents. In other words,      for every 100,000 Mississippi residents, 29 guns were sold in      Mississippi and traced to crimes in another state. For every      100,000 New Yorkers, 1.19 guns were sent to out-of-state      criminals.       Each state was rated on how strongly its rules crack down      on gunrunners' easy access to weapons. The ratings of state      gun laws are explained more fully in an appendix. Overall, 27      of the states are rated ``very weak'' because they have no      significant restrictions beyond those required under federal      regulation, such as the Brady Law. Four of the states were      rated ``weak,'' four ``moderate,'' six ``strong,'' and ten      ``very strong.''       By controlling for population, Table 2 underscores the      dramatic impact of state gun laws on gun trafficking      patterns. None of the top ten states on Table 2 had      ``strong'' or ``very strong'' ratings. Six of the ten are      ``very weak.''

The medium-sized and large      states that dominate the top of Table 1 are responsible for a      vast proportion of the guns traced to crimes across the      country.       The top two states, Florida and Texas, supplied 14% of the      guns traced to crime in other states. These two states along      with South Carolina and Georgia account for a quarter of the      traces.       A majority of the guns traced across state lines in 1996      (54.2%) came from just the top ten states--more than the      other 40 states and Washington, DC combined. Five of these      states have gun laws rated ``very weak'' (Florida, Texas,      Georgia, Ohio, and Mississippi).       In contrast, New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Minnesota,      four very large states with strong gun laws, accounted for      only 3.6% of those out-of-state guns.       Top-ranked Florida dealers sold about as many guns traced      to crime in other states (1,243) as did ten other medium-     sized or large states combined: New York (215), Michigan      (200), Missouri (155), Connecticut (134), Oregon (116),      Minnesota (106), Iowa (99), Massachusetts (90), New Jersey      (75), and Nebraska (54).       By controlling the data for population, Table 2      demonstrates how weak gun laws attract gunrunners. Analyzing      the data on a per capita basis demonstrates that even quite      small states can be mother lodes for gunrunners--if their      laws are accommodating.       Adjusted for population, Mississippi supplied the most guns      traced to other states' crimes. The explanation: except for      some limitations on juveniles, Mississippi has no significant      gun control laws of its own. Mississippi was closely followed      as a gun-providing state by South Carolina, West Virginia,      Nevada, and Kansas. Three of these four states have gun      control laws just as weak as Mississippi.       On a per capita basis, the fewest out-of-state guns came      from New Jersey, New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode      Island, Michigan and Minnesota. All these states except Rhode      Island were rated ``very strong;'' Rhode Island's laws are      ``strong.''       A gun traced to crime is twenty-five times more likely per      capita to come from Mississippi or South Carolina than from      New York or New Jersey.       Although New York's population is seven times larger than      Mississippi, Mississippi had three times more out-of-state      traces than New York.TREND 2: HOME SWEET HOME--In States With Lax Laws, More Crime Guns Come                              From In-State       In states with weak gun laws, criminals can shop at their      neighborhood gun store. By contrast, criminals in states with      tough gun control laws must obtain out-of-state guns on the      black market to perpetrate violent crimes.       More than three quarters of the gun traces from crimes in      South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, Kansas, Ohio      and Texas lead back to dealers in the same state.       Less than one quarter of the guns traced from crimes in New      York (23.5%), New Jersey (21.2%) were bought in these states,      which have strict laws.       A majority (53%) of the crime guns traced to states with      ``very strong'' laws were purchased out-of-state. There were      13,760 guns traced to crimes in these 10 states (New Jersey,      New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, the District of      Columbia, Illinois, Connecticut, and North Carolina).       Less than a quarter (23%) of the crime guns traced to      states with ``very weak'' laws were purchased out-of-state.      There were 15,046 guns traced to crimes in 26 of these states      (data for West Virginia was incomplete and not included in      this figure).    TREND 3: ONE-WAY STREETS--``Firearm Freeways'' Move In Only One                                Direction       The data shows how gunrunners use major interstate highways      as their smuggling routes. It also shows how those routes      move primarily in one direction--from states with less      stringent gun control to those with stricter rules.       I-95: The Most Travelled Highway in America Extends from      Southern Florida to Northernmost Maine:       North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida--the      four southernmost states on I-95--were the source of 1,199      guns traced to crimes in the nine northeast states from      Pennsylvania to Maine. These same nine northeastern states      accounted for a total of just 64 guns traced to the four      southeastern states--95% fewer.       702 guns bought in South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida were      traced to crimes in New York or New Jersey. On the other      hand, just 11 guns bought in New York or New Jersey were      traced to crimes in South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida.       Despite distance of 1,200 miles, Florida was the largest      supplier of out-of-state guns traced to crimes in      Massachusetts (40 gun traces). In contrast, just three guns      from Florida crimes came from Massachusetts. Georgia was the      second biggest source for Massachusetts, sending 30 guns to      the Bay State, while not a single trace from any Georgia      crime led back to Massachusetts.       I-55: Beginning in New Orleans, I-55 Runs Alongside the      Mississippi River to Jackson, Memphis and St. Louis before      Veering East to Springfield and Chicago:       Mississippi is the top supplier of out-of-state guns to      Illinois (306) and Wisconsin (75). Illinois and Wisconsin are      home to only four guns traced to crime in Mississippi.       Of all the guns traced to Mississippi, there were more      linked to crimes hundreds of miles away in Illinois (306)      than at home in Mississippi (268).       Louisiana sold 89 guns traced to crimes in Illinois,      Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin. These four states combined      sent just six guns down to Louisiana.  trend 4: love thy neighbor--the borders between some states are hot                           zones for gunrunners       When a state with loose gun laws borders on one with      stricter rules, the lax state floods the tough neighbor with      firearms.       Kansas: Dealers in Kansas sold 238 guns that were traced to      crime in Missouri. Missouri, which has a gun permit      requirement rated ``strong,'' sent only three crime guns back      across the border to Kansas.       South Carolina: Dealers in South Carolina sold 430 guns      that were traced to crimes in North Carolina. North Carolina,      which has much stricter gun control laws, is home to only two      guns traced to crimes in South Carolina.       Ohio: Ohio is perhaps the gunrunners' favorite northern      state, spreading firearms to criminals throughout the region.      Ohio sold 235 guns that went north to Michigan criminals, but      only 26 traces went the other way from Michigan dealers to      Ohio criminals. Similarly, Ohio was the source of 226 guns      traced to crimes in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, New      Jersey and the District. These five jurisdictions were the      source of just 24 guns traced to crimes in Ohio.       Indiana: While 306 guns from Indiana were traced to crimes      in Illinois, only 41 Illinois guns were traced to crimes in      Indiana. Hoosier gun dealers also sold 50 guns traced from      Wisconsin (which sent 22 to Indiana) and 77 to Michigan      (which sent 17 to Indiana).                            notes on sources       This study analyzes the 47,068 guns which the federal      Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) traced to a      final retail purchaser in 1996. ATF traces firearms at the      request of law enforcement agencies; not all firearms seized      in crimes are traced, and some are traced by local      authorities rather than by ATF. ATF supplied raw data at      Congressman Charles Schumer's request and did not contribute      to the analysis contained in this report.       Of all the traces, 16,663--35%--were used in crimes outside      of the state where they were bought. This subset was used for      analysis on ``out-of-state'' guns.       Handgun Control, Inc. provided summaries of state laws on      gun control, but bears no responsibility for the rankings.      Supplementary information was obtained from law enforcement      authorities or government offices in various states.       Population data was based on the 1995 Census as reported in      the ``Statistical Abstract of the United States.''                                 ______                                       By
