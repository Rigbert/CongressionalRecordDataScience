  The bottom line is that we should not be cutting back on a very much needed program, on a cost-effective program that keeps many Americans, including senior citizens, warm in the wintertime and cool in the summertime. We do not want to see another occurrence of where elderly people are dying because they cannot afford to maintain their apartments to be cool or to be dying when it gets to be 20 below zero.
