Mr. Chairman I want to commend the gentleman for his strong advocacy on behalf of Veterans Networks that have a rapidly aging population and an aging infrastructure to maintain. The VA in the State of New Jersey has the tough challenge of providing quality health care services to a veterans population that is the second oldest on average in the Nation. And unlike many other States that have older populations, New Jersey has an aging health care infrastructure that is proven costly to maintain and to operate.  As the gentleman knows, we have been working for some time to find solutions to this problem so that our veterans are not shortchanged by VERA.
