Speaker, for the past 40 years, the people of Michigan's 16th district have benefited from the representation of John Dingell. John is a gentleman whose example challenges us in the House of Representatives, and will continue to do so.  Michigan is consistently recognized each year as one of the most influentional delegations in the House. Through experience and leadership, both sides of the aisle have made their legislative mark for both their State and the entire Nation. John demonstrates both tenacity for his personal interests and causes, as well as a spirit of cooperation within the legislative process.  His record reflects a dedication of addressing needs of his district while balancing those with the needs of the Nation. His hard work, legislative ability and conscientious votings have earned him the admiration of his constituents and fellow Members of Congress.  I join my fellow colleagues in paying tribute to John, his accomplishments and his continued service to our Nation.
