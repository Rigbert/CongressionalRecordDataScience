 At this late stage in the session, the only way we could advance this proposal to completion would be with a consent agreement that allowed us to deal only with relevant amendments. One of the concerns is that we could end up having amendments on minimum wage or hate crimes or other issues that are completely unrelated to the underlying subject matter. So it was my belief that the consent agreement I just offered was reasonable in the sense that it did allow relevant amendments to the underlying bill, but it also gives us an opportunity to reach completion.  I want to modify my request a couple of more times and see if it might be more enticing to my good friend from Nevada. I modify my prior unanimous consent request as follows: That there be 8 hours instead of 6, 8 hours of general debate on the bill equally divided, and that the only amendments in order be three relevant amendments offered by each side instead of two, with each first-degree amendment subject to a second-degree amendment which shall be relevant to the first-degree amendment.
