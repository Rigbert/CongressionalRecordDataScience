 But where we stand today, the Democrats want to offer amendments about health care, about educational funding, about FMAP, and about Cobell funding, so we have both sides sort of piling on here.  I guess I would say to my friend from Louisiana that this is a discussion worth continuing with her counterpart, the Senator from Maine, who is our leader on the Small Business Committee, because somewhere in all of this there is a bipartisan bill, if we can structure the right kind of process that eliminates the feeling--beyond feeling, the reality of the minority getting shut out.  Therefore, Mr. President, I object.
