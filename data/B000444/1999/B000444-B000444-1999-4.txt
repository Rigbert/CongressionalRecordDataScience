 President, under the present law there are nondischargeable items with cash advances. It is a little over $1,000. This goes down to $750. There is a difference, but it is not what the Senator from Connecticut makes it out to be.  No. 2, in the means test in terms of ``other necessary expenses,'' it includes such expenses as charitable contributions, child care, dependent care, health care, payroll deductions--that is taxes, union dues, and life insurance. It is not true they are not able to be viewed as ``other expenses'' to be considered within bankruptcy.  I understand the Senator's point. I think he doth protest too loudly. It is not $1,000; it is $750. That is true. It is a $250 difference. That is what we are arguing about.  I have no more time, so I yield the floor.
