President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Jennifer Chartrand, who is leaving the Republican staff of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee.  Jennifer hails from Brooklyn and graduated from Fordham University. She began her career in the Senate with the Ethics Committee and went on to become a legislative assistant for Senator Conrad Burns. Jennifer's next move was to join the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, where my staff members got to know her well. She served both in the majority and the minority and was a valuable source of institutional knowledge on a range of issues.  While she was a tenacious fighter for Republican priorities, she always worked for good ideas, irrespective of which Senator came up with it. Perhaps most importantly, she always fought for the institutional prerogatives of both the Appropriations Committee and the Senate as a whole. Jennifer also recently staffed a congressional delegation to Europe which I was a part of. I truly appreciate all of her hard work in putting together that trip.  While I hate to see Jennifer leave, the good news is that she is only moving across the hall to the Defense Subcommittee. I hope that Senators Stevens and Inouye will not mind if we borrow her from time to time.                          ____________________
