 President, I rise today to include in the Record an additional comment regarding the Combat Meth Act, which was passed into law earlier this year as part of the USA-PATRIOT Reauthorization Act.  While much has been said about the portions of this bill that address the national meth problem, I wish to highlight the commonsense approach this legislation provides for preventing the diversion of controlled substances.  The Controlled Substances Act requires its registrants to ensure that controlled substances do not fall into the wrong hands in the places where they are manufactured, distributed, or sold. To this end, it has always been the Drug Enforcement Administration's goal to encourage such registrants to investigate fully the backgrounds of potential employees who might have access to such substances, specifically for drug-related criminal convictions.  However, certain State and local privacy laws have had the potential to hamper this objective. These laws frustrate the purpose of the Controlled Substances Act and the objectives of the Drug Enforcement Administration by, among other things, purporting to prohibit registrants from asking questions relating to an applicant's experience with controlled substances, including whether they have been convicted of drug-related crimes. The real-world implication has been, in a word, nonsensical. In my own State of California, for example, there is a State law that provides that employers are not allowed to question a potential employee about certain drug-related criminal convictions that are older than 2 years. This prohibition also purports to cover employers who are registered under the Controlled Substances Act. If a registrant complied with this State law, it could mean that a responsible pharmacy could hire someone to work at the cash register who would be in a position to divert pharmaceutical products, and the employer would never have any clue about the applicant's past. This runs counter to the purpose of the Controlled Substances Act and undermines the DEA's efforts to prevent the unlawful diversion of controlled substances.  The law we passed clarifies once and for all that registrants can and should fully vet applicants, including asking them about any and all drug-related criminal convictions--not as an infringement on someone's privacy but as a safeguard to ensure that people with access to controlled substances do not pose risks to the public welfare. This legislation makes clear that those on the frontlines of preventing controlled substance diversion have a crucial tool they need to do their job.                          ____________________[Page S2596]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            COMBAT METH ACT
