 President, this amendment that is before us, no matter what we hear, is about safety, is about our ability as a country to ensure that our constituents--whether they are traveling to work, taking their kids to daycare, going on vacation, or traveling down the highway--are safe. We have a right in this country to ensure the safety of our constituents.  I hear our opponents saying this is a violation of NAFTA. Do not take my word for it. Take the word of the NAFTA arbitration panel. They have clearly told us that the United States may not be required to treat applications from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as applications from United States or Canadian firms. United States authorities, in their words, are responsible for the safe operation of trucks within United States territory, whether ownership is United States, Canadian, or Mexican.  We have a right under treaties right now to ensure the safety of our citizens on our highways. That is what this amendment is about. That is what this vote is about--whether or not we will undermine that safety all on our own here in the Senate and go beyond what the NAFTA panel has told us we can do and undermine the NAFTA panel, or whether we are going to stand up for safety. That is what this amendment is about.  I urge all of our colleagues to vote on the side of families and safety.  I yield to my colleague.
