 President, I send two amendments to the desk. The first is an amendment, on behalf of myself, Senators Sununu, Gregg, Wyden, Cantwell, Feingold, Burr, McCain, Kerry, and Collins, ``To repeal certain tax benefits relating to oil and gas wells intangible drilling and development costs.''  The second amendment is an amendment, on behalf of Senator Kerry and myself, which would be a restatement for millionaires of 39.6 percent income tax rate, the pre-May 2003 rates of tax on capital gains and dividend rates and deduction limitations until the budget deficit is eliminated.
