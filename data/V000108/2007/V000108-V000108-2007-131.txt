Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding.  And I want to acknowledge that we in Congress authorized the loan guarantee program for advanced technology that addresses clean air and climate concerns. The Federal Credit Reform Act explicitly states that loan obligations can only be made to the extent there is an affirmative action on the part of the Appropriations Committee.  The Federal Credit Reform Act provides that new direct loan obligations may be incurred and new loan guarantee commitments may be made for fiscal year 1992 and thereafter only to the extent that, one, new budget authority is provided in an appropriations act; and, two, a limitation on the use of funds for the cost of a loan guarantee has been ``provided in an appropriations act''; or, three, ``authority is otherwise provided in appropriations acts.''  However, it is the implementation of this program that has raised the concerns of the committee. Our fiscal year 2008 bill does not provide loan guarantees for the nuclear industry. The request for guaranteed loans from the Nuclear Energy Association, subsidized by the Federal Government, is very large. It overwhelms what the bill provides for the entire energy community. The administration had asked for a total of $4 billion for the nuclear energy industry and the coal industry. This does not come close to what the Nuclear Energy Association has indicated they need. The Nuclear Energy Association indicates a need for $25 billion in Federal guaranteed loans for fiscal year 2008 and more than that in fiscal year 2009. The ``system,'' meaning the DOE loan guarantee infrastructure, cannot accommodate a request of this size at this time.  I would also point out that the fiscal year 2006 joint continuing resolution included $4 billion in Incentives For Innovative Technology loan guarantees for the Department of Energy to execute, without defining which technologies to target. The Congress did not limit the use of this initial $4 billion for nuclear projects. The administration chose not to make these loans available to the nuclear community.                              {time}  1700  I believe in the ``go slow approach.'' We should take all deliberate speed for the new DOE programs. I recommend this approach to the Congress on this one based on my continuing concerns about how DOE has managed it to date. I am, however, open to new information about the industry's plan for innovative technology deployment and discussion about how DOE can implement the program. I pledge to work with the gentleman to see if we can come to an agreeable solution.
