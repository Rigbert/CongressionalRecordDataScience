President, in 1985, when we had a conservative Republican in the White House by the name of Ronald Reagan, we had a Senate that was dominated by the Democrats. At that time, the Senate majority leader was a very distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Bob Byrd.  We found Ronald Reagan was violating the Constitution with recess appointments. Let me go back and give a little background of this. In the history of this country, back when we were in session for a few weeks and then they got on their horse and buggy and went for several days back to wherever they came from, if some opening occurred during the course of a recess, such as the Secretary of State dying, the Constitution provides that a President can go ahead and make a recess appointment and not rely on the prerogative of the Senate to confirm, for confirmation purposes. This is understandable at that time.  Since then, Republicans and Democrats in the White House have, when they were philosophically opposed to the philosophy of the prevailing philosophy in the Senate, made recess appointments.  Ronald Reagan was doing this. I loved him, but he was violating the Constitution.  Senator Byrd read and studied the Constitution. He sent a letter to the White House that said: If you continue to do this, then I can assure you we will put holds on all of your nominations. It wasn't just judicial nominations but all of them. I read from Senator Byrd:       In the future, prior to any recess breaks, the White House      will inform the majority leader and (the minority leader) of      any recess appointments which might be contemplated in the      recess. They would do so in such advance time to sufficiently      allow the leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to      fill whatever vacancies might take place during such a break.  Those were for anticipated vacancies.  President Reagan agreed with this and sent a letter back to Senator Byrd saying he would do it.  In June of 1999, the President made a recess appointment of someone who had not even gone through the committee process, had not given all their information to the appropriate committee in order to become an ambassador. He went in and appointed him anyway. I felt that was a violation every bit as egregious as anything Ronald Reagan had done.  I took the same letter that Senator Byrd had sent to Ronald Reagan, and I sent it to President Clinton.  I got no response until finally he realized I was putting holds on all these nominations. On June 15, 1999, President Clinton wrote a letter saying:       I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985      between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your      letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my      administration will follow.  I wrote a letter back thanking him and was very complimentary to him for taking this action.  A short while later--we were going into recess--along with 16 other Senators, I sent a letter to the President because we had heard rumors he was going to make several appointments, recess appointments. In fact, that is exactly what happened.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record all this in more detail.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Recess Appointments--Chronology       1985 Byrd-Reagan Agreement: ``In the future, prior to any      recess breaks, the White House would inform the majority      leader and (the minority leader) of any recess appointment      which might be contemplated during such recess. They would do      so in advance sufficiently to allow the leadership on both      sides to perhaps take action to fill whatever vacancies that      might be imperative during such a break.'' (Emphasis added)--     Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.V.), 10/18/85.       June 4, 1999 Recess Appointment: Without sufficient notice      in advance of the recess, President Clinton, on the last day      of the brief 5-day Memorial Day recess, granted a recess      appointment to controversial political and social activist      James Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg.       June 7, 1999 Inhofe Places Holds: Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.)      announced ``holds'' on all non-military nominees, demanding      Clinton's promise to abide by the Byrd-Reagan agreement on      all future recess appointments.       June 15, 1999 Clinton Letter to Lott: ``I share your      opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 between      President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your letter      remains a fair and constructive framework, which my      administration will follow.''       June 16, 1999 Inhofe Lifts Holds: Inhofe lifted his holds      on nominees, praising the President for agreeing to abide by      the Byrd-Reagan agreement in the future.       Nov. 10, 1999 Senators' Letter to Clinton: ``If you do make      recess appointments during the upcoming recess which violate      the spirit of our agreement, then we will respond by placing      holds on all judicial nominees. The result would be a      complete breakdown in cooperation between our two branches of      government on this issue which could prevent the confirmation      of any such nominees next year. We do not want this to      happen. We urge you to cooperate in good faith with the      Majority Leader concerning all contemplated recess      appointments.''--Inhofe and 16 senators.       Nov. 17, 1999 Inhofe Floor Speech: ``I want to make sure      there is no misunderstanding and that we don't go into a      recess with the President not understanding that we are very      serious . . . It is not just me putting a hold on all      judicial nominees for the remaining year of his term, but 16      other senators have agreed to do that . . . I want to make      sure it is abundantly clear without any doubt in anyone's      mind in the White House--I will refer back to this document I      am talking about right now--that in the event the President      makes recess appointments, we will put holds on all judicial      nominations for the remainder of his term. It is very fair      for me to sand here and eliminate any doubt in the      President's mind of what we will do.''       Nov. 19, 1999 Clinton Notifies Senate of Contemplated      Recess Appointments: In compliance with the Byrd-Reagan      agreement, Clinton provides a list--prior to the recess--of      13 possible recess appointments under consideration for the      Nov. 20-Jan. 24 intersession recess. Inhofe and others object      to five on the list who have holds or prospective holds on      their nominations. Eight are considered acceptable.       Nov. 19, 1999 Inhofe Floor Speech 10 Minutes Before      Adjournment: ``If anyone other than these eight individuals      is recess appointed, we will put a hold on every single      judicial nonimee of this President for the remainder of his      term in office . . . I reemphasize, if there is some other      interpretation as to the meaning of the (Nov. 10) letter, it      does not make any difference, we are still going to put holds      on them. I want to make sure there is a very clear      understanding: If these nominees come in, if he does violate      the intent (of the agreement) as we interpret it, then we      will have holds on these nominees.''       Nov. 23, 1999 Inhofe Letter to Clinton: In a spirit of      cooperation, Inhofe acknowledges one additional acceptable      appointment has been added to the list. ``I hope this makes      our position clear. Any recess appointment other than the      nine listed above would constitute a violation of the spirit      of our agreement and trigger multiple holds on judicial      nominees.''       Dec. 7, 1999 Inhofe Privately Urges White House Not to      Violate Agreement: Notified by the Majority Leader's office      that the President was contemplating at least two recess      appointments (Weisberg and Fox) which were not included on      the list submitted in advance of the recess, Inhofe      reiterated that making these appointments would trigger a      hold on all judicial nominees.       Dec. 9, 1999 Clinton Violates Agreement--Appoints Stuart      Weisberg to OSHA Review Commission: Name was not included on      list submitted in advance of the recess. Weisberg appointment      was strongly opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the      National Association of Manufacturers. Weisberg is a liberal      advocate of expanded regulatory authority who had compiled a      controversial record of decisions consistently unfavorable to      employers.       Dec. 17, 1999 Clinton Violates Agreement--Appoints Sarah      Fox to NLRB: Name was not included on list submitted in      advance of the recess. Fox is a stridently pro-labor former      Ted Kennedy staffer whose policy decisions were consistently      pro-union on such key issues as striker replacements, Davis-     Bacon wage laws and the Beck decision of compulsory union      dues.       Dec. 20, 1999 Inhofe Responds by Announcing Effort to Block      Judges: ``I am announcing today that I will do exactly what I      said I would do if the President deliberately violated our      agreement.''       Jan. 25, 2000 Inhofe Places Hold on All Judicial Nominees:      ``It is in anticipation of just such defiance that I and my      colleagues warned the President on at least five separate      occasions exactly what our response would be if he violated      the agreement. We would put on hold on all judicial nominees.      So today it will come as no surprise to the President that we      are putting a hold on all judicial nominees. We are simply      doing what we said we would do to uphold Constitutional      respect for the Senate's proper role in the confirmation      process.''       Feb. 10, 2000 Inhofe Hold is Overruled by Majority Leader      Trent Lott: Inhofe thanked the 19 Republican senators who, in      a key procedural vote, supported his effort to demand      presidential accountability. Those Senators were: Shelby      (Ala.), Murkowski (Alaska), Allard (Colo.), Craig (Idaho),      Crapo (Idaho), Grassley (Iowa), McConnell (Ky.), Bunning      (Ky), Grams (Minn.), Burns (Mont.), Smith (N.H.), Gregg,      (N.H.), Domenici (N.M.), Helms (N.C.), Ihofe (Okla.),      Thurmond (S.C.), Gramm (Texas), Thomas (Wy.), and Enzi (Wy.).       August 3-31, 2000 Clinton Grants 17 Recess Appointments in      Defiance of the Senate: Rejecting his commitment to cooperate      with the Senate, Clinton grants appointments to Bill Lann Lee      and other whom the Senate specifically said were unacceptable      as recess appointments. Clinton's action was a deliberate      affront to the Senate, a violation of the spirit of the Byrd-     Reagan agreement and an abuse of power undermining the      ``advice and consent'' clause of the Constitution.
