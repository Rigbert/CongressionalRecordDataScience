The chairman has announced that he expects to consider that, not next week but the week after. I have told the chairman, as I told Mr. Cantor last week, that I expect to bring it to the floor shortly after it's passed out of committee.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. So should I assume by the end of October, or am I missing something?
