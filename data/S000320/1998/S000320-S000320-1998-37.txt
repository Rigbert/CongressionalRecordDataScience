 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an award-winning Alabama journalist and authorwho has written the definitive history of the World War II military career of Hollywood-great Jimmy Stewart. Mr. Smith, who served with Stewart in WWII, wrote ``A Retrospective of the World War II Military Career of Hollywood's James M. (Jimmy) Stewart'' for the James M. Stewart Museum Foundation, located in Stewart's hometown--Indiana, PA. I believe excerpts from this article are a fitting tribute to both the life and legacy of a true American hero: Jimmy Stewart, as well as to one of Alabama's fine authors: Starr Smith. In compliance with the Congressional Record text-length rules, only excerpts of Mr. Smith's article could be placed in the Record; however, I encourage my colleagues and the American people to obtain a complete copy of this important article from either the James M. Stewart Museum or the September 1998 edition of The Retired Officers Magazine.  In addition to his many accomplishments, Smith is a travel columnist for the Montgomery Advertiser and is a retired Air Force Reserve colonel. He lives in Montgomery, AL.  Mr. President, the following are excerpts from ``A Retrospective of the World War II Military Career of Hollywood's James M. (Jimmy) Stewart'' by Starr Smith:       When the melancholy news came of Jimmy Stewart's death I      was in Montreal, Canada. I thought it singular that I was out      of my own country at the time because my relationship with      this remarkable American had taken place on foreign soil--     wartime England. Much has been said and written since      Stewart's death about his extraordinary life and career as a      film actor of the first rank, but little has been said about      Stewart's brilliant and brave record as an Army Air Force      combat pilot and commander in World War II.       I served with Stewart on a windswept and cold bomber      station, called Old Buckingham, near the North Sea between      Cambridge and Norwich in England's East Anglia in 1943-1944.      Our outfit was the 453rd Bomb Group. The commander, Colonel      Ramsay Potts, was a battle-tested B-24 specialist who had      been on the historic and pivotal Ploesti mission and earned      the Distinguished Service Cross. Stewart, then a major, was      the group's operations officer and I was an intelligence      officer who handled much of the briefings for the air crews      prior to their mission over Nazi Germany. It was in this      capacity that I worked with Stewart, night after night,      preparing the details of the mission. I have never known a      more intelligent, knowledgeable, hardworking, conscientious      and dedicated officer.       In my book, ``Only the Days Are Long: Reports of a      Journalist and World Traveler,'' I wrote of Stewart: ``At      night, working with me preparing the mission, Stewart was      crisp and business-like; reserved, but he knew his job and      was a keen student of daylight precision bombing. (The      Americans bombed in daylight, the RAF at night). It was      interesting to see Stewart at the bar of the Officer's Club      after a tough day and hear his discussion of the mission with      the returning pilots. But even then he was always slightly      aloof. He was never one of the boys. This is not to say      Stewart was unfriendly. Rather, he went about his work with a      cool professional detachment--a single purpose approach that      did not allow for personal involvement. This, I think, was      the reason for this success in the war. He was determined to      prove that he was more than an actor, more than a Hollywood      star. He was determined to prove that now he could measure up      as a man doing a really important job in the military      crucible and not just a celluloid hero.       Almost a year before Pearl Harbor, Jimmy Stewart had a deep      feeling that his country would soon be at war. Stewart also      knew that if war came he wanted to be in uniform and overseas      on combat duty.       At the beginning of the new year of 1941, Stewart was at      the top of his career as a movie actor and international      star. His 1939 picture, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' has      made him a folk hero throughout America and he was destined      for an Academy Award for his role as the reporter in      ``Philadelphia Story'' later in the year. His life was      blissful, romantic, flawless, and ahead was the golden      promise of infinite stardom as one of the premier movie      players of all time.       . . . but with England fighting Hitler since 1939, Edward      R. Murrow's bleak broadcasts from London, the Pacific war      against the Japanese going badly for the British . . . Jimmy      Stewart decided to join the fight. But, he faced two major      roadblocks: his boss and his country. Louis B. Mayer, the      forceful and dictatorial head of MGM used every persuasive      tactic at his command--choice roles, contract revisions, free      time to help with the war effort as a civilian. The other      matter was different.       In September of 1940, the Selective Service Act became law,      and men between the ages of 21 and 36 were required to      register. Being 32, Stewart registered . . . when he was      called up for a physical in late 1940, he was turned down:      underweight. That could have ended the whole affair. . . .      perhaps thinking of his father's fierce patriotism and his      service in two wars, plus his own fervent love of country,      Stewart favored the volunteer route. He appealed the Army's      underweight decision, embarked on an eating binge, made the      weight requirements and reported for induction on March 22,      1941 at Fort McArthur, California.       Stewart was among the very few officers in American      military history to rise from private to full colonel in      slightly over four years. Moreover, Stewart was actually on      combat duty all the time he was overseas, performing vital,      demanding and dangerous jobs: squadron operations officer,      squadron commander, group operations officer, wing operations      officer, and later at the end--Second Bomb Wing Commander.      And, all the while, he was flying combat missions as a B-24      pilot and command pilot.       . . . Stewart spent all of his service in England assigned      to the 2nd Combat Wing. . . . in late August of 1945, he      returned to New York on the Queen Elizabeth. And on September      29th of that year, Stewart was discharged at Andrews Air      Force Base in Washington. He was immediately appointed a full      colonel in the Air Force Reserve. In his war years, Stewart      had flown 20 combat missions, among them the tough ones:      Brunswick, Bremen, Frankfort, Schweinfut, and I recall that      he was on Berlin twice--once leading the entire 1,000 plane      8th Air Force. His wartime decorations include: Distinguished      Flying Cross, with Oak Leaf Cluster; four Air Medals, and the      French Croix de Guerre with Palm. He was promoted to      Brigadier General in the Air Force Reserve in 1959 and      retired in 1968. After Stewart died in July of 1997, Air      Power History published a memoriam . . . (which) contained      this little-known fact: ``In 1966, during his annual two      weeks of active duty, Stewart requested a combat assignment      and participated in a bombing strike over Vietnam.''       . . . With all the myriad honors of a celebrated and      eclectic career, including the highest in his profession--the      Academy Award--it is not too much to believe that Jimmy      Stewart reached the blue lawn of his life in those eventful      and dangerous years of World War II. A small town boy who      grew up with strong family values and a bed-rock foundation      in honesty and integrity, intertwined with a fervent      patriotism--Stewart served his country with dedication and      distinction, and, like F. Scott Fitzgerald, his fellow      Princetonian--he lived his life with an unbending      determination, subtle style and a certain mystique.                          ____________________
