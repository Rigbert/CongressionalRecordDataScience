 President, I rise today to pay tribute to San Francisco Police Officer James Guelff on the fifth anniversary of his death in the line of duty.  This coming Saturday, the City of San Francisco will honor Officer Guelff by having his name enshrined at the corner of Pine and Franklin in San Francisco where he was slain on November 13, 1994.  Responding to a distress call, Officer Guelff, stationed at Northern Police Station, reached the crime scene and was immediately fired upon by a suspect shielded by body armor and armed with an AK 223, an Uzi, two semi-automatic pistols, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. In an attempt to defend himself, Officer Guelff returned fire but his police issue revolver could not penetrate the gunman's kevlar vest and bulletproof helmet. Officer Guelff was killed under the barrage of the assailant's bullets as he attempted to reload his revolver.  Officer James Guelff bravely faced an assailant with defensive armor and firepower no police officer should ever confront. In response to his death, his relatives and fellow officers embarked on a national campaign to restrict felons' access to body armor.  This incident helped raise awareness of the unacceptable risks officers face on the street when they encounter gunmen with equal or better defensive protection. The bottom line is that criminals who use body armor have a deadly offensive weapon.  It is a tribute to the memory of Office James Guelff and a tribute to the persistence and dedication of his family and fellow officers that California passed legislation restricting the use of body armor by felons.  Earlier this year, I introduced the James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 to enact Federal regulations on body armor. First, the measure increases the penalties criminals receive if they commit a crime wearing body armor. Specifically, a violation will lead to an increase of two levels under the Federal sentencing guidelines. Second, it makes it unlawful for violent felons to purchase, use, or possess body armor.  This legislation is included in S. 254, the Juvenile Justice Crime bill, which is in its final negotiations in a joint House-Senate conference committee.  It is my hope that the Conference Committee will finish its job quickly so that we can provide a lasting tribute to Officer James Guelff. This legislation will better protect our police officers by making sure they are adequately supplied with body armor, and that hardened criminals are deterred from using body armor.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me on this special day in honoring Officer James Guelff and celebrating the life of a true American hero.                          ____________________
