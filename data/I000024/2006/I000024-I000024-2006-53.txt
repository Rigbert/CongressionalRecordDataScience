President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. And I think we will prevail. As to what you are suggesting, and what you have been suggesting over the last few minutes, the vast majority of the American people are on our side. They know as to people who say: You cannot secure our border, fences will not work--they worked for a long time up in between North Korea and South Korea. I think they will work down here, too.                          ____________________
