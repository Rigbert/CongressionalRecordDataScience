Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3892 constitutes a noncontroversial fine-tuning of an existing statute, the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980, which permits individuals to file complaints against Federal judges for inappropriate behavior.  The legislation before us will reorganize the 1980 act by recodifying it as a new chapter of title 28, United States Code, thereby making it easier to locate and use. The bill will also clarify the responsibilities of a circuit chief judge in making the initial evaluations of a complaint, will specifically empower a judicial council to refer a complaint to a smaller panel for greater scrutiny. These changes will not only assist the Federal judiciary in discharging its responsibilities under the 1980 act, they will enable an individual to understand more fully the reasoning behind the disposition of a complaint.  Mr. Speaker, the Committee on the Judiciary believes that the 1980 act works well in most instances but could work better. We have developed this bill with full participation of the minority, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
