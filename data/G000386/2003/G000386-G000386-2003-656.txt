 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Montana. I share Senator Pryor's interest in a GAO study and will be glad to work with him on a letter. And, obviously, a person such as I, who relies upon the GAO for so much study on matters in which I am involved, would not discourage my colleague from likewise seeking the General Accounting Office's expertise and look forward to what such a study would show in regard to the treatment of our military personnel.  I yield the floor.
