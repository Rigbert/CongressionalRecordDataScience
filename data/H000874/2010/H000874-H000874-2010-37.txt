 I would simply say to my friend--and he is my friend and I believe him to be a very positive Member of the Congress of the United States. I would say to him, I don't want to re-litigate. I do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past, and I believe, very frankly, my friend, that the economic policies that you want to pursue have not worked, and I don't want to pursue them again. It's not a question of re-litigation. It's a question of learning from the failures of the past that brought this economy so extraordinarily low. It is time to invest in the creation of jobs. I believe this bill does that.
