Speaker, today Congressman Portman and I have introduced The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1998. This legislation eliminates duplicative paperwork for those individuals and groups attempting to get federal assistance. The bill also removes federal road blocks to coordinating service delivery for families receiving federal assistance. The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1998 establishes the framework by which federal, state and local agencies can more efficiently deliver services to those in need.  We have asked families to get back on their feet so they can take care of themselves and their children but our maze of federal regulations makes it more difficult for community programs to assist families in doing this. We must help these families to help themselves. The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1998 coordinates federal service programs to better serve our Nation's children and families and I am pleased to introduce it today with my colleagues Rob Portman, Jim Moran, Chris Shays, Tom Davis, Steve Horn, Gary Condit, Dennis Kucinich, Bob Weygand, Rosa DeLauro, Jim McGovern, Carolyn Kilpatrick, Jim Talent, Mark Sanford, and John Sununu.                          ____________________
