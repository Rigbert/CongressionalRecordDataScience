Speaker, I offer an amendment to the title.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment to the title offered by Mr. Upton:         Amend the title so as to read: ``Resolution recognizing      the 100th anniversary year of the founding of the Ford Motor      Company, which has been a significant part of the social,      economic, and cultural heritage of the United States and many      other nations and a revolutionary industrial and global      institution, and congratulating the Ford Motor Company for      its achievements.''.  The amendment to the title was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
