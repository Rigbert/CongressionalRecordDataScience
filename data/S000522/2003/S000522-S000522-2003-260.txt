Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1208) to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 of United States contributions to the International Fund for Ireland, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1208       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Ireland Peace and      Reconciliation Support Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) The United States has been effectively engaged in the      Northern Ireland peace process through both participating in      negotiations and contributing to the economic development of      the region.       (2) Both the Government of Ireland and the Irish people and      the Government of the United Kingdom and the British people      are long-standing friends of the United States and the      American people.       (3) In 1986, the United States, in support of the Agreement      Between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the      United Kingdom (``Anglo-Irish Agreement'') dated November 15,      1985, initiated annual contributions to the International      Fund for Ireland (``International Fund'') to help bolster      economic development and support programs that would foster      peace and reconciliation in     Northern Ireland and the affected border areas of the      Republic of Ireland.       (4) The United States has been a generous and faithful      donor to the International Fund, contributing more than      $386,000,000 to help improve relations between Catholics and      Protestants in Northern Ireland through the creation of      thousands of jobs and cross community business development.       (5) More than 80 percent of the International Fund's      investments have been in disadvantaged areas offering work      experience and important job training programs for      disadvantaged and unemployed youth through the economic,      social, and physical regeneration of deprived areas.       (6) The International Fund has also developed a series of      community-building programs promoting greater dialogue and      understanding between Catholics and Protestants and      leadership programs designed to develop a new generation of      leaders in Northern Ireland to bring about a more peaceful      and prosperous future in the region.       (7) Through the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986      (Public Law 99-415), the United States also seeks to ensure      that its contributions promote ``reconciliation in Northern      Ireland and the establishment of a society in Northern      Ireland in which all may live in peace, free from      discrimination, terrorism, and intolerance, and with the      opportunity for both communities to participate fully in the      structures and processes of government.''.       (8) The Good Friday Agreement reached by the Government of      Ireland, the Government of the United Kingdom, and political      party leaders on April 10, 1998, created the Northern Ireland      Executive Assembly and Executive Committee and provided for a      ``democratically elected Assembly in Northern Ireland which      is inclusive in its membership, capable of exercising      executive and legislative authority, and subject to      safeguards to protect the rights and interests of all sides      of the community.''.       (9) The Good Friday Agreement also called for police reform      and establishment of a ``new beginning'' in policing in      Northern Ireland with an effective, accountable, and fair      police service capable of attracting and sustaining support      from the community as a whole, capable of maintaining law and      order, and based on principles of protection of human rights.       (10) In 1999, the Independent Commission on Policing in      Northern Ireland, mandated by the Good Friday Agreement, made      175 recommendations for policing reform in Northern Ireland,      some of which have been implemented.       (11) In 2002, the Department of State, as required by      section 701(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act,      Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228), issued a ``Report on      Policing Reform and Human Rights in Northern Ireland'' and      concluded that among key areas of concern that had not been      fully implemented was the establishment of a critically-     needed new police training facility and an increase in      funding for training programs.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) United States assistance for the International Fund has      contributed greatly to the economic development of Northern      Ireland and that both objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement      Support Act of 1986, economic development and reconciliation,      remain critical to achieving a just and lasting peace in the      region, especially in the economically-depressed areas;       (2) although there has been positive economic development      in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland,      International Fund contributions to support much-needed      projects in economically-depressed areas of Northern Ireland      remain very important, and an expansion of efforts in      reconciliation projects as a way to promote peace and      economic stability is also encouraged; and       (3) since policing reform is a significant part of winning      public confidence and acceptance in the new form of      government in Northern Ireland, the International Fund is      encouraged to support programs that enhance relations between      communities, and between the police and the communities they      serve, promote human rights training for police, and enhance      peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of continued conflict.     SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT SUPPORT ACT                    OF 1986.       (a) Findings and Purposes.--Section 2(b) of the Anglo-Irish      Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended by adding at the end      the following: ``Furthermore, the International Fund is      encouraged to support programs that enhance relations between      communities, and between the police and the communities they      serve, promote human rights training for police, enhance      peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of continued conflict,      promote training programs to enhance the new district      partnership police boards recommended by the Patten      Commission, and assist in the transition of former British      military installations and prisons into sites for peaceful,      community-supported activities, such as housing, retail, and      commercial development.''.       (b) United States Contributions to the International      Fund.--Section 3 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of      1986 is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(c) Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005.--Of the amounts made      available for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 to carry out chapter      4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (relating      to the economic support fund), there are authorized to be      appropriated $25,000,000 for each such fiscal year for United      States contributions to the International Fund. Amounts      appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations      under the preceding sentence are authorized to remain      available until expended. Of the amount authorized to be      appropriated for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 under this      subsection, it is the sense of Congress that not less than 20      percent of such amount for each such fiscal year should be      used to carry out the last sentence of section 2(b).''.       (c) Annual Reports.--Section 6(1) of the Anglo-Irish      Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended by adding at the end      before the semicolon the following: ``, specifically through      improving local community relations and relations between the      police and the people they serve''.
