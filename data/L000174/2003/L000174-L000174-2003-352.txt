 I send a resolution to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator Durbin. The resolution says that in any proceeding of a committee considering a nomination made by the President to the U.S. Senate, it shall not be in order to ask any question of the nominee relating to the religious affiliation of the nominee.  With that, Madam President, I send a resolution to the desk to amend the Standing Rules of the Senate to provide that it is not in order in a committee to ask questions regarding a Presidential nominee's religious affiliation.
