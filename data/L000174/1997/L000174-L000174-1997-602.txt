President, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to cast my vote today in support of the nomination of Andrew Cuomo for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Given the opportunity to choose a replacement for outgoing Secretary Henry Cisneros, I would be hard pressed to find a better candidate.  Andrew Cuomo has spent his life helping low-income families find answers to housing problems. His work to combat homelessness in New York and most recently at the Department has helped to take countless needy people off of the streets and put them back on their feet. His innovative continuum of care initiative provided the impetus for Vermont and other States to bring together housing and service providers and develop a comprehensive plan for dealing with homelessness. This approach has ensured that the Department's homelessness programs get the most bang-for-the-buck, and should serve as a model for other Federal programs.  That Yankee knack for cost cutting will serve him well in his new position. When I look at the funding problems ahead for the section 8 housing program and the uncertain impact of welfare reform on the cost of HUD rental assistance programs, I don't know whether to congratulate Andrew Cuomo on his promotion or offer my sympathies. However, I do know that outgoing Secretary Cisneros is leaving the Department in good hands, and I look forward to working with Secretary Cuomo in the years ahead to address these and other problems facing our Nation's housing programs.  Andrew Cuomo had nationwide responsibilities which he exercised with great skill. In Vermont we look at the people who turned to him for help in my home city of Burlington. He listened. He helped. Today their life is better because of him.
