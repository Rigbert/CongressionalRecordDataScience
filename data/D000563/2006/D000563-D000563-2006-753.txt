President, if I may ask one more question, in one of the hearings that I attended, I recall that Senator Dorgan brought in one of these whistleblowers who talked about the monogrammed towels they were charging the Government to be put into certain facilities. The Senator talked about running up the price of gasoline that they were charging to the Government. I hope the Senator will recount those particular instances.  But I would like to ask the Senator, when Members of Congress get up here and say: We love our soldiers and we love our troops and we stand behind them, how can we then cast a blind eye and overlook the obvious? When our soldiers aren't getting the right equipment, when our soldiers aren't getting the goods they deserve, when they are not getting the supplies they need to be safe and successful, how can that reflect any love of our troops? If we are truly committed to these soldiers, wouldn't we be holding oversight hearings, bringing in under oath these whistleblowers and their bosses? Let us bring them in and put them before the cameras and ask them if they are wasting taxpayer dollars and endangering the lives of our troops. Wouldn't that be the true measure of our commitment to these men and women in uniform?
