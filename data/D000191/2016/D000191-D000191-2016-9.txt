Speaker, I remember the closing ad in the Trump campaign. He was going to drain the swamp. Good. And then he had the CEO of Goldman Sachs up there, who represented the global elite who robbed the working class of their savings and homes. Pretty powerful stuff, and I will tell you what, I pretty much agreed with it.  Now, he is already working on draining the swamp, so things are showing up in D.C. that you haven't seen for a while. I was walking down the street by Trump Tower International last night and I found this laying in the street.  Now, I haven't seen this since a guy named Henry ``Hank'' Paulson, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, was Secretary of the Treasury under George Bush and he came to Congress after Wall Street destroyed our economy with reckless gambling and asked for an unlimited bailout of Wall Street, the key to the Treasury.  Now, I opposed that and, for one proud day, the House of Representatives didn't bail out Wall Street. Unfortunately, the Senate came back to town. They got scared by Wall Street tanking the market. They bailed out Wall Street and a number of my colleagues in the House changed their votes, so they all got bailed out. Well enough, good.  Now, that is Goldman Sachs that says please return to Goldman Sachs. Well, Donald Trump is returning the key to the Treasury to Goldman Sachs. Ain't that great? That's draining the swamp folks; draining the swamp.  A guy named Mnuchin--now he is a film producer, but he made a fortune at Goldman Sachs; his dad worked at Goldman Sachs for 33 years; his brother still works at Goldman Sachs--is going to get the key to the Treasury.  Now, he also made a fortune during the TARP bailout by buying an asset, IndyMac, and dispossessing tens of thousands of people of their homes.  So I would say that Mr. Trump, the candidate, and the ad was right. These people at Goldman Sachs and elsewhere are the global elite who have stolen people's savings, who have taken away their homes.  But now he is putting them back in charge. Mr. Mnuchin is getting the key to the Treasury, Goldman Sachs executive, dad, lifetime Goldman Sachs executive, brother still working at Goldman Sachs.  How the heck is that draining the swamp?                          ____________________
