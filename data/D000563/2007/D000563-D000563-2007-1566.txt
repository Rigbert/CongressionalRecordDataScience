President, let me say at the outset that committee report language cannot authorize something that is not legal, no matter what we put in committee report language. This has to be put in bill language.  So referring to a committee report--trust me, after more than 20 years serving on appropriations committees, committee report language is akin to sending a note to your sister--it doesn't mean much. But when it comes to the actual expenditure of money, you want bill language and it is there.  Let me, also, say that the money the Senator is talking about is being transferred, I assume--I don't know those particular projects--to other governmental entities. They could be counties, they could be States, they could be cities. These governmental entities are receiving this money.  What we are talking about, the most egregious cases that have led to the greatest embarrassment on Capitol Hill involves the people who represent private interest groups who come here and receive these earmarked funds. Those people are subject to full disclosure under the underlying bill. That is what this is all about.
