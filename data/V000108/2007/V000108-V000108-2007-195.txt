Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman making the announcement. I think Jim would want to be remembered as someone who was dogged on behalf of working people and the environment.  I appreciate the dean of our delegation asking for this moment of silence, and, again, deeply regret the loss of Jim Jontz.                          ____________________
