President, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that Mallory Rome of Killington, VT, has been selected to receive the prestigious James Madison Fellowship. I commend the foundation for their decision to select Mallory--a Vermonter who has a deep commitment to teaching.  As most Americans learn at an early age, James Madison is the ``Father of the Constitution.'' He sponsored the first 10 amendments and there is probably no single individual who had more involvement with drafting this remarkable document that has served our country so well. It is fitting that Congress established the James Madison Fellowship Program in honor of this great American.  Each year, fellowships are awarded to individuals who are interested in pursuing a career in education and who desire to concentrate their studies in American history or political science. Mallory has worked very hard to earn this fellowship. This month, she will graduate from Yale University. Her 4 years there have prepared her well for this fellowship and her future career. Mallory has already interned for the Teach For America Program and worked as a teaching assistant at a summer school.  I am confident that the foundation will be proud that it awarded this fellowship to Mallory. I know that her family and Vermont are already proud of her and I wish her the best in the future.
