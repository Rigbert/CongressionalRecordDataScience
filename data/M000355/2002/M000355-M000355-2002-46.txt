 President, the pending amendment should be called a clients' bill of rights because it is designed not to in any way handicap the recovery of the victim, but to rearrange the relationship between the lawyer and the victim so the victim can get more of the money he or she justly deserves and to deal with the problem of runaway punitive damages--which are not for the purpose of rewarding the plaintiff anyway; they are for the purpose of punishing the defendant.  I was in Henderson, KY, which is right on the Ohio River, Friday night.There were four doctors at the meeting I attended. Every single one of them was on the verge of moving over to Indiana--it is very easy for them; they just go across the Ohio River--in order to escape this malpractice crisis which has afflicted, of course, my State of Kentucky. It hasn't afflicted Indiana because they have reasonable caps on recovery and have had for years.  The next day, on Saturday, I was in Morganfield, KY, and there were some people there who have a son who lives in Mississippi. The distinguished Republican leader was talking about the crisis in Mississippi. The son of one of the people in Morganfield is an obstetrician in Mississippi, getting ready to pack his bags and move to a State where they have dealt this issue.  Speaking of a State that has a crisis, there is no State that has a greater crisis than the State of Nevada, and our colleague from Nevada is here to discuss the crisis in Nevada. It is my understanding that there is a special session going on this very week.  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?
