Chairman, I want to commend the gentleman. The gentleman came up to me on the floor about 2 months ago, I believe, and brought this matter to my attention, and I shared his anger and outrage at the apparent treatment that has occurred here. When I say apparent, it is simply that I have not personally verified all the facts, but the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Barcia) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss) are both men of great integrity.  I know the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) is also very concerned about this, as is the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop) is also very concerned about this.  I personally have been pursuing this with Customs and with Mr. Kelly. I know that Mr. Kelly, the commissioner of Customs, is very concerned about this matter and shares the outrage of the gentleman from Michigan and the gentleman from Georgia about what apparently has occurred. They are in the process of trying to come to grips with this.  Unfortunately, the timing is not as good as it should have been; better to have met last week than next week, but my staff is pursuing a meeting, as the gentleman knows, and I hope the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss) knows, because we have been in touch with his staff, a meeting next week, with Customs and with the four gentlemen who have been so involved in this, along with myself, and hopefully either the chairman or a member of the chairman's staff so that we can continue to pursue this and get to the bottom of it.  The gentleman from Michigan and the gentleman from Georgia, the two gentlemen from Georgia, I suppose, and the gentleman from South Carolina are absolutely correct if individuals were treated in the manner that we believe they were. It was outrageous, unacceptable, and the citizens involved deserve compensation for their loss.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Michigan wanted to offer an amendment which set a specific dollar value for the loss.
