President, I urge Members of the Senate to oppose this amendment. We have debated gun safety back and forth and one side says we need more enforcement. The second-degree amendment before us provides no new ATF agents. If we are going to enforce the laws to find the 1,000 Federal gun dealers responsible for selling 57 percent of the guns traced in crime, we need more ATF agents. If we are going to stop interstate gunrunning, we need more ATF agents. This second-degree amendment provides no new ATF agents. If my colleagues say enforcement is the key to gun safety, they have to oppose this amendment and support the underlying amendment which provides new ATF investigators, as well as new prosecutors, across America. I hope my colleagues will oppose the second-degree amendment.
