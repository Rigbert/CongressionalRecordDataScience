Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that we are considering this legislation, H.R. 338, a bill to promote a 21st century energy and manufacturing workforce, introduced by my friend and great colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).  This bipartisan bill takes steps to help make training for energy manufacturing jobs available to women and minorities as well as veterans.  By way of background, the bill was unanimously approved by the House last Congress by a voice vote. It was also included in the energy bill conference negotiations. But, unfortunately, even though the bill received overwhelming support in both the House and the Senate, it didn't make it to the President's desk before time ran out.  The U.S. has undergone an energy renaissance, driven by newly discovered resources, technological innovation, and a skilled workforce. Millions and millions of new jobs had been created, and many more are opening up, but we have got to continue to invest in our workers in order to maintain global leadership and maximize the economic potential of our energy abundance.  This bill, H.R. 338, takes important steps in the right direction by requiring that the Department of Energy modernize and improve coordination among the numerous workforce development programs and activities that expand the Department's programs, offices, labs, and technology centers.  This bipartisan bill places an emphasis on maximizing the Department's existing resources and increasing the diversity of our energy and manufacturing workforce by increasing opportunities for women, minorities, and veterans.  It also improves reemployment opportunities for out-of-work and dislocated workers, which, for example, would provide welcome relief to workers discouraged by sharp downturns in the coal industry.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation before us today is a good government bill that is going to increase benefits for American workers. I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1630  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased we are considering this bill sponsored by my friend and colleague, the ranking member of the Energy Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Rush.  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush).
