Speaker, the points of order that the gentleman from Wisconsin has been raising have been pursuant to House rules, and we should not be waiving the rules relative to the germaneness of motions to recommit.  Should the gentleman from Mississippi offer more nongermane motions to recommit, then I think it is incumbent upon me, as the manager of the bill, to raise a point of order, should the rules of the House be violated by the motion to recommit, as they have been in the past.
