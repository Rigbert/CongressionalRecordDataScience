Chairman, the real story of this bill is that it is punishing those in the dawn of life, our children, and those in the twilight of life, our senior citizens.  In the case of the elderly, if this bill passes in its present form, our Nation better get out the ambulances. At a time when our aging population is growing so rapidly, this bill hits 16 key programs for the elderly that are a lifeline for our seniors. It eliminates programs like the elderly abuse program at a time when elderly abuse has gone up 94 percent over the last 5 years. These are seniors that are being physically abused. They are being exploited. They are in a position where they cannot defend themselves and, yet, this Congress eliminates that program.  The same is true of the long-term care ombudsman program, a program that provides an early warning signal to seniors that are being abused in long-term care.  Let us not do this. We have supported those programs in the past on a bipartisan basis. Let us keep them strong for our Nation's seniors.
