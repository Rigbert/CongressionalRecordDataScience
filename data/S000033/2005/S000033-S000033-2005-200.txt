 Speaker, I wish to extend congratulations to Bellows Free Academy of St. Albans, Vermont, on its 75th anniversary. Our democratic society depends for its very existence on an educated and informed population. In that respect, there is no task in our society more important than educating our youth. For three-quarters of a century, BFA has been doing just that for students in St. Albans and surrounding towns in Franklin County: educating area students academically and preparing them to fully participate in our American democracy.  So it is a particular pleasure for me to recognize the magnitude of this achievement: for 75 years Bellows Free Academy has taught the young citizens of St. Albans and its neighboring towns. Those seven and a half decades have seen the high school serve as a binding force in the community, bringing it together behind sports and drama and whole variety of activities. They have seen generation after generation of young people fully prepared by BFA for the challenges of the adult world, young people whom BFA has taught and trained so they can find satisfying work and take their place as active and concerned members of their communities.  Of course, any institution is really only a reflection of the dedication and commitment of all the people involved with it. So recognition of BFA's 75-year history is really a recognition of the administrators, teachers, and, of course, students--present and former--who themselves are a living testament to the important role that BFA has played and continues to play in the lives of so many since its founding.  At time of this celebration, let me offer the wish that many, many more decades of rich and productive accomplishment lay ahead for Bellows Free Academy, its students, its teachers and its support community.                          ____________________
