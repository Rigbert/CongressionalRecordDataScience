Can the majority leader tell me whether there is any merit to that speculation? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman informing me of rumors, but that is a rumor that I have not yet heard nor has anyone discussed such a thing. I would hope that the conference committee could go to work immediately and complete this as soon as possible. It is important.  The conference report, as it comes out, I am sure will have many reforms that need to be implemented to keep the American people and American families safer, and we want to get it out as quickly as possible.
