Speaker.  It is with deep sadness that I rise today to note the passing of our colleague and friend, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald, a dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents in California's 37th Congressional District and a devoted representative who cared deeply for those she served.  Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was someone who never allowed the conventions of her surroundings to define the role she would play. Because she understood that education would unlock her budding potential as a community leader, Juanita achieved something extraordinary by earning a bachelor's degree from Redlands University at the age of 40, and a master's degree from California State University at the age of 47.  Because she recognized her duty to give back just a little of what she had learned, Juanita made our children's future her life's work by teaching math and English in the Los Angeles Unified School District.  Because she could not sit idly by when she had much to offer, Juanita turned to public service in 1990, becoming the first African American woman to serve on the Carson city council, the first African American woman to chair two committees in the California State assembly, and the first African American woman to chair a full committee in the U.S. Congress.  And because she never let go of her abiding faith in the fact that our tomorrows can be better than our todays, Juanita will be remembered, remembered as a leader who inspired action, drove progress and labored diligently to improve the lives of people throughout our Nation.  Mr. Speaker, the advocates of equal rights for women and minorities have lost a powerful voice in the U.S. Congress, one that always sought to bring people together by elevating the bonds that unite us as Americans and as human beings. Children and the working poor have lost a compassionateally. Men and women seeking to participate in their own governance have lost a steadfast guardian of voting rights who fought to expand the reach of democracy, not only in spirit but in practice as well. And defenders of human rights have lost a champion of their cause who never missed an opportunity to remind the free world of its obligation to help alleviate suffering and restore fundamental human dignity to those who have gone without it for far too long, such as those suffering in Darfur. Juanita Millender-McDonald personified what it means to serve others before serving self.  Mr. Speaker, I want Juanita's husband, James, and her children and grandchildren to know that the thoughts and prayers of a grateful Nation are with them as they mourn their loss. We join them in their mourning but we also join them in their joy of a life well-lived.                          ____________________
