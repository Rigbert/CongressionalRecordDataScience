President, I raise the visibility of a little-known, but praiseworthy, program--the Nutrition Education and Training Program. I am speaking today in defense of this program, which now seems to be on life-support, and in dire need of resuscitation. For those who are not aware, the Nutrition Education and Training Program, NET, is a direct grant-to-States program which provides the nutrition education and food service training component of the Child Nutrition Programs. Under NET, all funds are distributed to the States. States and local governments leverage these limited resources into effective and innovative education and training programs for children, food service personnel, and parents. I know in my own State of Vermont, the creativity and innovation of the NET staff has provided unique and valuable nutrition materials that are relevant to thousands of Vermonters. Over the past 20 years, NET has promoted an infrastructure and quality standards that support local schools in providing nutritious meals and improving the health and nutrition behavior of our Nation's children. State and local NET coordinators have been responsible for much of the local success of the nutrition education effort.  NET programs are intended to teach children about the nutritional value of foods and the relationship between food and health. The program is also intended to provide nutrition education for teachers and training in nutrition and food service management for school food service personnel, and to facilitate development of classroom materials and curricula. This is done through a State Nutrition Education Coordinator who identifies the needs of the State--this is important--the program is not one size fits all, full of restrictions and mandates from Washington, but rather a cooperative program that is tailored to State needs.  Sadly, I am here today to report on the dire funding status of NET. In fiscal years 1997 and 1998, NET has struggled along at a level of only $3.75 million--this is a far cry from the original program in 1978-79 of $26.2 million--giving each State a level of 50 cents per child. The fiscal year 1999 House appropriations bill funds NET at only $3.75 million and the Senate bill provides nothing--putting all funds into Team Nutrition at $10 million. This low level of funding has diminished NET's effectiveness and threatens its viability to provide nutrition education to the nearly $9 billion Child Nutrition Programs it supports.  A few years ago, as Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I supported a change in the law to provide NET with a guaranteed $10 million per year to provide important Nutrition Education activities. This level is not a budget-busting amount, and is in fact the amount the President requested in the fiscal year 1999 budget for this program. Unfortunately, in the rush toward welfare reform in 1996, NET's status as a mandatory program was rescinded, and the funding levels for NET have been problematic ever since.  I urge when the Conference on the Agriculture appropriations bill convenes that NET be provided adequate funding. The Child Nutrition Programs are absolutely critical to our Nation's future. Along with those benefits, we must give our children the chance to choose the right foods, to select a diet suited for them based on the facts and not on the latest billion-dollar junk food advertising.
