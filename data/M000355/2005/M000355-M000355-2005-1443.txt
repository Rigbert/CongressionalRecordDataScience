 President, today, following a 1-hour period for morning business, we will resume consideration of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Yesterday, the Senate invoked cloture with a unanimous vote of 100 to 0. I hope that the vote is an indication that the Senate is prepared to finish this bill in short order. There are a number of pending germane amendments to the bill. We hope that not all of these will require votes; however, Senators should expect a busy day as we try to wrap up our business on this emergency funding bill. At this particular time, we do not have a set time for the first vote, and Senators will be notified when that vote is scheduled. Again, I would anticipate a late evening as we continue to try to complete our work on this bill.                          ____________________[Page S3959]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
