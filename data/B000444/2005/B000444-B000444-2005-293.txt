 President, the leader has much better access to the President than I do, but to the best of my knowledge there is no negotiation, has been no negotiation, no discussion, no comment whatsoever about changing the U.S. provision from 27 percent to 25 percent. I know of nothing. The State Department has never said anything to me. The Defense Department, the White House, Kofi Annan, nobody has raised this, except my friends on the conservative right in the Republican Party.  If we do not want to send a mixed signal, do not vote against the President. The President of the United States, not our conservative friends on the right side of the aisle, says 27 percent. Do not undercut the President and send a mixed signal.  I yield whatever time I have remaining, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
