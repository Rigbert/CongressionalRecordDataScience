 President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of S. 1166, the Food Quality Protection Act, introduced by Senator Lugar.  This legislation addresses three major issues: the need to ensure that tolerances of pesticides in food safeguard the health of infants and children; the need to encourage the registration of minor use pesticides; and the need to repeal the Delaney clause and replace it with a negligible risk standard for pesticide residues in both raw and processed foods.  The Delaney clause was enacted in 1958 as part of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit any residue of a food additive that has been found to cause cancer, no matter the amount of the risk to human health. In the intervening years, our ability to detect residues has improved, to the point where we can now detect minute amounts, even parts per trillion.  Many including the Environmental Protection Agency agree the Delaney clause zero risk standard should be replaced with a de minimis standard. In fact, for a number of years, EPA has used a de minimis standard for regulating pesticide residues on food.  However, as a result of the court decision in Les versus Reilly and a consent decree in California versus Browner, the Environmental Protection Agency will have to strictly enforce the Delaney clause the end of this year. Strict enforcement of the Delaney clause will result in the cancellation of tolerances of over 100 chemicals used in California agriculture, even if they pose only a negligible risk of one in a million additional risk of cancer in a lifetime. In order for agriculture to retain use of these chemicals, it is imperative that the Delaney clause be replaced with a negligible risk standards that protects human health, including the health of infants and children.  S. 1166 replaces the Delaney zero risk standard with a negligible risk standard. EPA has been defining negligible risk as one additional cancer for every one million people exposed.  The issue of food safety is extraordinarily important both to California agriculture and to the health of 32 million Californians. About 20 percent of the agricultural chemicals sold in the United States--about 500 billion pounds of chemicals--are used in the State annually. California has its own pesticide regulation program and in many cases has stricter standards for pesticides than the national standards.  A concern that I have about S. 1166 is that it provides for national uniformity and preempts California's more stringent standards. I believe that States should be able to set tougher standards, and will move an amendment to do so.  I will work to improve the bill as it goes forward, and to get a bill enacted. It is vital that we reform the Delaney clause this year.                          ____________________
