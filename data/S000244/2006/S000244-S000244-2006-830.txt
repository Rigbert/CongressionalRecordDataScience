 Mr. Speaker, the two speakers who proposed this brief 5-week extension of the PATRIOT Act are symptomatic of the problems that the opponents of the PATRIOT Act have attempted to tar it with. They are wrong.  First, no Federal court has declared unconstitutional as violative of civil rights any of the 16 provisions of the PATRIOT Act that the sunsets were applied to, none whatsoever.  As I stated in my opening remarks, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice is required by the PATRIOT Act to report on civil rights violations to the two Judiciary Committees twice per year. We have received six of those reports on time, and the number of civil rights violations that have been found by the DOJ Inspector General have been zero.  Furthermore, there is a provision in the PATRIOT Act that anybody whose civil rights have been violated can obtain a statutory judgment of $10,000 in addition to any proven monetary damages against the Justice Department if they are successful in a lawsuit. The Justice Department has not paid out one dime in either monetary or statutory damages under this law.  The PATRIOT Act has nothing to do with NSA wiretaps, and anybody who has been familiar with the operation of the PATRIOT Act knows very, very clearly that it does not have anything to do with NSA wiretaps, and I really wish that the opponents would read the law and stick to the proven testimony of the operation of this act. To say that the Judiciary Committee has not conducted oversight is living in a dream world, and it does not comport with the facts.  Mr. Conyers and I have sent joint oversight letters to the Justice Department and published the nonclassified results of those oversight letters on the committee's website. Last year we had 12 hearings on the PATRIOT Act and the 16 provisions that expire. And guess what? There was no criticism about 14 of the 16 provisions, which the conference report makes permanent. And to say that the 16 provisions that were passed in the PATRIOT Act in October of 2001 were so egregious that sunsets had to be applied really does not talk about what happened then. Every expansion of law enforcement authority contained in the 2001 bill contained a sunset, and we did the oversight, and we found that in 14 of the 16 provisions there was not a problem. And even the witnesses the Democrats brought before the Judiciary Committee said that there was no problem in 14 of the 16 provisions. In the two provisions where there is a sunset in the conference report, there have not been any civil rights violations proven. I have just said that, but one would think that the people's rights were being trampled on. No courts found that, the DOJ Inspector General has not found that, and I really wish that people who do not like the PATRIOT Act would stick to the facts.  Now I would like to talk a little bit about what good the PATRIOT Act has done, and I am going to give credit to Deroy Murdock, who is a New York-based columnist with the Scripps Howard News Service and a senior fellow with the Atlas Economic Research Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. It says: ``Let the Numbers do the Talking.''  First, the total number of individuals who Islamic fanatics murdered on September 11, 2001: 2,977 people whose civil rights were snuffed out because they were murdered;  The cash sum that PATRIOT Act section 371 let Customs agents seize when terror-tied New Jersey imam Alaa al-Sadawi tried to smuggle funds into Egypt in his father's airline luggage: $659,000;  Pounds of heroin the three al Qaeda- and Taliban-linked San Diego weapons dealers offered undercover FBI agents as partial payment for four Stinger anti-aircraft missiles until PATRIOT Act sections 218 and 504 helped authorities unravel their conspiracy: 1,320 pounds of heroin;  Total terror-related defendants captured with the help of PATRIOT Act provisions: 401;  Total terror-related defendants who have pled guilty or who have been convicted with the aid of PATRIOT Act provisions: 212;  Total feet the Brooklyn Bridge would have plunged into the New York City's East River had the PATRIOT Act not helped authorities stop Iyman Faris'splan to sever the span's cables with acetylene torches: 119. That is New York City.  According to Federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein's January 3 comments after meeting with President Bush, the number of U.S. attorneys who use ``the PATRIOT Act tools each and every day in his or her efforts'': 93, out of 93 U.S. attorneys;  As U.S. Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf notes, total years of prison time earned under the PATRIOT Act by Osama bin Laden's self-proclaimed spiritual adviser, Mohammed al-Moayad, for trying to funnel $20 million to al Qaeda and Hamas: 75;  Number of scholars, former Cabinet members, and other prominent Americans, including Democratic ex-CIA Directors James Woolsey and James Schlesinger, who joined in signing a January 25 open letter advocating the PATRIOT Act's reauthorization: 68;  Years that David Wayne Hull, former Imperial Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, will spend behind bars after PATRIOT Act section 201 helped convict him for plotting to blow up abortion clinics with hand grenades: 12;  Number of Northern Virginia Islamofascists jailed after the PATRIOT Act's information-sharing provisions let spies and cops jointly determine that they had trained in Afghan and Pakistani terror camps between 1999 and 2001: Eight;  Total al Qaeda associates in Lackawanna, New York who were jailed for 7 to 10 years after the PATRIOT Act finally let cops and intelligence officers sit in the same room to discuss each other's investigations: Six;  According to the Associated Press, the number of tickets for American Airlines Flight 77 that Pentagon-bound 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi purchased online, using William Patterson University's library computers, that might have been detected had PATRIOT Act section 215 been in place: Two;  The number of the Portland Seven extremists who escaped the PATRIOT Act by being killed by Pakistani troops on October 3, 2003: One.                              {time}  1630  The number of individuals whom Muslim terrorists have killed on American soil since the adoption of the PATRIOT Act: zero.  Mr. Speaker, this law is working. This law has not violated anybody's civil liberty rights. It has not been held unconstitutional by any Federal court in the country. All of the arguments against the PATRIOT Act are a red herring. It has kept us safer. We ought to continue it. We ought to vote for this bill.
