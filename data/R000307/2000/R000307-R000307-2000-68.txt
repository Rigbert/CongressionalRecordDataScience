Have they ever been depressed? Have they ever had trouble sleeping? Have they ever attempted suicide? In some cases, that might be necessary, but do we really think we need a nurse to bother a physical therapy patient for this information so that he or she can send the answers over computer to someplace in Baltimore--hopefully Kansas City, but probably in Baltimore?  Does the Senator from Maine have any idea how patients have reacted to this survey? Talk about emotional distress, if somebody were to ask me in a hospital what I felt or how would I feel, do I feel depressed, I think they would learn pretty doggone quick.
