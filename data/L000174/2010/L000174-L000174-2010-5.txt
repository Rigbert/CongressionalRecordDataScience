President, I have heard complaints over the past few days about why we in the Senate are still working so close to the Christmas holiday. All of us would rather be home with our families, but of course we were sent here to serve the American people. We were sent here to the Senate to do the work of the American people, and we have been trying to complete our work for the past several weeks. One remaining issue demands our attention: taking care of the Americans who responded to the terrorist attacks on September 11th. We cannot turn our backs on these injured and ailing first responders. This is a defining issue of our American values--how we serve those who have sacrificed for our Nation.  Almost a decade ago, in the aftermath of attack, I visited the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, NY.
