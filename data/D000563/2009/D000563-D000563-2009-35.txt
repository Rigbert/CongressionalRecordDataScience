President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Congressional Record an article written by Victoria Reggie Kennedy, which will be published tomorrow in the Washington Post Sunday edition. It is entitled, ``The moment Ted Kennedy would not want to lose.''  There are many things said here which we can expect, but the one paragraph I wish to read into the Record is as follows, from the wife of Senator Ted Kennedy:       Still, Ted knew that accomplishing reform would be      difficult. If it were easy, he told me, it would have been      done a long time ago. He predicted that as the Senate got      closer to a vote, compromises would be necessary, coalitions      would falter and many ardent supporters of reform would want      to walk away. He hoped that they wouldn't do so. He knew from      experience, he told me, that this kind of opportunity to      enact health care reform wouldn't arise again for a      generation.  This bill has been called many things. It is officially titled the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.'' I am going to refer to it as ``Kennedy Care'' because Ted Kennedy, throughout his public career, cared deeply about this health care issue.  Our time is here, and in his name and in his memory, we need to pass this historic legislation.  I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             The Moment Ted Kennedy Would Not Want To Lose                      (By Victoria Reggie Kennedy)       The Washington Post--Sunday, December 20, 2009; A19--My      late husband, Ted Kennedy, was passionate about health-care      reform. It was the cause of his life. He believed that health      care for all our citizens was a fundamental right, not a      privilege, and that this year the stars--and competing      interests--were finally aligned to allow our nation to move      forward with fundamental reform. He believed that health-care      reform was essential to the financial stability of our      nation's working families and of our economy as a whole.       Still, Ted knew that accomplishing reform would be      difficult. If it were easy, he told me, it would have been      done a long time ago. He predicted that as the Senate got      closer to a vote, compromises would be necessary, coalitions      would falter and many ardent supporters of reform would want      to walk away. He hoped that they wouldn't do so. He knew from      experience, he told me, that this kind of opportunity to      enact health-care reform wouldn't arise again for a      generation.       In the early 1970s, Ted worked with the Nixon      administration to find consensus on health-care reform. Those      efforts broke down in part because the compromise wasn't      ideologically pure enough for some constituency groups. More      than 20 years passed before there was another real      opportunity for reform, years during which human suffering      only increased. Even with the committed leadership of then-     President Bill Clinton and his wife, reform was thwarted in      the 1990s. As Ted wrote in his memoir, he was deeply      disappointed that the Clinton health-care bill did not come      to a vote in the full Senate. He believed that senators      should have gone on the record, up or down.       Ted often said that we can't let the perfect be the enemy      of the good. He also said that it was better to get half a      loaf than no loaf at all, especially with so many lives at      stake. That's why, even as he never stopped fighting for      comprehensive health-care reform, he also championed      incremental but effective reforms such as a Patients' Bill of      Rights, the Children's Health Insurance Program and COBRA      continuation of health coverage.       The bill before the Senate, while imperfect, would achieve      many of the goals Ted fought for during the 40 years he      championed access to quality, affordable health care for all      Americans. If this bill passes:       Insurance protections like the ones Ted fought for his      entire life would become law.       Thirty million Americans who do not have coverage would      finally be able to afford it. Ninety-four percent of      Americans would be insured. Americans would finally be able      to live without fear that a single illness could send them      into financial ruin.       Insurance companies would no longer be able to deny people      the coverage they need because of a preexisting illness or      condition. They would not be able to drop coverage when      people get sick. And there would be a limit on how much they      can force Americans to pay out of their own pockets when they      do get sick.       Small-business owners would no longer have to fear being      forced to lay off workers or shut their doors because of      exorbitant insurance rates. Medicare would be strengthened      for the millions of seniors who count on it.       And by eliminating waste and inefficiency in our health-     care system, this bill would bring down the deficit over      time.       Health care would finally be a right, and not a privilege,      for the citizens of this country. While my husband believed      in a robust public option as an effective way to lower costs      and increase competition, he also believed in not losing      sight of the forest for the trees. As long as he wasn't      compromising his principles or values, he looked for a way      forward.       As President Obama noted to Congress this fall, for Ted,      health-care reform was not a     matter of ideology or politics. It was not about left or      right, Democrat or Republican. It was a passion born from the      experience of his own life, the experience of our family and      the experiences of the millions of Americans across this      country who considered him their senator, too.       The bill before Congress will finally deliver on the urgent      needs of all Americans. It would make their lives better and      do so much good for this country. That, in the end, must be      the test of reform. That was always the test for Ted Kennedy.      He's not here to urge us not to let this chance slip through      our fingers. So I humbly ask his colleagues to finish the      work of his life, the work of generations, to allow the vote      to go forward and to pass health-care reform now. As Ted      always said, when it's finally done, the people will wonder      what took so long.
