 Hazel Wolf, of Seattle, Washington, who passed away at the age of 101 on Wednesday, January 19, 2000. A tireless advocate for conservation and social justice, Ms. Wolf was an outstanding example for all Americans. She combined humor with persistence as she set about combating injustice. She will continue to live in the hearts and minds of the many who knew her. And there are many, for Hazel had the remarkable ability to engage just about anyone, from Senator to second grader.  Hazel Wolf was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on March 10, 1898. In 1923, she moved to the United States with her daughter, Nydia. She was a union organizer for the Works Progress Administration and avidly followed politics, eventually becoming a Democrat. Until 1965, she worked as a legal secretary for the Seattle civil rights lawyer John Caughlan. It wasn't until her retirement that she became such an involved environmental activist and leader.  Ms. Wolf began working with the Audubon Society in the early-1960s and helped start 21 of the 26 Audubon Society chapters in Washington State. In 1979, she worked to organize the first statewide conference to bring together environmentalists and Native American tribes, the Indian Conservationist Conference. She served as Secretary of the Seattle Audubon Society chapter for three decades, and for 17 years she edited an environmental newsletter, `Outdoors West'. In 1990, her discussions with a Soviet delegation led to the creation of the Leningrad Audubon Society in Russia. Ms. Wolf was also a founder of Seattle's Community Coalition for Environmental Justice, which works to improve environmental safety in poor city neighborhoods. She also belonged to the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and the Earth Island Institute. Ms. Wolf was a frequent and favorite speaker at schools and environmental conferences throughout the Northwest.  In 1997, the National Audubon Society awarded her the prestigious Audubon Medal, for Excellence in Environmental Achievement. She received numerous other awards, including the State of Washington Environmental Excellence Award, the National Audubon Society's Conservationist of the Year Award and the Washington State Legislature Award for environmental work. To celebrate her 100th birthday in 1998, the Seattle Audubon chapter created the Hazel Wolf ``Kids for the Environment'' endowment, which will fund programs to provide urban children from lower-income communities with opportunities to experience the natural world. In Issaquah, Washington, there is a 116-acre wetland named after her. On the other side of the Cascade Mountains near Yakima, a bird sanctuary bears her name.  Hazel Wolf served as the environmental conscience of the Northwest, with her dedication to protecting forests, saving salmon, educating young people and preserving the outdoors for future generations to enjoy. The most significant and important tribute we can give to Hazel Wolf is to continue the work which she pursued with such vision and passion. We will miss you Hazel, but rest assured, we will continue the work you started.                          ____________________
