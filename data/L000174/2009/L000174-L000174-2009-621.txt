I note he passed after a lengthy time. He has been waiting much longer than the past three Attorneys General did, from the time he was announced to the time he got out of the committee. He passed the committee by 17 to 2 today.  I had understood and actually told Mr. Holder and others, based on my conversation with the distinguished leader, that we would go to Mr. Holder tomorrow once this bill was finished.
