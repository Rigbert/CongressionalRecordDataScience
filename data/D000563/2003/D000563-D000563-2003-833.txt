Note that it says:       Upon a finding by the court the respondent in an action      commenced under subsection (a) has knowingly violated a      provision of this chapter, the court shall notify . . .  And it goes on to say medical license at stake, fine at stake.  Now, if you will turn back to read section (a) you will find 1531, section (a) includes viability of fetus.  So if a doctor has misrepresented--for example, if there is medical evidence the fetus was viable and the doctor went ahead and performed an abortion, arguing, ``Well, it wasn't viable,'' and in so doing has misrepresented the medical facts, he can have his license revoked and face the penalty. That iswhat it says, section (a). It doesn't go down to subsection (1) and (2); it says subsection (a), which includes viability of the fetus.  What we are driving at is this, I would say to the Senator from Pennsylvania. Under this language I don't think I am going to get endorsed by any medical group that is going to stand up and say what a great amendment, Senator Durbin, because it puts an extraordinary burden on doctors who want to be involved in these abortions. But I think that burden is merited when we are dealing with these particular circumstances.
