President, we all recognize that a postsecondary education is required for most family-sustaining, middle-class jobs, and that an educated workforce is essential to a modern, productive economy. A report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that college-level intensive business services have replaced manufacturing as the largest sector in the U.S. economy, and that while college-educated workers make up only 32 percent of the workforce, they now produce more than 50 percent of the Nation's economic output, up from 13 percent in 1967. A college degree also pays off, with one recent analysis estimating that the typical college graduate will earn $900,000 more of their lifetime than the typical high school graduate.  Yet just as there is growing recognition that postsecondary education is indispensable in the modern economy, families are being required to shoulder growing debt burdens that threaten access to college and their financial health. According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve, student loan debt per capita doubled between 2005 and 2014, rising from $5,000 to $10,000. This is a growing drag on our economy. As student loan debt has grown, young adults have put off buying homes or cars, starting a family, saving for retirement, or launching new businesses. They have literally mortgaged their economic future.  We know that student loan borrowers are struggling. The Secretary of Education just testified before the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee that 43 percent of the student loans in the nearly $1.5 trillion Federal student loan portfolio are in default, more than 30 days delinquent, or negatively amortized. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that the balance of defaulted loans now exceeds $120 billion. More than 8 million borrowers currently have a loan in default.  Default is catastrophic for student loan borrowers. Only in rare instances can the debt be discharged in bankruptcy. The Federal government has the power to withhold tax refunds, garnish wages, and even garnish Social Security benefits to collect defaulted student loans.  We have seen the costs to students and taxpayers when institutions are not held accountable. Corinthian Colleges and ITT are two examples of institutions that failed their students while benefitting from Federal student aid. Their fraudulent business practices eventually led to their demise, but not before leaving their students and taxpayers on the hook for millions of dollars in student loan debt. More recently, we have seen the closure of Argosy University, South University, and the Art Institutes, all operated by the Dream Center, leave roughly 26,000 students in the lurch.  We cannot wait until an institution is catastrophically failing its students before taking action. Institutions need greater financial incentives to act before default rates rise. Simply put, we cannot tackle the student loan debt crisis without States and institutions stepping up and taking greater responsibility for college costs and student borrowing.  That is why I am pleased to reintroduce the Protect Student Borrowers Act with Senators Durbin, Warren, and Murphy. Our legislation seeks to ensure there is more skin in the game when it comes to student loan debt by setting stronger market incentives for colleges and universities to provide better and more affordable education to students, which should in turn help put the brakes on rising student loan defaults.  The Protect Student Borrowers Act would hold colleges and universities accountable for student loan defaults by requiring them to repay a percentage of defaulted loans. Only institutions that have one-third or more of their students borrow would be included in the bill's risk-sharing requirements based on their cohort default rate. Risk-sharing requirements would kick in when the default rate exceeds 15 percent. As the institution's default rate rises, so too will the institution's risk-share payment.  The Protect Student Borrowers Act also provides incentives for institutions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt burdens and reduce default rates. Colleges and universities can reduce or eliminate their payments if they implement a comprehensive student loan management plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce the payments for institutions whose mission is to serve low-income and minority students, such as community colleges, Historically Black Institutions, or Hispanic-Serving Institutions--if they are making progress in their student loan management plans.  The risk-sharing payments would be invested in helping struggling borrowers, preventing future default and delinquency, and increasing Pell Grants at institutions that enroll a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients and have low default rates.  With the stakes so high for students and taxpayers, it is only fair that institutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program.  We need to tackle student loan debt and college affordability from multiple angles. All stakeholders in the system must do their part. With the Protect Student Borrowers Act, we are providing the incentives and resources forinstitutions to take more responsibility to address college affordability and student loan debt and improve student outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and look forward to working with them to include it and other key reforms in the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.                                 ______                                       By
