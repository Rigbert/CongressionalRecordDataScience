 A guy walks into the bar and says, ``What are they so happy about?'' Another guy says, ``Oh, they just put together a jigsaw puzzle, and they did it in 3 hours.'' The guy walks up to them and says, ``Congratulations, but why is that so special?'' They showed him the box, which said ``2 to 4 years.'' At any rate, it will take a while for that to sink in. A little bit of levity in the chemical weapons treaty is worth the effort.  The junior Senator from Arizona complimented me on the limited success that we have achieved here. I thank him for that. Now I am going to yield to a man of unlimited capacity to prove to everyone that there is no limit to the success we are about to achieve in this treaty.  I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, my good friend, John McCain.
