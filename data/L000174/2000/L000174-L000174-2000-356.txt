President, I say to my friend from West Virginia, I have already been on this floor speaking for a couple days. I took a moment to go back to the office. But I was watching the Senator on the monitor, and I just wanted to come over and listen to him in person. I have no intention of wanting to ask him to yield the floor. I appreciate the courtesy he has offered.
