President, I rise today in strong support of the confirmation of Senator Hillary Clinton to be our next Secretary of State. Last Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee overwhelmingly approved Senator Clinton to become our Nation's top diplomat. I rise today to echo the committee's approval and to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of her confirmation.  Senator Clinton's many years of public service make her an outstanding nominee for Secretary of State. In her confirmation hearing, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, spoke of Senator Clinton as ``the epitome of a big leaguer,'' who has remarkable qualifications for the post of Secretary of State.
