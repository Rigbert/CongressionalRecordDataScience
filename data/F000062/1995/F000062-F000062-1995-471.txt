 President, I thought it might be in order to give a very brief status report on the condition of the flooding in the State of California. It is a strange and altogether tragic irony that just about 1 year ago southern California was hit by wildfire and then the shattering Northridge earthquake. The 1-year anniversary of the Northridge earthquake will be this coming Tuesday, January 17.  As we evaluate the recovery and expenditure of nearly $11 billion of Federal funding that has been committed to disaster relief in that earthquake, record levels of rain are falling in California and have been since late last week, flooding rivers, washing out roads, causing mud slides, knocking out electricity and water supplies, and affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the State.  So I rise today, Mr. President, to give a brief status report on that record rainfall and flooding.  To begin with, I have been in contact with FEMA Director James Lee Witt, who is currently in California, and my State staff is on alert to provide whatever assistance they can. In addition, Transportation Secretary Pena, Housing Secretary Cisneros, and Federal Highway Administrator Slater are on a 1 o'clock flight today to California to assess what additional Federal assistance will be necessary in the days and weeks ahead.  Although the spirit in my State may be temporarily dampened, I am really confident that Californians will once again show the resilience and the determination that we have shown in the past and that we will overcome this disaster as we have the others. Californians have come together in times of disaster, and we will do so once again.  Last night, at about 11:30 p.m. eastern time, less than an hour after a request from Gov. Pete Wilson, President Clinton declared a Federal disaster for 24 of California's 58 counties. I thank the President on behalf of California for quickly declaring this emergency so individual disaster assistance funds could begin flowing.  FEMA started taking calls for disaster assistance as early as this morn- ing. For those that might be watching C-SPAN, FEMA encourages all disaster victims to call this number, 1-800-462-9029, for information and to register for Federal assistance.  Preliminary estimates of the damage are as follows: At least six people are dead; over 1 million have been affected by power outages up and down the State. Very preliminary damage estimates exceed $50 million as of now. This will undoubtedly rise as the waters recede and a full assessment of damages is made. Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes.  According to news reports, California has been hit with 6 months' worth of rain in 10 days. Last night I talked with Dr. Joe Friday, the Director of the National Weather Service, and he stated to me that although there is a brief respite today, heavy rains are apt to continue through the weekend. More than 50 major highways and freeways and hundreds of roads are closed due to flooding. In one 7-hour period yesterday, the California highway patrol logged 530 accident calls. That is more than five times the normal level, and by early afternoon had dealt with almost 500 disabled vehicles just in southern California alone.  What is clear is that in many areas of the State near-record levels of rain have fallen with devastating consequences. Let me describe some examples of just what the State is facing. In the Russian River area of northern California, the entire business district and hundreds of homes in the community of Guerneville in Sonoma County have been underwater for the last few days. The Russian River has swelled to record flood levels. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Monday's water flow in the Russian River was the highest ever recorded. The word from California this morning is that the river has begun to recede back to normal levels. However, Sonoma County has been without water, and the State is bringing water in. Everybody is being urged to boil their water.  All 2,800 residents of Hamilton City in Glenn County were evacuated as the Sacramento River rose 3 feet above flood stage. People literally are kayaking down the main business street, State Street, in downtown Santa Barbara.  Many of the communities still recovering from last year's earthquake and severe wildfires have been particularly hard hit, such as Malibu and many of the canyons in southern California. Everything that was a river or a creek yesterday is a flood basin today. The Pacific Coast Highway from Malibu to Santa Barbara has been closed due to mud slides.  Pepperdine University and local businesses in the Malibu canyon are closed due to flooding. The Pepperdine campus was used for helicopter evacuations of residents in the surrounding canyon.  Fortunately, but not for lack of practice, the local, State, and Federal responses are timely and effective. The State Office of Emergency Services under the direction of Richard Andrews quickly established a state operations center to coordinate State assistance. The California National Guard has activated 75 trucks, helicopters, boats, and 300 personnel, conducting rescue and evacuation operations in seven counties.  FEMA Director James Lee Witt, already in California, is remaining in the State to coordinate the Federal disaster response. FEMA damage assessment teams have been on the ground since the weekend, though much of this work is impossible until the water finally recedes after the final rainfall. We do not know when that will be. FEMA has been requested by the State not to establish disaster assistance centers. All financial assistance to people will be done by teleregistration, through the number that I gave earlier. I would like to repeat it once again. Anyone who is a victim of the flood and wishes either information or assistance should call 1-800-462-9029. The  [[Page S761]] system is in place right now and will be taking calls for as long as necessary. Personnel have been deployed from FEMA's Infrastructure, Individual Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Programs to California to begin work with State and local officials.  As I mentioned, Secretaries Cisneros and Pena are on their way now to California to decide what additional assistance might be warranted. I will work closely with my colleague, Senator Boxer; my colleagues in the House; and you, Mr. President, and others in the Senate. Over 30 congressional districts in California have been affected by this disaster, and we, together, will make sure that Federal response is swift, effective, and complete.  My heart goes out to the families that have members who have perished in this, our latest disaster, and to the many thousands of people that have been affected by the rising waters. My message to them is that FEMA will be there until we can get people back in their homes, businesses back on their feet, and lives back in order.  I thank you very much, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                            ____________________
