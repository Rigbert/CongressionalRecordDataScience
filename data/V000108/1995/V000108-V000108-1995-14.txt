Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Durbin-Hansen-Smith amendment.  I would like to address three sets of people here: children, farmers, and tobacco companies.  The gentleman from Utah [Mr. Hansen] in his remarks earlier said that smoking among eighth graders has increased 30 percent in the last 3 years. As the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] asked rhetorically several years ago, would any of you be happy if your eighth grader came home tomorrow and said, dad, mom, I started smoking today? Would you be happy if that happened?  We talked about a lot of farmers here today. We ought to talk about a lot of kids and the $6 billion that the tobacco companies spend every year on promotion and advertising to get these kids addicted.  Second, I represent a district that lost 38,000 jobs, count them, between 1977 and 1987, and I am very sympathetic with the problem that the tobacco farmers are having. But I find it very interesting that the tobacco companies do not care. If they care, we, 2 years ago, would not have had to enact a limitation on imported tobacco coming into this country because so much of the tobacco that the companies use was from other countries, not from those poor farmers who are losing their jobs who they trot out in front of them to take that first volley of fire, because they have no place to hide.  Finally, the issue of saving $23 million, that is still a lot of money from where I come from, and if you want to protect those farmers, if you want to give them insurance, let the tobacco companies take some of their $6 billion in profits and spend $23 billion to help those farmers insure their tobacco so they can continue to grow it in safety.
