President, I want to use this opportunity to recognize the extraordinary contribution of a dear friend of mine, Dr. Henry Jarecki, who is the founding chairman of the Institute of International Education's Scholar Rescue Fund.  This year is the fund's 10th anniversary, and on September 18, 2012, Dr. Jarecki will be honored with the Institute of International Education's Humanitarian Award--along with Scholar Rescue's other founders, Tom Russo, Henry Kaufman and George Soros--for his commitment to protecting endangered scholars around the world.  The Scholar Rescue Fund provides safe havens to scholars whose lives are threatened, often for no other reason than their intellectual pursuits, allowing them to continue their academic work. No other global fund of this kind exists. Since 2002, with congressional support, the Scholar Rescue Fund has enabled 469 threatened scholars from 48 countries to resettle in places where they have safely pursued their professional studies and research, preserving the intellectual capacity of a country during conflict or crisis.  Over 40 percent of these scholars have returned to their home countries. For example, as reports emerged of assassinations of Iraqi scholars, the Scholar Rescue Fund identified those in danger and provided stipends so they could resettle and continue teaching and writing in Jordan and other neighboring countries. Many have since returned to leadership positions at Iraqi universities as that country rebuilds its institutions of higher education.  While many have supported the Scholar Rescue Fund, Dr. Henry Jarecki stands out. Drawing on his own experiences as a child whose family fled Nazi Germany, Dr. Jarecki has generously devoted his energy, resources, and time to the fund. He has been a passionate voice for responding to the dangers confronting scholars in Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and now Syria.  He has guided staff and inspired fellow board members, always striving to do more on behalf of persecuted academics. He has been a source of support and hope to threatened scholars everywhere. Dr. Jarecki's own words explain his motivation best: ``Most of all, I thank and admire our scholars, who have gone through hell to educate us.''  I am proud to have been his friend for decades, and I know his deep commitment. It is with great respect, gratitude, and admiration that, on the occasion of the Scholar Rescue Fund's 10th anniversary, we recognize and commend Dr. Henry Jarecki's work to protect scholars worldwide. Because of his efforts the fund will continue into the future, saving the lives, work, and voices of threatened academics and reminding us all of the importance of intellectual freedom.                          ____________________
