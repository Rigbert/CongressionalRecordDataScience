Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I want to commend her for her terrific efforts in subcommittee and in full committee, and now on the floor, to get appropriate attention to the important question of food safety in our country. It really is staggering to think that 76 million Americans every year have some type of food-borne illness.                              {time}  1600  As modern a society as we are, we question, why does this happen? Part of the reason for it is because our food system, in many ways, is moving very far away from home.  It used to be that you knew the farmer where your eggs came from. You knew the farmer who grew your strawberries. There was local accountability. You knew where your chickens came from. You knew where your beef for your sausage came from, because the people lived in your community and you went to the stores and the outlets that they operated.  Mr. Chairman, today we live in a very industrialized food system, and industrialized food processing has not necessarily brought with it a safer food system. In fact, last year, 315 Food and Drug Administration regulated food products were recalled, the most recalls in 1 year since the mid-1980s.  It was a 36 percent increase above the average, and part of the reason for that is, even though we have certain scientific methods in place, the way in which our food is processed actually encourages food-borne illness.  For example, in the area of beef, if you go into some of our slaughter houses and meat-packing plants now, which are very, very mechanized, often, an intestine will be pierced and E. coli will be driven into flesh in the animal that is ultimately then cut up and sold on the supermarket shelf.  Mr. Chairman, some of that is not detected by the human eye. Industrial slaughtering is different than when animals were cut by hand and there were not so many animals slaughtered per day and there was closer oversight.  It has never been easy to work in a meat processing facility. At the beginning of the 20th century, books were written about what was going on inside these meat-packing plants, and through the 20th century, we tried to improve the situation.  In poultry, for example, if you look at the USDA inspectors who are on a line, the rate at which birds move by them has become so fast, the human eye cannot necessarily detect the different types of salmonella and pfiesteria and other bacterial microbes that can infect the meat product.  In spite of the fact that we seem to be so modern, some of the very procedures that we have as well as the fact that food is grown and processed very far from home has made the system in some ways extremely vulnerable.  It is surprising to us also that in a country as bountiful as ours that we have increasing amounts of food imports.  Over the last 4 years alone, imported foods sold in the United States have increased by 50 percent, from 2.7 million items in 1997 to 4.1 million last year alone. But of all the foreign imports coming in here, as the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) has accurately described, only 1 percent are inspected.  When most people get sick from food poisoning, they do not report it to the Centers for Disease Control. A lot of times they do not really realize what is wrong with them until a couple of days later. At the local level, there is not an automatic reporting upstream to the CDC. So a lot of the food poisoninggoes unreported. The DeLauro amendment would provide additional funds for food inspection.  There is $98 million more for imported food inspection, which we so desperately need at our borders; $73 million for more FDA inspections of domestic food processors. Many processors do not even get inspected once a year; sometimes it takes up to 2 years.  The FDA actually is the agency where 75 percent of the problem is, 75 percent of the outbreaks and problems relate to FDA-inspected facilities. This means inspection is inadequate.  The DeLauro amendment also would provide $50 million for USDA food safety and inspection service to carry out new procedures and regulations for meat and poultry food products. For example, USDA is currently addressing port of entry procedures and the development of contingency plans for emergency breakouts. Remember, we had that problem of strawberries in Michigan causing children to become so ill. To this day, we were never actually able to track back where the problem with those strawberries came from. We knew they were processed in southern California. Their origin was Mexico, but we just could not track it back.  So I think the DeLauro amendment is more than worthy; it is essential. She has my full support on this. I hope she has the attention of the membership. Let us get this DeLauro amendment incorporated in the final bill that we bring back from the other body.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this is simply an effort to try to build the infrastructure of the agencies that we charge with protecting our food, our food supply, which is ultimately about the food, but it is about the safety of every man, women and child in this country. That is all that we are asking about here.  Given the statistics, which are staggering, 5,000 deaths, 73 million people ill, 325,000 people hospitalized, it is unconscionable that we do not recognize this as a crisis and as an emergency.  We cannot allow this to continue. We can do something about it.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
