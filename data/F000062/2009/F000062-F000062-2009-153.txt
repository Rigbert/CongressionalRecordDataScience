 President, I thank my colleague, the ranking member, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, for his comments. I agree with him.  The floor is open. We are going back and forth using the time, but I don't want Members to believe that if they come to the floor to offer an amendment, we will not promptly hear their amendment. The floor is open. So, please, if you have an amendment, come to the floor. The filing deadline is in 36 minutes. Hopefully, we will know what we are facing in about 36 minutes. We would like to move this bill and move on to Defense appropriations.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
