  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is indeed focused on jobs. In fact, their H.R. 1 would kill 700,000 jobs under the guise of fiscal responsibility. They'd cut transportation investments. They'd cut investments in education, student loans, and grants. They'd cut the COPS program, keeping our citizens safe with additional police on the street. They'd cut back on nutrition assistance to women, infants, and children.  What's not on the table? Well, corporate welfare. Six billion dollars inethanol subsidies--don't want to touch that. Twelve billion dollars in agriculture subsidies for corporate farms--can't touch that. Tax loopholes for Big Oil while they're gouging us at the pump and not paying taxes in the United States of America--can't put that on the table.  But the Republicans have shown us their priorities, and even their friends in the Senate yesterday refused to take up their bill.  And that's the way it is.                          ____________________
