 Speaker, I rise today to discuss the issue of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity as it relates to both our civilian population and our Gulf War veterans. I continue the submission for the Record the latest ``Recognition of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity'' newsletter which lists the U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, U.S. federal and state courts, U.S. workers' compensation boards, and independent organizations that have adopted policies, made statements, and/or published documents recognizing Multiple Chemical Sensitivity disorders for the benefit of my colleagues.            U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development       In a letter from HUD Assistant Secretary Timothy Coyle to      Senator Frank Lautenberg, confirming HUD recognition of ``MCS      as a disability entitling those with chemical sensitivities      to reasonable accommodation under Section 504 of the      Rehabilitation Act of 1973'' and also ``under Title VIII of      the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988'' [26 October 1990, 2      pages, R-13]. This was followed by a formal guidance      memorandum from HUD Deputy General Counsel G.L. Weidenfeller      to all regional counsel, detailing HUD's position that MCS      and environmental illness ``can be handicaps'' within the      meaning of section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act and its      implementing regulations [1992, 20 pages, R-14]. Also      recognized in a HUD Section 811 grant of $837,000 to develop      an EI/MCS-accessible housing complex known as ``Ecology      House'' in San Rafael, CA, consisting of eleven one-bedroom      apartments in a two-story complex. This grant was pledged in      1991 and paid in 1993. [2 pages, R-15] (See also Recognition      of MCS by Federal Courts, Fair Housing Act, below.)         U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service       In response to a disability rights complaint filed against      the Baltimore County Parks and Recreation Department (BCPRD)      by Marian Arminger on behalf of her three children, which the      National Park Service (NPS) accepted for review pursuant to      both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of      the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Acting Equal      Opportunity Program Manager of the NPS ruled that ``the BCPRD      must accept the determination of disability by the Baltimore      County Public Schools [BCPS, see US Department of Education,      above] regarding the children and their disability of MCSS      [MCS Syndrome]. This will eliminate possible retaliation with      a different conclusion by the same public entity.'' [Case      #P4217(2652), 1996, 4 pages, R-102]. The NPS further ruled      that ``With the determination that these children are      individuals with a disability (MCSS), it is necessary to make      reasonable modifications to program facilities. It appears      that discontinuing, temporarily or permanently, the use of      outside or inside pesticide application and toxic cleaning      chemicals is the basic reasonable modification necessary in      this case. . . . Therefore we believe that steps should be      taken by the BCPRD to provide the necessary communication      with other affected agencies such as the BCPS and develop, in      consultation with the parents and others deemed appropriate,      a plan for the reasonable modification of the program      environment for these children.''                       U.S. Department of Justice       In its enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act      of 1990, under the terms of which MCS may be considered as a      disability on a case-by-case basis, depending--as with most      other medical conditions--on whether the impairment      substantially limits one or more major life activities. The      Office of the Attorney General specifically cites      ``environmental illness (also known as multiple chemical      sensitivity)'' in its Final Rules on ``Non-Discrimination on      the Basis of Disability in State and Local Government      Services'' (28CFR35) and ``Non-Discrimination on the Basis of      Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial      Facilities'' (28CFR36), as published in the Federal Register,      Vol. 56, No. 144, pages 35699 and 35549 respectively [26 July      1991, 2 pages, R-16]. ``Environmental illness,'' also is      discussed in the ADA Handbook, EEOC-BK-19, 1991, p. III-21      [14 page excerpt, R-17], jointly published by the Department      and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The ADA      Handbook describes environmental illness as ``sensitivity to      environmental elements'' and, although it ``declines to state      categorically that these types of allergies or sensitivities      are disabilities,'' it specifically asserts that they may be:      ``Sometimes respiratory or neurological functioning is so      severely affected that an individual will satisfy the      requirements to be disabled under the regulations. Such an      individual would be entitled to all the protections      afforded by the Act.''                  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs       In recognizing MCS as a medical diagnosis (although not as      a ``disability'') in the case of at least one Persian Gulf      War veteran [Gary Zuspann, October 1992, 3 pages, R-18].     It is impossible to know exactly how many other Persian Gulf      veterans may have been diagnosed with MCS as the diagnostic      data recorded in the VA's Persian Gulf Registry are based on      the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9CM), which      does not yet include a specific code for MCS. In June 1997,      VA released its ``Environmental Hazards Research Centers'      Annual Reports for 1996.'' These included preliminary data      from the New Jersey EHRC showing that, of the 1161 veterans      randomly selected from the VA's Persian Gulf Registry (living      in NJ, NY, CT, MA, MD, DE, IL, VA, OH or NC) who completed      the center's questionnaire, 12.5% ``endorsed symptoms      compatible with a conservative definition of MCS'' [1997, 5      page excerpt, R-144]. When the NJ EHRC published its first      report on this study, however, in an abstract entitled      ``Preliminary prevalance data on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and      Multiple Chemical Sensitivity,'' it said 26% of 104 veterans      randomly selected from the VA Register ``were especially      sensitive to certain chemicals, and 4% reported that this      snsitivity produced at least 3 of 4 lifestyle changes . . .      suggesting that something about serving in the Gulf      substantially increased the risk of developing CFS and MCS''      [1996, Journal of CFS, 2(2/3): 136-137; R-177] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pollution, Prevention    and Toxins, Health Effects Division, Occupational and Residential         Exposure Branch, Special Review and Registration Section       In a peer-reviewed memorandum entitled ``Review of      Chlorpyrifos Poisoning Data'' from EPA's Jerome Blondell,      PhD, MPH, and Virginia Dobozy, VMD, MPH, to Linda Propst,      Section Head, Reregistration Branch. The memo discusses data      from several sources on acute and chronic health effects,      including MCS, associated with exposure to Dursban and other      chlorpyrifos-containing pesticides, and recommends many      changes (subsequently agreed to by DowElanco, the      manufacturer) in the use and marketing of these products,      including the phase out of all indoor sprays and foggers,      consumer concentrates, and all pet care products except flea      collars. Most significantly, the memo documents that of 101      cases of unambiguous chlorpyrifos poisoning reportedly      directly to EPA in 1995, 38 had chronic neurobehavioral      effects (including 4 who also had peripheral neuropathy),      while 50 ``reported symptoms consistent with multiple      chemical sensitivity'' [1977, 70 pages, R-145].U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Radiation & Indoor Air,                           Indoor Air Division       In its August 1989 Report to Congress on Indoor Air      Quality, entitled Assessment and Control of Indoor Air      Pollution (EPA/400/1-89/001C), the Environmental Protection      Agency's Indoor Air Division describes MCS as ``a subject of      considerable intra professional disagreement and concern      (Cullen, 1987). While no widely accepted test of physiologic      function has been shown to correlate with the symptoms, the      sheer mass of anecdotal data is cause of concern.'' [14 page      excerpt from Vol. 2, R-19]. In 1991, the Indoor Air Division      asked the National Research Council to sponsor a scientific      workshop on ``Multiple Chemical Hypersensitivity Syndrome''      the proceedings of which are published in Multiple Chemical      Sensitivities: Addendum to Biologic Markers in      Immunotoxicology [National Academy Press, 1992]. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research & Development       Descries ``chemical sensitivity'' as an ``ill-defined      condition marked by progressively more debilitating severe      reactions to various consumer products such as perfumes,      soaps, tobacco smoke, plastics, etc.'' in The Total Exposure      Assessment Methodology (TEAM) Study, Summary and Analysis:      Volume 1, by L. Wallace, Project Officer, Environmental      Monitoring Systems Division, EPA Office of Research and      Development [1987, 2 page excerpt, R-20]. The Office of      Research and Development (ORD) began conducting human      subjects chamber research at its Health Effects Research      Branch in Chapel Hill (NC) in 1992 to identify possible      diagnostic markers of MCS. (See also joint entry under U.S.      Consumer Product Safety Commission, above.) In the      justification for its fiscal year 1998 budget, ORD devotes      one paragraph to MCS in the section on Air Toxins, saying      that it plans to release ``information comparing individuals      who identify themselves as belonging to a particular subgroup      (multiple chemical sensitivity) against established norms for      a variety of health-related endpoints,'' and will make      ``recommendations for follow up to evaluate the potential      relationship between the signs/symptoms reported by these      individuals and objective/quantitative health endpoints''      [1997, 3 page excerpt, R-160].

Bell Atlantic, No. 120 93 0152, 17      May 1994 [2 pages, R-22].Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology,    Subcommittee on Risk Assessment, Working Party on Neurotoxicology       In its Final Report: Principles of Neurotoxicology Risk      Assessment, published in the Federal Register by the US EPA's      Office of Health Research [17 August 1994, 45 pages for      entire report, R-161, or 3 page excerpt, R-162], which says      in Section 2.5.1 on ``Susceptible Populations'' that:      ``Although controversial [Waddell 1993], recent evidence      suggests that there may be a subpopulation of people who have      become sensitive to chemicals and experience adverse      reactions to low-level exposures to environmental chemicals      [Bell et al 1992].'' The report is ``the result of the      combined efforts of 13 Federal agencies comprising the ad hoc      Interagency Committee on Neurotoxicology,'' including ATSDR,      the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Center for      Biologies Evaluation and Research, Center for Drug Evaluation      and Research, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Dept of      Agriculture, Dept. of Defense, Environmental Protection      Agency, National Center for Toxicological Research, National      Institutes of Health, National Institute of Occupational      Safety and Health, and the National Toxicology Program.     Federal Interagency Workgroup on Multiple Chemical Sensitivity       Formed in 1994 to review and coordinate the role of federal      agencies involved in research on multiple chemical      sensitivity [1 page agenda from 9/14/94 meeting, R-91]. The      Work Group is so-chaired by Dr. Barry Johnson, Assistant      Surgeon General and Assistant Administrator of the Agency for      Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and Dr. Richard      Jackson, Director of the National Center for Environmental      Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.      Other agencies represented include the Departments of Energy,      Defense, and Veterans' Affairs, the Environmental Protection      Agency and two other institutes within the Department of      Health and Human Services: the National Institute for      Occupational Safety and Health, and the National Institute of      Environmental Health Sciences. Draft report is expected to be      released by ATSDR in September 1998 for a 60-day public      comment period.     National Council on Disability (an independent federal agency)       In ADA Watch--Year One, its ``Report to the President and      Congress on Progress in Implementing the Americans with      Disabilities Act,'' which recommends that Congress and the      Administration ``should consider legialtion to address the      needs of people with ``emerging disabilities,'' such as those      . . . ``with environmental illness who are severely adversely      affected by secondary smoke or other pollutants in public      places'' [5 April 1993, 8 pages, R-23].    President's Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities       In its report to the President, entitled Operation People      First: Toward a National Disability Policy, which recommends      that the federal government ``develop, refine and better      communicate methods of `reasonable accommodation,' in      particular, the accommodation needs of people with . . .      chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple chemical sensitivity''      [1994, 5 pages, R-24] encouraging the Deputy Ministers of      Housing, Health Community and Social Services ``to begin a      consultative process and help to establish some guidelines''      spelling out exactly what services and benefits are available      to provincial residents with MCS, including possible      admission to treatment facilities in the United States [27      October 1989, 2 page letter and 2 pages of press coverage      from the Globe & Mail, R-158].

Funding for this document was provided by      the US Dept of Education National Institute on Disability and      Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), grant #H224A40002, but a      disclaimer notes that the content does not necessarily      reflect the views of the US government [October 1996,      11pages, R-129].   Arizona Department of Economic Security, Rehabilitation Services         Administration, and Statewide Independent Living Council       In RSA's Interim Fiscal Year 1995 State Plan for      Independent Living, specifying that ``Services Related to      Housing'' include ``modifications to accommodate people with      EI/MCS'' [Attachment 12, 1 October 1994, 7 pages, R-31] and      in an administrative review decisions issued 22 June 1992 in      the case of a vocational rehabilitation client determined to      be ``severely disabled'' by ``environmental illness,      allergies.'' In addition, training on MCS was presented to      both Vocational Rehabilitation and ILRS counselors at the      1994 state staff conference.

A cover letter sent by      the EHIB to the project's Advisory Panel members notes the      extraordinary preliminary results obtained from an annual      survey of random Californians to which questions about MCS      were added for the first time in 1995. Of the first 2,000      people surveyed, 16% reported suffering from MCS symptoms      while 7% (``certainly far higher than any of us may have      expected'') claim they have been diagnosed with MCS by a      physician. [3 October 1995, 2 pages, R-100]. Citing personal      communication with Dr. R. Kreutzer, the acting chief of the      EHIB (also confirmed with Dr. Kreutzer by MCS R), Dr. Ann      McCampbell reported the study's final results in a letter to      the editor published by Psychosomatics (38(3): 300-301, May-     June 1997): of 4,000 people surveyed, 15.9% reported chemical      sensitivity and 6.3% said they had been given the diagnosis      of MCS by a physician [1997, 1 page, R-141].                      California Energy Commission       In its report on California's Energy Efficiency Standards      and Indoor Air Quality (#P400-94-003), which says of MCS that      ``Its increasing incidence is suggested as accompanying the      increasingly wide-spread use of products manufactured with      potentially toxic chemical constituents. Available      information points to this condition as an acquired disorder      usually resulting from prior sensitization to chemicals in      the environment'' [1994, 2 page excerpt, R-35].

The report addresses common      barriers to access in public buildings, transportation,      institutions, employment, housing, and present detailed      suggested solutions, both those required under law and others      recommended. It covers the work of the subcommittee, its      outside Advisory Panel, and its MCS Task Forces (on Building      Standards and Construction, Environmental Illness, Industry,      Medicine and Health).                       Florida State Legislature       In legislation that created a voluntary Pesticide      Notification Registry for persons with pesticide sensitivity      or chemical hypersensitivity, as long as their medical      condition is certified by a physician specializing in      occupational medicine, allergy/immunology or toxicology      [Florida Statute 482.2265(3)(c), 1989, 7 pages, R-38]. The      legislation requires lawn-care companies to alert registry      members 24 hours in advance of applying chemicals within a      half-mile of their home. Note that pesticide sensitivity      registries also have been adopted in CO, CT, LA, MD, MI, NJ,      PA, WA [1992, 6 pages, R-149], WV and WI, but these do not      refer specifically (by any name) to MCS-type illness, and      most require notification only of adjacent properties.                               ____________________
