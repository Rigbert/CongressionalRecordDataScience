 President, on June 27, 2007, the Committee on Foreign Relations ordered reported S. 966, the Passport Backlog Reduction Act of 2007. On July 30, the President signed the bill into law, Public Law 110-50.  At the time the committee filed its report, the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, was not available. It was recently provided to the committee by CBO. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate       Public Law 110-50--Passport Backlog Reduction Act of 2007       Public Law 110-50 (formerly S. 966) grants the Department      of State additional flexibility in rehiring Foreign Service      annuitants on a temporary basis to reduce backlogs in visa      and passport processing. The new authority will expire in      2008 for visa backlogs and in 2009 for passport backlogs. CBO      estimates Public Law 110-50 will cost $2 million in 2008 and      $3 million over the 2008-2012 period, assuming the      availability of appropriated funds. The law does not affect      direct spending or receipts.       Under previous law, Foreign Service retirees could work for      the department for up to six months, provided they didn't      reach a certain salary cap. According to information provided      by the department, about half the retirees hit the salary cap      before six months (at four months, on average). The      department is already in the process of hiring 55 retirees      and plans to hire an additional 250 retirees to work on visa      and passport backlogs. By providing a waiver for the salary      cap, Public Law 110-50 allows the department to retain some      of those retirees for an additional two months. Under this      law, CBO estimates that about 150 retirees will work an      additional two months in 2008 at a cost of $2 million, and      about 65 retirees will work an additional two months in 2009      at a cost of $1 million.       Public Law 110-50 contains no intergovernmental or private-     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform      Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Sunita D'Monte.      This estimate was approved by Peter H. Fontaine, Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                          ____________________
