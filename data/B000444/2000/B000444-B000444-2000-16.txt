 I know he knows I think he is dead wrong on this issue. For two reasons I think he is dead wrong: On the facts and I think he is dead wrong on the approach he has taken.  The fact of the matter is, the administration at the time this aide memoire--a fancy phrase for saying this agreement--was signed by Gore and Chernomyrdin, a follow-on to a verbal agreement made by Clinton and by Yeltsin in 1994--that agreement was made known to the public; it was publicly stated, and that was actually offered. The House of Representatives was briefed at the time.  Here we are less than 10 days before an election and it has become a causecelebre. I don't have the time, and I am sure my friend from Oregon doesn't have the inclination, to listen to why this is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. And this is not a binding obligation. There are distinctions between binding obligations and agreements. One requires disclosure; the other does not. The fact is, this was a good deal and it was disclosed and made available to be disclosed.  Let me cut to the chase. The fact of the matter is we did have a closed meeting with members of the State Department. I was present, my friend from Oregon was present, our colleague from Kansas was present, Senator Brownback, and maybe someone else; I can't recall. I indicated at the time that although the White House and the State Department were not required to share these documents, in my view they were making a tactical political mistake not doing it.  I am here to tell my friend from Oregon what I told Senator Lugar and what I told Senator Hagel, and I understand it is being communicated to the majority leader. The State Department is going to make available to the leadership of the House and the Senate--which is the way we do these things--the so-called annexes. If there is any violation of law--which there is not, but if there is any--the only violation could flow from there being a weapons system that was transferred on the annex, that falls within the purview of the law, that covered certain weapons systems and destabilizing systems under the McCain-Gore legislation. So if there is nothing in that annex that was transferred, there can be no question there was no law broken here.  This will be the test to know whether this is politics or not. This will be the test. If the administration makes that available to the majority leader, minority leader, Speaker of the House, and the minority leader of the House, the leadership of the House, then, in fact, we will find out. They will bring the document up, and they can see it.  If they really want to know the answer, if they really believe a law was broken, then it is really clear; they can sit down and look at it and find out. But if the offer is made and it is refused--I will say and challenge anyone to give me a good reason why I am wrong--that is pure politics.  I really mean this; I have an inordinately high regard for my friend from Oregon. That probably hurts him back home, but I like him a lot. The fact of the matter is, we have worked closely together on a whole number of items. I have never misled him and he has never misled me. I got off the phone with Strobe Talbott. The Secretary of State is intending to call the majority leader, going to make the offer tomorrow to come up and show the documents.  It is interesting that the letter requesting documents says they basically want these annexes. I know we need more time to explain this to someone listening because this is kind of confusing. My friend from Oregon knows what I am talking about because he knows the area well. The annex lists all those weapons systems that would be sanctionable if transferred by the Russians to the Iranians, if that were to occur.  We will find out whether anything was transferred. By the way, unlike in any other administration, it has been pointed out that 10 times as many weapons were transferred to the Iranians when Bush was President than since Clinton has been President. But we will find out whether anything was violated.  I want to make it clear, the offer will be made. If the offer is rejected, I want everyone to know--and the press who may be listening--that a big neon light should go on, ``Politics, politics, politics.'' If the offer is accepted, then, in fact--and my colleagues look at it, the majority leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, if they look at it and they say this looks like a duck, to use my friend's phrase, that is a different story. That is debatable; that is something that warrants concern.  To reiterate:  The Senators' letter says that ``the Vice President pledges to `avoid any penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law.' ''  The letter omits the words immediately preceding that quote from the leaked understanding: ``take appropriate steps'' to avoid penalties. That meant that the United States would not circumvent U.S. law. Rather, if necessary, we would sanction Russia, but waive the penalties, pursuant to the law.  But in fact, there was no need to waive penalties at all, because Russia was not proposing any conventional arms transfers that would trigger sanctions under U.S. law--and the Vice President was assured of this by the Department of Defense before he signed the understanding.  One relevant law was the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992, the so-called ``McCain-Gore Act.'' That law requires sanctions against governments that transfer ``destabilizing numbers and types'' of ``advanced conventional weapons'' to Iran or Iraq. Thus, you must find both the sale of advanced conventional weapons to Iran, and that these are a number and type so as to tip the balance of power in the region.  We have been assured--by experienced, career officials--that the Annex listing planned Russian arms transfers to Iran contains nothing that would meet all those tests.  But we don't have to trust the Government on this. Anthony Cordesman, who was John McCain's national security assistant in 1992, working on the McCain-Gore bill, wrote recently: ``Iran . . . has not . . . received destabilizing transfers of advanced conventional weapons.''  The third Kilo-class submarine to be sent to Iran was specifically considered by the Pentagon, which decided that it would not be destabilizing.  In any case, submarines are not listed in the 1992 law's definition of advanced conventional weapons; and even President Bush made no move to add them to the list, even though the law permits such additions.  The Senators' letter quotes Secretary Albright's letter to Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov, in which she says we ``upheld our commitment not to impose sanctions'' and that ``without the Aide Memoire, Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws.'' As you said yesterday:  One reasonable interpretation is that Secretary Albright is saying, ``if you hadn't obeyed the Aide Memoire, you would have gotten in trouble.'' And that's true. If Russia had signed new deals to sell ``lethal military equipment'' to Iran, or if it had sold lots of ``advanced conventional weapons'' to Iran, it would have forced us to invoke sanctions under our law. But they basically did obey the Aide Memoire, and stayed out of trouble in this regard.  Another reasonable interpretation is that the Secretary was overstating her case, using U.S. law as a club with which to beat the Russians. If so, more power to her.  A third reasonable interpretation is that Secretary Albright was thinking of those sanctions, based on other U.S. laws, that do not require any trigger other than a Presidential determination that the national security warrants them.  The Albright letter does not show any violation or circumvention of the 1992 Iran-Iraq law, and there is no evidence of any such action.  The Senators' letter rejects Vice President Gore's point that Russia's arms transfers were pursuant to previously-signed contracts, because the McCain-Gore law does not exempt such transfers.  That misses the point. There are other laws that would require sanctions for any transfer of ``lethal military equipment'' to Iran. Those laws exempt transfers under pre-1996 contracts.  The administration never claimed that it was cutting off all Russian arms transfers to Iran. But it did put a cap on those transfers, limiting them essentially to ones contracted for during the Bush administration.  The Senators' letter says that the Congress must review all the relevant documents, renews a demand for all the previously requested documents, and threatens a subpoena if these are not produced by noon Monday.  The fact is, however, that only the Annex to the Aide Memoire is cited as a really necessary document.  I think the executive branch ought to find a way to let appropriate senators review the Annex and the Secretary'sletter to the Russian Foreign Minister, while maintaining the confidentiality of those documents.  Once that is done, I believe that there will be no good reason to seek further documents.  Tony Cordesman, the expert in Middle Eastern military affairs who was Senator McCain's national security assistant, summed up this case admirably a couple of weeks ago:       Political campaigns are a poor time to debate complex      military issues, particularly when the debate is based on      press reports that are skewed to stress the importance of the      story at the expense of objective perspective and the facts.  I ask unanimous consent the pertinent letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.     Hon. Madeleine Albright,     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Albright: We were extremely disappointed      that the Department of State continues to refuse to give the      Committee access to critical documents relating to the Gore-     Chernomyrdin agreement.       Madame Secretary, this is simply unacceptable. All of the      evidence in the public domain leads us to the conclusion that      Vice President Gore signed a secret deal with Russian Premier      Viktor Chernomyrdin, in which he agreed to ignore U.S. non-     proliferation laws governing weapons transfers to Iran.       The text of the agreement signed by Mr. Gore and Mr.      Chernomyrdin (as published in the New York Times), the Vice      President pledges to ``avoid any penalties to Russia that      might otherwise arise under domestic law.''       And, in your letter to Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov      earlier this year (published in the Washington Times), you      state: ``We have also upheld our commitment not to impose      sanctions for these transfers disclosed in the Annex to the      Aide Memoire, Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would      have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of      our laws. This possibility still exists in the event of      continued Russian transfers after the December 31 termination      date.''       The administration's defense--repeated by the Vice      President this morning on ``Good Morning America''--that the      Russian transfers to Iran he agreed to were under ``pre-     existing contracts'' simply does not wash. The date the      contracts were signed is irrelevant. The Gore-McCain law      covers the transfer of weapons after 1992. There is no      ``contract sanctity'' exception in the law--it does not      matter whether the transfers took place under new or pre-     existing contracts. What matters, under law, is when the      transfer took place.       The Administration's other defense--that the weapons      transferred are not covered by the Gore-McCain law--is belied      by the Administration stubborn refusal to share with the      Committee the Annex that lists the weapons.       In essence, you are saying to Congress and the American      people: ``Trust us.'' Considering the fact that almost      everything we have learned about this secret deal has come      from the news media and not the Administration, we      respectfully decline.       Congress has a right and responsibility to review all the      relevant documents, and to judge for itself whether the      transfers the Vice President signed off on were covered by      U.S. non-proliferation laws.       We expect the Administration to share all of the requested      documents with the Committee no later than noon on Monday,      October 20.       If the Administration continues to stonewall, and withhold      these documents from Congress, then the Foreign relations      Committee will have no choice but to issue a subpoena to      obtain them.           Sincerely,         Gordon Smith, John McCain, Jesse Helms, Trent Lott, John            Warner, Sam Brownback, Don Nickles, Fred Thompson,            Richard Shelby, Richard G. Lugar.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, October 25, 2000     Hon. George P. Schultz,     Thomas W. and Susan B. Ford Distinguished Fellow, Hoover          Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.       Dear Mr. Secretary: I read with interest your election-eve      condemnation of an understanding that Vice President Gore and      Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin reached some five years      ago. I was surprised--and saddened--to see that you and other      men who have served our nation with dignity and distinction      would sign a letter that was promptly used in an effort to      exploit a national security issue for partisan gain.       It is time to set the record straight. First, the June 1995      U.S.-Russia understanding prevented new Russian arms sales to      Iran and thus enhanced the security of the United States and      its allies. Second, the understanding did not circumvent,      violate or undermine any U.S. law. Indeed, it appears to have      led Russia to stay within the bounds of U.S. law regarding      conventional arms transfers to Iran. Third, although the      executive branch was under no legal obligation to submit the      June 1995 understanding to the Congress as an international      agreement, it did make public the broad outlines of the      understanding and provide classified oral briefings at least      to one committee.       One highly respected expert in this field is Mr. Anthony H.      Cordesman, who was national security assistant to Senator      John McCain when his employer and then-Senator Al Gore wrote      the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992. Mr.      Cordesman now holds the Arleigh Burke Chair at the Center for      Strategic and International Studies. Earlier this month, he      wrote an analysis of Russia's conventional arms transfer to      Iran. The opening of that study strikes me as especially      worthy of your consideration: ``Political campaigns are a      poor time to debate complex military issues, particularly      when the debate is based on press reports that are skewed to      stress the importance of the story at the expense of      objective perspective and the facts. Iran does represent a      potential threat to US interests, but it has not had a major      conventional arms build-up or received destabilizing      transfers of advanced conventional weapons.''       If you remain uncertain regarding any of the points I have      made, I invite you to consult such sources as Mr. Cordesman's      CSIS study, Iranian Arms Transfers: The Facts, the public      testimony this morning of Deputy Assistant Secretaries of      State John P. Barker and Joseph M. DeThomas before the Senate      Committee on Foreign Relations, and even my own opening      statement at this morning's hearing.           Sincerely,                                             Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,                                                     U.S. Senator.
