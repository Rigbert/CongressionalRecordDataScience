Madam Speaker, yes, it will be a very fair, wide open process in the Rules Committee looking at amendments--those that have not been able to be offered already in committee, where these bills have gone through subcommittee and full committee with amendments being offered, and then they will be brought to the floor so we can get the work done and move the bill forward.
