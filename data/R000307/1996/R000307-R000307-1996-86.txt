Again, let me say to the gentleman that we all stand in admiration of the gentleman's efforts to cut spending. Nobody has done more in the Congress. But what I would like to try to point out is that we do have two separate pastures in regard to our financial obligation in regard to agriculture. One is the mandatory pasture, and one is the discretionary pasture.  The gentleman has done yeoman work in regards to the discretionary part of the funding. We are in charge of the mandatory part.  Now, we started out at $56.6 billion.
