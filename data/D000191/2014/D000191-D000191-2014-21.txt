 Many years ago, I worked as a bicycle mechanic, so I know how to patch a tube. But if you get to the point where you can't see the tube anymore for the patches, then it is time for a new tube.  Well, that is where we are at here today. We have had study after study that we are not even investing enough money in our infrastructure to bring it up to a state of good repair, let alone build a modern 21st century infrastructure.                              {time}  1345  We were the envy of the world with the Eisenhower program. We were the number one in infrastructure in the world. Where are we now? We are number 26. We are down there slugging it out with Third World countries, in terms of our infrastructure.  140,000 bridges on the national highway system need repair or replacement. Forty percent of the national highway system is so deteriorated that it has to be totally replaced. You can't just patch it anymore. You just can't resurface anymore.  Our transit agencies have a $70 billion backlog to bring their existing systems up to a state of good repair--not to build new transit options for Americans, no--just to bring what we have up to a state of good repair.  Why are we here today? Because there are people on that side of the aisle who actually don't believe it is either the duty, obligation, or right of the Federal Government to invest in a national highway system, a national transportation system. They believe in devolution. Make the States do it.  We tried that. In the 1950s, Kansas built a brand-new turnpike. It ended at the Oklahoma border because Oklahoma ran out of money, and they didn't build it until the Eisenhower bill went through.  They want to go back to those good old days of the 1950s, when you couldn't even have roads that connected between States. That is nuts. It was bad in the middle of the last century, and it is nuts for the 21st century.  Are we just going to kick the can down the road again? If we pass this Republican proposal to continue the current anemic levels of funding until next May, that is not going to bring the States the certainty they need. It is not going to bring the industry the robust investment they need. It is not going to get us the jobs we need.  Yes, we will limp along until next May, and then there will be incredible uncertainty about the next construction season. There won't be major new projects planned. Nothing will happen. We need to resolve that this year.  We should stay here, as the gentleman from Oregon said, and resolve it this August. Five weeks, guys, and we can't get to this issue? Then you are going to kick it into next year? Better, at least, that we are confronted with it before the end of this year; then maybe we can get a robust funding source.  Maybe we can make the investments we need. Maybe we could give theStates the tools they need next construction season and the certainty they need next construction season to go forward.
