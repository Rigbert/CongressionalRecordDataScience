President, at 12:02 AM this morning the six billionth person was born. It was a boy, in Sarajevo.  It took hundreds of thousands of years for the world's population to reach 1 billion, but it has taken less than 40 years for it to double from 3 to 6 billion people. This is a staggering number with implications that are impossible to fully grasp or predict.  What we do know, however, is that 95 percent of new births are occurring in developing countries that are least equipped to deal with the consequences. From sub-Saharan Africa to Asia, people's most basic needs continue to go unmet.  Of the 4.8 billion people in developing countries, it is estimated that nearly 60 percent lack basic sanitation. Almost a third do not have access to clean water. A quarter do not have adequate housing and a fifth--about 1 billion people--have no access to modern health services.  We also know that population pressures threaten every aspect of the Earth's environment. Severe water shortages, shrinking forests, soil degradation, air and water pollution and the daily loss of animal and plant life have changed the face of the planet and contributed to famine, social unrest and massive displacement of people.  This is not to minimize the progress that has been made in slowing population growth rates. Thanks in large part to the availability of modern contraceptives, the average number of births per woman has declined from 6 to 3. In addition, people today enjoy longer, healthier lives than ever before. Women have more opportunities and choices. Technology has enhanced access to medical care, education and employment. In every corner of the globe, we have seen the dramatic successes that have been achieved through vigorous, well-funded foreign assistance programs.  But the disparities between haves and have nots is growing. Given what we know about the inextricable link between population growth, poverty, political instability, lack of social justice and environmental degradation, it is astonishing to me that every year there are those in Congress who continue to oppose funding for international family planning.  It is inexplicable that even though the world's population has doubled since 1960, Members of Congress, especially in the House, vociferously oppose funding the United Nations Population Fund which promotes access to voluntary reproductive health services for women around the world. They do so because UNFPA has a small program in China, which supports women's health, modern contraceptives, and other voluntary family planning services. It makes absolutely no sense, since these are precisely the interventions that reduce reliance on abortion as a method of family planning.  And this year's Foreign Operation's bill contains only $385 million for the Agency for International Development's family planning programs, a $150 million cut from what it was just five years ago.  It is a travesty that so many people around the world want family planning services and still cannot get them. Time and again it has been proven that when these services are available the number of abortions declines, lives are saved and opportunities for women, children and families dramatically increase.  It is also shortsighted. The decisions we make today will determine how long it will be before another billion people occupy this planet and whether our children and grandchildren are born into a world of poverty and deprivation or a world of opportunity and prosperity.  Mr. President, today is a sobering reminder of the need for the United States to resume its leadership in support of international family planning. We have the ability to help improve the lives of billions of people both now and in the future.                          ____________________
