President, the Senator has several excellent amendments which I support and agreed to.  We have given the other side over and over again a list of amendments that under normal circumstances would be agreed to in about 5 minutes by voice vote, including a number of the amendments of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. I keep hoping we might do that.  We had more than 200 amendments in the Judiciary Committee that were voted on. Of those that were adopted, all but three passed with bipartisan votes. We demonstrated we were willing to do this on a bipartisan basis.  To assure the Senator from Louisiana--who is a wonderful Senator and dear friend--that I support these, I keep trying to get them accepted. I hope, after 2 weeks on this bill--and realizing we did the very extensive and open markup in the Judiciary Committee--that we can get to the point where we could start accepting a number of amendments--both Democratic and Republican--that we all agree on, including those from the Senator from Louisiana.  I am sorry to interrupt her. But she has worked so hard on this. She has gotten bipartisan support. She has talked to all of us. At some point, she should be allowed to have her amendments.  I yield the floor.
