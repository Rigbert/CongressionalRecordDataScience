Speaker, I rise this evening to thank the Oregon National Guard. There is a lot of discussion here about the things that went wrong with the response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster; but yesterday, I had the experience of accompanying the adjutant general, Major General Fred Rees of the Oregon National Guard, to New Orleans to see the guard units there in action.  We have one of the largest, if not the largest, contingents in New Orleans. They have one of the most difficult sectors, a large portion of the city, particularly the portion of the city that is still submerged; and I had an opportunity there to meet with the troops. They are basically living in battlefield conditions, eating meals ready to eat, sleeping in an abandoned school and a university that is vacant at the moment, and they are doing extraordinary work.  One of the first people I met from the city when we made our first stop was a woman who was still in her house. I went to ask her why she was still in her house, because they have been trying to encourage people to evacuate. She said, well, I feel safe. I said, well, I can understand that. She said, no, thank God for the National Guard; I feel safe. She says, you do not understand. She was telling me that she felt safe in her neighborhood for the first time in years, an incredibly high crime neighborhood, because of the Oregon National Guard presence.  Then we went on from there to the flooded areas where, in the preliminary stages, they are still rescuing people. The day we were there they rescued people; 570 people rescued so far by the Oregon National Guard.  They have begun in their own small way to contribute to the restoration effort of the school, the high school that they are living in which was pretty trashed and this other university campus that they are on, beginning cleanup; but their efforts are just extraordinary.  The thing about the National Guard is they do not just bring the military precision to these sorts of efforts. I mean, they have got the discipline, the training, the logistic support, the unit cohesion, those sorts of things; but they have something else special. They are citizen soldiers, and they have other skills, and those other skills are needed more than ever in a disaster, more than regular Army troops.  They can certainly restore order. We have quite a number of police officers who have been heavily relied upon by other troops and other units of Guards not from Oregon in dealing with the residents and some of the problems still in the neighborhoods that they are assisting.  We have firefighters. We have people with expertise in heavy equipment. They found and repaired an abandoned bulldozer to begin clearing streets foraccess around one of the headquarters. We have electricians who are trying to wire the school so that they can use the generators, at least have some basics for the troops.  This is the National Guard at their finest. Many of these troops have just recently returned from Iraq. They have not even been home 6 months, and many are signed up to go to Afghanistan next March; but I did not hear a single complaint. They said, this is a great mission. We are saving people's lives. We can see we are making a difference here. We are proud to serve.  I am proud as an Oregonian to represent many of these individuals. The Guard is a tremendous success story in a disaster which has too many other problems, things that must be investigated by Congress in terms of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, returning it to being an independent, professionally run, high-functioning agency. Many of us objected to putting it in Homeland Security. We were all too right, unfortunately.  We must oversee the relief and recovery effort. The government is borrowing and spending $500 million a day. That must be strictly overseen to make sure there is not crisis profiteering that has happened after some other disasters and other hurricanes. Congress has a role in that, and Congress then is going to have to look at the rebuilding effort in terms of the infrastructure that serves that area, the intricate infrastructure, the Corps of Engineers and what steps we are taking for the future, where we will rebuild, and how we will protect those things.  It will be massively expensive; and in the face of that massive expense, in addition to a deficit, I hope that the President and the majority party drop their push for more tax cuts for the wealthiest among us. Those who earn more than $300,000 a year and those who have estates worth more than $6 million, should they not contribute to this effort? Are they not part of this country, or do they just live behind walled compounds with their private security and their private jets?  We are all in this together, as was demonstrated by my citizen soldiers who are not paid a whole heck of a lot of money to do this. So let us do this right. Let us recognize the National Guard and others who volunteered and have done so well. So far let us support their effort, and let us enter into this rebuilding effort in a wise and cost-efficient way, protecting both the taxpayers and the people who have been ravaged by this storm.                          ____________________[Pages H7927-H7928]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   HONORING THE OREGON NATIONAL GUARD
