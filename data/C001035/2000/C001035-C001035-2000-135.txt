President, I thank my colleague from Iowa and my colleague from New York for their graciousness.  I ask unanimous consent that we be permitted to proceed for not to exceed 15 minutes, and that would be divided such that I would have 7 minutes and the Senator from Wisconsin would be permitted to proceed for not to exceed 8 minutes.
