Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, my State is unique. We actually have a weight mile formula we charge to the trucking industry. Federally, when I first served here, the industry tried to preempt it a number of times and never did. It is now widely recognized as one of the fairer systems in the States because it apportions according to scientifically based research, much of it done at Oregon State University in the labs there, the impacts of individual vehicles.  In this case, DOT says that these vehicles would cause an additional $6,000-per-vehicle per-year damage on the Federal system, and they would be charged $200. I don't think that is a fair return to the taxpayer, and I urge Members to oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
