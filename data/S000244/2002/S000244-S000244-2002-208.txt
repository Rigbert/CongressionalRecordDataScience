Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, just let me make it clear, this bill has nothing to do with the immigration law, lest anybody have a misimpression on this. It is legislation that changes the qualification for membership in the VFW, as well as makes it clear that the VFW is a charitable organization. Both of these changes were requested by the delegates to the last VFW annual convention that was held in August of last year in my hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The best way we can help our veterans, I think, is by not confusing the issue. Let us help our veterans by doing what they asked us to do, which is to allow them to expand their membership, as well as to get some State departments of revenue off their back claiming that what the VFW does is not charitable in nature.  I think all of us in this Chamber know that the VFW is a legitimate and honorable charitable organization, and I think that we can send the message very clearly by amending their charter to get the State tax departments off their backs so that they can continue to do their very meritorious work.
