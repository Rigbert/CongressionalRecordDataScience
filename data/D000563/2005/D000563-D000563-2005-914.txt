I ask the Senator from Rhode Island this question. The argument used for this gun legislation is, how can you hold a gun dealer responsible? For goodness sakes. How will they know what is going to happen to this gun? They sell the gun to a purchaser, the gun leaves the shop. Why in the world would you hold the gun dealer responsible? In the cases we have cited, in the examples which the Senator has used, you have gun dealers, 1.2 percent, who are responsible for more than half the guns traced to crimes. In these dealers you have repeated sales, and over and over again, hundreds of times, to those who will use them in crime. It obviously raises a question which the supporters of this legislation can't answer, and that is why you are trying to protect these miserable bums. Why are you trying to say they can't be held responsible for the devastation and killing and violence that goes on, on our streets when they are sitting there churning out firearms that are used day after day in the commission of a crime.  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, why do we not create an exception in this law for those who are repeat offenders as gun dealers who continue to sell these guns used in crime and we know it and we have the facts to prove it.  Why in the world should we protect them in this legislation?
