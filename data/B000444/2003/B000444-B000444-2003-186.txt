 Res. 144       Whereas paragraph 1 of Article 1 of the International      Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United      States is a party, recognizes that all peoples have the right      of self-determination;       Whereas Kosova was constitutionally defined as an      autonomous region in the First National Liberation Conference      for Kosova on January 2, 1944, this status was confirmed in      the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of      Yugoslavia adopted in 1946, and the autonomous status of      Kosova was preserved in the amended Yugoslav Constitution      adopted in 1974;       Whereas prior to the disintegration of the former      Yugoslavia, the autonomous region of Kosova constituted a      political and legal entity with its own distinct financial      institutions, police force, municipal government, school      system, judicial and legal system, hospitals, and other      organizations;       Whereas, in 1987, Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic rose      to power in Yugoslavia on a platform of ultranationalism and      anti-Albanian racism, advocating violence and hatred against      all non-Slavic peoples and specifically targeting the ethnic      Albanians of Kosova;       Whereas Slobodan Milosevic subsequently stripped Kosova of      its political autonomy without the consent of the people of      Kosova;       Whereas the elected Assembly of Kosova, faced with this      illegal act, adopted a Declaration of Independence on July 2,      1990, proclaimed a Republic of Kosova, and adopted a      constitution on September 7, 1990, based on the      internationally accepted principles of self-determination,      equality, and sovereignty;       Whereas in recognition of the de facto dissolution of the      Yugoslav federation, the European Community established      principles for the recognition of the independence and      sovereignty of the republics of the former Socialist Federal      Republic of Yugoslavia;       Whereas a popular referendum was held in Kosova from      September 26 to 30, 1991, in which 87 percent of all eligible      voters cast ballots and 99.87 percent voted in favor of      declaring Kosova independent of the Socialist Federal      Republic of Yugoslavia;       Whereas, during the occupation of Kosova, which began in      1989 and ended with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization      (NATO) military action against the regime of Slobodan      Milosevic in 1999, the ethnic Albanians of Kosova were      subjected to brutal treatment by the occupying forces, and      approximately 400,000 ethnic Albanians were forced to flee to      Western Europe and the United States;       Whereas in the spring of 1999 almost 1,000,000 ethnic      Albanians were driven out of Kosova and at least 10,000 were      murdered by Serbian paramilitary and military forces;       Whereas Slobodan Milosevic was indicted by the      International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and      extradited to The Hague in June 2001, to stand trial for war      crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Kosova,      Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia;       Whereas on June 10, 1999, United Nations Security Council      Resolution 1244 mandated an international civil presence in      Kosova, ending the decade-long Serbian occupation of Kosova      and Milosevic's genocidal war there;       Whereas the people of Kosova, including ethnic Albanians,      Serbs, Turks, Roma, Bosniaks, Goranis, and Ashkalis, held      free and fair municipal elections in 2000 and 2002 and a      general election in 2001 to elect a Parliament, which in turn      selected a President and Prime Minister in 2002;       Whereas, with 50 percent of the population in Kosova being      under the age of 25, and the unemployment rate currently      being between 60 and 70 percent, there is an increasing      likelihood of young people entering criminal networks, or      working abroad in order to survive unless massive job      creation is facilitated by guaranteeing the security of      foreign investments through the establishment of the rule of      law and functioning institutions in Kosova;       Whereas for the first time since the end of the conflict,      refugees from ethnic minority communities in Kosova have      started to return to their homes in substantial numbers,      although those refugees are still a small fraction of the      number of people that left in 1999;       Whereas most ethnic Albanian elected authorities in Kosova      recognize that substantial efforts toward reconciliation with      ethnic minorities are needed for the long-term security and      participation in government institutions of all citizens of      Kosova;       Whereas leaders of the Kosova Parliament have publicly      committed to developing a western-style democracy in which      all citizens, regardless of ethnicity, are granted full human      and civil rights and are committed to the return of all      refugees, whatever their ethnicity, who fled Kosova during      and after the conflict;       Whereas Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic of Serbia      called for the return of Serbian forces to Kosova and for      talks on the status of the province;       Whereas, on February 25, 2003, representatives of a Serbian      minority coalition in the Kosova Parliament called for the      establishment of a Serbian Union in northern Kosova;       Whereas the international community has made clear that it      will support neither monoethnic government institutions, nor      the partition of Kosova;       Whereas the tragic assassination in Belgrade of Serbian      Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic on March 12, 2003, underscored      that criminal nationalist elements remain a destabilizing      factor in the region and an obstacle to reform efforts;       Whereas the Special Representative of the United Nations      Secretary General in Kosova has initiated a dialogue between      the authorities in Belgrade and in Pristina on issues of      practical concern;       Whereas the Serbian Government on April 17, 2003, declared      as ``unacceptable'' the plan put forward by the Special      Representative to devolve powers to the elected officials in      Kosova;       Whereas following his address to the Organization for      Security and Cooperation in Europe Permanent Council on May      8, 2003, the Special Representative of the United Nations      Secretary General stated that ``Kosovo Albanians are being      more assertive about competencies and status issues while at      the same time Kosovo Serbs are concentrating on developing      monoethnic structures'';       Whereas Deputy Prime Minister Covic on May 9, 2003, again      dismissed the assessment that the time has come to begin to      discuss the final status of Kosova;       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244      stated that the main responsibilities of the international      civil presence in Kosova include facilitating a political      process designed to determine Kosova's future status and, in      the final stage, overseeing the transfer of authority from      Kosova's provisional institutions to institutions established      under a political settlement; and       Whereas the only viable option for the future of Kosova is      one that reflects both the needs and aspirations of its      entire population: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the      United States should--       (1) recognize the danger that an unnecessary delay in the      resolution of Kosova's final status would pose for the      political and economic viability of Kosova and the stability      of Southeast Europe;       (2) publicly support the goal of a democratic government in      Kosova in which human rights, including the rights of ethnic      and religious minorities, are respected;       (3) to achieve that goal, call for holding a referendum,      under international supervision, on the future status of      Kosova, once Kosova has made further progress in developing      institutions of democratic self-government, establishing the      rule of law, facilitating the return and reintegration of      refugees into local communities, and protecting ethnic      minorities, in accordance with the benchmarks established by      the United Nations;       (4) work in conjunction with the United Nations, the North      Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, the      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and      other international organizations to assist Kosova to meet      the United Nations benchmarks that are the necessary      conditions for holding a referendum on the future status of      Kosova and to facilitate the implementation of the form of      government determined by the people of Kosova; and       (5) continue to provide assistance, trade, and other      programs to encourage the further development of democracy      and a free market economic system in Kosova.
