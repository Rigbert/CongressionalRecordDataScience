Speaker, this month brings us the retirement of Dr. Benjamin Reed, long time county coroner in Fulton County, Ohio. I am pleased to recognize Dr. Reed, who ended his service April 1, 2002 after nearly four decades.  A physician in the finest sense of the word and true public servant, Dr. Reed is known by everyone in Fulton County and is doctor to all in his hometown of Delta and to so many more in Northwest Ohio. A friend and confidante to all who knew him, his energetic attitude and dedication to his profession are unsurpassed.  The practice of medicine runs deep in Dr. Reed's family. He followed in his grandfather's footsteps, obtaining his medical degree from the University of Louisville. He began his practice in Kentucky, then moved to West Virginia where he doctored to the people of a coal mining town. There he learned to put his skills to the test as he practiced everything from obstetrics to cardiology to surgery. It was soon after moving to Delta that he began working in the coroners office, to which he was elected after seven years. In 1994, his neighbors recognized him as Delta's Citizen of the Year.  In addition to his practice and his coroner's work, Dr. Reed held offices with the Ohio State Medical Association, the Fulton County Medical Society, and the American Heart Association's Northwest Ohio Chapter. As he ends his public life, may Dr. Reed enjoy the serenity of family life and the peace which comes from a job well done. We wish him a very enjoyable retirement as he spends time on his own schedule and preferred activities, and with the family and friends dear to him. Thank you Dr. Reed, for your exemplary service to us all!                          ____________________
