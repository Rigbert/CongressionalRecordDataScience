He and his wife Sheila, his daughter, several staff members, and the pilot and copilot were lost in that plane crash. I attended that memorial service for him at the University of Minnesota.  Paul had such a passion for so many issues. But the one thing that meant more than anything to him was this mental health parity bill. I am saddened that, 6 years later, we still haven't passed it. We only had 5 Republicans join us today and vote for it. I hope the Senator from Minnesota feels as I do, that we need to pass the Wellstone mental health parity bill--make no excuses, find no alternatives, other than to make sure it is named in his memory, the man who started us down this road and whose journey needs to be finished by us today.  I am glad the Senator from Minnesota is here to participate in that. It should be the highest priority before we adjourn this year. Since I need to ask the question, I ask her if she agrees.
