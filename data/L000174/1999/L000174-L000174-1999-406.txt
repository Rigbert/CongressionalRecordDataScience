President, I wish to commend the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois for his statement. The Senator from Illinois represents one of the greatest States of our country, a significant and very large State, with millions of people, ranging from one of the best known, most dynamic cities not only in this country but in the world, and also with very small rural areas. I, in turn, represent a very small State, where the largest city is 40,000 people. We go down to a town of 40 people. But I couldn't help but think, while listening to the statement of my good friend from Illinois, about some of the letters he read. The names of the towns might be different, but we might have heard similar letters from Vermont. Sometimes the problems are compounded by the fact that we are a rural State. As he knows, in the rural areas of his great State the problems are even worse because of the distances they have to travel and the lack of choices they may have. I hope he will continue to speak because he speaks not just for the people of Illinois, but for the people of Vermont and everywhere else.                          ____________________
