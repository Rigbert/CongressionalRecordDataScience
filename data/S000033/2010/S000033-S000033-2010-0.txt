 President, today I wish to introduce to you one of my constituents, Lawrence ``Rip'' Kirby of Rutland, VT, who has written to me outlining his ideas on how Congress can and should address our $13.8 trillion national debt in a fair and sensible way. I am pleased the citizens of Vermont are engaged on this issue, which is of critical importance to not only our State, but indeed the Nation. The decisions that we make on the Senate floor today will impact generations of Americans to come. That is why I would like to share with you what Mr. Kirby wrote:       To reduce the deficit and accumulated debt we must      understand their root causes and history:       Short-term problem: The near-collapse of the economy was      arrested by means of deficit spending, including corporate      bailouts, extended unemployment benefits, and stimulus      initiatives. While arguably necessary to stave off an even      worse catastrophe, these measures have added to the deficit      and the debt.       Solution(s): Our emphasis should not be on recovery of sunk      costs but on prevention of future disasters. Break up ``too      large to fail'' businesses through anti-trust laws. Regulate      imprudent, secretive, or unfathomable financial arrangements      like derivatives. Increase regulated safety margins like      reserve requirements for banks and loan limits based on      borrower credit ratings. Eliminate conflicts of interest like      permitting bond rating agencies to have a financial stake in      the companies they rate.       Medium-term problem: Our wars overseas have been funded by      massive deficits with no real strategy for repayment. The      unexpected length and intractability of these conflicts      exacerbates the problem.       Solution(s): Stop the financial bleeding and provide a      financial transfusion. To stop the bleeding we must get out      of these conflicts within a short time (two years at most).      Continue intelligence-gathering and maintain air power, but      get the boots off the ground. To provide a transfusion, enact      a temporary and progressive ``war surtax'' with a sunset      provision.       Long-term problem: Entitlement spending (Medicare, Social      Security, etc.) has exceeded its funding as America's      longevity has climbed faster than its typical retirement age      without tax increases to keep up. The mass retirement of the      baby boomers will aggravate this problem as they become      greater consumers of entitlements and a lesser source of      taxes.       Solution(s): Recognize that longevity is really an      advantage, and make better use of people's lengthening      ability to work and to contribute. In short, this means      gradually raising the age of entitlement eligibility. We must      also end the regressive and irrational Social Security tax      exemption for earnings above $108,000.       Long term problem: Our K-12 school system has deteriorated      while foreign students have surged ahead in critical subjects      like math, science, and language skills. The underlying cause      is debated endlessly, but I believe we have replaced the hard      work of learning with trendy feel-good initiatives that      represent the path of least resistance for both educators and      students. We also underfund education, thereby encouraging      the employment of second-rate teachers, curricula, and      facilities. This exacerbates the deficit by degrading our tax      base as emerging generations of Americans are prepared for      only menial jobs paying low wages.       Solution(s): Stop experimenting and do what works--get back      to basics and pay for excellence. Reward teachers who      cultivate competence. Emphasize math, science, and language      skills, as well as less tangible, but important skills like      inquiry and logic. Recognize sports programs as a way to      teach critical social skills, not as a career path. Treat      standardized testing as a means to excellence, not as an end      in itself. And finally, forget self esteem--it will come on      its own when it is earned.''       Lawrence ``Rip'' Kirby       Rutland, Vt.  Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to share with you these words of wisdom from an average Vermonter. I hope my colleagues in the Senate take note of Mr. Kirby's sage advice.                          ____________________
