 President, let me assure the Senator from New York that I am willing to listen to his stories about how people might be affected by the health care debate that is going on in the Congress right now if he will listen to some of the stories I have to tell. By the middle of June, people in 94 of the 99 counties in Iowa may not be able to buy insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.  Senator Schumer talked about the tough consequences of the House bill on healthcare. I am coming to the Senate floor today to talk about the tough consequences of ObamaCare.  I rise today to speak some more about the Affordable Care Act.
