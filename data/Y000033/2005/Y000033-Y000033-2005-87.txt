Mr. Chairman, as hard as it is for me, I am going to support the gentleman's amendment, but my concern when I look at it is we have got to make sure that this does not come out of the Coast Guard's budget. It either comes out of Homeland Security or some other arena, and that is what we can work out in this bill when we put it in. Because I do not want the Coast Guard's budget to take money and go into it when they raise that alert state.  So I think the gentleman has got a good idea, and I am more than willing to work with him and see if we can solve it. I agree with the gentleman. Because when they put us on a higher alert, even though it might not even be in the arena of a port, it is a national higher alert, and it is a huge cost, and they have to carry that burden.  As long as we get the money from some other source than the Coast Guard, I am highly in support of it.
