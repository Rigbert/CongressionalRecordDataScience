Speaker, last week, the House passed, by 387 5, major legislation that impacts millions of jobs by allowing the faster and safe approval of medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs.  Rather than sending those jobs overseas, they're staying here. The administration's impending tax on medical devices is a ticking time bomb for manufacturing jobs and innovation across the country and especially in Michigan, which is why we need to repeal it and pass this legislation.  Last month, I visited Stryker, a major device manufacturer that is headquartered in Kalamazoo and Portage, Michigan. They reinforced the harmful impacts that this tax will have on our corner of the State. Stryker employs about 2,500 workers in Kalamazoo County. They tell me that the tax is going to cost their company alone $150 million, and that number does not include the millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours that they're going to have to expend on ensuring that they're in compliance with that tax. These are dollars that could be better spent on wages, research, development, and investments in lifesaving technologies, which would not only help the employment sector but, obviously, patients as well. Stryker also recently announced the elimination of 1,000 jobs worldwide, which is a 5 percent reduction in its global sales force. The cause of that reduction: making up the cost for this impending tax.  The President said earlier this year that he would do whatever it takes to create jobs in America. He needs to sign this bill because, without it, it's going to cost jobs--as has been proven in Michigan alone.
