 President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record ``Letters from Vermont and America.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    The Collapse of the Middle Class                    Letters from Vermont and America       Dear Friend, As gas and oil prices soared and as the nation      slipped into recession, I made a request to Vermonters on my      e-mail list. I asked them to tell me what was going on in      their lives economically. That was it. Frankly, I expected a      few dozen replies. I was amazed, therefore, when my office      received over 600 responses from all across the State, as      well as some from other states. This small booklet contains a      few of those letters.       It is one thing to read dry economic statistics which      describe the collapse of the American middle class. It is      another thing to understand, in flesh and blood terms, what      that means in the lives of ordinary Americans. Yes, since      George W. Bush has been in office 5 million Americans have      slipped into poverty, 8 million have lost their health      insurance and 3 million have lost their pensions. Yes, in the      last 7 years median household income for working-age      Americans has declined by $2,500. Yes, our country, for the      first time since the Great Depression, now has a zero      personal savings rate and, all across the Nation, emergency      food shelves are being flooded with working families whose      inadequate wages prevent them from feeding their families.       Statistics are one thing, however, and real life is      another. The responses that I received describe the decline      of the American middle class from the perspective of those      people who are living that decline. They speak about families      who, not long ago, thought they were economically secure, but      now find themselves sinking into desperation and      hopelessness.       These e-mails tell the stories of working families unable      to keep their homes warm in the winter; workers worried about      whether they'll be able to fill their gas tank to get to      their jobs; and seniors, who spent their entire lives      working, now wondering how they'll survive in old age. They      describe the pain and disappointments that parents feel as      they are unable to save money for their kids' college      education, and the dread of people who live without health      insurance.       In order to try and break through the complacency and      isolation inside the Washington Beltway, I have read some of      these stories on the floor of the Senate. It is imperative      that Congress and the corporate media understand the painful      reality facing the middle class today so that we can develop      the appropriate public policy to address this crisis. We must      expand low income home heating assistance, stop oil      profiteering and price gouging, and support programs that      address the growing crisis of hunger in America. The National      Priorities Act (S. 818) that I introduced in this session of      Congress is one example of legislation that would address the      growing crisis.       Let me conclude by thanking all of those people who have so      kindly shared their lives with me through these letters. I      know that for many of you this was not an easy thing to do.                                                   Bernie Sanders,     United States Senator.                                  ____       Here are letters from two mothers in Vermont. The first is      from a woman in rural area; the second is a single mother in      a small city.     We have at times had to choose between baby food and heating          fuel.       My husband and I have lived in Vermont our whole lives. We      have two small children (a baby and a toddler) and felt      fortunate to own our own house and land but due to the      increasing fuel prices we have at times had to choose between      baby food/diapers and     heating fuel. We've run out of heating fuel three times so      far and the baby has ended up in the hospital with pneumonia      two of the times. We try to keep the kids warm with an      electric space heater on those nights, but that just doesn't      do the trick.       My husband does what he can just to scrape enough money for      car fuel each week and we've gone from three vehicles to one      just to try and get by without going further into debt. We      were going to sell the house and rent, but the rent around      here is higher than what we pay for our monthly mortgage and      property taxes combined. Please help.     By February we ran out of wood and I burned my mother's          dining room furniture.       I am a single mother with a 9 year old boy. We lived this      past winter without any heat at all. Fortunately someone gave      me an old wood stove. I had to hook it up to an old/unused      chimney we had in the kitchen. I couldn't even afford a      chimney liner (the price of liners went up with the price of      fuel). To stay warm at night my son and I would pull off all      the pillows from the couch and pile them on the kitchen      floor. I'd hang a blanket from the kitchen doorway and we'd      sleep right there on the floor. By February we ran out of      wood and I burned my mother's dining room furniture. I have      no oil for hot water. We boil our water on the stove and pour      it in the tub. I'd like to order one of your flags and hang      it upside down at the capital building...we are certainly a      country in distress.       These two letters describe the pressures faced by      Vermonters on family life.     Not spending those 10 hours at home with my husband and son          makes a big difference for all of us . . .       As a couple with one child, earning about $55,000/year, we      have been able to eat out a bit, buy groceries and health      insurance, contribute to our retirement funds and live a      relatively comfortable life financially. We've never      accumulated a lot of savings, but our bills were always paid      on time and we never had any interest on our credit card.       Over the last year, even though we've tightened our belts      (not eating out much, watching purchases at the grocery      store, not buying ``extras'' like a new TV, repairing the      washer instead of buying a new one...), and we find ourselves      with over $7,000 of credit card debt and trying to figure out      how to pay for braces for our son.       I work 50 hours per week to help earn extra money to catch      up, but that also takes a toll on the family life--not      spending those 10 hours at home with my husband and son makes      a big difference for all of us. My husband hasn't had a raise      in 3 years, and his employer is looking to cut out any extra      benefits they can to lower their expenses, which will      increase ours.     I want to drop everything I am doing and go visit him.       My 90-year-old father in Connecticut has recently become      ill and asked me to visit him. I want to drop everything I am      doing and go visit him, however, I am finding it hard to save      enough money to add to the extra gas I'll need to get there.      I am self-employed, with my own commercial cleaning service      and money is tight, not only with gas prices, but with      everything. I make more than I did a year ago and I don't      have enough to pay my property taxes this quarter for the      first time in many years. They are due tomorrow.       These letters speak of retirement. One is from an older      Vermont couple who recently stopped working; the second is      from a woman in a small town in Vermont who is thinking about      the future she and her husband face.     We also only eat two meals a day to conserve.       My husband and I are retired and 65. We would have liked to      have worked longer but because of injuries caused at work and      the closing of our factory to go to Canada, we chose to      retire earlier.       Now with oil prices the way they are we cannot afford to      heat our home unless my husband cuts and splits wood, which      is a real hardship as he has had his back fused and should      not be working most of the day to keep up with the wood. Not      only that he has to get up two or three times each night to      keep the fire going.       We also have a 2003 car that we only get to drive to get      groceries or go to the doctor or to visit my mother in the      nursing home three miles away. It now costs us $80.00 a month      to go nowhere. We have 42,000 miles on a 5 year old car.       I have Medicare but I can't afford prescription coverage      unless I take my money out of an annuity, which is supposed      to cover the house payment when my husband's pension is gone.       We also only eat two meals a day to conserve.     My husband and I are very nervous about what will happen to          us when we are old.       Yesterday I paid for our latest home heating fuel delivery:      $1,100. I also paid my $2,000+ credit-card balance, much of      which bought gas and groceries for the month.       My husband and I are very nervous about what will happen to      us when we are old. Although we have three jobs between us      and participate in 403B retirement plans, we have not saved      enough for a realistic post-work life if we survive to our      life expectancy. As we approach the traditional retirement      age, we are slowly paying off our daughter's college tuition      loan and trying to keep our heads above water.       We have always lived frugally. We buy used cars and store      brand groceries, recycle everything, walk or carpool when      possible and plastic our windows each fall. Even so, if/when      our son decides to attend college, we will be in deep debt at      age 65.       P.S. Please don't use my name. I live in a small town, and      this is so embarrassing.       These letters speak about the emotional consequences of the      current economic situation and are from a man who lives in a      small town near the New Hampshire border, and from a woman      who lives in central Vermont.     The pennies have all but dried up . . . Today I am sad,          broken, and very discouraged.       I, too, have been struggling to overcome the increasing      costs of gas, heating oil, food, taxes, etc. I have to say      that this is the toughest year, financially, that I have ever      experienced in my 41 years on this earth. I have what used to      be considered a decent job, I work hard, pinch my pennies,      but the pennies have all but dried up. I am thankful that my      employer understands that many of us cannot afford to drive      to work 5 days a week. Instead, I work three 15-hour days. I      have taken odd jobs to try to make ends meet.       This winter, after keeping the heat just high enough to      keep my pipes from bursting (the bedrooms are not heated and      never got above 30 degrees) I began selling off my      woodworking tools, snowblower, (pennies on the dollar) and      furniture that had been handed down in my family from the      early 1800s, just to keep the heat on.       Today I am sad, broken, and very discouraged. I am thankful      that the winter cold is behind us for a while, but now gas      prices are rising yet again. I just can't keep up.     I don't go to church many Sundays, because the gasoline is          too expensive to drive there.       As a single parent, I am struggling everyday to put food on      the table. Our clothes all come from thrift stores. I have a      5-year-old car that needs work. My son is gifted and      talented. I tried to sell my house to enroll him in a school      that had curriculum available for his special needs. After 2      years on the market, my house never sold. The property taxes      have nearly doubled in 10 years and the oil to heat it is      prohibitive. To meet the needs of my son, I have left the      house sit and moved into an apartment near his high school. I      don't go to church many Sundays, because the gasoline is too      expensive to drive there. Every thought of an activity is      dependent on the cost. I can only purchase food from dented      can stores . . . I am stretched to the breaking point with no      help in sight.       More descriptions of what it feels like to be caught in the      American economy of the early years of the 21st century.      These letters are from a man in north central Vermont and      from a man in rural Pennsylvania.     At the rate we are going we will be destitute in just a few          years.       Due to illness my ability to work has been severely      limited. I am making $10 an hour and if I am lucky I get 35      hours a week of work. At this time I am only getting 20 hours      as it is ``off season'' in Stowe. It does not take a      mathematician to do the figures. How are my wife and I      supposed to live on a monthly take-home income of less than      $800? We do it by spending our hard earned retirement      savings. I am 50 and my wife is 49. At the rate we are going      we will be destitute in just a few years. The situation is so      dire that it is all I can think about.       Soon I will have to start walking to work, an 8-mile round      trip because the price of energy is so high it is that or go      without heat.       As bad as our situation is, I know many in worse shape. We      try to donate food when we do our weekly shopping but now we      are not able to even afford to help our neighbors eat. What      has this country come to?     I am just tired . . . I work 12 to 14 hours daily and it just          doesn't help.       I am 55 years old and worse off than my adult children. I      have worked since age 16. I don't live from paycheck to      paycheck, I live day to day. I can only afford to fill my gas      tank on my payday thereafter, I put $5, $10 whatever that I      can. I cannot afford to buy the food items that I would. I am      riding around daily to and from work with a quarter of a tank      of gas. This is very scary as I can see myself working until      the day that I die. I do not have a savings, no credit cards      and my only resources are thru my employment. I have to drive      to work as there are no buses from my residence to work. I      don't know how much longer I can do this. . . . I am      concerned as gas prices climb daily. I am just tired, the      harder that I work the harder it gets, I work 12 to 14 hours      daily and it just doesn't help.       Two women, the first from the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont,      the second from a small city in Vermont, write about their      situation and their fears.     Now we find that instead of a feeling of comfort, we have a          feeling of dread.       I live in the beautiful Northeast Kingdom. There are only a      handful of decent jobs available, and the wages everywhere      else are not very good. My husband and I have done what we      had to in order to survive and to make a decent life for our      two children, aged 7 and 4. He has worked steadily at a local      plant for 15 years, and I have worked part-time in order to      pay the bills without having to rely on daycare. We live a      modest life and do not live beyond our means. We have no      flat-screen TV, no cell phones, no iPods, and have only one      vehicle payment. We thought that finally, maybe, we would be      able to get ahead.       Now we find that instead of a feeling of comfort, we have a      feeling of dread. It seems like every time we do the right      thing and try to move ahead for our family, something out of      our control happens in order to slap us back down. I have      always been a big pusher of ``if you can do something to      change your situation, do it.'' Now, even though we are doing      everything right, my husband and I find ourselves extremely      worried about this winter. I have no answers as to how to      make the oil prices lower.       My husband and I have tried, again, to do the right things      by limiting our driving and by setting the heat at 68 degrees      all winter. We even had our home made as energy efficient as      possible, yet we now find ourselves unsure if we will be able      to pay for both the mortgage and our oil next winter.     Some nights we eat cereal and toast for dinner because that's          all I have.       I am a working mother of two young children. I currently      pay on average around $80.00 a week for gas so that I can go      to work. I see the effects of the gas increase at the grocery      stores and at the department stores. On average I spend      around $150.00 per week at the grocery store and trust me      when I say I don't buy prime rib--I buy just enough to get us      through the week and I can't afford to make sure we have      seven wholesome meals to eat every night of the week--some      nights we eat cereal and toast for dinner because that's all      I have. My family has had to cancel our annual trip to the      zoo, and we make less trips to see our families in another      town due to the increase of gas. The price of gas has created      a hardship for most average Americans. We have less money to      pay to living expenses which have also increased. It seems as      if it's just a rippling effect. I am really scared of what      the future holds for me and my kids because I just simply      cannot afford to live from day to day. I am getting further      and further in credit card debt just trying to stay afloat.       Some letters are from people who work in health care and      report on what is happening in their towns. The first of      these is from a small town in north-central Vermont; the      second is from a small town in the state of Washington.     Insurance costs continue to rise causing some to forgo          insurance to pay for gasoline, heating fuel and          groceries.       As the chief of a small ambulance service, I have seen the      impact of rising costs.       As a service made up of primarily volunteers, we have seen      our numbers decline. When soliciting for volunteers from the      community, we have been told that they are unable to put the      time in due to the need to work more just to pay their bills.       Our costs associated with running an ambulance have also      risen in the last few years. When discussing with our      suppliers, fuel prices play a large part in the increase--     both to manufacture and to transport.       We are hearing from more and more Vermonters that insurance      costs continue to rise causing some to forgo insurance to pay      for gasoline, heating fuel and groceries.       In speaking with other ambulance services both volunteer      and paid, most including ours, are delaying purchases on      major equipment such as ambulance replacements, due to      limited funding. This means we have older equipment, and      higher maintenance costs.     Dentistry is expensive and people are opting not to come to          the dentist.       I live in Washington. I drive about 10 miles to work every      day. I drive an eight-year-old car that gets about 25 miles      per gallon. My husband is a contractor and drives a small      pickup truck that gets very poor mileage. Together I have      estimated that we spend about $300 a month on gas. This has a      tremendous effect on our budget. We are watching every penny      we spend.       I work in a dental clinic that is also seeing a slowdown.      Dentistry is expensive and people are opting not to come to      the dentist or not getting the optimal dentistry they need. I      spoke to the medical doctor across the hall from our office.      He was telling us that they too have seen a slowdown in their      practice. People are forgoing a trip to the doctor to save      money. One of my patients told me a story yesterday about a      food bank in town that is finding it difficult to keep its      shelves full. They had a realtor who was a regular      contributor. Now she was coming to get food for herself. The      cost of food is rising at a tremendous rate.       Rising gas prices have an effect on medical care as well,      as this letter from an oncology social worker in a Vermont      city reveals.     I cannot describe how devastating it has been for these folks          who need to travel great distances to get to/from their          cancer treatment.       My story involves my capacity as an oncology social worker      working with cancer patients in an outpatient clinic. I also      run an emergency fund through the Cancer Patient Support      Program which provides funds to cancer patients in need      during their cancer journey, including initial diagnosis,      surgery, and treatment period in which they experience a      significant decrease in income during a medical leave.       I cannot describe how devastating it has been for these      folks who need to travel great distances to get to/from their      cancer treatment and followup care with the way gas prices      have been!       Many of these folks need to travel on a daily basis to      radiation therapy for several weeks while others come from      surrounding counties every one to two weeks for chemotherapy.      It [the high price of gas] has had a tremendous impact on our      ability to provide the financial assistance through our      emergency fund to all those in need.       Someone with cancer who has to get treatment has no choice      in how many times they need to travel great distances. They      have to have reliable transportation, and thus need access to      gas for their cars, or another family member's car, to get to      their treatment and followup care.       This is becoming increasingly difficult as gas prices      continue to rise and our emergency fund cannot meet all the      financial needs of these patients.       This is the story of a woman who lives in a suburban      community near Burlington, Vermont. Following it is a short      letter from a senior citizen in a very small town in the      mountains of central Vermont.     I feel as though I am between a rock and a hard place no          matter how hard I try to adjust my budget for the month.       First of all, I am a single mother of a 16 year old      daughter. I own a condominium. I have worked at the hospital      for 16 years and make a very good salary, in the high $40,000      range.       I own a 2005 Honda Civic. I filled up my gas tank      yesterday, April 1, and it cost me almost $43. That was at      $3.22 per gallon. If prices stay at that level, it will cost      me $160 per month to fill up my gas tank. A year ago it cost      me under $20 to fill up my tank. Which would have amounted to      approximately $80 per month. I now have to decide what      errands I really need to run and what things I can do over      the phone or on the Internet. But the other issue is if I use      my cell phone too much during the month my bill will increase      and that will cost me more money.       I feel as though I am between a rock and a hard place no      matter how hard I try to adjust my budget for the month. I am      watching my purchases in the grocery store and department      stores more closely because of increased prices. I am not      sure that I can afford to take a summer vacation this year. I      usually take a day off during my daughter's spring vacation      so we can go shopping in New Hampshire somewhere. I have      already cancelled those plans for this year. I am hoping that      I can take a few days off this summer to go to Maine. We will      see how the gas prices are this summer but I hear it is going      to get worse. Not much hope for someone on a tight budget.     I have been forced to go back to work.       I am a 71 year old man and have been retired since 2000.      With the price of fuel oil I have been forced to go back to      work just to heat my home and pay my property taxes.       These two women who live in small towns in central Vermont      write about their sense that their families are sinking,      economically.     We would like to not have to worry about where our next meal          will come from.       I am a registered school nurse in Vermont, and my husband      is a self-employed bread baker. We are in our mid 30's and      have two young children. We always thought that if we went to      college, earned 4-year degrees, and worked hard, that we      would be able to live a decent life. We have no desire to be      wealthy, but would like to not have to worry about where our      next meal will come from.       As you know, wheat prices are soaring. Over the last year,      he has seen his price per 50-pound bag of flour increase      about $10 or more (last week alone, price per bag went up      $2.75). We are feeling distraught that we may never ``get      ahead'' but will always be pedaling to just keep up . . .      Employed in Vermont since 1997, I will be paying back my      nursing loans for a long time--longer now that we just can't      keep up with the rising costs of oil and wheat.       My husband and I both work very, very hard to provide      needed services to our Vermont communities. Yet we scratch      our heads when trying to budget our income. How can it be      that two college-educated individuals with respectable      careers are in such a financial bind?     My husband and I followed all the rules . . . Slowly, though,          we have sunk back to the `poor' days.       My husband and I followed all the rules. He grew up in      urban projects and went into the military with Vietnam      service so he could get GI Bill benefits and go to college. I      grew up picking strawberries as a migrant worker, but had a      mother who so pressed education that I was able to go to      college on scholarship and by working full time nights in a      mental hospital. My husband and I worked hard to buy a home,      maintain good credit, even taking government jobs because we      truly wanted to help others. I became disabled and unable to      work, but we managed to live a middle-class life on one      salary.       Slowly, though, we have sunk back to the `poor' days. Our      heating oil bill, gas prices, food prices--well, you know the      story. Even a pizza is a splurge now. The interest on our      meager savings doesn't seem worth keeping the money in the      bank. We're so much more fortunate than many others, since we      can still meet our bills, but we're scared that we'll drop      beneath that level soon. It doesn't seem right that after      working hard and following all the rules for our lives, now,      at 60, we're tumbling down.       These two letters, one from a man in a Chicago suburb, and      one from a teacher in Vermont's Connecticut River Valley,      also speak of the sense of falling behind in the 21st century      American economy.     It costs me so much money in gas that my wife and I live on          $6 per day to eat.       My job was transferred to China 8 years ago. No jobs were      available in my field. I tried to do everything I possibly      could do in finding another job outside of my field but      failed. My unemployment ran out. I lost everything: House,      cars and the will to live. My wife and I moved into my in-     law's basement after this catastrophe. I regained my never-     give-up outlook on life. I went back to school. I spent      $13,000 on my education to become a residential home      inspector. That market is in turmoil, and I can't make any      money in it these days. I am still self-employed now      performing various inspections on the commercial side within      the northern half of Illinois. I drive on average 250 miles      per day. It costs me so much money in gas that my wife and I      live on $6 per day to eat. I can't afford health insurance      for my wife and I because that money is in the gas tank every      week. The irony of it is my wife is a nurse. She's expecting      the doctor she works with to close his office any day now      because he's behind in his malpractice insurance. His      premiums are too high and he's 120 days past due on his      office lease payments because he's trying to keep the      malpractice insurance in effect. He stopped offering health      insurance to his employees 2 years ago with his increasing      costs. I still live in a basement. Do you need any more      evidence that our country and our leaders have failed me?     How much more of a hit can people take? The future looks          extremely bleak to me.       Bernie, I am so frightened for next year, as I struggle      daily this year. I drive past the gas stations and see the      price go up. Those prices are going up even 10 cents a gallon      in one day.       What about heating fuel next year? I spent this winter with      my heat turned down to 53 degrees, varying it only for a few      hours after I returned home from work. I have my master's      degree and am a teacher. I am struggling so hard in my new      home. It's a double wide and I've waited 50 years to get my      own home. Now, I am worried I won't be able to keep it as      everything else is going up, except my salary, which next      year will only go up slightly more than 1 percent.       The middle class is no longer the middle class...I've      slipped into the lower class after a winter of double heating      costs and now these new economic hits. How much more of a hit      can people take? The future looks extremely bleak to me. I      worry constantly about how I am going to pay my bills.       The first letter is from a young person in a small, rural,      college town in Vermont. The second was written by a woman      who lives in a city on the Gulf Coast of Florida.     I am now living out of my car.       As a student and a part time employee working for just      above minimum wage I have found it more and more difficult to      survive under these conditions. The drive to school and work      require me to use roughly 30 percent of my paycheck just to      go where I need to, to make it through my day.       When school is in session I am lucky to get about 170      dollars a week and with gas prices at their current all time      high I am continually finding myself under hardships because      of it. Recently I had to vacate my apartment because I could      not afford to pay rent and I am now living out of my car.      This too seems like it may not be able to last that much      longer because I am encountering difficulties in making my      car payment.       I can remember when gas prices were a little over a dollar      and I dream about life taking that turn once more. Because of      the gas prices I have found nothing but an extremely low      budget for food, I was forced out of my home and now I might      lose the one thing that is allowing me to continue my      schooling and keep going to work--my car.       I am struggling to understand why prices continue to rise      and I see no end in sight.     Our life style has drastically changed in the past 12 months.       I travel over 30 miles one way (60 miles roundtrip). My car      requires high test which is now $3.95/gal. I have approached      my company about doing a survey of its employees to see how      many co-workers travel over 20 miles one way, and suggested      that we start to work on a commuter policy. I suggested four      10-hour work days, telecommuting, setting up car pools,      setting up incentives for car poolers. I was turned down. I      was able to find another person who was interested in car      pooling & we have started to do that. I take breakfast,      coffee, lunch, and snacks to work daily. I do not go to the      hair dresser or nail salon as I used to. We stopped taking      weekend trips and plan to see our children in NJ only once      this year. Between the 30 percent credit card interest rates,      fuel cost, and food increases our life style has drastically      changed in the past 12 months.       Two women from Vermont write about what the economy is      doing to them and their families.     My mortgage is behind, we are at risk for foreclosure, and I          can't keep up with my car payments.       I am a 31 year old wife, mother of two. How has this      affected me? My husband drives 35 miles to work, that is a      one-way trip. He is putting an average of $80 a week into his      gas tank. No, he doesn't drive an SUV or a half-ton work      truck. It's a small pickup truck that he needs as he builds      houses. The kicker is that he never puts more than half a      tank in, because we can't afford to fill it. I drive 15 miles      one way, and put about $40 a week into my 30-miles-to-the-     gallon car. Again, I never fill the tank--ever. We have even      contemplated having my husband quit his job because he isn't      making much more money weekly than he spends on gas. We could      move to an area that is closer to our jobs, but because of      the market, we cannot sell our house fast enough, or for a      fair price.       Meanwhile, my mortgage is behind, we are at risk for      foreclosure, and I can't keep up with my car payments. My      parents, both in their 60's, are back to work so that they      can make ends meet, and struggle to come up with enough gas      money so they can get to doctor's appointments. They are      opting to close their house up for the winter, and stay with      my uncle so they don't have to put oil in their furnace. I      can't tell you how many times we had to fill our little gas      tanks with kerosene or diesel because we ran out of oil and      couldn't afford the $380 it would cost us to put a mere 100      gallons in. Needless to say, we are way behind on all of our      bills, we are still playing catch up with our winter      expenses. People that I know that have never struggled with      money, are now frequenting our local food shelf so they can      feed their families staple foods. Please listen to our pleas      and put ethics first.     We are barely staying afloat.       My family has been hit so hard by this economy, we are      barely staying afloat. We have remortgaged the house 4 times      in the last three years to pay credit card debt. Now we are      trying to tap into our annuity to pay more credit card debt.      The debts on the credit cards are all for bills. Mostly      grocery, oil and the mere cost of living.       My husband is a union carpenter and they just changed our      fantastic insurance plan to a terrible one with barely any      coverage. I have none of my doctors on it and I suffer from      painful nerve damage. I am not eligible for social security      disability and I am unable to work.       We had a dream to own our own home, and that dream came      true seven years ago. I am afraid our dream is slipping      through our fingers and it won't be long before we lose our      home, the way things are going.       A young couple in Burlington, Vermont writes of their      situation and their concerns.     I wonder some times if we should try to follow our dreams--         decide to have children?       Even after we bought our house, there was a time when I      could save a little here and there and feel secure and      hopeful for the future.       Recently, I have been trying to stretch out time between      grocery trips and have chosen to postpone necessary repairs      to our house simply because we just don't have the money to      do so.       We are frugal people with simple spending habits, mainly      food and our house expenses. We ride bicycles, buy bulk foods      and used clothing, repair and mend before buying new, and we      love this life.       But if we can't fix our roof, or become malnourished from      food choices on a family income of $50,000 yr, then what does      the future hold for the next generation?       I wonder some times if we should try to follow our dreams--     decide to have children? Try to buy a farm? All of these      thoughts lead me to another emotion--sadness.       These letters, the first from a single mother in Vermont,      the second from a retired couple also in Vermont, ask      questions that we as a Nation should listen to.     People say, `Cut back.'       I am a single mother, owning a home, preparing to send a      son to college, and working two jobs most of the time. While      I am managing to keep my house (I think I'm upside down given      the slump in market value), I am falling behind on my bills      and have to use my credit card more often for necessities.       People say, `Cut back.'       When I look at my bank and credit card statements, I see;      gas, groceries, gas, fuel oil, gas, groceries, school-related      activities, car maintenance, gas, electricity. Cut back on      what? The occasional pizza between jobs and athletic events?      The trip to college to seek financial aid? Clothes for work      and school?     Does anybody have a solution? Does anybody in Washington          care?       Thanks for your invitation to talk with you. We are      retired, 70 and 65 and living on Social Security and some      savings.       Like most Vermonters we use wood to offset the price of      being warm. Our last oil fill up was nearly $700. How can we      continue to make ends meet? My gasoline cost $239 last month.      Food and everything else we buy is going up every week      because of gouging from oil companies. We are worried about      the national debt and the trade deficit. What can be done to      bring them down? Does anybody have a solution? Does anybody      in Washington care?                          ____________________
