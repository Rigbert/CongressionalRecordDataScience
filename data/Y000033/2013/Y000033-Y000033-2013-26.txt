Mr. Chairman, the Corps has been good, but they are expanding. They just spent money, instead of on solving a problem, on a UAV, and they spent $2.3 million on a yacht. There is no reason for that, Mr. Chairman; there is no reason.  This doesn't keep them from surveying, it doesn't keep them from contracting, but I don't want them to expand this program. We have another government agency, and we are trying to save money and we are going to allow them to expand it. I know how these agencies go. They will start buying more and more and they will expand and say, We don't have to contract anymore. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, you know that is true. I have watched these agencies. As chairman of this committee, I watched them and tried to stop them. This is not the time to spend money foolishly. We have the contractors out there. Let's use them where they are available. Let's not let them build a machine within the Corps of Engineers themselves. Keep that in mind. You ought to adopt this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).  The amendment was rejected.           Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Florida  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 113-251.
