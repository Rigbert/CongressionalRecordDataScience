Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate a remarkable team of young women from Maryland's fifth congressional district. The Huntingtown Hurricanes won the 3A Maryland state track and field finals on May 28, becoming the first high school team in Calvert County history to bring home a state championship title. This momentous victory was made all the more significant given the caliber of their competition.  Following an arduous, three day meet at Morgan State University's Hughes Stadium, the Hurricanes edged out John F. Kennedy High School and Catonsville High School, who tied with 47 points, by just one-and-a-half points.  This victory demonstrates that with hard work, determination, and discipline, we can reach our goals. For the past three years, the Huntingtown Hurricanes have placed second in the 3A South Region--a significant achievement--but this year, the team broke through and won the 3A South Region meet on May 21.  Fourteen student-athletes qualified for the state meet, and they remained focused and determined to achieve their dream of victory at the statewide competition.  I want to applaud Head Coach Valerie Harrington and her coaching staff--Mike Henshaw, Jim Hall, Raffaele Simpson and Deb Fillippi--for their dedication and commitment to training these superb student-athletes. And I send my hardiest congratulations to the members of the championship team--Cassidy Aley, Linsey Aley, Maia Burke, Diarra Butler, Shania Collins, Erin Dix, Taylor Fallin, Ellie Frazier, Zanae Freeland, Mercedes Jackson, Payton Muse, Leea Parker, Shelby Taylor, and Hanna Weis--on their victory. I'm very proud of these young women, and I congratulate all those involved in bringing home the championship title.  Let me close by echoing Coach Harrington's sentiments after the meet. She proudly stated that this was a banner year and one that will go down in the history of Huntingtown's girls' track and field program. I know that many other women's teams will win the title in the future, but this year's Hurricanes can always hold their heads high and recall that they were the first team to win for Calvert County.  I ask that my colleagues join me in applauding this significant accomplishment.                          ____________________
