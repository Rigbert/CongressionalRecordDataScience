 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Rules for the Committee on Finance, for the 109th Congress, be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          COMMITTEE ON FINANCE                         I. RULES OF PROCEDURE                       (Adopted January 25, 2005)       Rule 1. Regular Meeting Days.--The regular meeting day of      the committee shall be the second and fourth Tuesday of each      month, except that if there be no business before the      committee the regular meeting shall be omitted.       Rule 2. Committee Meetings.--(a) Except as provided by      paragraph 3 of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate      (relating to special meetings called by a majority of the      committee) and subsection (b) of this rule, committee      meetings, for the conduct of business, for the purpose of      holding hearings, or for any other purpose, shall be called      by the chairman after consultation with the ranking minority      member. Members will be notified of committee meetings at      least 48 hours in advance, unless the chairman determines      that an emergency situation requires a meeting on shorter      notice. The notification will include a written agenda      together with materials prepared by the staff relating to      that agenda. After the agenda for a committee meeting is      published and distributed, no nongermane items may be brought      up during that meeting unless at least two-thirds of the      members present agree to consider those items.       (b) In the absence of the chairman, meetings of the      committee may be called by the ranking majority member of the      committee who is present, provided authority to call meetings      has been delegated to such member by the chairman.       Rule 3. Presiding Officer.--(a) The chairman shall preside      at all meetings and hearings of the committee except that in      his absence the ranking majority member who is present at the      meeting shall preside.       (b) Notwithstanding the rule prescribed by subsection (a)      any member of the committee may preside over the conduct of a      hearing.       Rule 4. Quorums.--(a) Except as provided in subsection (b)      one-third of the membership of the committee, including not      less than one member of the majority party and one member of      the minority party, shall constitute a quorum for the conduct      of business.       (b) Notwithstanding the rule prescribed by subsection (a),      one member shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of      conducting a hearing.       Rule 5. Reporting of Measures or Recommendations.--No      measure or recommendation shall be reported from the      committee unless a majority of the committee is actually      present and a majority of those present concur.       Rule 6. Proxy Voting; Polling.--(a) Except as provided by      paragraph 7(a)(3) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the      Senate (relating to limitation on use of proxy voting to      report a measure or matter), members who are unable to be      present may have their vote recorded by proxy.       (b) At the discretion of the committee, members who are      unable to be present and whose vote has not been cast by      proxy may be polled for the purpose of recording their vote      on any rollcall taken by the committee.       Rule 7. Order of Motions.--When several motions are before      the committee dealing with related or overlapping matters,      the chairman may specify the order in which the motions shall      be voted upon.       Rule 8. Bringing a Matter to a Vote.--If the chairman      determines that a motion or amendment has been adequately      debated, he may call for a vote on such motion or amendment,      and the vote shall then be     taken, unless the committee votes to continue debate on such      motion or amendment, as the case may be. The vote on a motion      to continue debate on any motion or amendment shall be taken      without debate.       Rule 9. Public Announcement of Committee Votes.--Pursuant      to paragraph 7(b) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the      Senate (relating to public announcement of votes), the      results of rollcall votes taken by the committee on any      measure (or amendment thereto) or matter shall be announced      publicly not later than the day on which such measure or      matter is ordered reported from the committee.       Rule 10. Subpoenas.--Witnesses and memoranda, documents,      and records may be subpoenaed by the chairman of the      committee with the agreement of the ranking minority member      or by a majority vote of the committee. Subpoenas for      attendance of witnesses and the production of memoranda,      documents, and records shall be issued by the chairman, or by      any other member of the committee designated by him.       Rule  11.  Nominations.--In considering a nomination, the      Committee may conduct an investigation or review of the      nominee's experience, qualifications, and suitability, to      serve in the position to which he or she has been nominated.      To aid in such investigation or review, each nominee may be      required to submit a sworn detailed statement including      biographical, financial, policy, and other information which      the Committee may request. The Committee may specify which      items in such statement are to be received on a confidential      basis. Witnesses called to testify on the nomination may be      required to testify under oath.       Rule 12. Open Committee Hearings.--To the extent required      by paragraph 5 of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the      Senate (relating to limitations on open hearings), each      hearing conducted by the committee shall be open to the      public.       Rule 13. Announcement of Hearings.--The committee shall      undertake consistent with the provisions of paragraph 4(a) of      Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate (relating to      public notice of committee hearings) to issue public      announcements of hearings it intends to hold at least one      week prior to the commencement of such hearings.       Rule 14. Witnesses at Hearings.--(a) Each witness who is      scheduled to testify at any hearing must submit his written      testimony to the staff director not later than noon of the      business day immediately before the last business day      preceding the day on which he is scheduled to appear. Such      written testimony shall be accompanied by a brief summary of      the principal points covered in the written testimony. Having      submitted his written testimony, the witness shall be allowed      not more than ten minutes for oral presentation of his      statement.       (b) Witnesses may not read their entire written testimony,      but must confine their oral presentation to a summarization      of their arguments.       (c) Witnesses shall observe proper standards of dignity,      decorum and propriety while presenting their views to the      committee. Any witness who violates this rule shall be      dismissed, and his testimony (both oral and written) shall      not appear in the record of the hearing.       (d) In scheduling witnesses for hearings, the staff shall      attempt to schedule witnesses so as to attain a balance of      views early in the hearings. Every member of the committee      may designate witnesses who will appear before the committee      to testify. To the extent that a witness designated by a      member cannot be scheduled to testify during the time set      aside for the hearing, a special time will be set aside for      the witness to testify if the member designating that witness      is available at that time to chair the hearing.       Rule 15. Audiences.--Persons admitted into the audience for      open hearings of the committee shall conduct themselves with      the dignity, decorum, courtesy and propriety traditionally      observed by the Senate. Demonstrations of approval or      disapproval of any statement or act by any member or witness      are not allowed. Persons creating confusion or distractions      or otherwise disrupting the orderly proceeding of the hearing      shall be expelled from the hearing.       Rule 16. Broadcasting of Hearings.--(a) Broadcasting of      open hearings by television or radio coverage shall be      allowed upon approval by the chairman of a request filed with      the staff director not later than noon of the day before the      day on which such coverage is desired.       (b) If such approval is granted, broadcasting coverage of      the hearing shall be conducted unobtrusively and in      accordance with the standards of dignity, propriety, courtesy      and decorum traditionally observed by the Senate.       (c) Equipment necessary for coverage by television and      radio media shall not be installed in, or removed from, the      hearing room while the committee is in session.       (d) Additional lighting may be installed in the hearing      room by the media in order to raise the ambient lighting      level to the lowest level necessary to provide adequate      television coverage of the hearing at the then current state      of the art of television coverage.       (e) The additional lighting authorized by subsection (d) of      this rule shall not be directed into the eyes of any members      of the committee or of any witness, and at the request of any      such member or witness, offending lighting shall be      extinguished.       (f) No witness shall be required to be photographed at any      hearing or to give testimony while the broadcasting (or      coverage) of that hearing is being conducted. At the request      of any such witness who does not wish to be subjected to      radio or television coverage, all equipment used for coverage      shall be turned off.       Rule 17. Subcommittees.--(a) The chairman, subject to the      approval of the committee, shall appoint legislative      subcommittees. The ranking minority member shall recommend to      the chairman appointment of minority members to the      subcommittees. All legislation shall be kept on the full      committee calendar unless a majority of the members present      and voting agree to refer specific legislation to an      appropriate subcommittee.       (b) The chairman may limit the period during which House-     passed legislation referred to a subcommittee under paragraph      (a) will remain in that subcommittee. At the end of that      period, the legislation will be restored to the full      committee calendar. The period referred to in the preceding      sentences should be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event      that adjournment or a long recess is imminent.       (c) All decisions of the chairman are subject to approval      or modification by a majority vote of the committee.       (d) The full committee may at any time by majority vote of      those members present discharge a subcommittee from further      consideration of a specific piece of legislation.       (e) Because the Senate is constitutionally prohibited from      passing revenue legislation originating in the Senate,      subcommittees may mark up legislation originating in the      Senate and referred to them under Rule 16(a) to develop      specific proposals for full committee consideration but may      not report such legislation to the full committee. The      preceding sentence does not apply to nonrevenue legislation      originating in the Senate.       (f) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve      as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which      they do not serve as voting members.       (g) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by      any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before      that subcommittee.       (h) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the      staff director to insure that--       (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee      is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;       (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full      committee is holding hearings; and       (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same      time.       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may      meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two      subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the      approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of      the committee and subcommittees involved.       (i) All nominations shall be considered by the full      committee.       (j) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably      frequent meetings of the full committee to permit      consideration of legislation reported favorably to the      committee by the subcommittees.       Rule 18. Transcripts of Committee Meetings.--An accurate      record shall be kept of all markups of the committee, whether      they be open or closed to the public. This record, marked as      ``uncorrected,'' shall be available for inspection by Members      of the Senate, or members of the committee together with      their staffs, at any time. This record shall not be published      or made public in any way except:       (a) By majority vote of the committee after all members of      the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to correct      their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately reflect      statements made.       (b) Any member may release his own remarks made in any      markup of the committee provided that every member or witness      whose remarks are contained in the released portion is given      a reasonable opportunity before release to correct their      remarks.       Notwithstanding the above, in the case of the record of an      executive session of the committee that is closed to the      public pursuant to Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the      Senate, the record shall not be published or made public in      any way except by majority vote of the committee after all      members of the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to      correct their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately      reflect statements made.       Rule 19. Amendment of Rules.--The foregoing rules may be      added to, modified, amended or suspended at any time.                          ____________________[Pages S425-S426]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                RULES OF PROCEDURE, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
