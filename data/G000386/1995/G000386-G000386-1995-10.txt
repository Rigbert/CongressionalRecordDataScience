 President, I rise in support of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Just as many thought they would never see the Berlin Wall fall, this is a day that I never thought I would see--the U.S. Congress passing a balanced budget that uses realistic economic assumptions, not rosy scenarios.  Over a year ago, Republicans campaigned to balance the budget and cut taxes. The American people have become justifiably cynical about politicians making promises to get elected. Well, this budget can be summed up in one phrase: promise made, promise kept.  The Balanced Budget Act keeps our commitment to the American people; we do balance the budget. And only after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office certified that the Republican plan achieves a balanced budget did we turn to providing working families tax relief.  And let's be clear, in 1996, 88 percent of the tax cuts will go to families earning under $100,000, 72 percent to families earning under $75,000.  These tax cuts are targeted to help families with a $500 per child tax credit, a tax credit to help families meet the costs of adoption and relief from the marriage penalty.  These tax cuts will also help family farms and small businesses by reducing the estate tax and lowering capital gains.  Republicans promised tax relief for working families and we have delivered.  Mr. President, while Republicans have kept their promises to the voters, President Clinton seems to want to forget the promises he made. His alternative is to ``just say no.'' He stated that he would balance the budget in 5 years, then he said 7 years, then 10 years. He has done more flips and flops than a flapjack.  Now President Clinton is going to veto the continuing resolution that simply states that the Congress and the President should agree to reach a balanced budget in 7 years based on realistic economic assumptions. It doesn't say how that should be reached, just that a balanced budget should be the goal.  I should note that several Democrats in both the House and the Senate voted for this commonsense continuing resolution calling for a balanced budget in 7 years. They are sincere in wanting a balanced budget. My hope is that more conscientious Democrats will join this bipartisan effort for a balanced budget.  However, my concern is that still too many of my colleagues are like the old man who says: ``How do I know what I think, until I've heard what I've said.'' Likewise, many in Congress don't know how to vote until they hear from the White House. I encourage my colleagues to put the people of this country first, before the shortsighted partisan politics practiced by the White House.  Mr. President, the American people are beginning to realize the White House is engaging in gamesmanship instead of statesmanship. The great Republican President, Abraham Lincoln was certainly right, ``You can't fool all the people all the time.'' This administration is going to learn this lesson the hard way.  My mail is now running four-to-one in favor of Republicans standing firm to their commitments for a balanced budget and tax relief for working families. The phone calls are overwhelmingly in favor of the Republicans effort to preserve Medicare and reform the current disastrous Great Society Welfare programs--both part of this Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  In talking to my colleagues they are finding the same reaction. The American people are listening and considering what is being done here in Washington. And they are supporting Republican efforts to keep the promises made to the voters last fall.  And why is public opinion shifting? The sad truth is becoming clear to Americans--President Clinton has no interest in balancing the budget. President Clinton's top interest is appeasing the special interests that still control the Democratic Party.  And what do these special interests want? They want to spend more, more, and more of the taxpayers' money. The special interests don't want a balanced budget and tax cuts for working families, that would mean less money for them to spend.  It seems the White House is completely captive to the special interests. They still believe that big government should dictate how to spend the taxpayers' money instead of families making the decisions. I thought President Clinton said he got the message from the November elections. Unfortunately, it appears he was listening to the special interests instead of the public interest.  Mr. President, this is a momentous vote. This is a vote for a real future for our children and grandchildren. For a stronger more productive economy. It is a vote to preserve Medicare and reform welfare.  I urge all my colleagues to stop listening to pollsters and the special interests who are running the White House and instead of listening to the American people who want us to keep our promises, to not break faith, and to pass the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  Mr. President, I now want to briefly highlight a few specific provisions that I am particularly pleased are incorporated in the 1995 Balanced Budget Act.  First, is the new student loan interest deduction. I have long fought for the appropriate national investment in education. Once again the United States is investing in the minds of its people in addition to the fixed assets of its businesses.  Mr. President, we also promised more choices in health care for Medicare beneficiaries. The Medicare reforms contained in this bill are going to make that possible. It is also going to be good for my State of Iowa.  Medicare is now going to reimburse for health care services much more fairly in Iowa than has been the case in the past. We have greatly increased the Medicare per capita payments that will be made in Iowa in the coming years.  This action is going to give our Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa more health care choices than is presently the case. We have also narrowed the variation in Medicare's reimbursement from one area of the country to another, so that there will be greater equity in the use of our hard-earned tax and premium dollars.  I also want to point out that we have secured a number of very important health provisions which are going to help preserve the rural health infrastructure in Iowa:  The bill includes legislation I introduced earlier this year to restart the Medicare Dependent Hospital Program. This is going to provide greater financial support for at least 29 small rural hospitals around Iowa.  In addition, this bill includes my legislation to reform the Medicare reimbursement for physician assistants and nurse practitioners which will also help improve access to primary care services in rural Iowa.  These are just a few examples of the many good provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, and underscore the importance of passing this historic legislation.                     regarding environmental issues
