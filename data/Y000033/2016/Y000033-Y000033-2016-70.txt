Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate a group of outstanding students from West Valley High School in Fairbanks, Alaska who participated in the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program.  The We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program, administered by the Center for Civic Education, complements regular school curricula by providing upper elementary, middle, and high school studentswith an innovative course of instruction on the history and principles of U.S. constitutional democracy.  The We the People program's culminating activity is a simulated Congressional hearing in which students evaluate and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. These young constitutional experts from West Valley High School won the state competition in Alaska on December 2, 2015 and qualified for the We the People national finals competition held in Washington, D.C.  The students from West Valley High School who qualified to compete at the national competition are:  Alicia Alabran, Dylan Brabham, Jennifer Campbell, Mitch Wilson, Robin O'Donoghue, Ileana Casiano, Skylar Watt, Emma Wiegand, Samuel Hiltenbrand, Daniel Hornbuckle, Teddy Edquid, Colton Scribner, Teresa Wrobel, Jacqueline Lundberg, Natilly Hovda, Carl Birchard, Caleb Moretz, Jonathan Gates, Jewel Hediger, Siani Post, Amber Szmyd, Jenna Zusi-Cobb, Nicholas Kowalski, Tara Vaughn, Brinley Jarvis, Hunter Meltvedt, and Celia Richards.  I would like to recognize their teacher Amy Gallaway for her dedication and contributions as one of the top civics teachers in the country. I would also like to recognize Alaska's We the People state coordinator, Maida Buckley, who has done such an outstanding job throughout the years organizing and directing the program for our state.                          ____________________
