 President, I am delighted that we last week reached a compromise enabling Congress to send another 5-year reauthorization of the Debbie Smith Act to the President's desk this week. Both Chambers' adoption of that compromise, which passed the Senate by voice vote last night, with my support, signals Congress's continued support for the DNA Backlog and Capacity Enhancement Program.  Earlier this year, I called for reforms to the grant program that the Debbie Smith Act established. These reforms, suggested this year by the Government Accountability Office, would require both that the Justice Department articulate measurable, program-wide goals and that the National Institute of Justice take additional steps to prevent lobbying-related conflicts of interest. They would not resolve every issue with this grant program, but I believe the implementation of such reforms would substantially strengthen the program. I also advocated for reforms, which are included in the final legislation, that ensure the analysis of untested DNA in sexual assault cases is accorded higher priority under this program.  As mentioned earlier this week, I have called on the Attorney General to implement several of my proposed reforms through administrative action. I thank the Attorney General for committing to do so, in the attached letter dated December 11, 2019. My letter to the Attorney General on this subject, dated December 9, 2019, also is attached, and I ask unanimous consent that both letters be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2019.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. John Cornyn,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley and Senator Cornyn: This responds to      your letter to the Attorney General dated December 9, 2019,      regarding the DNA Capacity Enhancement for Backlog Reduction      (CEBR) Program. We write to assure you that the Department of      Justice places a high priority on the Government      Accountability Office's (GAO) reports and recommendations.      The recommendations from the 2019 GAO report regarding the      CEBR program are being addressed by the Office of Justice      Programs, and specifically, by the National Institute of      Justice (NIJ).       In particular, NIJ concurs with the recommendations in the      2019 GAO report regarding performance measures. To create and      implement appropriate and meaningful performance measures NIJ      has: conducted an in-depth analysis of currently available      program performance data to identify information gaps; made      corresponding modifications to program performance measures      to address these gaps; aligned its performance measures with      consistently articulated program goals and permitted program      activities; clearly delineated between measures intended to      capture the state of DNA backlog and laboratory throughout,      and those measures intended to gauge grant program impact;      made clarifications to promote consistency in grant recipient      data reporting; augmented its measures to efficiently capture      the level of DNA funding used for outsourcing DNA sample      analysis (which accounted for approximately only 10 percent      of program costs for FY 2015 award recipients).       Consistent with the recommendations in the GAO report, NIJ      will communicate enhancements to DNA CEBR program measures      starting in calendar year 2020 and continuing through 2020.      This will occur in advance of updated performance measures      that will appear in the FY 2021 DNA CEBR Program      solicitation. Grant recipients will be required to report      against the specific articulated updated measures thereafter.       The 2019 GAO report expressed concern regarding lobbying      disclosure certifications and a lack of controls to follow-up      with grantees to help ensure they are meeting statutory      requirements. As of February 2, 2019, all entities      registering for federal awards in the System for Award      Management (SAM.gov) are required to review the Financial      Assistance Representations and Certifications required by      statutes or regulations in accordance with guidance under      Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. SAM.gov      registration question 8.L. references compliance with the      Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. Under      this question, the registrant must attest as follows:       I have read each of the certifications and representations      presented on this page. By submitting this certification, I,      , am attesting to the accuracy of the certification      and representations contained herein. I understand that I may      be subject to criminal prosecution under Section 1001, Title      18 of the United States Code or civil liability under the      False Claims Act if I misrepresent  by providing      false, fictitious, or fraudulent information to the U.S.      Government.       In addition, OJP plans to send annual reminders to all OJP      vendors with open active awards reminding them of the      disclosure requirements under the Lobbying Disclosure Act      along with instructions on how to submit the disclosures.       Finally, regarding GAO's concerns regarding controls for      conflict of interest and lobbying, OJP has historically      followed Justice Management Division procedures. However, OJP      did not have these procedures reduced to writing, as      acknowledged by GAO. OJP has memorialized the procedures in      writing, which the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney      General has approved. The procedures are in process for      implementation.       It is OJP's intent, as evidenced by the work already      completed and the plan moving forward, to comply with the      2019 GAO report. We hope this information is helpful. Please      do not hesitate to contact this office if we may provide      additional assistance regarding this or any other matter.       Sincerely,                                                  Stephen E. Boyd,     Assistant Attorney General.                                  ____     Hon. William P. Barr,     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,     Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Barr: We are writing to urge your      immediate adoption of a government watchdog agency's      recommendations respecting a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)      grant program that makes resources available for criminal      laboratories across the country to process DNA evidence      collected from crime scenes and criminal offenders. We also      request that you commit to implement specific and measurable      goals for this program, known as the ``DNA Capacity      Enhancement and Backlog Reduction Program'' (CEBR), by the      end of the year.       The Government Accountability Office (GAO) repeatedly has      faulted DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and National      Institute of Justice (NIJ) for neglecting to articulate, in      clear, specific, and measurable terms, program-wide goals for      this formula grants program, originally authorized by      Congress under the Debbie Smith Act. The CEBR program, which      has received roughly $1.5 billion in congressional      appropriations since its inception 15 years ago, has been the      subject of two critical GAO reports, one in 2013 and another      this year.       As stated by GAO in a 2019 report on this subject:       ``[T]he Office of Justice Programs (OJP)--the primary      grant-making arm of the Department of Justice--has not      consistently documented program-wide goals for its DNA      Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction grant program      (CEBR). For instance, OJP has documented different meanings      of ``capacity enhancement.'' Additionally, CEBR performance      measures do not fully reflect selected attributes of      successful performance measures, such as having measurable      targets. These issues hinder OJP's ability to assess program      results.''       This is not a new concern: GAO reported a half dozen years      ago that DOJ was not doing enough to assess the results of      the CEBR program. As stated in a 2013 report by the      Comptroller General: ``NIJ has a process in place to      determine DNA and forensic program funding priorities, but      its decisions regarding these priorities are not clearly      documented.'' GAO noted that NIJ was unable to articulate its      rationale for how funding priorities are determined, and      ``[w]ithout a clearly documented process that demonstrates      the rationale for NIJ's funding priorities, there is limited      transparency regarding how and why the agency is allocating      its funding.'' In 2018, a GAO spokesperson testified before      the Senate Judiciary Committee that we lack the tools      necessary to assess whether the CEBR program is working:       Concerns regarding the process for identifying lobbying-     related conflicts of interest were reported by the      Comptroller General in the 2019 report on the CEBR program.      This 2019 report states that ``OJP has not properly designed      all controls related to selected requirements for conflicts      of interest and lobbying.'' Because DOJ's Office of Inspector      General also identified conflicts of interest with NIJ grant      programs as early as 2009, it is imperative that the Office      of Justice Programs immediately establish all appropriate      controls necessary to eliminate such conflicts, as      recommended by the Government Accountability Office in the      report entitled, `DNA Evidence: DOJ Should Improve      Performance Measurement and Properly Design controls for      Nationwide Grant Program' (GAO-19-216).       We also request that you give your commitment, prior to the      end of this calendar year, to implement three steps, based on      the 2019 and 2013 recommendations of the Comptroller General.      Specifically, we ask that you commit that OJP will:       Define CEBR program-wide goals in clear, specific, and      measurable terms by no later than June 30, 2019.       Consistently document these measurable goals for the CEBR      program and use performance measures that fully reflect the      recommendations made by GAO in its report entitled, `DNA      Evidence: DOJ Should Improve Performance Measurement and      Properly Design controls for Nationwide Grant Program' (GAO-     19-216).       Describe any actions taken, including steps to eliminate      conflicts of interest to improve the CEBR program based on      the 2019 recommendations of the Comptroller General.       We look forward to hearing your response no later than      December 20, 2019. If you have any questions, please contact      Evelyn Fortier of Senator Grassley's staff or Franci Rooney      of Senator Cornyn's staff. Thank you in advance for your      cooperation.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley,       Chairman.     John Cornyn,       U.S. Senator.                          ____________________
