President, I join my Judiciary Committee colleague Senator Hatch and others in introducing a bill to authorize the minting of a commemorative coin in honor of UnitedStates Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, commonly known as ``the Great Chief Justice.''  Marshall's contributions to our country have been noted by members of the executive and judicial branches. President John Quincy Adams described his father's appointment of Marshall to the Supreme Court as ``one of the most important services rendered by [his father] to his country.'' Fellow Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story described Marshall in the following terms: ``Patience, moderation, candor, urbanity, quickness of perception, dignity of deportment, gentleness of manners, genius which commands respect, and learning which justifies confidence.'' Congress' passage of the ``John Marshall Commemorative Coin Act'' in honor of the upcoming 250th anniversary of his birth would be a fitting complement to these, and other, recognitions of ``the Great Chief Justice's'' extraordinary accomplishments.  Marshall presided over the Supreme Court during the formative years of 1801-1835. Before that time, the Supreme Court played a comparatively minor role in our Federal government. Under Marshall's leadership, the Court evolved into a powerful institution and assumed its role as guardian of the Constitution, and as the arbiter of disputes between the Federal government and the States. As one legal scholar commented: ``It is not inconceivable that the Supreme Court would have remained a minor appendage of our government, and our constitutional development taken a distinctly different course, but for the fact that John Marshall occupied the Chief Justice's chair during the first three decades of the nineteenth century.''  Marshall is considered the founding father of American Constitutional law. To name just a few of Marshall's groundbreaking opinions, Marbury v. Madison the first instance in which the Supreme Court pronounced an act of Congress unconstitutional is the leading precedent for the Court's power to judge the constitutionality of legislative and executive acts. In McCulloch v. Maryland, Marshall asserted the right of the Supreme Court to decide questions involving the conflicting powers of the Federal and State governments, affirmed Congress' authority to act in furtherance of its enumerated powers, and established the standard for determining when the exercise of a Federal power limits the otherwise sovereign power of a State. In Cohens v. Virginia, Marshall established the authority of the Federal judiciary to review decisions of the highest State courts. As a final illustration of Marshall's many important judicial opinions, in Gibbons v. Ogden, he set forth Congress' power to regulate commerce among the States and with foreign nations.  Aside from the specific constitutional principles Marshall established while on the Court, he made many other important contributions to American constitutional law. For example, Marshall advocated that judges, as ultimate guardians of the Constitution, should be above politics and that the role of the Nation's courts was to mitigate the effects of factional politics. Moreover, Marshall adopted an approach to constitutional interpretation termed ``fair construction'' which struck a middle ground between an overly restrictive, and an overly broad, reading of the Constitution because he feared that strict construction would ultimately weaken the Constitution and, in due course, the Nation.  In closing, it is difficult to overstate Chief Justice Marshall's contributions to our Nation. Many years ago, when I read Marshall's opinions in my first year of law school, I admired the Chief Justice. Now, having served in Congress and worked within the principles Marshall established, I find him all the more admirable. A commemorative coin in his honor would be a fitting tribute to ``the Great Chief Justice.''  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1531       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Chief Justice John Marshall      Commemorative Coin Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) John Marshall served as the Chief Justice of the      Supreme Court of the United States from 1801 to 1835, the      longest tenure of any Chief Justice in the Nation's history;       (2) Under Marshall's leadership, the Supreme Court      expounded the fundamental principles of constitutional      interpretation, including judicial review, and affirmed      national supremacy, both of which served to secure the newly      founded United States against dissolution; and       (3) John Marshall's service to the nascent United States,      not only as Chief Justice, but also as a soldier in the      Revolutionary War, as a member of the Virginia Congress and      the United States Congress, and as Secretary of State, makes      him one of the most important figures in our Nation's      history.
