I have fought for the bridges and highways.  I have tried my best to get rid of all the enhancements--all of them. But to have an amendment that says to my State of Oklahoma: You still have to spend 10 percent of your surface transportation funds, but you have to spend it on bike trails and turtle bridges, I think that is wrong.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
