Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.  Ms. DeLAURO. Instead of pursuing this unnecessary and misguided bill that would punish the IRS, but honestly makes very little impact on tax avoidance, what we should do is we need to go after those corporations. They game our system at the expense of the American taxpayer of up to almost $11 billion.  Wouldn't every American like to have an opportunity to be able to say that they can send their kid to school, that they don't have to risk homelessness, and that they can provide their kid with an education instead of these corporations taking and ripping off the United States?  Let's get real on the floor of this House of Representatives. Do you want to do the right thing? Do you want to do what is morally responsible? Then, let us end these inverted corporations. Let them pay their fair share of taxes or tell them that it is illegal and that we can prosecute them.
