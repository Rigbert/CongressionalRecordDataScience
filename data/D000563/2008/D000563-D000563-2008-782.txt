Because we said thatwhen it came to the so-called cramdown or modification of mortgages, we would make an exception and the exception would apply to the homes of farmers and their farm property. We said if they go into bankruptcy, they can have the mortgage on their farm home crammed down or modified.  At the time, the banking industry said this is a terrible decision because we are going to have to raise interest rates on farms. You are going to regret this. We did it anyway, and there was no significant increase in interest rates.  I would like to ask, through the Chair, whether the Senator from the great agricultural State of Iowa objects to cramming down mortgages on farm homes under Chapter 12.
