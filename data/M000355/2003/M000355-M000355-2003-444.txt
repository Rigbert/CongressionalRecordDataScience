 President, for the information of all Senators, on Wednesday, following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill. Under a previous order, upon returning to the bill at approximately 10:40 a.m., the Senate will proceed to two back-to-back rollcalls. The first vote will be in relation to Corzine amendment No. 1811 relating to military retirement pay. That vote will be followed by a vote in relation to Reed amendment No. 1834 relating to end strength. The votes in relation to the Corzine and Reed amendments will be the first votes of the day.  As previously announced, the Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. Following the recess, the Senate will resume consideration of the Iraq-Afghanistan supplement appropriations bill. Amendments will be offered and debated throughout the day tomorrow.  Again, I encourage all Senators who have amendments to this vital measure to come over and visit with the managers and dispose of those amendments. Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day and into the evening tomorrow in relation to this bill.                          ____________________
