Chair, federal funding for biomedical research has been stagnant over the past several years, another victim of unwise and shortsighted sequestration and budget cuts that put deficit reduction before investments that can save lives.  With no increase to counter the effects of inflation and increased cost of research, NIH has lost 22 percent of its purchasing power over the last decade. NIH has been forced to cut or deny funding for thousands of promising studies that could hold the key to incredible breakthroughs.  We should do everything we can to bring cures to patients as quickly as possible. Far too many people suffer from rare, serious and deadly diseases, and its outrageous cures could be found except for the lack of funding. It's also important we make sure drugs are safe and actually do what they are intended to do. I have concerns with some of the proposed changes to FDA's approval process designed to speed drugs and devices to market. We need to be certain that the proposed changes will not subject patients to a high level of risk. I expect the Senate will review and fix those provisions when they take up the bill.  HR. 6 does what Congress has been unable to do because the Republican majority refuses to understand a simple fact: Funding biomedical research, just like investing in our roads and bridges, is an investment, not wasteful spending.                          ____________________
