Mr. Speaker, today I would like to salute two outstanding young women who have been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Award by Farthest North Girl Scout Council in Fairbanks, Alaska. They are: Erin Shaw and Rachel Shaw.  They are being honored for earning the highest achievement award in United States Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The award can be earned by young women aged 14 through 17, or in grades 9 through 12.  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the Gold Award program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Girl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.  As members of Farthest North Girl Scout Council, Erin and Rachel Shaw began workingtoward the Girl Scout Gold Award in the late spring of 1998. They completed their project in the areas of leadership and community service by developing their communication skills and then working with the hearing impaired community. They used these skills to reach out to various parts of the community. They used their skills to plan and implement a deaf community carnival for people with hearing impairments and their families, as well as students who were learning sign language. I believe they should receive the public recognition due them for this significant service to their community and their country.                          ____________________
