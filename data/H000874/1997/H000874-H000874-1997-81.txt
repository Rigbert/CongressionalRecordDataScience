Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me say to my friend, the gentleman from Virginia, and to all those who are concerned about this issue, the fact of the matter is, I am on their side and we lost. But I would urge the gentleman to look at the balance of the bill, because in terms of all of the rest of the bill, in terms of IRS, in terms of Customs, in terms of Secret Service, in terms of ATF, in terms of the White House, in terms of all of the other issues that this bill covers, it isa very positive bill for many of the folks that the gentleman and I represent.  I would urge the gentleman that this is really an issue that needs to be addressed in the gentleman's committee. It should not be in our committee, the gentleman is absolutely right. The fact of the matter is the majority believed that this should pass, and we did not have the votes to stop it. I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
