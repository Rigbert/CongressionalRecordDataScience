Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) for yielding me this time and compliment the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill) for bringing forward this resolution, along with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays).  All of us cared very deeply for our beloved colleague, Frank McCloskey. To his wife, Roberta, to his children, family and friends, to the citizens of Indiana, you sent America a beautiful man to serve here in this Congress.  I can remember when Frank first arrived. We were both babies of the 1980s here. The economy was not so good. He being from the Hoosier State, and I from the neighboring Buckeye State, were fighting to try to restore some economic sanity to the country so people could have decent jobs at good wages and we could manage our accounts in a way that would be responsible for future generations. He was a part of that great struggle of the 1980s. I remember how in the 1990s after his trip to the Balkans, he would come up to us on the floor and say we cannot tolerate this genocide. I remember his very straight, erect figure becoming a bit bent as the weight of that affected him. I could see it in his face. The young Congressman who had come here was taking on a cause that was global in proportion. He truly made a difference. Millions and millions of children will grow up in a different and better world because of the life that he lived.  He was beyond reproach in terms of his honor and his devotion to public service. He always had a good word for us. He was such a pleasant gentleman here. He added to the comity. Partisanship was not the main aspect that drove Frank.  When we look up on the wall of Congress, there is a saying by Daniel Webster which talks about performing something in your time and generation worthy to be remembered. Surely, Congressman Frank McCloskey of Indiana fits that level of achievement as a Member of this precious body of the Congress of the United States, and we send deepest condolences to his family. He made a difference.                              {time}  1430
