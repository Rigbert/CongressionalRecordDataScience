Speaker, I rise to commemorate the passing of a Capitol Hill icon, Joseph S. Miller, described by The Oregonian in 1987 as the dean of lobbyists in the nation's capital who specialized in Pacific Northwest issues. Joe was a seminal figure in Northwest politics and became well-known in Washington, D.C. His career spanned over 70years, and he earned a reputation for having great political insight and courage.  Joe was a respected journalist and came from the infamous Class of 1943 at the University of Oregon, which included Les Anderson, Jeff Kitchens, Aaron U. Jones, and Bill Roth, Jr. After serving in the Army in the Aleutian Islands during World War II, he wrote for Northwest newspapers. He covered drama, literature, labor, politics, sports, and music. One weekend, he covered a heavyweight fight, a college football game, and the Seattle Symphony. The next day he ran into the president of the symphony, who said, ``Joe, last night I thought I went to a symphony concert, but when I read your review this morning I knew I'd been to a title fight instead.'' Gradually, politics and labor issues became Joe's focus.  In 1958, Joe moved his wife Rosalie Daggy Miller and their two daughters from Seattle to Washington, D.C., to become the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He helped elect many Democratic senators, including Senators Ed Muskie, Gaylord Nelson, Bill Proxmire, and Frank Church. Later he advised the presidential election of John F. Kennedy. The Washington Post once called him the Democrats' answer to Madison Avenue. Senator Dick Neuberger said of Joe that he ``would never base a campaign on personal malice or an appeal to a hate element. His politics are never bitter.''  Joe had an almost encyclopedic memory for details and always told it like it was. These talents usually served him well as he represented clients such as the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, United Steelworkers of America, American Association of Railroads, Port of Portland, Western Forest Industries Association, and Association of Oregon and California Land Grant Counties.  A life-long Democrat, Joe had great friendships and professional relationships with many Republicans. As he once said, ``We would hash out issues all day long, but when 5 o'clock came, we were all on the same side.'' Joe and his second wife, Erna Wahl Miller, personal secretary to Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson, were valued friends and hosts to many in their home on Capitol Hill until Erna's death in 2004.  In 2008, Joe's memoir, The Wicked Wine of Democracy, was published by the University of Washington Press. The book is a candid look at politics from the 1950s onward. Joe wanted to call his memoir When Politics Was Fun, but the UW Press, publishing the book as a potential political-science text, had other ideas.  For over 40 years, Joe met for lunch every Friday at the Irish Times on Capitol Hill with a drop-in group of old and new friends. He respected ``the wit and wisdom of his Friday lunch gang,'' which represented a wide range of political thought. Joe's ability to listen to other points of view and to find common ground kept his voice relevant and in demand throughout his life.  Joe was a great believer in the ``American Political Way'' and said, ``We have overcome many challenges over two centuries and have always emerged a stronger and more democratic nation as a result.''  Thanks to Joe Miller for his dedication and contributions to the political process. His positive outlook and ability to adapt to changing times, even in his 90s, will be missed.                          ____________________
