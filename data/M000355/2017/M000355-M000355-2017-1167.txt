 President, I know the entire Senate will join me in echoing the sentiments of the President this morning. We are deeply saddened. We are all concerned for those injured. We will keep them in our prayers, and we will continue to send them every wish for a quick and full recovery.  We are grateful for all those who stepped in to help--those practicing on the field, the first responders and, of course, the Capitol police officers on the scene. We are deeply indebted for their service. We again salute their continuing and unfailing bravery on behalf of the Capitol community.  The Congressional Baseball Game is a bipartisan charity event. I know the Senate will embrace that spirit today as we come together in expressing both our concern and our gratitude.                          ____________________
