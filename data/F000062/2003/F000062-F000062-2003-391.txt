 There is no unanimous consent agreement. I withdraw that amendment at this time because it is scheduled for a vote at 7:30 tonight and Members are not yet returned from the codel. Therefore, they would have no advance warning of the amendment. I will do it at another time. Therefore, I withdraw amendment No. 542.
