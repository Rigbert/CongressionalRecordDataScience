Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to remind both of my speakers on that side of the aisle my amendment raises the fund from $10 million to $14 million with a $5 million grant that is $19 million, and I had information from the Department that said that they could operate very well with $19 million.  We expect a decrease of personnel probably of 23 members of the total aid program, and that is all. What we are trying to do here is not this administration is future administration, this administration is on its waning days, but future administration, regardless of parties, will not have the opportunity to use these dollars that are paid in good faith by the sportsmen of America and then misspent.  Even those within the agency today have told me privately, yes, they made a mistake, and they really would suggest that we are doing the correct thing. We will review this. We will have a very simplistic audit system. I have agreed to that. We will work with those people involved and make sure that in the future time, we will be able to see where they have been able to reach those goals.  In closing, may I suggest, I have asked them time and time and time again give me the figures where they need it and how they want to spend it, and the agency itself has been reluctant. In fact, they have stonewalled us. I am trying to get those figures. I am working very hard.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Ryun).
