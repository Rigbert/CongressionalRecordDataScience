President, as I said earlier, I understood that the consent agreement was to give me 45 minutes on the Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment and 15 minutes on the bill. That seems to not have been the agreement entered into by leadership. I ask that I take 10 minutes from the Democratic leader's time and the remaining time from my own 45 minutes of time.  I see the concern by the Senator from Michigan. I will take it from my 45 minutes. I also note that I will not consent to any other time agreements on this bill insofar as the time agreement I understood I had was not entered into. I will take the 45 minutes.  Mr. President, this administration has yet to come clean to the Congress or the American people in connection with the secret legal justifications it has generated and secret practices it has employed in detaining and interrogating hundreds if not thousands of people in the war on terror. Even they cannot dismiss the practices at Guantanamo as the actions of a few ``bad apples.'' With Senate adoption of the anti-torture amendment last year and the recent adoption of the Army Field Manual, I had hoped that 5 years of administration resistance to the rule of law and to the U.S. military abiding by its Geneva obligations might be drawing to a close. Despite the resistance of the Vice President and the administration, the new Army Field Manual appears to outlaw several of what the administration euphemistically calls ``aggressive'' tactics and that much of the world regards as torture and cruel and degrading treatment. Of course, the President in his signing statement undermined enactment of the anti-torture law, and now the administration is seeking still greater license to engage in harsh techniques in connection with the military tribunal legislation before us now.  What is being lost in this debate is any notion of accountability. Where are the facts of what has been done in the name of the United States? Where are the legal justifications and technicalities the administration's lawyers have been seeking to exploit? Senator Levin's amendment, which restores the bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee, would maintain some accountability for this administration's actions and some standards of justice and decency. The Republican leadership's legislation which is before us now strips away all accountability and erodes our most basic national values.  If the administration had answered me when I asked over and over about the Convention Against Torture and about rendition, we could have come to grips with those matters before they degenerated, as they have, into international embarrassment for the United States. As Secretary Colin Powell wrote recently, ``The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.'' It did not need to come to that.  If FBI Director Mueller had been more forthcoming with me at or after the May 2004 hearing in which I asked him about what the FBI had observed at Guantanamo, we could have gotten to a detention and interrogation policybefitting the U.S. years sooner than we have.  If the administration would have responded to my many inquiries over the years regarding the rendition of Maher Arar, I would not have had to send yet another demand for information to the Attorney General this week, and we would not have been embarrassed by the Canadian commission report about his being sent by U.S. authorities to Syria where he was tortured. Mr. Arar is the Canadian citizen who was returning to Canada through New York when he was arrested by American authorities at JFK airport and held for 12 days without access to a Canadian consular official or lawyer. He was then rendered, not to Canada, but to Syria, without the knowledge or approval of Canadian officials, where he was tortured. Last week, a Canadian commission inquiry determined that Mr. Arar had no ties to terrorists, he was arrested on bad intelligence, and his forced confessions in Syria reflected torture, not the truth. Sadly, the administration is still seeking to avoid accountability by hiding behind legal doctrines. The administration continues to thwart every effort to get to the facts, to get to the truth and to be accountable. I am worried that the legislation before us is one more example of that trend.  Unfortunately, Senator Levin's amendment, like the Armed Services Committee's bill, retains the extremely troubling habeas provision. I will be submitting an amendment to strip that provision.  We are rushing through legislation that would have a devastating effect on our security and on our values, and we need to step back and think about what we are doing. The President recently said that ``time is of the essence'' to pass legislation authorizing military commissions. Time was of the essence when this administration took control and did not act on the dire warnings of terrorist action. Time was of the essence in August and early September 2001 when the 9/11 attacks could still have been prevented. This administration ignored warnings of a coming attack and even proposed cutting the anti-terror budget. It focused on Star Wars, not terrorism. Time was of the essence when Osama bin Laden was trapped in Tora Bora.  After 5 years of unilateral actions by this administration that have left us less safe, time is now of the essence to take real steps to keep us safe from terrorism like those in the Real Security Act, S. 3875. Instead, the President and the Republican Senate leadership call for rubberstamping more flawed White House proposals in the run up to another election. I hope that this time the U.S. Senate will act as an independent branch of the government and finally serve as a check on this administration.  We need to pursue the war on terror with strength and intelligence, but also to do so consistent with American values. The President says he wants clarity as to the meaning of the Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes Act. Of course, he did not want clarity when his administration was using its twisted interpretation of the law to authorize torture, cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees and spying on Americans without warrants and keeping those rationales and programs secret from Congress. The administration does not seem to want clarity when it refuses even to tell Congress what its understanding of the law is following the withdrawal of a memo that said the President could authorize and immunize torture. That memo was withdrawn because it could not stand up in the light of day.  It seems that the only clarity this administration wants is a clear green light from Congress to do whatever it wants. That is not clarity; it is immunity. That is what the current legislation would give to the President on interrogation techniques and on military commissions. Justice O'Connor reminded the nation before her retirement that even war is not a ``blank check'' when it comes to the rights of Americans. The Senate should not be a rubberstamp for policies that undercut American values and make Americans around the world less safe.  In reality, we already have clarity. Senior military officers tell us they know what the Geneva Conventions require, and the military trains its personnel according to these standards. We have never had trouble urging other countries around the world to accept and enforce the provisions of the Geneva Conventions. There was enough clarity for that. What the administration appears to want, instead, is to use new legislative language to create loopholes and to narrow our obligations not to engage in cruel, degrading, and inhuman treatment.  In fact, the new legislation muddies the waters. It saddles the War Crimes Act with a definition of cruel or inhuman treatment so oblique that it appears to permit all manner of cruel and extreme interrogation techniques. Senator McCain said this weekend that some techniques like waterboarding and induced hypothermia would be banned by the proposed law. But Senator Frist and the White House disavowed his statements, saying that they preferred not to say what techniques would or would not be allowed. That is hardly clarity; it is deliberate confusion.  Into that breach, this legislation throws the administration's solution to all problems: more Presidential power. It allows the administration to promulgate regulations about what conduct would and would not comport with the Geneva Conventions, though it does not require the President to specify which particular techniques can and cannot be used. This is a formula for still fewer checks and balances and for more abuse, secrecy, and power-grabbing. It is a formula for immunity for past and future abuses by the Executive.  I worked hard, along with many others of both parties, to pass the current version of the War Crimes Act. I think the current law is a good law, and the concerns that have been raised about it could best be addressed with minor adjustments, rather than with sweeping changes.  In 1996, working with the Department of Defense, Congress passed the War Crimes Act to provide criminal penalties for certain war crimes committed by and against Americans. The next year, again with the Pentagon's support, Congress extended the War Crimes Act to violations of the baseline humanitarian protections afforded by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Both measures were supported by a broad bipartisan consensus, and I was proud to sponsor the 1997 amendments.  The legislation was uncontroversial for a good reason. As I explained at the time, the purpose and effect of the War Crimes Act as amended was to provide for the implementation of America's commitment to the basic international standards we subscribed to when we ratified the Geneva Conventions in 1955. Those standards are truly universal: They condemn war criminals whoever and wherever they are.  That is a critically important aspect of the Geneva Conventions and our own War Crimes Act. When we are dealing with fundamental norms that define the commitments of the civilized world, we cannot have one rule for us and one for them, however we define ``us'' and ``them.'' As Justice Jackson said at the Nuremberg tribunals, ``We are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us.''  In that regard, I am disturbed that the legislation before us narrows the scope of the War Crimes Act to exclude certain violations of the Geneva Conventions and, perhaps more disturbingly, to retroactively immunize past violations. Neither the Congress nor the Department of Defense had any problem with the War Crimes Act as it now stands when we were focused on using it to prosecute foreign perpetrators of war crimes. I am concerned that this is yet another example of this administration overreaching, disregarding the law and our international obligations, and seeking to immunize others to break the law. It also could well prevent us from prosecuting rogues who we all agree were out of line, like the soldiers who mistreated prisoners at Abu Ghraib.  The President said on May 5, 2004 about prisoner mistreatment at Abu Ghraib: ``I view those practices as abhorrent.'' He continued: ``But in a democracy, as well, those mistakes will be investigated, and people will be brought to justice.'' The Republican leader of the Senate said on the same day: ``I rise to express my shock andcondemnation of these despicable acts. The persons who carried them must face justice.''  Many of the despicable tactics used in Abu Ghraib the use of dogs, forced nudity, humiliation of various kinds do not appear to be covered by the narrow definitions this legislation would graft into the War Crimes Act; of course, despite the President's calls for clarity, the new provisions are so purposefully ambiguous that we cannot know for sure. If the Abu Ghraib abuses had come to light after the perpetrators left the military, they might not have been able to be brought to justice under the administration's formulation.  The President and the Congress should not be in the business of immunizing people who have broken the law, making us less safe, turning world opinion against us, and undercutting our treaty obligations in ways that encourage others to ignore the protections those treaties provide to Americans. We should be very careful about any changes we make.  If we lower our standards of domestic law to allow outrageous conduct, we can do nothing to stop other countries from doing the same. This change in our law does not prevent other countries from prosecuting our troops and personnel for violations of the Geneva Convention if they choose; it only changes our domestic law. But it could give other countries a green light to change their own law to allow them to treat our personnel in cruel and inhuman ways.  Let me be clear. There is no problem facing us about overzealous use of the War Crimes Act by prosecutors. In fact, as far as I can tell, the Ashcroft Justice Department and the Gonzales Justice Department have yet to file a single charge against anyone for violation of the War Crimes Act. Not only have they never charged American personnel under the act, they have never used it to charge terrorists either.  We can address any concerns about the War Crimes Act with reasonable amendments, as the Warner-Levin bill did, without gutting the Act in a way that undermines our moral authority and makes us less safe. Senator Levin's amendment goes back to the Warner-Levin bill's formulation, and I urge Senators of both parties to support it.  The proposed legislation would also allow the admission into military commission proceedings of evidence obtained through cruel and inhuman treatment. This provision would once again allow this administration to avoid all accountability for its misguided policies which have contributed to the rise of a new generation of terrorists who threaten us. Not only would the military commission legislation before us immunize those who violated international law and stomped on basic American values, but it would allow them then to use the evidence gotten in violation of basic principles of fairness and justice.  Allowing in this evidence would violate our basic standards of fairness without increasing our security. Maher Arar, the Canadian citizen sent by our government to Syria to be tortured, confessed to attending terrorist training camps. A Canadian commission investigating the case found that his confessions had no basis in fact. They merely reflected that he was being tortured, and he told his torturers what they wanted to hear. It is only one of many such documented cases of bad information resulting from torture. We gain nothing from allowing such information. The Armed Services Committee bill, which the Levin amendment restores, would not allow the use of this tainted evidence.  The military commissions legislation departs in other unfortunate ways from the Warner-Levin bill. Early this week, apparently at the White House's request, Republican drafters added a breathtakingly broad definition of ``unlawful enemy combatant'' which includes people--citizens and non-citizens--alike--who have ``purposefully and materially supported hostilities'' against the United States or its allies. It also includes people determined to be ``unlawful enemy combatant'' by any ``competent tribunal'' established by the President or the Secretary of Defense. So the government can select any person, including a U.S. citizen, whom it suspects of supporting hostilities--whatever that means--and begin denying that person the rights and processes guaranteed in our country. The implications are chilling. We should go back to the reasonable definition the Senate Armed Services Committee came up with. That is what the Levin amendment does.  I hope that we will take the opportunity before us to consider and pass bipartisan legislation that will make us safer and help our fight on terrorism, both by giving us the tools we need and by showing the world the values we cherish and defend, the same values that make us a target. We should amend the legislation before us to keep the War Crimes Act strong and to require some accountability from the administration. The Levin amendment does just that, and I urge all senators to vote for it. Let us join together on behalf of real security for Americans.  Mr. President, before we stand here congratulating ourselves too much about all the wonderful things we did in these closed-door meetings and these back-room meetings and the Bush-Cheney statements about what we are allowed to do or not allowed to do in what has become an increasingly rubberstamp Congress--the most rubberstamp Congress I have ever seen in 32 years here--I want to talk about the habeas stripping provisions, what I call un-American provisions, which are regrettably in the bill before us and unfortunately contained in the committee bill, and even included in the amendment before us now. The Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment will eliminate those provisions from the bill pending before the Senate.  It will be interesting to see whether the Bush-Cheney administration will allow Republican Senators to vote for it. Lord knows there have not been many votes made here that have been by independent Senators.  As currently drafted, section 7 of the military commissions bill would wrongfully, and in my view, unconstitutionally eliminate the writ of habeas corpus for anyone detained by this administration on suspicion of being what they call an ``enemy combatant,'' which is a dangerous concept that is being expanded by a vague and ever-expanding definition.  The President could basically say I think you are an enemy combatant, and lock you up, and you can't even contest it.  I think of the hundreds of pages of statements made by Senators on both sides of the aisle when other countries have done something this arbitrary, or this vague, and locked up people inside their borders, and we said how un-American it is. If we pass this, we can no longer call it un-American. We can call it codified American law.  Important as the rules for military commissions are, they will apply to only a few cases. In this war on terror, you may wonder how many people have been brought to justice. We are holding about 500 people in Guantanamo. We are so committed to this war that we have charged a total of 10 people in the nearly 5 years that the President declared his intention to use military commissions. That is two a year. They just announced plans to charge an additional 14 men. At this rate, I will be about 382 years old when they get around to charging all the people they are detaining. But for the vast majority of the almost 500 prisoners at Guantanamo, and the thousands it has detained over the last 5 years, the administration's position remains as stated by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 3 years ago: There is no interest in trying them.  It is not just a question of we have no interest in trying those we have determined to be enemy combatants. If we have dozens and dozens or even hundreds of people who are picked up by mistake or turned over by bounty hunters to get the bounty and not because they might have done something, we are not going to try them either. Sorry, we are just going to lock them up.  Perhaps the single most consequential provision of the so-called military commissions bill can now be found buried nearly 100 pages in to curtail judicial review and any meaningful accountability. This provision would perpetuate the indefinite detention of hundreds of individuals against whom the Government has brought no charges and presented no evidence, without any recourse to justice whatsoever. Maybe some of them are guilty.If they are, try them. But we have to understand that there may be people in there who have no reason to be there and there are no charges and no evidence. This is un-American, it is unconstitutional, and it is contrary to American interests. This is not what a great and wonderful nation should be doing.  Going forward, the bill departs even more radically from our most fundamental values. I am proud to be an American, and I am proud to be a Senator. But mostly I am proud of what has been in the past our American values. Provisions that were profoundly troubling a week ago when the Armed Services Committee marked up the bill have gotten much worse in the course of the closed-door revisions over the past 5 days, including the last round of revisions, which were put in behind closed doors and sent around late yesterday, and that the majority now demands we pass immediately. Five years they sit, doing nothing, and then all of sudden, whoops, the polls look bad this fall for the election: Quick, pass anything, no matter how unconstitutional it might be.  For example, the bill has been amended to eliminate habeas corpus review even for people inside the United States, and even for people who have not been determined to be enemy combatants. Quick, pass it; quick, do it now; quick, pass it out of here so we can rubberstamp it in a signing ceremony before anybody reads the fine print.  We have done this in the past. As a witness said before our committee this week, we did this in the past. We did it with the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. We did it with the internment of Japanese Americans. Now we are about to do it again.  As the bill now stands, it would permit the President to detain indefinitely--even for life--any alien, whether in the United States or abroad, whether a foreign resident or a lawful permanent resident, without any meaningful opportunity for that person to challenge his detention. The administration would not even need to assert, much less prove, that the alien was an enemy combatant; it would suffice to say that the alien was awaiting a determination on that issue, even though they may wait 20, 30, 40 years and wait until the grave gives them their escape.  In other words, the bill would send a message to the millions of legal immigrants living in America, participating in American families, working for American businesses, and paying American taxes. Its message would be that our Government may at any minute pick them up and detain them indefinitely without charge and without any access to the courts or even to military tribunals unless and until the Government determines that they are not enemy combatants--even though they have no ability to help in that determination themselves. In turn, the bill now defines the term enemy combatants in a tortured and unprecedented broad manner.  Detained indefinitely, and unaccountably, until they are proven innocent; even though they have no right to stand up and offer proof. It is like the Canadian citizen Maher Arar, shipped off to a torture cell in Syria by the Bush-Cheney administration, despite what the Canadian Government recently concluded, that there is no evidence that he ever committed a crime or posed a threat to either the United States or Canadian security. Pick him up. He looks bad. Ship him to Syria. Torture him. Maybe he will confess to something and prove we were right.  Now it has been documented the Bush-Cheney administration did the wrong thing to the wrong man. When asked about it, what do they do? As usual, they evade all accountability. This is an administration that makes no mistakes. A rubberstamp Congress will never ask them what they did, they make no mistakes, and they hide behind a purported State secrets privilege.  The administration's defenders would like to believe Mr. Arar's case is an isolated blunder, but it is not. We have numerous press accounts that have quoted administration officials themselves who believe a significant percentage of those detained at Guantanamo Bay have no connection to terrorism. They have been held by the Bush-Cheney administration for several years and the administration intends to hold them indefinitely without trial or any recourse to justice, even though a substantial number of them are innocent people who were turned in by anonymous bounty hunters or picked up by mistake in the fog of war.  The most important purpose of habeas corpus is not to give people extra rights. No one is asking to give people special rights. Habeas corpus does not do that. Habeas corpus is intended to correct errors such as this to protect the innocent. It is precisely to prevent such abuses that the Constitution prohibits the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus ``unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion public safety may require it.''  I would assume the Bush-Cheney administration is not saying we are handling this question of terrorists so poorly that we are under invasion now. And I have no doubt this bill, which will permanently eliminate the writ of habeas corpus for all aliens within and outside the United States whenever the Government says they might be enemy combatants, violates that prohibition. I believe even the present Supreme Court, seven of the nine members now Republican, would hold it unconstitutional.  When former Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote of his concerns with the administration's bill, he wrote: ``The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.''  Talk to anyone who travels around the world anywhere, even among some of our closest allies, our best friends. We are asked, What are you doing? Have you lost your moral compass? And these are countries that faced terrorist attacks long before we did.  General Powell, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was right.  We have heard from current and former diplomats, military lawyers, Federal judges, law professors, law school deans, and even a former Solicitor General under the first President Bush, Kenneth Starr, that they have grave concerns with the habeas corpus stripping provisions of this bill. I have letters that come from across the political and legal spectrum saying this is wrong.  I ask unanimous consent that some of these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               September 25, 2006.     To United States Senators and Members of Congress.       Dear Madams/Sirs: This letter is written in the name of the      former members of the diplomatic service of the United States      listed below.       We urge that the Congress, as it considers the pending      detainee legislation, not eliminate the jurisdiction of the      courts to entertain habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf      of those detainees.       There is no more central principle of democracy than that      an officer of the executive branch of government may restrain      no one except at sufferance of the judiciary. The one branch      is vital to insure the legitimacy of the actions of the      other. Habeas corpus is the ``Great Writ.'' It is by habeas      corpus that a person--any person--can insure that the      legality of his or her restraint is confirmed by a court      independent of the branch responsible for the restraint.      Elimination of judicial review by this route would undermine      the foundations of our democratic system.       Weare told that the central purpose of our engagement in      that ``vast external realm'' today is the promotion of      democracy for others. All nations, we urge, should embrace      the principles and practices of freedom and governance that      we have embraced. But to eliminate habeas corpus in the      United States as an avenue of relief for the citizens of      other countries who have fallen into our hands cannot but      make a mockery of this pretension in the eyes of the rest of      the world. The perception of hypocrisy on our part--a sense      that we demand of others a behavioral ethic we ourselves may      advocate but fail to observe--is an acid which can overwhelm      our diplomacy, no matter how well intended and generous.      Pretensions are one thing; behavior another, and quite the      more powerful message. To proclaim democratic government to      the rest of the world as the supreme form of government at      the very moment we eliminate the most important avenue of      relief from arbitrary governmental detention will not serve      our interests in the larger world.       This is the first and primary reason for rejecting the      proposal. But the second is almost as important, and that is      its potential for a reciprocal effect. Pragmatic      considerations, in short, are in this instance at one with      considerations of principle. Judicial relief from arbitrary      detention should be preserved here else our personnel serving      abroad     will suffer the consequences. To deny habeas corpus to our      detainees can be seen as prescription for how the captured      members of our own military, diplomatic and NGO personnel      stationed abroad may be treated.       As former officials in the diplomatic service of our      nation, this consideration weighs particularly heavily for      us. The United States now has a vast army of young Foreign      Service officers abroad. Many are in acute and immediate      danger. Over a hundred, for example, are serving in      Afghanistan. Foreign service in a high-risk post is      voluntary. These officers are there willingly. The Congress      has every duty to insure their protection, and to avoid      anything which will be taken as justification, even by the      most disturbed minds, that arbitrary arrest is the acceptable      norm of the day in the relations between nations, and that      judicial inquiry is an antique, trivial and dispensable      luxury.       We urge that the proposal to curtail the reach of the Great      Writ be rejected.           Respectfully submitted,         William D. Rogers, former Under Secretary of State;            Ambassador J. Brian Atwood; Ambassador Harry Barnes;            Ambassador Richard E. Benedick; Ambassador A Peter            Burleigh; Ambassador Herman J. Cohen; Ambassador Edwin            G. Corr; Ambassador John Gunther Dean; Ambassador            Theodore L.

Laingen; Anthony            Lake, former National Security Advisor; Ambassador            Princeton N. Lyman; Ambassador Donald McHenry;            Ambassador George Moore.

Pickering; Ambassador Anthony Quainton; Helmut            Sonnenfeldt, former Counselor of the Department of            State; Ambassador Roscoe S. Suddarth; Ambassador            Phillips Talbot; Ambassador William Vanden Heuvel;            Ambassador Alexander F. Watson.                                  ____       To Members of Congress: The undersigned retired federal      judges write to express our deep concern about the lawfulness      of Section 6 of the proposed Military Commissions Act of 2006      (``MCA''). The MCA threatens to strip the federal courts of      jurisdiction to test the lawfulness of Executive detention at      the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station and elsewhere outside the      United States. Section 6 applies ``to all cases, without      exception, pending on or after the date of the enactment of      [the MCA] which relate to any aspect of the detention,      treatment, or trial of an alien detained outside of the      United States . . . since September 11, 2001.''       We applaud Congress for taking action establishing      procedures to try individuals for war crimes and, in      particular, Senator Warner, Senator Graham, and others for      ensuring that those procedures prohibit the use of secret      evidence and evidence gained by coercion. Revoking habeas      corpus, however, creates the perverse incentive of allowing      individuals to be detained indefinitely on that very basis by      stripping the federal courts of their historic inquiry into      the lawfulness of a prisoner's confinement.       More than two years ago, the United States Supreme Court      ruled in Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), that detainees      at Guantanamo have the right to challenge their detention in      federal court by habeas corpus. Last December, Congress      passed the Detainee Treatment Act, eliminating jurisdiction      over future habeas petitions filed by prisoners at      Guantanamo, but expressly preserving existing jurisdiction      over pending cases. In June, the Supreme Court affirmed in      Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S. Ct. 2749 (2006), that the federal      courts have the power to hear those pending cases. These      cases should be heard by the federal courts for the reasons      that follow.       The habeas petitions ask whether there is a sufficient      factual and legal basis for a prisoner's detention. This      inquiry is at once simple and momentous. Simple because it is      an easy matter for judges to make this determination--federal      judges have been doing this every day, in every courtroom in      the country, since this Nation's founding. Momentous because      it safeguards the most hallowed judicial role in our      constitutional democracy--ensuring that no man is imprisoned      unlawfully. Without habeas, federal courts will lose the      power to conduct this inquiry.       We are told this legislation is important to the ineffable      demands of national security, and that permitting the courts      to play their traditional role will somehow undermine the      military's effort in fighting terrorism. But this concern is      simply misplaced. For decades, federal courts have      successfully managed both civil and criminal cases involving      classified and top secret information. Invariably, those      cases were resolved fairly and expeditiously, without      compromising the interests of this country. The habeas      statute and rules provide federal judges ample tools for      controlling and safeguarding the flow of information in      court, and we are confident that Guantanamo detainee cases      can be handled under existing procedures.       Furthermore, depriving the courts of habeas jurisdiction      will jeopardize the Judiciary's ability to ensure that      Executive detentions are not grounded on torture or other      abuse. Senator John McCain and others have rightly insisted      that the proposed military commissions established to try      terror suspects of war crimes must not be permitted to rely      on evidence secured by unlawful coercion. But stripping      district courts of habeas jurisdiction would undermine this      goal by permitting the Executive to detain without trial      based on the same coerced evidence.       Finally, eliminating habeas jurisdiction would raise      serious concerns under the Suspension Clause of the      Constitution. The writ has been suspended only four times in      our Nation's history, and never under circumstances like the      present. Congress cannot suspend the writ at will, even      during wartime, but only in ``Cases of Rebellion or Invasion      [when] the public Safety may require it.'' U.S. Const. art.      I, Sec. 9, cl. 2. Congress would thus be skating on thin      constitutional ice in depriving the federal courts of their      power to hear the cases of Guantanamo detainees. At a      minimum, Section 6 would guarantee that these cases would be      mired in protracted litigation for years to come. If one goal      of the provision is to bring these cases to a speedy      conclusion, we can assure you from our considerable      experience that eliminating habeas would be      counterproductive.       For two hundred years, the federal judiciary has maintained      Chief Justice Marshall's solemn admonition that ours is a      government of laws, and not of men. The proposed legislation      imperils this proud history by abandoning the Great Writ to      the siren call of military necessity. We urge you to remove      the provision stripping habeas jurisdiction from the proposed      Military Commissions Act of 2006 and to reject any      legislation that deprives the federal courts of habeas      jurisdiction over pending Guantanamo detainee cases.           Respectfully,       Judge John J. Gibbons, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third      Circuit (1969-1987), Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals      for the Third Circuit (1987-1990).

Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter: I write to express my concerns about      the limitations on the writ of habeas corpus contained in the      compromise military commissions bill, The Military      Commissions Act of 2006 (S. 3930). Although S. 3930 contains      many laudable improvements to military commission procedure,      section 6 of the bill effectively bars detainees at the U.S.      Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba from applying for habeas      corpus review of their executive detention. I am concerned      that limitation may go too far in limiting habeas corpus      relief, especially in light of the apparent conflict between      the holdings of Rasul v. Bush, 124 S. Ct. 2684 (2004), and      Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950).       Although the Rasul Court limited its holding to statutory      habeas rights, which may be limited by the Congress, the      Supreme Court nevertheless viewed Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as a      territory within the control and jurisdiction of the United      States. Accordingly, the Eisentrager case may no longer be      relied upon with confidence to rule out constitutional habeas      protections for Guantanamo detainees. One of the Eisentrager      factors that limited constitutional habeas rights for aliens      in military custody was whether the detainee was held outside      of the United States. Based on the finding of the Rasul case      that Guantanamo Bay falls within U.S. territorial      jurisdiction, Guantanamo detainees likely have a different      constitutional status than the alien detainees in      Eisentrager, who were held in Landsberg, Germany.       Article 1, section 9, clause 2 of the United States      Constitution provides that ``[t]he Privilege of the Writ of      Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of      Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.'' The      United States is neither in a state of rebellion nor      invasion. Consequently, it would problematic for Congress to      modify the constitutionally protected writ of habeas corpus      under current events.       I encourage the Senate Judiciary Committee to study the      constitutional implications of S. 3930 on the habeas corpus      rights of detainees in United States territory. Although no      one wants the War on Terror to be litigated in the courts,      Congress should act cautiously to strike a balance between      the need to detain enemy combatants during the present      conflict and the need to honor the historic privilege of the      writ of habeas corpus. I thank you for holding a hearing on      this topic and hope that it helps to strike that balance.           Sincerely,                                                 Kenneth W. Starr.
