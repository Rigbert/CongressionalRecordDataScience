 Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, there are at least three good reasons to oppose the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.  First, the Export-Import Bank is an integral part of a failed trade policy. If you like the fact that between 1994 and 2000 the U.S. has lost more than 3 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs in Ohio, in Indiana, in New York State, all over the country, in my small State of Vermont, if you like and want to continue a failed trade policy, vote for the Export-Import Bank.  The second reason to oppose the reauthorization is corporate welfare. This country has a $6 trillion national debt and a growing deficit. We cannot take care of our veterans, we cannot take care of education, we cannot take care of affordable housing. But, yes, we do have hundreds of millions and billions of dollars available to subsidize the largest, most profitable corporations in America, corporations which shut down plants in this country and move to China and Mexico, corporations which pay their CEOs huge salaries while they lay off their employees.  Lastly, I think it is time to tell the CEOs of America they have to get off of the corporate welfare line; they have to produce jobs in America, not in China; they have to protect the taxpayers of this country.  Those are at least some of the reasons to oppose the Export-Import Bank.  Mr. LaFALCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).  (
