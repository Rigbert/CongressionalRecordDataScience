Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to Richard Cherry, a member of the American Legion in my district. Dick is being feted by his comrades and friends at a special Appreciation Dinner to be held on November 14, 1998 at the Adams Township Post No 553 of the American Legion. I will be proud and humbled to participate in this well-deserved recognition.  Dick Cherry currently serves as National Committeeman for the more than 164,000 members of the Ohio American Legion. In his 29 years with the Legion, he has also served as Commander of the Department of Ohio, First Vice and Second Vice Commander of the Department of Ohio, Commander of the Great First District of Ohio, Commander of Lucas County, Commander of the Adams township Post, and Delegate to Lucas County, the First District, Department of Ohio, and National Organization. He also diligently labors on countless committees on the County, District, Department of Ohio, and National levels.  A member of the United States Army, Dick is a veteran of the Korean War who served with the Second Division, 23 Infantry Battalion. With the deepest of understanding of the importance of remembering our nation's veterans, he is an active member of the Toledo Soldiers Memorial Association, and the Lucas County Veterans Service Commission, and the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Association.  Listing his involvement in civic and veteran organizations only gives one a glimpse of the man. Dick Cherry is a man of the greatest compassion and empathy, with a sharp mind and a deep soul. He has been a trusted advisor to me on veterans issues, offering wise counsel regarding health care in our nation's VA medical centers, compensation and pension benefits for veterans and their families, and the ``veterans position'' on national issues. In any forum, he conducts himself with dignity and grace, quietly but effectively conveying the message that we must never forget our veterans, their courage, or the sacrifices they made to bring us the freedom we know today.  If a measure of a man is the esteem in which others hold him, then Dick Cherry is a man beyond measure. I join his wife Carol, his family, friends, and colleagues in paying homage to a most down-to-earth yet most remarkable man.                          ____________________
