  American taxpayers expect Congress to exercise oversight in order to ensure that their hard-earned dollars are not wasted. To conduct more effective oversight, Congress adopted the Inspector General Act in 1978, creating a system of inspectors general. I will probably refer to them as everyone else does, as IGs.  We did this throughout many departments of Government.
