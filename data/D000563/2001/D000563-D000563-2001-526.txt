President, I rise in opposition to the resolution before us related to ergonomics.  First, about the word ``ergonomics.'' It sounds like a course that one intentionally skipped in high school, but it is much more serious. It relates to a worker's injury on the job, a worker's injury that, unfortunately, affects in America every year a million people who take time away from work to treat and recover from these work-related ergonomic injuries.  I come to this debate perhaps in a little different position than some of my colleagues because I come to it with some work experience in my life that has familiarized me with this problem as well as experience as an attorney representing people who have been injured on the job. When I was a college student, I worked in a slaughterhouse in East St. Louis, IL, Hunter Packing Company. It was a great job for a college student because it paid pretty well, but it was a tough job. It was dirty. The hours were long. I went to it every day realizing I was saving enough money to get through school.  In the 12 months that I worked in that slaughterhouse, I came to understand what it means to work on an assembly line. It was a hog production facility. The hogs that were brought forward for slaughter and processing were on a chain. The union I belonged to, the Meat Cutters and Butcher Workers, had negotiated a contract with the packing company. The contract said that 1 hour's work equals 240 hogs. During the course of a day of 8 hours, we were expected to process 1,920 hogs. Of course, if we could speed up the line, we might get off work in 6 hours. Every day we tested ourselves, or someone did, to see how fast we could process those hogs to go home.  The line would break down. We never quite knew what would happen. Day after day I would stand there on this line and watch these animal carcasses come flying by as I did a routine job on every single one of them. I was one of many employees in that facility.  I came to respect a hard day's work, the men and women who got up every day and did this. I also came to respect the danger of that job. Some of the dangers were obvious. On that line one day a man I was standing next to passed out and was taken away; he died of a heart attack. Other people cut themselves with knives. Others suffered back injuries, neck injuries, and injuries to their hands. I would see this every single day. I came to appreciate a little more than some that working for a living in America can be dangerous unless there are people to protect you. In this case the protection came from a labor union doing its best to make the workplace safe.  It also came from Congress and the State legislatures that were responsible for a safe workplace. I came to appreciate that responsibility when I was elected to Congress in 1982 and to realize that I have a burden and a challenge, as a Congressman and a Senator, to make certain that the laws we pass are consistent with maintaining the safety of the workplaces across America.  My second experience, as an attorney in Illinois, was on workers compensation claims. I have listened to some of the statements made on the floor of the Senate today. I have to shake my head. Some of the people who are arguing against this bill have literally never tried a workers compensation case. For instance, there have been arguments made that under this ergonomics rule, it is not necessary that one is injured in the workplace to recover.  Time out. One of the first premises, when you go to a workers compensation case for someone injured on the job, is whether or not you were an employee. That is the first question. The second question is whether or not your injury was work related. If you can't get past those two hurdles, your case is thrown out, period.  Many of the employers on the other side of these worker injury cases tried to argue that the person wasn't an employee or doing an employee function at the time of the injury or, if he had an injury, it happened someplace other than the workplace.  That is not going to be changed by this ergonomics rule. What this rule will do is establish a standard of care for employees across America. A million American employees each year lose time from work to treat or recover from the injuries we are discussing. These injuries account for fully one-third of all workplace injuries that are serious enough to keep workers off the job--more than any other type of injury.  Those who oppose this rule and will vote for this resolution of disapproval are ignoring this reality. They are saying that regardless of the injuries to American workers, we should do nothing about it, nothing. The net result of voting for this resolution of disapproval is to put an end to the debate over whether we will continue to protect workers at America's workplaces.  That is a sad commentary. It is a sad commentary on this Congress--which started off with all sorts of promise, an evenly divided Senate that would work in a bipartisan fashion--that here, in one of its very first actions, it has decided to remove a protection in the workplace for millions of American workers.  The cost of these injuries is enormous. Many companies come by my office and argue that they just can't afford to make the changes necessary to make their workplace safer. We estimate it would cost about $50 billion a year, these employers are currently paying out, for people who are injured in the workplace. There is no money being saved in an injured employee. Not only does it damage or even destroy the life of the worker, you lose the productivity, skill, and experience of that worker, and you pay for attorneys and for doctors and for compensation for that injured employee. It is penny wise and pound foolish for business to ignore the fact that safety in the workplace is profitable, profitable not only for the business but for all the people who work there.  Yet the business interests that have lined up today to defeat this have, frankly, turned their back on that reality. I am not surprised, when I look at what has happened over the last several weeks with the new administration, that this attack on the protection of workers in the workplace is coming to us today for consideration. We have already had a number of decisions made by the new Bush administration which have been clearly against the best interests of working men and women.  On January 31, the Bush administration suspended for at least 6 months the contractor responsibility rule. This was a rule finalized at the end of the Clinton administration and already in effect which required Government contracting officers to take into consideration a company's record of complying with the law--civil rights laws, tax laws, labor laws, employment laws, environmental laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws--before awarding a Federal contract.  I introduced a bill in the 106th Congress that would have done essentially what this rule did. I believe if you break the law with regard to someone's civil rights, if you harm the environment, or if you defraud the Federal Government, you should not be able to compete for Federal contracts.  It is curious to me that one of the first acts of office by President Bush was to literally suspend this law for 6 months. With a stroke of the pen, President Bush has said it is OK to defraud the Federal Government, to pollute our Nation's streams, and then go on and bid for Government contracts, to be considered a good corporate citizen when it comes to awarding contracts that pay tax dollars.  Along with my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Lieberman, I sent a letter to OMB Director Mitch Daniels asking him why the administration took this action. I have not received a response.  This points out the mindset of this administration; that when it comes to businesses that break the law, they are prepared to look the other way. Sadly, this is part of the argument being made today. If a business decides to have an unsafe workplace and employees are in fact injured, it is the belief of some that it is none of the Government's business; that we should somehow absent ourselves from the discussion. I believe otherwise.  Let me tell you about a couple other things that have been done by the Bush administration in the early days. One of them relates to project labor agreements. Project labor agreements are nothing new. They have been around since 1930. They are negotiations at the outset of a Federal, State, or local construction project between contractors, subcontractors, and the unions representing the crafts that are needed on the project. Under a project labor agreement, or PLA, they try to reach an agreement on the terms and conditions of employment for the duration of the project, establishing a framework for labor management cooperation.  These project labor agreements have been around for 70 years. They benefit the Federal Government and the taxpayers because they dramatically lower the cost of construction projects for these taxpayers.  So what did President Bush do about these project labor agreements? He repealed them. Gone. With the stroke of a pen, President Bush eliminated project labor agreements. He even received a letter from a Republican Governor, John Rowland of Connecticut, urging him not to repeal it. Let me quote John Rowland's position on project labor agreements:       Public sector labor agreements have been in use for over      seventy years and have proven to be extremely valuable tools      used by public entities to manage large construction      projects.  President Bush ignored the Governor of Connecticut. He ignored 70 years of precedent. He decided that instead of pushing for labor-management cooperation for the benefit of taxpayers, he would eliminate these project labor agreements.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from Governor Rowland printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Dear President Bush: It is my understanding you are      considering issuing an Executive Order that may impact      project labor agreements on federally financed or assisted      construction projects. Public sector project labor agreements      have been in use for over seventy years and have proven to be      extremely valuable tools used by public entities to manage      large construction projects. The State of Connecticut has      successfully implemented project labor agreements for many      public projects that came in ahead of schedule and under      budget.       Project labor agreements provide many economic benefits to      the government owner. PLAs eliminate any uncertainty with      respect to the supply of and cost of labor for the life of      the project. This can generate significant cost savings and      is especially important at the present time when there are      substantial shortages of skilled construction workers. PLAs      set standardized conditions and predetermined wages for all      crafts on the project. This allows contractors to bid the      work with labor as a constant.       With the greater certainty of estimated costs, cost      overruns and change orders are reduced, keeping final      expenses closer to the estimated cost of the project. Access      to an immediate supply of skilled craft workers results in      the likelihood that jobs will be completed on schedule. In      addition, PLAs are negotiated to reflect the special needs of      a particular project, including specific hiring requirements      for local residents and minority and female employees.       Past experience supports the use of PLAs. Huge federal      projects such as the Grand Coulee Dam in Colorado, the Shasta      Dam in California, the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee,      Cape Canaveral in Florida and the Hanford Nuclear Test Site      in Washington State were all built under project labor      agreements. More recently, the PLA used on the Boston Harbor      Project is credited with helping reduce costs from $6.1B to      $3.4B, with 20 million craft hours worked without time lost      to strikes or lockouts.       I hope you will see the benefit of implementing project      labor agreements in our nation's large construction projects.       Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.           Sincerely,                                                  John G. Rowland,                                                         Governor.
