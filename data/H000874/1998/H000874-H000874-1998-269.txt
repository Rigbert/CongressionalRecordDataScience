Speaker, in recent weeks we have seen a seemingly new conflict begin to emerge in the Balkans with fighting in Kosovo. I say seemingly because it is really a conflict that has been around for quite some time.  As the co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission in the mid-1980s, human rights violations were the first issue regarding the former Yugoslavia with which I and the Commission was confronted. In April 1990, 2 years before Bosnia would enter our foreign policy debates, I and other Members of the commission traveled to Kosovo and witnessed firsthand the repression which was building in Kosovo as the basis for Slobodan Milosevic's rise to power.  During the Croatian and Bosnian conflicts, Kosovo no longer became a leading concern, as the Serbian regime directed its nationalist ambitions toward the north, and the Kosovar Albanians attempted to avoid bloodshed through a highly commendable passive resistance to Serbian rule. Even at that time, the Commission had focused on Kosovo in hearings and briefings as a potential site for spillover of the conflict.  Finally, in the post-Dayton period the Commission has seen that Kosovo remains explosive, as indicated in a Commission visit and report in the summer of 1996. So for me and for other Members, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran), the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Kelly), and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), Kosovo is not new.  Despite the complexities of the Balkans, the simple fact is that the regime of Slobodan Milosevic has fermented hatred between the peoples of the former Yugoslavia as a means to maintain power and ward off democratic development in Serbia itself.  In 1989, Milosevic unilaterally revoked Kosovo's previous autonomy. He made discrimination against ethnic Albanians, who constitute 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, official policy, especially in terms of employment. His police force in Kosovo, which is, in effect, more of an army, has arbitrarily harassed, detained, tortured, and yes, even murdered innocent Albanians on a regular basis.  The front page of the Washington Post shows an Albanian mother and her small child, victims of this Serbian onslaught.                              {time}  1800  On a regular basis, when students protest the lack of a university education, they announce it in advance and make clear their desire is to do so peacefully. The response to the exercise of freedom of assembly and expression? They are beaten.  The recent fighting in central Kosovo can be traced to a few Kosovar Albanians who have formed a Kosovo liberation army and seek to fight repression with terrorism. They are wrong and their actions should be condemned.  That said, and I say it strongly, the presence of these individuals cannot and must not be the pretext to justify further human rights violations by the Milosevic regime. The attacks on several Albanian villages which left dozens dead and many others injured or displaced is absolute and undeniable contravention of the standards for the behavior of governments as stated in the Helsinki Final Act and other documents of the OSCE. They are to be condemned by this country and all freedom-loving peoples.  At a high-level meeting of the contact group yesterday, at which Secretary of State Albright represented the United States, there was agreement to take action, as we must. In particular, I would like to focus on three of them which I, along with the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Smith), raised with the Secretary beforehand.  First, the contact group supports a new OSCE mission led by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the return of the mission to Kosovo, the Sandzak and Vojvodina. Getting an international presence on the ground which can deter human rights violations and report objectively on the situation is absolutely critical.  Frankly, I believe there has not been a sufficient effort to get a mission back on the ground. Milosevic kicked out the mission and opposed its return because of Yugoslavia's suspension of the OSCE, yet he invited the OSCE to come to Serbia during and after elections in 1996 and 1997, when he found it convenient.  Whatever else we do, Mr. Speaker, we must create this international presence on the ground as a first step.  Second, the contact group urged the prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to gather information related to the violence in Kosovo which may fall within its jurisdiction.  Third, the contact group recommended adoption of the mandate for UNPREDEP, the U.N. peacekeeping force in neighboring Macedonia, which has a U.S. contingent.  Mr. Speaker, this House, the Senate and this Nation must speak out for the safety of those in Kosovo.  If Kosovo explodes, its potential for direct spillover into neighboring countries is actually greater than it was for Bosnia, and we must be prepared for that threat.  As far as political and economic sanctions on Belgrade, Russia has indicated opposition at this time. I hope Moscow reconsiders this position. While it calls for sanctions on Latvia resulting from a demonstration in which no injuries were reported, the Russian Government opposed sanctions against a regime which brutally attacked whole villages and caused more than 75 fatalities, including women and children.  Finally, I want to make clear that my opposition to Slobodan Milosevic is not opposition to the Serbian people. They, too, are victims in all of this. They are denied their basic human rights through limits on a free media, rigged elections and harassment by the authorities. Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, we need to focus more squarely not just on ethnic conflict in the Balkans, but on democratization in Serbia. Ultimately, we cannot rely on Slobodan Milosevic to maintain stability in the Balkans, a democratic Serbia is essential to that end, in Bosnia and in Kosovo.  Given our witness to the horrors which took place in Bosnia, we should be aware of the dangers of Kosovo. As Polish foreign minister, and OSCE chairman, Bronislav Gerememek said in February, ``In Kosovo we are witnessing a conflict in preparation * * * it would be inexcusable for the OSCE to remain passive regarding Kosovo.'' I fully agree, and hope my colleagues will support strong action to prevent a new and potentially more dangerous conflict in the Balkans.                          ____________________
