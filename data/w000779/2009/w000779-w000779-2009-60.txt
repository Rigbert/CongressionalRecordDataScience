President, I have unanimous consent requests to make. Before I do that, I wish to say, again, how much I appreciate the Senator from Utah and his involvement and particularly his leadership on health care issues. When you look at the array of important legislation that has clearly improved American health care, Senator Hatch's name is all over that legislation.  Think about landmark legislation for children. It could not have happened without Senator Hatch. He and I have written legislation together. One of the accomplishments of which I am most proud is that we found a bipartisan way to increase coverage for community health centers by lowering their malpractice costs. I think it was an example of the way Senator Hatch approaches that kind of legislation. He brought together advocates of low-income people, trial lawyers, community health centers. Everybody said you could not find common ground among those kinds of organizations, and with Senator Hatch's leadership we were able to do it.  I am going to make a unanimous consent request, but I wish to tell the Senator from Utah I am convinced this year we are going to be able to pass health reform. One of the reasons we are going to be able to do it is because of both the good will and the expertise of the Senator from Utah. I am verymuch looking forward to working with him on that.
