That is why the unanimous consent request I am going to make is the easiest, quickest solution to our problem--a clean, bipartisan appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. But we are not running away from the immigration issue. Because Senator McConnell is now the majority leader and controls the business of the Senate and Speaker Boehner controls the business of the House, they can take up the immigration issue immediately after we have funded this Department.  So what I am going to suggest in my unanimous consent request is that they use their power in the majority to take us to this important debate on immigration after we have given a clean appropriation to the one Federal agency empowered with keeping America safe from terrorism.  Let's not play politics with terrorism. Let's not play politics with the budget of the Department of Homeland Security.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that following the enactment of the text of S. 272, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2015, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader but no later than Monday, March 16, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, as passed by the Senate by a vote of 68 to 32 on June 27, 2013, the text of which is at the desk.
