Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2443, the Coast Guard and MaritimeTransportation Act of 2003. The bill is a result of a bipartisan effort, and it deserves the support of all the Members. I especially again want to thank the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), and the full and subcommittee ranking members, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner), for their help and cooperation in developing this bill.  I want to stress that, again, as the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) has mentioned, it has been a long time since this bill has become a law, and it is time that the other body acts as we pass it today.  I am pleased we are taking the action today to authorize funding for the most important programs of the United States Coast Guard and Federal Maritime Commission.  In addition to authorizing the fiscal year of 2004 FMC budget at the level requested by the administration, this bill authorizes the fiscal year 2004 Coast Guard budget at the level requested by the President, plus an additional $460 million.  Of this amount, $70 million is authorized for the Coast Guard domestic port security activities, $80 million is to equip four C-130J aircraft for Coast Guard missions, and $202 million is for the Coast Guard's Deepwater capital equipment modernization project.  We have also provided $39 million for an armed Coast Guard helicopter squadron, $50 million for Coast Guard foreign port security activities, and $19 million for the alteration of bridges which obstruct navigation.  H.R. 2443 will result in improved operation of the Coast Guard and the Federal Maritime Commission and safer, more efficient maritime transportation.  However, nearly one-third of our exclusive economic zone lies off the shores of Alaska. These waters include the Nation's largest fishery, and sufficient cruise ship and oil tanker traffic. Therefore, I am concerned about the ability of the Coast Guard to carry out its traditional search and rescue, fisheries law enforcement, and vessel inspection missions. There are concerns that some of these missions may be suffering as a result of the new emphasis on homeland security.  I remain optimistic that this legislation will provide the Coast Guard with the resources and legal authorities necessary to get the service back to an acceptable state of mission balance.  Mr. Chairman, all of us recognize the exceptional work performed by the Coast Guard, often under dangerous circumstances.  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill which authorizes sufficient resources for the Coast Guard to carry out its many missions and make necessary improvements of laws governing maritime transportation.  Mr. Chairman, I again speak about the role of the Coast Guard in the great State of Alaska. We have more coastline than all the United States combined and more Coast Guard activities, not only in the fisheries, but again in the oil tanker business, and in the interception of all types of foreign vessels that occur.                              {time}  1545  I can only compliment my Coast Guard contingency in Alaska for the work they do in adverse conditions, flying in weather that you cannot believe, rescuing people, fishermen, and, yes, even some tourists, recovering them with helicopters and with ships themselves. They have done yeoman's duty day after day in very adverse conditions.  I will again stress, as one of the authors of Homeland Security, and I expressed at that time the Coast Guard be put at the top of the list in homeland security and they were, not at the bottom, which they were under the original proposal.  But I am still very concerned. There is a possibility that their mission, which is actually navigation, safety, interdiction of drugs, of doing duties which this Congress made them responsible for, now there is sort of an emphasis on security purposes and that alone. We must protect and make sure that does not occur, that they have their mission. In fact, I will at the appropriate time, not in this legislation but during the coming year, make a proposal that we take Coast Guard out of Homeland Security, put it back where it belongs and make sure it can do the missions that we have charged them with.  Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to understand the importance of this legislation. We will have some amendments offered. We hope to work most of them out before they are offered. We will debate those, and we will finally pass a very good piece of legislation for the United States Coast Guard.
