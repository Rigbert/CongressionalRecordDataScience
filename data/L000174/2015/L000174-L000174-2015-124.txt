President, today I am joining again with Senator Grassley in introducing the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act, legislation that will provide protections to employees who come forward and disclose to law enforcement agencies pricefixing and other criminal antitrust behavior that harms consumers. This bill includes changes that we made in the Judiciary Committee last Congress, which enabled it to pass the Senate unanimously. Senator Grassley and I have long worked together on protecting whistleblowers, and this legislation continues those efforts.  Whistleblowers are often instrumental in alerting the public, Congress, and law enforcement agencies to wrongdoing in a variety of areas. These individuals take risks in stepping forward and deserve to be protected from retaliation. Congress should encourage employees with information about criminal antitrust activity to report this information. The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act does exactly that by offering meaningful protection to those who blow the whistle on illegal behavior such as pricefixing.  This legislation is modeled on whistleblower protections that Senator Grassley and I authored as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The protections are narrowly tailored and do not provide whistleblowers with an economic incentive to bring forth false claims. Last Congress, we made modest changes to the bill in the Judiciary Committee to improve the definition of a covered individual and clarify that protections only apply to employees reporting criminal violations. The protections in this bill build on recommendations from key stakeholders in a 2011 Government Accountability Office report to Congress.  The antitrust laws offer critical protections for consumers that promote free enterprise. By extending whistleblower protections to this area of the law, this bipartisan bill will help to ensure that criminal antitrust violations do not go unreported. This bill passed the Senate unanimously last Congress. I urge the Senate to pass it again.                          ____________________
