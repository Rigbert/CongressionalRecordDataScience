Speaker, after a decade of trying, Calvin United Church of Christ was officially organized. Thus, 2003 marks the 100th anniversary of the congregation, and I am pleased to recognize this milestone in Toledo's Hungarian community's history.  As Toledo's Hungarian neighborhood grew toward the end of the nineteenth century, Reverend Eiek Csutoros of the Cleveland Reformed Church held the first church service for Toledo's Hungarian Protestants in 1893. In 1898, 45 Hungarian Protestants came together to discuss the formation of an Hungarian Reformed Church. Reverend Csutoros, serving as an advisor, recommended they join Reformed Church in the USA. In 1901, the Toledo Hungarian Reformed Church was officially recognized as a member of the Tiffin East Ohio Classis. The church's first leaders were John Nagy, John Jakesy, Julius Simon, Gabriel Bertok, Stephen Molnar, and John Takacs. The church, still at its original site, was purchased for $1,225.00. After a rocky two years and with the installation of pastor Stephen Harsanyi, the present church was constructed and a congregation of 284 founding members was established. Many of the first names are still recognizable in the congregation today, generations later.  The following decades brought growth to the church, with the organization of a Sunday School, Ladies' Aid, Boys Athletic Club, Cherub Choir, and Youth Organization, building expansions including a parsonage, educational building, and hall, and increasing service to the neighborhood. Services were preached in both English and Hungarian, as the congregants' ties to Hungary remained strong even while they established themselves in the United States.  The recorded history of the church notes its difficult beginnings, describing the ten year journey to bring the dream of a dedicated band of believers to fruition, explaining, ``The beginnings were not easy, there were many obstacles in the way. The history of our church reads like a novel; filled with pathos, drama, laughter, on the brink of defeat, then triumphant.'' Those early pioneers never wavered from their goal of worshiping in communion with each other, and they were guided by the words of Luke 1:37 that ``With God, all things are possible.'' Calvin United Church of Christ stands as a monument to the perseverance and faith of its founders and all who have come after them. It tells of the struggle and success of people who achieved though starting with humble means. As our community celebrates the centennial year of Calvin United Church of Christ, we watch the century's story pass in review, but turn to the future with hope and a renewed sense of dedication. Onward!                          ____________________
