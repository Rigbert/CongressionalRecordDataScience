 President, today I commend a distinguished public servant, the commander of Delaware Civil Air Patrol, COL Russell M. Opland.  Civil Air Patrol, CAP, is the official auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, and is comprised entirely of civilian volunteers. It was formed on the shores of Delaware and New Jersey in 1941 to patrol coastal waters for enemy submarines. The wing commander is the senior corporate officer within a CAP Wing and is responsible to the Civil Air Patrol Corporation and to the regional commander for ensuring that corporate objectives, policies, and operational directives are executed within the Wing.  CAP has three missions: cadet programs, emergency services, and aerospace education. The cadet program provides youth, ages 12-21, the opportunity to serve their communities and develop into responsible citizens, inspiring them to become the next generation of pilots, engineers, mechanics, and aviation enthusiasts. As part of the emergency services mission, CAP performs 95 percent of inland aerial search and rescue missions in the continental U.S. CAP volunteers also perform homeland security, disaster relief, and counterdrug missions at the request of Federal, State, and local agencies.  Colonel Opland has led the Delaware Wing of the CAP since August 2003 and will step down on September 8, 2007. He has volunteered an average of 38 hours a week to the people of Delaware and the CAP cadets while still keeping his full time job as chief privacy and information security officer for the University of Pennsylvania Health System.  During his tenure as commander, Colonel Opland earned significant awards and honors including the following: four Exceptional Service Awards, three Meritorious Service Awards, the Gill Robb Wilson Award, No. 2074, Delaware Wing Senior Member of the Year, the Air Force Association, AFA, Award for Outstanding CAP Achievements, ``Outstanding'' rating as Commander, 2005 Wing Compliance Inspection, and ``Outstanding'' rating as Incident Commander, 2003 Evaluated SAR/DR exercise.  In addition to his personal awards, Colonel Opland led the Delaware Wing to national recognition. Despite the Wing's small size, Colonel Opland's attention to operational detail and discipline allowed the Delaware Wing to log the most flying hours of any CAP wing in the nation, resulting in the wing receiving three new aircraft. For each of the past four years, Delaware cadets participating in national drill team and/or color guard competitions placed third or higher.  I commend Colonel Opland for his dedication to aerospace education, to helping build young enthusiasts who believe in volunteering, and to the vital aerial missions that help keep Delaware and the Nation more secure. It is the tireless work of citizens like him that make this Nation great.                          ____________________
