If it would benefit American consumers to be able to purchase their drugs, the exact same drugs manufactured mostly in America, in Puerto Rico for the most part, in Canada seems trade law does not allow that. But if an American firm wants to export jobs, export capital, if an American firm wants to blackmail their suppliers into moving to Mexico to get cheaper labor, now that is okay. It is kind of an odd world.  I mean when are the American consumers and workers going to truly come out ahead on trade, or is it all just about corporate profits and driving down wages in this country? I have got to believe that that maybe is more of the agenda.  I just, as my colleagues know, have been watching for years our trade balance, and we are headed toward a record trade deficit this year. The funny thing is that the Commerce Department loves to talk about trade and how much trade benefits American people, and they say: Hey, every billion dollars of trade is worth 20,000 jobs. But if you are running a $200 billion trade deficit and you apply the ruler of our own Commerce Department, that means we have just lost a lot of jobs.
