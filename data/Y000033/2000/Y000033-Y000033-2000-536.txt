Mr. Speaker, today I would like to congratulate and honor a young Alaska student from my district who has achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in her community. Rebecca Dickison of Anchorage, Alaska has just been named one of my state's top honorees in The 2000 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the most impressive student volunteers in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  Ms. Dickison is being recognized for her hard work and dedication in collecting new and used books and organizing a reading corner for children at the Intermission Crisis Nursery. She has volunteered her time to bring happiness and joy to those in need.  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contribution this young citizen has made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Ms. Dickison are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.  The program that brought this young role model to our attention, The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, was created by The Prudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to inspire other young people to follow their example. In only five years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, with nearly 75,000 youngsters participating since its inception.  Ms. Dickison should be extremely proud to have been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. I heartily applaud Ms. Dickison for her initiative in seeking to make her community a better place to live, and for the positive impact she has had on the lives of others. She has demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and deserves our sincere admiration and respect. Her actions show that young Americans can, and do, play important roles in our communities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.                          ____________________
