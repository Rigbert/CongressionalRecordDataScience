President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be authorized to hold a hearing during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, July 31, 2007, at 2:30 p.m., in room 253 of the Russell Senate Office Building.  The purpose of this hearing is to examine three major consumer protection and fraud prevention issues under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission: 1. The effectiveness of the national Do-Not-Call registry and current legislative proposals to improve the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act of 2003; 2. The effectiveness of CROA and possible legislative initiatives to clarify the language of the act; and 3. Telemarketing fraud, particularly against older Americans.
