President, we are in a great position that we are not very often in. We have someone who is enthusiastically supported by Republicans, by Democrats, and he is obviously the right person. He has the trust of our President, he has the trust of our military, and he has the trust of Congress and the country to keep our Nation safe.  Dr. Mark Esper is the right man for the job. He is a great choice to lead the Pentagon, and I am proud to support him. And I am not the only one. In fact, I would like to take a moment to share some of the bipartisan support we have for Dr. Esper from the defense experts, former officials, and my own colleagues.  Senator Kaine from Virginia said this at Dr. Esper's confirmation hearing:       He is a person of sound character and moral courage. He's      been proactive and transparent . . . trademarks of      exceptional leadership.  Secretary Mattis--you remember him--when Dr. Esper was being sworn in as the Secretary of the Army, then-Secretary of Defense Mattis said:       The bottom line is the virtuous and vile alike have written      history, but let's remember here today that we're the good      guys . . . and this is the man who can take us forward.  Mark Jacobson, a senior adviser to Ash Carter, said:       This is someone who can work across the aisle. This is      somebody who can work with Congress. And that's really what      defines him. A soldier, a scholar.  The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said:       Anybody impartial would have to have come away impressed by      Dr. Esper's mastery, intelligence, and thoroughness.  My colleagues in the Armed Services Committee also widely support Dr. Esper's nomination, advancing his nomination with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.  Across the Capitol, both the chairman and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee support Dr. Esper. They all support him. Chairman Adam Smith said that Dr. Esper is ``capable of executing the National Defense Strategy in a way that is insulated from outside influence and political considerations. . . . The Department would benefit from his leadership.'' That is my counterpart over in the House.  Ranking Member Mac Thornberry said he has ``done an outstanding job as Secretary of the Army.'' I agree with Congressman Thornberry.  Under Dr. Esper's leadership, we saw Army modernization leap forward by leaps and bounds. He managed the largest reorganization of the Army in 45 years, prioritizing research, development, and innovation. He showed accountability to the taxpayers by being responsible with his budget, making tough decisions, tough choices, streamlining legacy programs, and directing defense dollars to critical future needs.  It is impressive, but being a good Army Secretary isn't enough on its own. Secretary Mattis reminded us that civilian leaders in our military must be more than their past accomplishments. Mark Esper is more because he truly respects and honors his commitment to the men and women in uniform. I have seen this firsthand.  Back in April, I asked Dr. Esper to join me on a visit to Fort Sill in my State of Oklahoma. What impressed me was how well he communicated with the troops in the field. He is one of the troops out there, and you could see the love that he had for them. In Fort Sill, he even joined them--and I was there--for an Army combat fitness test workout. He participated with the troops. He ate the MREs out in the field. Anyone who has been in the Army can tellyou that you don't often find people who choose to do that, but Mark Esper did.  Dr. Esper deeply cares about the troops, whether it is making sure that they have the weapons, equipment, and training they need to succeed in their missions or simply that they have quality housing when they are on base.  We moved quickly to consider Dr. Esper's nomination here on the floor, but that isn't because we didn't fulfill our duty of advice and consent. We did. Dr. Esper testified for over 3 hours. Between his hearing and his followup questions for the record, he answered approximately 600 questions. It is clear that Dr. Esper has what it takes to lead the Department of Defense and that most of my colleagues think so as well.  He has served the Nation with honor and integrity, and I am certain that he is going to continue to do so when he is confirmed.  I strongly request a strong vote to confirm Dr. Mark Esper to be our next Secretary of Defense.  With that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
