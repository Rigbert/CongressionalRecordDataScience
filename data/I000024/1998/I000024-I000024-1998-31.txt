President, I rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional leader in recognition of a remarkable career of service to his country--Lieutenant General Richard A. Burpee, United States Air Force, retired. Dick Burpee has amassed a truly distinguished record, including 35 years of service in the Air Force uniform, that merits special recognition on the occasion of his retirement as chairman of the board of directors of the Retired Officers Association.  Born and raised in Delton, Michigan, he is now a distinguished citizen of the great State of Oklahoma. He enlisted in the Air Force just after the Korean War in 1953. Subsequently selected for pilot training, he earned his aviator's wings and Second Lieutenant's commission in 1955.  Over the next decade, Dick served in a variety of flying and staff positions, including assignments as an instructor pilot and as an exchange pilot with the Royal Canadian Armed Forces. In the process, he successfully completed studies leading to the award of a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in public administration.  During a 1967-68 tour of duty with the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing in Vietnam, he distinguished himself with a record of 336 combat missions in the F-4 fighter and the award of the Silver Star, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, a Bronze Star and fifteen air medals.  Air Force leaders recognized the talent and potential of this general-to-be and selected him for prestigious positions at Air Force headquarters in Washington, DC, first in the Office of the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation and subsequently as an aide to the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.  Following completion of the National War College and selection for promotion to the grade of Colonel, he returned to operational flying duty in a series of leadership positions, ultimately serving as Commander of the Strategic Air Command's (SAC) 509th Bombardment Wing in 1974-1975.  Exceeding even the Strategic Air Command's high standards of leadership excellence, Dick Burpee was hardly getting started. Following selection to General officer rank, he carved a path of performance and achievement through assignments at Headquarters Strategic Air Command, as Commander of the 19th air division, and in senior plans and operations positions at Air Force headquarters in the Pentagon. From 1983 to 1985, the great State of Oklahoma had the good fortune to get to know Dick Burpee as a particularly outstanding Commanderof the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center.  Oklahomans were not alone in recognizing his talents, as he was subsequently promoted to three-star rank and assigned as Director for Operations for the Pentagon's Joint Staff--the highest ranking operations staff officer of our country's Armed Forces.  Finally, in 1988, he was appointed to command the Strategic Air Command's prestigious 15th Air Force, a position he held until his retirement from active military service in 1990.  In addition to the impressive combat record I have already mentioned, I would note that General Burpee's military files reflect an outstanding total of 11,000 flying hours as well as the award of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, two Distinguished Service Medals, and the Legion of Merit. A true warrior and leader, indeed.  Dick Burpee, however, is not a person who considers even 35 years of arduous service a full working career. Following his retirement, he started a successful consulting business in management and marketing with aerospace industries and government. Since relocating to Oklahoma City in 1991, he has served as vice president for development and vice president of administration at the University of Central Oklahoma, sits on the board of directors of the United Bank in Oklahoma City, and has been deeply involved with the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. Elected to the board of directors of the Retired Officers Association (TROA) in 1992, he was unanimously selected as TROA's chairman of the board in 1996, a position from which he is now retiring.  Through his stewardship, the Retired Officers Association continues to play a vital role as a staunch advocate of legislative initiatives to maintain readiness and improve the quality of life for all members of the uniformed service community--active, reserve and retired, plus their families and survivors.  I won't describe all of his accomplishments, but will briefly touch on some highlights to illustrate his involvement and concern for military people. As chairman, he has championed the fight for health care equity for retirees of the uniformed services, whose access to the military health care system has been severely curtailed by base closures, downsizing, and shrinking military medical budgets. His persistent and well-reasoned proposals have translated into successful legislative initiatives aimed at expanding Medicare-eligible retirees' access to military facilities and allowing them to enroll in the federal employees health benefits program. He also has been one of the most vocal advocates for ending the practice of capping annual pay raises for active and reserve personnel below those enjoyed by the average American. Happily, those efforts are now bearing fruit in the form of full-comparability raises for the troops in 1999 and, hopefully, from 2000 on.  Taken together, these comprise two of the most important institutional inducements to help reverse declining career retention statistics in all services.  In forcefully articulating the urgency of honoring long-standing health care and retirement commitments to those who have already served and by championing improved quality-of-life initiatives for those now serving, Dick Burpee has significantly raised Congress' sensitivity to these important retention and readiness issues.  Perhaps most importantly, Dick Burpee has distinguished himself and TROA from other, often strident, critics by consistently offering cogent, well-researched plans that outline workable legislative solutions to these complex problems.  My closing observation, with which I am sure you will all agree, is that General Dick Burpee has been, in every sense of the word, a leader in the military, TROA and the entire retired community. Our very best wishes go with him for long life, well-earned happiness, and continued success in service to his Nation and the uniformed servicemembers whom he has so admirably led.  As a former soldier myself, who entered military service at about the same time he did, I offer General Burpee a grateful and heartfelt salute.                          ____________________
