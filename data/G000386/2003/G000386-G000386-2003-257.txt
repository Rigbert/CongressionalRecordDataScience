 President, first, from a parliamentary point of view, this amendment, if adopted, would subject the entire bill to a budget point of order. We have enough people in this body who maybe do not want a prescription drug bill that could take down the whole bill.  The other reason is, all the concerns the Senator has mentioned we have taken into account within the $400 billion capability of our legislation. We have before us this $400 billion to provide prescription drug benefits to our seniors. We have used that $400 billion to help low-income seniors with prescription drug costs if they have cancer, diabetes, or anything else for which they need drugs.  We have used the $400 billion to limit the catastrophic costs of prescription drugs to all seniors. We do not create two drug classes for the sick and the ill, and that is why we should move forward with this amendment so it does not bring down the whole bill on a potential budget point of order.  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
