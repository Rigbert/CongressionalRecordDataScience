 President, I rise today to honor a good friend and fellow Kentuckian, Seldon Short, who with his wife Janet has worked for the Kentucky Mountain Holiness Association for the past 49 years and in radio for the past 55.  Mr. Short began his career in broadcasting in 1951 at WMTC-AM, a small radio station in Vancleve, KY. Throughout his time in radio Mr. Short ran the gauntlet of progress, keeping up with the technological changes of the last half century from 78-rpm vinyl records to cassette tapes to satellite delivery, while also expanding his own radio station. After Mr. Short became general manager in 1978, his small AM station grew from 1000 watts to 5000 watts, and in 1991 switched over to the FM dial.  Upon his retirement from WMTC-FM this October, Mr. Short was awarded the J.T. Whitlock Life Member Award from the Kentucky Broadcasters Association for his commitment and dedication to the field of broadcasting.  On October 12, 2006, The Breathitt County Voice published an article highlighting Mr. Short's contributions to his community. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record and that the entire Senate join me in paying respect to this beloved Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From The Breathitt County Voice, Oct. 12, 2006]    ``A Blessing to Breathitt County''--Seldon & Janet Short Retire                            (By Jeff Noble)       All around the room Seldon Short could see friends. Dozens      of them came out on a Friday night to say ``thank you'' to      him and his wife Janet. Even after he suffered crippling      injuries in a horrible car crash a few years back, he smiles.      Even after Janet suffered debilitating illness from an      operation some time ago, she remains upbeat.       And they're not bitter. Because of their resiliency, Seldon      and Janet Short's faith and love of people keeps them above      the rollercoaster that is life. ``It does our hearts good to      see all these people we've served,'' Seldon said during a      retirement party for him and his wife inside the dining hall      of Mt. Carmel High School. ``You look around and it's amazing      how wonderful life really is. Janet and I will be married 50      years next June. We've been blessed with four children and      six grandchildren. And we have a lifetime of memories. God's      been good to us, and because of that, we keep going.''       Janet gently squeezed her husband's hand as she spoke of      the outpouring of love their friends provided at the party.      ``It's so nice to see all these people. People I've worked      with, people who helped babysit for my children when I was on      the radio, people who we love and cherish. I'm just thankful      the Lord has seen us through during this time, and sometimes,      it was rough.'' Then she looked admiringly at Seldon and      spoke softly with a smile. ``Seldon, he's a great guy. I      don't know what I'd do without him. He's wonderful. I can't      brag on him enough.''       Neither could some in the room, like his old friend Robert      Cundiff. ``Seldon loves people. But he is also a shy      person,'' getting a laugh out of the crowd as he spoke. He      then told a story about his old buddy, who, like Cundiff,      graduated from Mt. Carmel and the former Kentucky Mountain      Bible Institute (now Kentucky Mountain Bible College). ``For      instance, in the cafeteria, Seldon was so shy, he wouldn't      even say `Pass the biscuits.' Can you imagine Seldon doing      that?'' It was a remark that brought the house down. Cundiff      then thanked Seldon for being the ``founding father of the      Mt. Carmel Former Students Association--our alumni      association. Thank you, my old friend.''       Not to be outdone, several of Janet's friends and co-     workers came to bring yellow roses to her, and to spin some      stories about Mrs. Short and her work she and her husband did      at WMTC Radio. ``While I played piano, I remember Janet      reading poems over the radio station,'' said Donna Woodring.      ``Sometimes they would be quite inspiring, sometimes they      would be whimsical. She was always delightful.'' Carlene      Light recalled another moment. ``Janet loved to cook, and she      loved to watch you eat. That's why I'm overweight.'' After      getting laughs from the audience, Carlene went on to say,      ``What's so great about this couple is that Seldon and Janet      are focused on people.'' It was a statement echoed by Faith      Amspaugh. ``In fact, my children, who are all grown, still      call them Uncle Seldon and Aunt Janet.''       For many years, Seldon and Janet wore many hats working for      the Kentucky Mountain Holiness Association. He was with KMHA      for 49 years, while Janet worked for 40 years. Of that time,      Seldon served as Vice-President of KMHA, as well as positions      on the Jackson Kiwanis Club, the Jackson Independent School      board, the pastor of two churches (Wolverine for 23 years and      Bach Memorial for 18 years), and as a board member of the      Kentucky Broadcasters Association (KBA). From his humble      beginnings as a part-time announcer in 1951, Seldon returned      to WMTC full-time in 1954-55. After going to Asbury College,      he came back for good to the radio station in 1958.       He and Janet had a heart for radio, and remained with the      station for many years. Seldon became General Manager of WMTC      in 1978, saw the station's signal on 730 AM go from 1,000      watts to 5,000 watts, and was at the creation of WMTC-FM, as      it went on the air at 99.9 in 1991. ``I did a lot of live      programs back then. There was no tape as we know it today.      Recorded shows were on big, heavy 78 RPM vinyl discs. Then we      got old-fashioned recorders that weren't plastic, but      paperback. Then we went to reel-to-reel tape recorders,      cassette recorders, CD's and satellite delivery. Today is all      computerized.'' Then Short pointed his finger up at the sky      and said, ``What hasn't changed is the commitment to serving      people. I still think trying to be of service to the area you      cover is still the most important thing you can do as a      broadcaster. You still need to respond to their wants, their      needs, their requests and their hunger for information.''       That same hunger for service came to his successor,      Jennifer Cox. ``The Shorts welcomed me to WMTC. I had never      worked at a family environment. And I learned from a reliable      source.'' Cox, who succeeded Seldon as General Manager in      June of this year, got misty-eyed when she spoke of him. ``He      did live radio and has gone through the computer age.      Everything I know he taught me. Because of Seldon and his      vision, we at WMTC are where we are today. I thank him for      his leadership and kindness.'' At that point, Cox presented      Seldon with the J. T. Whitlock Life Member Award from the      Kentucky Broadcasters Association. ``J. T. was a great friend      of mine,'' Seldon said of the late, long-time Executive      Secretary-Treasurer of the KBA. ``He was a great friend of      the small broadcaster, like us, and he had a great heart for      people, and serving those people who listened to him.''       As some 50 of their friends munched on cake and      refreshments in the dining hall, the Shorts listened as the      current President of KMHA reminded the crowd that despite      their adversities, Seldon and Janet were not bitter about      their experiences. ``Both of them are not quitters,'' said      Dr. Philip Speas. ``The Shorts are made out of good stuff.      They're made of good metal. They've been a real illustration      of patience. They are a blessing to Breathitt County.''       Toward the end of the reception, Seldon got up out of his      wheelchair and looked at the room again. His friends, like      Rev. and Mrs. Wilfred Fisher, and his children and      grandchildren, were all standing and applauding. The cheering      died down. His wife was in tears. He was too, as he softly      told them, all his friends for life, ``Thank you. God has      really blessed us through these long, wonderful years, and      all of you have graced us with your friendship. Despite our      difficulties, we'd do it all over again. God's grace has been      sufficient. It's been a good life.''                          ____________________[Page S11041]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO SELDON SHORT  Mr. McCONNELL.
