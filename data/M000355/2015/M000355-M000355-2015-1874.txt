 President, today we will have two stacks of votes culminating in passage of S. 1, the Keystone bill. Senators should be expected to stay close to the floor as these will be 10-minute votes. We will have five or six votes at 11 a.m. and four or five votes kicking off at 2:30 p.m.  The Senate will be in session tomorrow morning but no votes are expected. The first vote of next week will be at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.                          ____________________
