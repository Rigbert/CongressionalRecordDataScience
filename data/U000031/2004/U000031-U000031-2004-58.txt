Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Patrick Ryan, a stalwart in education for the folks of southwest Michigan. Over the last 62 years, Pat has dedicated his life to the educating, mentoring, and training of local youth. Whether, as a teacher, counselor, principal, or athletic coach, Pat touched the lives of every student who had the fortune of receiving his wisdom and tutelage.  Over his inspiring career the number of students, colleagues, and parents who benefited from Pat's devotion to education is immense and it would be an extremely difficult task to hear from all these folks. However, over the years a couple of themes have constantly been bountiful when speaking of Pat. For students, he was a leader who constantly taught that everyone has the chance and ability to make a difference--all one needs to do is always give 100 percent to any task, big or small. For his colleagues, he was the standard that all strived to reach. And for parents, he was the teacher who through example, demonstrated respect, kindness, and courtesy to their child.  Pat also shined and inspired in his life outside of the classroom. He and his wife have four children, but somehow over years found the time to take troubled children into their home and provide stability into their lives. He counseled women with troubled pregnancies, served on the Little League Board of Directors, and taught religious education. To list the accomplishments of a man like Pat is not an easy endeavor to undertake, and to be quite honest, not possible without feeling inadequate. He was a teacher who gave his all to the education and inspiration of his students, and was a man who dedicated his life to the betterment of his fellow citizen.  I can think of no better honor than to have a past student say that, ``you were the reason why I chose to become an educator.'' Over the years Pat has received this testimonial time and time again, and I believe this is an exact statement of an amazing teacher and human being.  Mr. Speaker, Pat Ryan is simply ``The Best.''                          ____________________
