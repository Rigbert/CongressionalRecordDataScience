President, I am pleased to be joining my colleagues from Illinois and Minnesota, Senators Obama, Durbin, and Coleman, in introducing the National Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, STEM, Scholarship Database Act of 2007, which is intended to address one of the obstacles that students experience in pursuing undergraduate and postbaccalaureate studies in STEM fields.  There is growing concern that the United States is not preparing a sufficient number of students, teachers, and practitioners in STEM fields. An important aspect of U.S. efforts to maintain and improve economic competitiveness is the existence of a capable scientific and technological workforce.  The change from a labor-based manufacturing to a knowledge-based manufacturing and service economy demands certain skills of our citizenry. The National Science Foundation, NSF, projects that in the increasingly changing context for science and technology, a workforce trained in the sciences and engineering is necessary for continued economic growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4 percent from 2004 to 2014, compared to a growth of 13 percent in all occupations during the same time period. Furthermore, the current scientific and engineering workforce is aging. The NSF reports that the number reaching retirement age will increase dramatically over the next two decades.  A May 2007 report of the Department of Education states that: There is increasing concern about U.S. economic competitiveness, particularly the future ability of the nation's education institutions to produce citizens literate in STEM concepts and to produce future scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and technologists. Such experts are needed to maintain U.S. preeminence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. While other countries around the world strive to improve their own education systems and to expand their economies, the U.S. will have to work even harder in the coming years to maintain its competitive edge.  In addition to these statistics, we have anecdotal evidence from universities across the country and in my home State of Maine. Faculty from the University of Southern Maine and across the State point to decreasing undergraduate enrollments in STEM fields and an even greater decrease in the number of bachelor and master's degrees conferred in these fields. For many students, the obstacle is not a lack of interest but rather a lack of financial resources.  On August 9, 2007, President Bush signed into law Public Law 110-69, The America COMPETES Act, H.R. 2272. The legislation is directed at increasing research investment, improving economic competitiveness, developing an innovation infrastructure, and strengthening and expanding science and mathematics programs at all points on the educational pipeline. The America COMPETES Act authorizes $33.6 billion for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2010 for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology programs across the Federal Government. This Federal effort, while laudable, is essentially unknown to the average student interested in pursuing a degree in a STEM field. Moreover, it does little to help a rising college freshman today enter a degree program in aerospace engineering, veterinary medicine, or computer information systems.  A major challenge facing many high school graduates and their families is how to afford college. Helping students locate financial aid might well increase the number of students entering STEM fields. For many first-generation college students, financial assistance may be available but the student may be unaware of the opportunities. As a result of Federal efforts in this area, there is a large array of financial aid opportunities available in the STEM fields; however, there is no simple way for potential applicants to explore them.  The database created in this bill will have a complete list of STEM scholarships, fellowships, and other programs of financial assistance from all public and private sources for postsecondary and postgraduate study. The American Chemical Society and the National Science Teachers Association believe this measure will expand and strengthen the STEM education pipeline and help keep our nation competitive in the global economy by aiding capable students who are interested in STEM careers in their search for the right scholarship opportunity to support their studies.  With less than 6 percent of the world's population, the United States cannot expect to dominate science and technology in the future as it did during the second half of the last century when we enjoyed a massively disproportionate share of the world's STEM resources. We must invest more in the resources we do have, encourage those resources to produce economically useful innovations, and organize the STEM enterprise by working to make sure that innovations developed here produce prosperity and progress for all.                          ____________________
