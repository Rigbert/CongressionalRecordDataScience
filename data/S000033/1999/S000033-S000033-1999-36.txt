 McKinney).  Ms. McKINNEY. Madam Chairman, have my colleagues ever seen a bully on the playground and they knew it was not right? Well, that is exactly what our own State Department is doing right now to South Africa.  We can tell a lot about a country the way they act when they think no one is watching. The State Department of the world's indispensable Nation has decided that poor Africans dying of preventable and treatable diseases is okay.  In South Africa, thousands of people are dying every week because they cannot afford to treat deadly but preventable and treatable diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and typhoid.  In South Africa, it costs more to get a prescription filled than to go to the doctor's office. Therefore, they can go to the doctor to find out what is wrong, but they cannot treat it; they cannot treat the illness.  Accordingly, South Africa decided to fight back. South Africa went to the free market to buy its prescription drugs rather than to the pharmaceutical cartel and the State Department objects to that. Once again, seems to prefer corporate profits over healthy people.  It looks to me like the State Department is the bully on the playground and they think no one is watching. Well, let them see that the Congress is watching by supporting the Sanders amendment.
