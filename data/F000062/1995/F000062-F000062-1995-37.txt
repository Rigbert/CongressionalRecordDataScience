 President, I want to make clear that this amendment is presented as a substitute.  I am pleased it was read because it makes clear the following: First, that it is the sense of the Senate that Congress should not criminalize a medical procedure.  Second, that nothing in Federal law should be construed to prohibit the States, local governments, local health departments, medical societies, or hospital ethical boards from regulating, restricting, or prohibiting postviability abortions to the extent permitted by the U.S. Constitution.  The U.S. Congress is not the appropriate place to be making decisions about medical procedures, whatever they are. The bill before us would criminalize one procedure, a procedure that does not appear in medical literature, a procedure that is worded vaguely.  All I ask is that the Members of this body read the actual legislation. Many Members who have spoken in favor of the legislation point to the use of scissors, the cutting of tissue, the draining of fluid from the brain. Nowhere does the legislation itself specifically refer to that kind of procedure. In its very vagueness, it affects more than one procedure and it can affect more than postviability abortions.  So, my point is twofold. One, that this body is not the appropriate place to be making medical decisions and that, two, under current Federal law, States can choose to regulate, restrict, or prohibit postviability abortions as 41 do now.  When physicians make a decision to use a particular treatment, they very thoroughly evaluate a number of factors: evidence from scientific literature, the risks and benefits for the patient--for example, possible side effects--future health, quality of life, the efficacy of the treatment--what the outcome will be--the safety of the treatment, the patient's preferences. These are often complicated decisions, representing a systematic strategy developing from multiple decisional building blocks. Medical decisionmaking is not simple and these are not decisions we should or can make.  We should also understand that medical decisionmaking is individualized. Every case is different. Every human body is different. Every patient brings a unique medical history into the doctor's office. Physicians have to evaluate every situation as it presents itself and often at the last minute.  The risks of a particular procedure depend, often, on the patient. For example, a hip replacement that restores function in one patient can be life-threatening to another, for example, to one who has heart disease. Medical science and treatments are constantly evolving. Medicine is becoming increasingly specialized. Technology is advancing. Today's standard of practice can be out of date in 5 years. The human body will always have some degree of mystery, as science stretches to understand how the body works and does not work. Congress cannot keep up with these changes. That is not our job.  Mr. President, physicians go to college for 4 years, to medical school for 4 years, to residency training for 3 to 6 years. In some States, to keep their licenses current, they are required to undergo continuing education annually. They get extensive training. Medical decisionmaking, I believe, is a job for trained physicians.       an example of decisionmaking: medical practice guidelines  For almost 60 years, the medical profession in this country has been developing medical practice guidelines. According to the Institute of Medicine, clinical practice guidelines are ``systematically developed statement to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for a specific clinical circumstances.'' They are guidelines--guidance--not enforceable rules. There are over 24,000 developed by over 75 organizations.  Medical practice guidelines are designed to improve patient outcomes. They help medical practitioners and patients make decisions about prevention, diagnosis and treatment of specific clinical conditions. For example, guidelines have been developed for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, pressure ulcers, and stroke rehabilitation.  Developing practice guidelines is a complicated process. To develop a guideline, panels of experts are convened. They review all available literature, all available evidence of patient outcomes, a review that can take up to 9 months. They are subjected to peer review for scientific validity and pilot testing. Development of one guideline can take from 1\1/2\ to 3\1/2\ years.  The point here is that there is an orderly, scientific, deliberative, professional, and balanced approach for making medical decisions. It is complicated. It is based on the patient's best interest.  Medical decisionmaking is not and should not be a legislative or political process.                             unprecedented  Congress has legislated medical benefits, reimbursement policies, quality standards, training requirements. But Congress has never banned or criminalized a specific medical procedure. This is the first time Congress has tried to outlaw a medical procedure.  My amendment is quite simple. It says, in essence, that Congress should not be making medical decisions and that States can regulate post-viability abortions.  I can go on, but in the interest of time, and giving my cosponsors the opportunity to speak, I want to just say one other thing. I have followed this debate very carefully. I want particularly to commend my friend and colleague, the junior Senator from California. I think she has been quite eloquent in defining what this procedure is, and what this procedure is not, the enormous vagueness of the bill and the human tragedies involved.  Post-viability abortions can be banned by every State and 41 have chosen to do so. This legislation is not necessary. This legislation puts the Congress in the position of deciding medical procedures, and I do not believe we can or should do this. This substitute amendment clearly states what I believe is right.  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.
