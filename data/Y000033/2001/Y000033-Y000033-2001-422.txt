Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it is in violation of section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Committee on Appropriations filed a suballocation of budget totals for fiscal year 2001 on June 19, 2001. That was House Report 107-104. This amendment would strike a rescission and, therefore, provide in effect a new budget authority in excess of the subcommittee suballocation made under section 302(b) and is not permitted under section 302(f) of the act.  And so, Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.
