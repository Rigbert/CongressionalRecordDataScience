President, I want to thank everybody for joining Senator Shelby and I on this vote. It is going to help us move forward, and, as I said in my earlier remarks, Republicans and Democrats came together and worked extraordinarily hard on these appropriations bills, and it shows what can be done when we work together. I think the vote here is an indication of that.  If nobody is seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
