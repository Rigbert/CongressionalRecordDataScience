Quite obviously the Flato family has suffered a very significant loss, has received a judgment which obviously cannot compensate for their loss but is a money judgement as we have in our system which is the best we can do. Clearly the Congress intended for an American citizen, as the gentleman has pointed out, to collect on this judgment.  The only difference I would have with him, while it is a case of justice, quite obviously it is not as simple, and there are different perspectives on the ramifications beyond this case. But I congratulate the gentleman, and I have indicated to him and to others that I will work closely with the chairman to see if this matter can be resolved successfully.
