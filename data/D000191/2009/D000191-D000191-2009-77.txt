The Bush legacy lives on.  George Bush has made a horrible hash out of this economy with his trickle-down economics favoring those at the top, with his deregulatory policies, dismantling those things which protect consumers, people's 401(k)s and their investments from fraud and abuse, and with his unnecessary war.  President Obama sees and realizes the pain across America and wants to take positive steps to put people back to work and get this economy back on course. That is the good news.  The bad news is that I don't believe the President is well-served by a number of his economic advisers. Some of them do not now, nor have they ever believed, that rebuilding the foundations of our economy with investment in infrastructure, putting millions to work, increasing the wealth of the country, making us more efficient and competitive in the international economy, delivering our goods more fuel effectively, getting people out of congestion in their cars and getting them to work more efficiently, they don't think those are good investments. They say that is not what we want. They want tax cuts. They want other spending that is more immediate. We do not need another consumer-driven, borrowed-money--because all this money is borrowed--bubble for this economy. We need to get back to basics. We need to rebuild our foundations.  Unfortunately, this bill dedicates about 6 percent, 6 percent of $825 billion, to our transportation infrastructure. In contrast, the Chinese are spending, over the next 2 years, $600 billion on their transportation infrastructure to make their country more fuel efficient, to make their country more competitive. And we in the United States can only come up with $40 billion for transportation infrastructure?  They say that it can't be spent quickly enough. That is not true. The list of deferred maintenance in projects is long. The known need far exceeds that short-term outlook, just for this year's deficiency in investment. We could spend much more, we could spend it more productively, and we could put millions of Americans back to work.  For every $1 billion we spend on transportation infrastructure, by the most conservative of estimates, you get a six times multiplier effect in the economy and you put 28,000 to 30,000 people to work. For a dollar in tax cuts, you get back, depending on whether or not people spend them or use it to replenish their depleted savings, very, very little stimulative effect.  The Bush tax cuts, $160 billion borrowed last spring, gave us a whole one-quarter of one percent bounce in one quarter for the economy. $160 billion borrowed, an obligation for the next 30 years for our kids and grandkids, and that is what we got? No, we need more substantial investment.  There a lot of talk about ``shovel-ready.'' There is a lot of talk about infrastructure. We need to deliver on those promises, and thus far this legislation that is being proposed falls short.  I don't fault my colleagues here. It is coming from the Senate. It is coming from downtown. But we can do better. We are the people's House, the House of Representatives. We don't need to have $275 billion in tax cuts and we don't need to take those dictates from somewhere else, and particularly the President's advisers when they are wrong.  I know the President's heart is in the right place. I am hoping we can do a better bill.                          ____________________
