President, on my reservation, I don't have a problem with the Senate voting on the three amendments included in Chairman Hatch's request, but there are a number of other important amendments that are not included in that request that colleagues on my side feel very strongly about and want to have the Senate vote on. Because the chairman's request would not allow these important additional amendments to be considered, I must object.
