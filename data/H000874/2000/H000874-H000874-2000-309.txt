Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, all of us were very pleased that the judgment was made to move into the rotunda, and, that in fact, the rotunda was available on January 20, 1985. I think the temperature outside with the windchill was many degrees below zero. It was a very cold period. Very frankly, the health of all of those in attendance, including the President himself, would have been at stake had we remained outside.  More than that, however, the rotunda, of course, is one of our most historical sites, in the middle of the United States Capitol, which is perceived around the world as the center of democracy.  I rise in support of this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
