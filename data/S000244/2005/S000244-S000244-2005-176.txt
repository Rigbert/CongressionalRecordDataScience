 Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan has said that he wants us to recede to the Senate, and that means that the Senate bill goes to the President as passed by that body. That means that there will be no provisions relative to control of methamphetamine. There will be no provisions relating to airline security or port security or mass transit security. The Inspector General's audits that are contained in the conference report will not go to the President, and the minimization procedures to get rid of extraneous material that might come into the presence of the government will also not be in the bill that goes to the President.  Listening to the litany that has come from the gentleman from Michigan and folks on the other side of the aisle, you would think that Halloween is tomorrow, because there is an attempt to scare the American public. The PATRIOT Act had nothing to do with the detention of immigrants, indefinite intentions, invasion of habeas corpus, writs of assistance and warrantless wiretaps. The Brandon Mayfield case which has been cited by others on the other side of the aisle was relating not to the PATRIOT Act but a mistake in fingerprint identification.  If we accept their argument, we ought to abolish the FBI fingerprint lab. That is irresponsible, as are most of their arguments. Vote down the motion to recommit. Keep the good parts in the bill. Pass a good bill, and let's make the American people safer.
