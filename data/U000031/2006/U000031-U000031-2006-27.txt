Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding.  I rise in strong support of this legislation. I would note that it passed without dissent in the Energy and Commerce Committee some time ago. But I also refer back to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, section 986, the one we remember so well. It did call for a report to Congress on U.S.-Israel cooperative energy research and projects, and this bill takes that one step further, and it funds cooperative joint ventures to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy, and alternative energy sources.  We have an energy crunch, a crisis. We should be working together. That is what this bill does. It expands the opportunities for companies and universities and different bodies in both countries to work together to develop new technologies, whether it be solar or other different projects, where consumers, citizens from both countries, will benefit. It is good bipartisan legislation. I would like to think that we can pass it without dissent this afternoon, move it to the Senate.  And, again, it was part of the energy bill that the President signed last year. This is a step in the right direction. It is good policy. That is why the Energy and Commerce Committee passed it out on such a strong bipartisan vote, and I would like to think that we will pass it without further ado this afternoon.
