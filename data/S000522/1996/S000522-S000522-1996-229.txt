Mr. Speaker, I rise to note and commend the President for taking the time during his recent trip to Moscow to meet with, and encourage the work of Alexander Ogorodnikov, a former political prisoner and founder of the Christian Mercy Society. Alexander Ogorodnikov established a private shelter for young homeless from all over Russia who find themselves on the streets of Moscow without a roof over their heads. During the Moscow G-7 Nuclear Security Summit in April, President Clinton visited a number of the residents of the shelter.  Naturally, Mr. Ogorodnikov's work has been very challenging. After 70 years of communism, the institution of private charity has been slow to make a comeback. Resources are scarce; property rights are unclear. Bureaucrats often seem more determined to stifle than assist private initiative. Criminal structures would prefer that idle hands look in the direction of criminal activity for sustenance and livelihood. Nevertheless, Mr. Ogorodnikov has persisted. His efforts have been reported and applauded by the Moscow press, and Mayor Luzkkov's office has been supportive of his work. Some international organizations are providing a measure of assistance.  As Moscow was preparing for the Summit, Mr. Ogorodnikov had invited President Clinton to visit the Christian Mercy Society shelter to observe private charity in action in Russia. This request was forwarded through the Beautiful Hearts charitable organization of Erie, PA, and by many Members of the Congress of both parties. For logistical and security reasons, the President was unable to visit the shelter itself, but Mr. Ogorodnikov and his Beautiful Hearts associates had arranged an exhibit about the shelter at a Moscow hotel where the President had other meetings scheduled. Despite the heavy demands on his schedule, President Clinton graciously visited the exhibit and met with some of the young residents.  Mr. Speaker, the G-7 Nuclear Security Summit was about providing nuclear safety in our uneasy world, about governments cooperating with one another to reduce danger to millions of people. Security can also be a function of mutual understanding and having genuine concern--even across borders--for other human beings, one for another. By visiting the young people of the Christian Mercy Society shelter, President Clinton exhibited that concern on behalf of all of us here in the United States, and I appreciate his kind gesture.                          ____________________
