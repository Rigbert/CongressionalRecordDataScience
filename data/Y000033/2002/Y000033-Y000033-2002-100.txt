Mr. Speaker, I note that one provision of this agreed language, which appears as section 2011 of the conference report, is particularly complicated. And I would hope that the gentleman could draw on his background as the former chairman of our Committee on the Judiciary, as well as his current position as chairman of our Committee on International Relations, to explain to our colleagues the purpose of section 2011.
