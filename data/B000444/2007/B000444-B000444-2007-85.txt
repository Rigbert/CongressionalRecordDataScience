 To fight terrorist organizations whose tactics include blending into our cities and communities and attacking civilian populations engaged in the activities of everyday life, we must have robust and agile intelligence capabilities. Rendition, detaining a terrorist operative in one foreign country and transfering him to the United States or to another foreign country to face justice, has proved to be one effective means of taking terrorists off the streets and collecting valuable intelligence.  Despite its effectiveness, however, the U.S. Government's use of rendition has been controversial. Foreign governments have criticized the practice as ungoverned by law and on the basis of its alleged use to transfer suspects to countries that torture or mistreat them or to secret, extraterritorial prisons.
