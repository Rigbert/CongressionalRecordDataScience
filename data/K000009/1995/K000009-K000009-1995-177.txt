 Mr. Speaker, I would like to know whether if we vote for this, we assure ourselves that until the President certifies that without exception every requested document has been turned over to Congress, all further Mexican bailout funds through the ESF, the Federal Reserve Board or any other fund with which the United States is associated in the pipeline are halted.
