 I thank him very much for that comment because he is absolutely right. The jog up is so small when you compare it with the drop which is so steep and pronounced. So I thank the Senator very much.  It leads me to the conclusion that the situation with Mexico has never been worse. DEA has suspended American agents going into Mexico because, just last month, Mexico forbade United States drug agents from carrying weapons on the Mexican side of the border.  I understand that there may be some agreement again to enable our agents to be armed, and then they will go in again. However, it should be pointed out that death threats against our agents are up.  I would like to ask that all Members, if they would be willing, to simply read the testimony provided by Thomas Constantine, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal Justice Subcommittee, last week. It was played about three times on C-SPAN over the weekend. I heard it. I also read the remarks. And the remarks are really very, very profound.  In this report, Mr. Constantine points out again:       Since 1993, 23 major drug-related assassinations have taken      place in Mexico. Virtually all of these murders remain      unsolved. Many of them have occurred in Tijuana, or have      involved victims from Tijuana in the last year. Twelve law      enforcement officers, or former officials, have been gunned      down in Tijuana, and the vast majority of the 200 murders in      that city are believed to have been drug related.  The Administrator also points out that of the 1,200 firings firings of Government officials for corruption made by President Zedillo, no successful prosecutions of these individuals have ever taken place. So of the 1,200 Government officials fired for corruption, there has not been a single successful prosecution.  The arrest last month of Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo brings, I think, the level of drug-influenced corruption in Mexico into some glaring relief. It is frightening. But, as I have pointed out, it is just the tip of the iceberg.  In September, a federal police commander, Ernesto Ibarra, who had vowed to take down the Tijuana cartel, was murdered, and some of the assailants were his own officers.  That should tell us a great deal about the level of corruption.  The celebrated army raid of a wedding last month of the sister of Amado Carillo-Fuentes, Mexico's most powerful cartel leader, seems to be an elaborate charade. The raid, which was organized by General Gutierrez, who we now know was on the Carillo-Fuentes payroll and the target of the raid, was tipped off in advance and either never did come to the wedding or escaped. Federal police were found to be protecting the drug traffickers at that wedding. The federal police were protecting drug traffickers. I find that just amazing.  As former DEA Administrator Robert Bonner said, ``It would be hard for anyone to say with a straight face that the Mexican Government is taking effective action against the major drug traffickers at this juncture.''  Yet, they were just certified as so doing.  The purpose of section 490 was not to deliver merit badges to nations whose leaders have good intentions. The world is filled with leaders who have good intentions. The act was designed to measure uniformly the actions taken by countries to assist the United States in antidrug efforts.  Colombia was decertified last year and again this year because their efforts were ineffectual.  How Mexico cannot be held to the same standards I have a hard time understanding. To certify Mexico in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary undercuts the certification process.  So I ask all of my colleagues to join the distinguished Senator from Georgia and myself in voting to disapprove the President's decision on certification of Mexico but to allow him, if he sees fit, to enact a national-interest waiver.  Then we should work with the President to devise conditions under which Mexico would be eligible for recertification.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 26, 1997.     The President,     The White House, Washington, DC       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge you to deny      certification that Mexico has taken sufficient actions to      combat international narcotics trafficking when you report to      Congress on the anti-narcotics efforts of major drug      producing and drug-transit countries. We believe a reasonable      examination of the facts leads to no other decision.       Regrettably, we have concluded that there has been      insufficient progress, or no progress, on a wide range of key      elements of an effective counternarcotics program in Mexico.      Some of these failures are due to inability; others are due      to a lack of political will. But all have set back the urgent      effort to end the plague of drugs on our streets.       We want to bring to your attention a number of the most      significant examples of Mexico's inability and unwillingness      to deal with the drug trafficking problem effectively:       Cartels: There has been little or no effective action taken      against the major drug cartels. The two most powerful--the      Juarez Cartel run by Amado Carillo Fuentes, and the Tijuana      Cartel, run by the Arellano Felix brothers--have hardly been      touched by Mexican law enforcement. Those who have been      arrested, such as Hector Palma, are given light sentences and      allowed to continue to conduct business from jail. As DEA      Administrator Thomas Constantine says, ``The Mexicans are now      the single most powerful trafficking groups''--worse than the      Colombian cartels.       Money Laundering: Last year, the Mexican parliament passed      criminal money laundering laws for the first time, but the      new laws are incomplete and have not yet been properly      implemented. These laws do not require banks to report large      and suspicious currency transactions, or threaten the banks      with sanctions if they fail to comply. Promises to enact such      regulations--which prosecutors need to identify money-     launderers--have so far gone unfulfilled. Mexican officials      said that such regulations would be developed by January,      but they were not produced.       Law Enforcement: While there have been increases in the      amounts of heroin and marijuana seized by Mexican      authorities, cocaine seizures remain low. Although slightly      higher than last year's figures, the 23.6 metric tons seized      in 1996 is barely half of what was seized in 1993. A modest      increase in drug-related arrests brought the total to 11,245      in 1996--less than half of the 1992 figure.       Cooperation with U.S. Law Enforcement: Our own drug      enforcement agents report that the situation on the border      has never been worse. Last month, the Mexican government      forbade U.S. agents to carry weapons on the Mexican side of      the border, putting their lives in grave danger. Recent news      reports indicate that death threats against U.S. narcotics      agents on the border have quadrupled in the past three      months. Some U.S. agents believe that all their cooperative      efforts are undone almost instantly by the corrupt Mexican      agents with whom they work.       Extraditions: Mexico also has made very little progress in      the area of extraditions. In the past year, they have failed      to capture and extradite a single high-ranking member of any      of the major drug cartels. There are 52 outstanding U.S.      extradition requests for drug dealers, and Mexico has failed      to comply with a single one of them. No Mexican national has      ever been extradited to the United States on drug charges. In      the last year, Mexico has fired two directors of its National      Institute to Combat Drugs, one Attorney General, and several      high-ranking officials in the federal police for their      corrupt involvement with the drug lords. We should expect      Mexico to pursue the cartel leaders with the same level of      intensity used to expose and punish corruption by government      officials.       Corruption: Mexico's counternarcotics effort is plagued by      corruption in the government and the national police. Among      the evidence are the eight Mexican prosecutors and law      enforcement officials who have been murdered in Tijuana in      recent months. There has been considerable hope that the      Mexican armed forces would be able to take a more active role      in the counternarcotics effort without the taint of      corruption. But the revelation that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez      Rebollo, Mexico's top counternarcotics official and a 42-year      veteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the      Carillo Fuentes cartel, casts grave doubts upon that hope.       Recent news reports indicate that U.S. law enforcement      officials suspect judges, prosecutors, Transportation      Ministry officials, Naval officers, and Governors of      corruption and actively facilitating the work of drug      traffickers. The National Autonomous University of Mexico      estimates that the drug lords spend $500 million each year to      bribe Mexican officials at all levels, and many consider that      figure to be a gross under-estimation.       Mr. President, we believe that the evidence is overwhelming      and can lead to no decision other than the decertification of      Mexico. It would send a strong signal to Mexico and the world      that the United States will not tolerate lack of cooperation      in the fight against narcotics, even from our close friends      and allies. Accordingly, we urge you to establish a clear set      of benchmarks by which you will judge if and when to      recertify Mexico for counternarcotics cooperation. These      benchmarks must include, but not be limited to: effective      action to dismantle the major drug cartels and arrest their      leaders; full and ongoing implementation of effective money-     laundering legislation; compliance with all outstanding      extradition requests by the United States; increased      interdiction of narcotics and other controlled substances      flowing across the border by land and sea routes; improved      cooperation with U.S. law enforcement officials including      allowing U.S. agents to resume carrying weapons on the      Mexican side of the border; and a comprehensive program to      identify, weed out, and prosecute corrupt officials at all      levels of the Mexican government, police, and military.       You may feel, as many of us do, that U.S. interests in      Mexico, economic and otherwise, are too extensive to risk the      fall-out that would result from decertification. That is why      Congress included a vital national interest waiver provision      in Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act. But other vital      interests are not a valid reason to certify when      certification has not been earned. If you feel that our      interests warrant it, we urge you to use this waiver. But an      honest assessment of Mexico's cooperation on counternarcotics      must fall on the side of decertification.           Sincerely,         Wayne Allard, Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Boxer, John Breaux,            Richard Bryan, Max Cleland, Susan M. Collins, Kent            Conrad, Paul Coverdell, Larry Craig, Alfonse D'Amato,            Pete Domenici, Byron Dorgan, Dick Durbin, Russ            Feingold, Dianne Feinstein, Wendell Ford, Slade Gorton,            Judd Gregg, Chuck Hagel, Jesse Helms, Kay Bailey            Hutchison, Tim Hutchinson, Dirk Kempthorne, Bob Kerrey,            Jon Kyl, Mary Landrieu, Frank Lautenberg, Connie Mack,            Patty Murray, Frank Murkowski, Daniel Patrick Moynihan,            Carol Moseley-Braun, Jack Reed, Harry Reid, Rick            Santorum, Ted Stevens, Robert Torricelli, and Ron            Wyden.                          ____________________
