Mr. Speaker, on March 22 I chaired a hearing at the Helsinki Commission on the achievements, with a special focus on the unfinished business, of the April 10, 1998 Good Friday Agreement. As Members know so well, the signing of the Good Friday Agreement 20 years ago was truly historic, extraordinarily difficult to achieve, a remarkable framework for peace, and the hope for beginning of reconciliation.  In its most important provisions, the agreement launched a series of challenging protocols, by which the leaders of the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland agreed to a better governance, and peaceful resolution of differences. Prisoner releases, new government structures, British demilitarization of the North, the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons and systemic police reform were achieved to varying degrees over the last 20 years. In the 30 years between 1969 and 1998, approximately 3,500 people were killed in political violence, while in the 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement fewer than 100 have lost their lives.  I have personally chaired 16 congressional hearings and markups of legislation on human rights issues in Northern Ireland, most of them with a special focus on police reform and the need to establish a public, independent judicial inquiry into state-sponsored collusion in the murder of human rights attorney Patrick Finucane and others who were gunned down or, in the case of Rosemary Nelson, killed by a bomb. I also offered legislation that was adopted by the House of Representatives that put the House on record condemning violence and promoting peace and justice in Northern Ireland and police reform. And I just recently introduced H. Res. 777 which calls for a recommittal of the United States, the British, and all parties, including the Republic of Ireland, to the peace process.  The most contentious of my amendments over the years, one of which became law, resulted in suspending all U.S. support for and exchanges with the British police force in Northern Ireland, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, or RUC, until standards were met to vet RUC officers who engaged in human rights abuses. Those new standards were set and eventually then-President Bush was able to certify, in accordance with my law, that human rights principles were part of police training going forward, both in the RUC and in its reformed successor, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, or PSNI. With the improvements, the police exchanges were resumed.  That is the good news. But as the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement milestone approaches, serious attention and effort to be paid to achieving the dream. First and foremost, the government in Northern Ireland seems unable to consistently function or even constitute itself. Also, after 20 years, despite many obvious successes and benefits of the Good Friday Agreement, and although no one wants to scrap it, no one would want to return to the killing, the reconciliation to some extent has stalled. One of the reasons is that long-standing cases have not been resolved.  Geraldine Finucane, widow of murdered human rights lawyer Patrick Finucane, submitted testimony for my March 22nd hearing. And she points out, and I quote in part, ``My family has campaigned for a public inquiry into Pat's murder, but the British government has repeatedly failed to establish one. Instead, they have instigated one confined investigation after another, claiming to want to examine the facts or get to the truth, but always in a process conducted away from public view. One cannot but wonder at the pointlessness of conducting investigation after investigation that are doomed to fail, no matter how forceful the conclusions, because they lack the transparency required to attain public confidence.''  As Geraldine points out further in her testimony, ``the 1998 agreement represent a new beginning that would mark a point from which the new future for everyone in Ireland, north and south, could be launched. What was not appreciated or acknowledged, however, was the fact that moving forward also meant dealing with the past.'' And of course, that is something that this Commission and my Subcommittee on Human Rights has tried to do for the last 20-plus years.  I would like to just point out too, testimony that's been provided to us by the Committee on the Administration of Justice, again, a very important quote from them, ``In a highly disturbing development, and notwithstanding the reality that only a small number of legacy cases relate to British soldiers, a recent report of the Commons Defense Select Committee called for the enactment of a statute of limitations covering all troubles related to incidents involving members of the armed forces. This concept effectively means a selective amnesty for crimes committed by British soldiers.'' The Commons Defense Select Committee also suggested that it be extended to the RUC and other security force members. This position is, of course, completely contrary to human rights standards and, if were enacted, would probably be found unlawful by the courts. Nevertheless, the U.K. government has said that it will include the proposed in a forthcoming consultation on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. That is a dangerous backtracking on the part of the British government. Hopefully it will cease and desist in moving in that direction.                          ____________________
