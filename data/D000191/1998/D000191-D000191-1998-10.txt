Dingell) for yielding the time to me.  Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the committee has taken action in the area of consumer telephone slamming. I introduced the first bill on this subject on July 9, 1997, with the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Franks), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays), the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Smith). It was a bipartisan approach to a problem created by a little too much deregulation.  Now a number of people listed on my bill were here and voted for the telecommunications deregulation. I did not. I was one of 16. I foresaw many of these anti-consumer problems coming from totally unfettered deregulation, and I am pleased to see that the committee recognizes that either the industry has to adopt a strict code to stop slamming people for profit, or there will be new rules in place to take the profit out of that activity.  Madam Speaker, I think the committee could have gone a bit further. I know the industry objects strongly to having written authorization. I do not believe that would impede the commerce in this industry and believe it would make even one more step toward fully protecting consumers. So we may find that steps taken are not totally adequate, but this is progress.  Sometimes when huge industries get deregulated, consumers get shafted. They have been shafted now for 2 years by unscrupulous members of the industry who are slamming them for profit. This bill will go a long way toward closing that door on the unscrupulous operators. I congratulate the committee on taking the first steps in this area.
