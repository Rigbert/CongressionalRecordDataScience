Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to say at the outset I want to express my appreciation to the chairman, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], as well as the ranking member, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton], who have cooperated in the reparation of this amendment.  Let me try to describe this amendment in very express and succinct terms. This bill envisions the possibility that NATO will be expanded in the future. The North American Treaty Organization, which has been the bedrock of democracy in Europe since World War II, has been a major factor in American foreign policy.  Many countries which were not members of NATO after World War II were under Communist domination and were thereby precluded from participation. Now that we have seen the elimination of the Soviet Union per se and the emergence of new countries in the region, many of them new democracies, we are envisioning the possibility that NATO in the future will embrace these same democracies.  The bill is express in its terms and suggests that we should consider enlarging NATO to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. I have absolutely no objection to that, and feel they are appropriate candidates to be considered for NATO.  Unfortunately, the bill does not list many other nations which were formerly under Communist domination, and I think immediately, but not exclusively, about the Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine.  What my amendment does is to open the possibility, the potentiality, that other formerly Communist-dominated nations will also be considered for NATO membership.  This a great boost to these countries to know that they, too, are considered potential allies of the United States and all freedom-loving nations.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
